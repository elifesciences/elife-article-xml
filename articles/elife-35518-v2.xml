Both neurons and synapses are surrounded by a network of proteins called the extracellular matrix, which anchors, protects and supports the synapse. The matrix also helps to regulate the dynamic communication across the synapses and consequently neurons.</p><p>Little is known about the proteins of the extracellular matrix, in particular about the ones involved in structural support. This is especially important for the so-called neuromuscular junctions, where neurons stimulate muscle contraction and trigger vigorous movement. Receptor proteins on cell surfaces, such as integrins, can bind to the extracellular matrix proteins to anchor the cells and are important for all cell junctions, including synaptic junctions. But because of their many essential roles during development, it was unclear how integrins modulate the activity of the synapse.</p><p>To investigate this further, Wang et al. studied the neuromuscular junctions of fruit flies. The experiments revealed that both muscle and neurons secrete a large protein called Tenectin, which accumulates into the small space between the neuron and the muscle, the synaptic cleft. This protein can bind to integrin and is necessary to support the neuromuscular junction structurally and functionally.</p><p>Wang et al. discovered that Tenectin works by gathering integrins on the surface of the neuron and the muscle. In the neuron, Tenectin forms complexes with integrin to regulate the release of neurotransmitters. In the muscle, the complexes provide support to the synaptic structures. However, when Tenectin was experimentally removed, it only disrupted the integrins at the neuromuscular junction, without affecting integrins in other regions of the cells, such as the site where the muscle uses integrins to attach to the tendon. Moreover, without Tenectin an important intracellular scaffolding meshwork that lines up and reinforces cell membranes was no longer organized properly at the synapse.</p><p>A next step will be to identify the missing components between Tenectin/integrin complexes on the surface of neurons and the neurotransmitter release machinery inside the cells. The extracellular matrix and its receptors play fundamental roles in the development and function of the nervous system. A better knowledge of the underlying mechanisms will help us to better understand the complex interplay between the synapse and the extracellular matrix.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>extracellular matrix</kwd><kwd>integrin</kwd><kwd>synaptic terminals</kwd><kwd>neuromuscular junction</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000052</institution-id><institution>NIH Office of the Director</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Z01 HD008914</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Qi</given-names></name><name><surname>Han</surname><given-names>Tae Hee</given-names></name><name><surname>Nguyen</surname><given-names>Peter</given-names></name><name><surname>Serpe</surname><given-names>Mihaela</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000052</institution-id><institution>NIH Office of the Director</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Z01 HD008869</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Qi</given-names></name><name><surname>Han</surname><given-names>Tae Hee</given-names></name><name><surname>Nguyen</surname><given-names>Peter</given-names></name><name><surname>Serpe</surname><given-names>Mihaela</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Characterization of Tnc as a selective integrin ligand at the Drosophila NMJ allows for unprecedented insights into our understanding of extracellular matrix/integrin interactions at synaptic locations and reveals novel, distinct presynaptic and postsynaptic integrin functions.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The extracellular matrix (ECM) and its receptors impact every aspect of neuronal development, from axon guidance and migration to formation of dendritic spines and neuromuscular junction synaptic junctions and function. The heavily glycosylated ECM proteins provide anchorage and structural support for cells, regulate the availability of extracellular signals, and mediate intercellular communications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Reichardt and Prokop, 2011</xref>). Transmembrane ECM receptors include integrins, syndecans and the dystrophin-associated glycoprotein complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bökel and Brown, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Häcker et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Waite et al., 2009</xref>). Integrins in particular are differentially expressed and have an extensive repertoire, controlling multiple processes during neural development. In adults, integrins regulate synaptic stability and plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Morini and Becchetti, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">McGeachie et al., 2011</xref>). However, integrin roles in synapse development have been obscured by their essential functions throughout development. How integrins are selectively recruited at synaptic junctions and how they engage in specific functions during synapse development and homeostasis remain unclear.</p><p>One way to confer specificity to ECM/integrin activities is to deploy specialized ECM ligands for the synaptic recruitment and stabilization of selective heterodimeric integrin complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Reichardt and Tomaselli, 1991</xref>). For example, at the vertebrate NMJ, three laminins containing the β2 subunit (laminin 221, 421 and 521, that are heterotrimers of α2/4/5, β2 and γ1 subunits) are deposited into the synaptic cleft and basal lamina by skeletal muscle fibers and promote synaptic differentiation. However, only laminin 421 interacts directly with presynaptic integrins containing the α3 subunit and anchors a complex containing the presynaptic Ca<sub>v</sub>α and cytoskeletal and active zone-associated proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Carlson et al., 2010</xref>). Studies with peptides containing the RGD sequence, recognized by many integrin subtypes, have implicated integrin in the morphological changes and reassembly after induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">McGeachie et al., 2011</xref>]). Several integrin subunits (α3, α5, α8, β1 and β2) with distinct roles in the consolidation of LTP have been identified, but the relevant ligands remain unknown.</p><p><italic>Drosophila</italic> neuromuscular junction (NMJ) is a powerful genetic system to examine the synaptic functions of ECM components and their receptors. In flies, a basal membrane surrounds the synaptic terminals only in late embryos; during development, the boutons ‘sink’ into the striated muscle, away from the basal membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Prokop et al., 1998</xref>). The synaptic cleft relies on ECM to withstand the mechanical tensions produced by the muscle contractions. The ECM proteins, including laminins, tenascins/teneurins (Ten-a and -m) and Mind-the-gap (Mtg), interact with complexes of five integrin subunits (αPS1, αPS2, αPS3, βPS, and βν) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Broadie et al., 2011</xref>). The αPS1, αPS2 and βPS subunits localize to pre- and post-synaptic compartments and have been implicated in NMJ growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Beumer et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Beumer et al., 2002</xref>). The αPS3 and βν are primarily presynaptic and control activity-dependent plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rohrbough et al., 2000</xref>). The only known integrin ligand at the fly NMJ is Laminin A, which is secreted from the muscle and signals through presynaptic αPS3/βν and Focal adhesion kinase 56 (Fak56) to negatively regulate the activity-dependent NMJ growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Tsai et al., 2012</xref>). Teneurins have RGD motifs, but their receptor specificities remain unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mosca et al., 2012</xref>). Mtg secreted from the motor neurons influences postsynaptic βPS accumulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Rushton et al., 2009</xref>), but that may be indirectly due to an essential role for Mtg in the organization of the synaptic cleft and the formation of the postsynaptic fields (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Rohrbough et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Rushton et al., 2012</xref>). The large size of these proteins and the complexity of ECM-integrin interactions made it difficult to recognize relevant ligand-receptor units and genetically dissect their roles in synapse development.</p><p>Here, we report the functional analysis of Tenectin (Tnc), an integrin ligand secreted from both motor neurons and muscles; Tnc accumulates at synaptic terminals and functions in <italic>cis</italic> to differentially engage presynaptic and postsynaptic integrin. We uncovered <italic>tnc,</italic> which encodes a developmentally regulated RGD-containing integrin ligand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fraichard et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fraichard et al., 2010</xref>), in a screen for ECM candidates that interact genetically with <italic>neto,</italic> a gene essential for NMJ assembly and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kim et al., 2012</xref>). We found that Tnc selectively recruits the αPS2/βPS integrin at synaptic locations, without affecting integrin anchoring at muscle attachment sites. Dissection of Tnc functions revealed pre- and postsynaptic biologically active <italic>cis</italic> Tnc/integrin complexes that function to regulate neurotransmitter release and postsynaptic architecture. Finally, we exploited the remarkable features of this selective integrin ligand to uncover a novel synaptic function for integrin, in engaging the spectrin-based membrane skeleton.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Tnc localizes at synaptic terminals</title><p>To search for novel ECM proteins important for NMJ development we set up a synthetic lethality screen that took advantage of the 50% lethality of an allele with suboptimal levels of Neto, <italic>neto<sup>109</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kim et al., 2012</xref>).

Tnc has one RGD and several more RGD-like motifs that have been implicated in interaction with integrin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fraichard et al., 2010</xref>). During development, Tnc is secreted in the lumen of several epithelial organs, including foregut, hindgut and trachea. Tnc is also expressed in the embryonic CNS. Using a polyclonal anti-Tnc antibody (Materials and methods) we found that Tnc signals are strongly enriched in the neuropile, in the proximity of the anti-Fasciclin II (FasII) positive axons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A,B</xref> and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fraichard et al., 2006</xref>]).

We also generated a small deletion mutant (<italic>tnc<sup>82</sup></italic>) by FRT-induced recombination. These animals die as homozygous pharate adults (100% lethality, n = 221) but produce some heteroallelic escapers (17.5% viability for <italic>tnc<sup>82/Df</sup></italic>, n = 389).</p><p>Western blot analysis revealed a Tnc-positive band of ~300 kD (the calculated MW for Tnc is 299 kD) in extracts from brains and body-wall muscles of control larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).

A band of similar size was found in S2 cells transfected with a Tnc expression construct and was enriched in the conditioned media, indicating that Tnc is efficiently secreted in cell culture (Figure 1D, Material and methods). Neuron specific RNAi knockdown reduced Tnc levels in larval brains to 43% of the control group; this generated very strong phenotypes (below) suggesting that the residual band could reflect additional Tnc-expressing cells in the larval brain.

To further confirm the specificity of Tnc signals, we overexpressed Tnc in motor neurons (<italic>elav-Gal4</italic>) or muscles (<italic>BG487-Gal4</italic>) and examined the NMJs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H–J</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1H–I</xref>). Paneuronal expression of Tnc induced strong accumulation of Tnc-positive signals at synaptic terminals, as well as along the motor neuron axons. At these NMJs, Tnc-labeled puncta were concentrated at the edge of anti-horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-stained boutons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jan and Jan, 1982</xref>). Most of these signals were also observed in the absence of detergents, suggesting that Tnc is secreted in the synaptic terminal. In contrast, muscle overexpression of <italic>tnc</italic> showed increased Tnc-positive signals throughout the muscle; at synaptic terminals these signals appeared diffuse and farther away from the neuronal membrane. Thus, excess muscle Tnc may not be properly targeted and/or stabilized at synaptic terminals and may have detrimental effects on Tnc-mediated functions. We repeated these results using independent HA-tagged <italic>tnc</italic> transgenes and staining with anti-HA antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Both tagged and untagged transgenes rescued the viability of <italic>tnc</italic> mutants (see below), indicating that Tnc functions are unaffected by addition of the tag. As above, expression of <italic>tnc-HA</italic> in neurons but not in muscles induced high accumulation of HA-positive puncta, accessible without detergent, around the synaptic boutons, indicating extracellular distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A–D</xref>). Thus, Tnc is expressed in both motor neurons and muscles and appears to accumulate at the ECM surrounding synaptic terminals.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title><italic>tnc</italic> mutants have impaired NMJ physiology</title><p>To investigate a possible role for Tnc in the function of the nervous system and/or the musculature, we examined the morphology and physiology of <italic>tnc</italic> mutants.

Since we found no change in the resting potential and input resistance in mutant animals, the decrease in EJPs amplitude and quantal content was probably not caused by abnormal passive membrane properties in the muscle. Instead, the reduction of quantal content could be due to a decreased number of vesicle release sites or reduced probability of release. The reduced mEJP frequency is in agreement with reduced quantal content due to fewer release sites. To evaluate the vesicle release probability, we measured the paired-pulse ratio (PPR) using the EJP amplitudes evoked by two stimuli separated by duration of 50 ms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Wong et al., 2014</xref>). At 0.5 mM extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration, the control larvae showed mild short-term depression following paired-pulse stimulation (PPR &lt; 1, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G–H</xref>), indicating a relatively high initial probability of vesicle release; the second stimulus, provided before the resting Ca<sup>2+</sup> returned to baseline, lead to the exocytosis of fewer synaptic vesicles than the first stimulus. In contrast, the <italic>tnc</italic> mutant NMJs showed elevated facilitation and significantly increased PPR (<italic>w<sup>1118</sup></italic>, 0.80 ± 0.03 vs. <italic>tnc<sup>EP/Df</sup></italic>, 1.21 ± 0.08, p=0.0231, and <italic>tnc<sup>82/Df</sup></italic>, 1.16 ± 0.09, p=<italic>0.0295</italic>).

Together, these data indicate that neuron-derived Tnc regulates normal neurotransmitter release at the NMJ.</p><p>Previous studies suggest that Tnc functions as a ligand for αPS2/βPS integrin during wing morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fraichard et al., 2010</xref>). <italic>Drosophila</italic> integrins have been implicated in NMJ growth and synaptic function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Keshishian et al., 1996</xref>), with the βPS-containing complexes primarily in the postsynaptic compartment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Prokop et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Beumer et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Koper et al., 2012</xref>). If Tnc functions by recruiting integrin at the NMJ, then presynaptic but not postsynaptic βPS or αPS2 should similarly modulate the neurotransmitter release. Indeed, neuronal knockdown of <italic>myospheroid</italic> (<italic>mys</italic>), which encodes the βPS integrin subunit, significantly reduced the mEJPs frequency compared to control (<italic>mys<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> transgene with no driver) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G–H</xref>). In contrast, muscle knockdown of <italic>mys</italic> had no detectable effect on mEJPs frequency (control, 0.95 ± 0.14 Hz vs. <italic>N &gt; mys<sup>RNAi</sup></italic>, 0.47 ± 0.05 Hz p=0.0044 and <italic>M &gt; mys<sup>RNAi</sup></italic>, 1.00 ± 0.07 Hz p=0.9142) or amplitude. Similarly, neuronal but not muscle knockdown of <italic>inflated</italic> (<italic>if</italic>), which codes for αPS2 integrin, significantly reduced the mEJPs frequency compared to control (<italic>if<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> transgene with no driver) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J–L</xref>) (control, 1.62 ± 0.51 Hz vs. <italic>N &gt; if<sup>RNAi</sup></italic>, 0.99 ± 0.23 Hz p=0.0041 and <italic>M &gt; if<sup>RNAi</sup></italic>, 1.67 ± 0.42 Hz p=0.9662). The <italic>if<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> transgene appeared stronger than <italic>mys<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> and generated larval lethality and, occasionally, muscle attachment defects; using these transgenes we observed diminished mEJP amplitude compared to control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3L</xref>). Overall, the reduction of presynaptic αPS2/βPS mirrored the mEJP frequency deficits observed for <italic>tnc</italic> neuronal knockdown suggesting that neuron-derived Tnc functions as a ligand for presynaptic αPS2/βPS to modulate neurotransmitter release. Postsynaptic αPS2/βPS integrin does not appear to influence neurotransmitter release. Alternatively, a role for postsynaptic αPS2/βPS may be obscured by partial knockdowns and essential functions for these genes in the muscle.</p><p>If Tnc recruits integrin to modulate neurotransmitter release, then <italic>tnc</italic> and <italic>mys</italic> (or <italic>if</italic>) should interact genetically. We tested this prediction by examining the trans-heterozygote animals (<italic>mys/+;; tnc/+</italic>). Indeed, these trans-heterozygotes exhibited severe mEJP deficits that resembled <italic>tnc</italic> mutants, whereas individual heterozygote larvae (<italic>mys/+</italic> or <italic>tnc/+</italic>) showed normal mEJPs frequency and amplitude (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3M–O</xref>).

Indeed, the βPS signals were dramatically reduced at <italic>tnc</italic> mutant NMJs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–D</xref>). In these analyses the βPS immunoreactivities concentrated at perisynaptic locations, surrounding the control boutons, consistent with previous observations that the muscle pool constitutes the major fraction of βPS at synaptic terminals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Beumer et al., 1999</xref>). Interestingly, the βPS levels remained unchanged at the muscle attachment sites; we also observed no detachment of the muscle fibers or defects in costamere organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Maartens and Brown, 2015</xref>). This indicates that loss of Tnc selectively impairs the recruitment of βPS integrin at synaptic terminals. The anti-Tnc antibodies marked discrete puncta at the edge of the HRP- labeled boutons in a region strongly stained by anti-βPS antibodies, but Tnc was not detectable at the muscle attachment sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E–F</xref>). This suggests that Tnc and βPS may directly associate at synaptic terminals. Our attempts to co-immunoprecipitate Tnc/integrin complexes from larval carcasses failed; instead, we tested for their close juxtaposition at the NMJ using a proximity ligation assay (PLA), which indicates a less than 40 nm distance between two proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Wang et al., 2015</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G–H</xref>, PLA signals between Tnc and βPS were detected at control but not at <italic>tnc</italic> mutant NMJs. These PLA signals were tightly packed around the synaptic boutons, unlike the Tnc or βPS immunoreactivities, which spread into the postsynaptic specializations, suggesting that Tnc and βPS form complexes in the close proximity of the synaptic terminal. Such complexes could influence the presynaptic neurotransmitter release, as described above, but could also function in the postsynaptic compartment, where most of the perisynaptic βPS resides (see below).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.35518.010</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title><italic>tnc</italic> mutants have reduced perisynaptic αPS2/βPS integrin.</title><p>(<bold>A–D</bold>) Confocal images of control NMJ4 boutons and NMJ 6/7 muscle fields of indicated genotypes stained for βPS (green) and HRP (magenta).

The synaptic abundance of βPS integrin subunit was inversely correlated with the synaptic accumulation of FasII, a homophilic adhesion molecule required for synapse stabilization and growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Schuster et al., 1996a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Schuster et al., 1996b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Beumer et al., 2002</xref>).

This increase resembles the elevated levels of FasII reported at <italic>mys</italic> mutant NMJs, and indicates that loss of Tnc recapitulates some of the phenotypes reported for selective <italic>mys</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Beumer et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>Since secreted Tnc accumulates at synaptic terminals, both neuron- and muscle-derived Tnc could potentially recruit βPS. However, we found that <italic>tnc</italic> knockdown in muscles, but not in neurons, reduced the synaptic βPS levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4M–O</xref>, quantified in P). In fact, <italic>tnc</italic> knockdown in neurons induced a significant increase of βPS synaptic levels, suggesting that neuron-derived Tnc limits the accumulation of predominantly postsynaptic βPS. This unexpected result prompted us to examine the distribution of Tnc itself in RNAi experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). Compared to the control (<italic>tnc<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> transgene with no driver), <italic>tnc</italic> knockdown in motor neurons produced a significant increase (by 28%, p=0.0044, n = 27) of synaptic Tnc levels; this result is consistent with the apparent increase in Tnc net levels in muscle extracts from <italic>N &gt; tnc<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, right panel). Thus, neuron-derived Tnc limits the accumulation of muscle-derived Tnc at synaptic terminals. In contrast, <italic>tnc</italic> knockdown in muscle diminished the synaptic Tnc levels by 37% (p&lt;0.0001, n = 30). This partial reduction may reflect an inefficient RNAi treatment and/or a complementary increase in the neuron-derived Tnc. Nonetheless our data indicate that muscle Tnc is required in cis for the postsynaptic recruitment of βPS and that neuron-derived Tnc limits the accumulation of both Tnc and βPS postsynaptically (see below).</p><p>To determine the function of Tnc in the muscle we first tested whether Tnc influences the assembly and organization of postsynaptic iGluR fields by examining the levels and distribution of various postsynaptic components. <italic>Drosophila</italic> NMJ utilizes two types of iGluRs, type-A and -B, which require the essential auxiliary protein Neto for their distribution and function. Lack of Tnc did not alter the intensities of GluRIIA and GluRIIB synaptic signals or the IIA/IIB ratio (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). This result is consistent with the normal mini amplitude observed at <italic>tnc</italic> mutant NMJs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Neto itself appeared properly recruited at Tnc-depleted synapses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). In addition to iGluRs, Neto is critical for the recruitment of p21-activated kinase, PAK, a postsynaptic protein that stabilizes type-A receptors at PSDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ramos et al., 2015</xref>). We found that PAK signals are normal at Tnc-deprived NMJs, even though the βPS levels are reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). This suggests that Neto controls PAK recruitment at synaptic terminals; alternatively, a very low level of βPS may suffice in recruiting/stabilizing PAK at synaptic terminals.</p><p>In the course of these experiments, we noted that <italic>tnc</italic> mutant NMJs have smaller boutons and often poorly defined bouton/interbouton boundaries. To characterize these defects, we first examined the distribution of HRP-marked neuronal membranes and Discs large (Dlg), a PDZ (PSD-95/Dlg/Zona occludens-1) domain-containing scaffolding protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Budnik et al., 1996</xref>). Dlg localizes perisynaptically to the subsynaptic reticulum (SSR), a stack of membrane folds that surrounds the type I boutons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Guan et al., 1996</xref>).

For this rescue experiment we used a wide range of Tnc levels and monitored both βPS accumulation and postsynaptic function (Ib bouton area) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A–G</xref>). Paneuronal expression of Tnc rescued the postsynaptic βPS accumulation at <italic>tnc</italic> mutant NMJs; however, these animals had small, <italic>tnc</italic>-like boutons. Thus, neuron-derived Tnc can engage postsynaptic βPS to form non-productive complexes that cannot restore the bouton architecture.

To test this possibility, we overexpressed Tnc in an otherwise wild-type genetic background and examined the βPS signals at perisynaptic vs. muscle attachment sites. In these experiments we observed no changes in βPS levels and distribution at muscle attachment sites or costameres (not shown). However, βPS recruitment at larval NMJ was drastically reduced when Tnc was overexpressed in either neurons or muscles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A–E</xref>). Neuronal excess of Tnc produced a reduction of βPS synaptic levels (to 54% from control, p=0.0002, n = 23), and activities, as reflected by the reduction of bouton size compared with the control (transgene only) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref>).

This pulse triggered an increase in Tnc immunoreactivities, which distributed diffusely around the synaptic terminals. Importantly the βPS signals were also drastically diminished, particularly at postsynaptic locations. The βPS signals were no longer concentrated around the synaptic boutons, and instead appeared as thin lines inside the boutons, along the HRP-marked neuronal membrane. Thus, it appears that excess Tnc in the muscle gradually disrupted the postsynaptic βPS accumulation, revealing a small but clear pool of presynaptic βPS; further Tnc overexpression in the muscle completely disrupted both the Tnc and βPS synaptic accumulation and altered the boutons morphology. This dose dependent depletion of Tnc and βPS synaptic signals indicates that excess Tnc may form large aggregates that may be physically excluded from the intercellular space and dispersed away from the synaptic terminals. Alternatively, excess Tnc may trap integrin in the secretory compartment and/or overload a limiting step for the synaptic targeting and recruitment of Tnc/integrin complexes. We favor the former possibility because (i) Tnc itself diffused away from the synaptic terminal when in mild excess, (ii) Tnc has been previously implicated in the formation of large aggregates that fill the lumen of epithelial organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Syed et al., 2012</xref>), and (iii) simple disruption of Tnc trafficking and targeting within the muscle cannot explain the loss of presynaptic integrin accumulation and function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D–E</xref> and not shown).</p><p>To our knowledge this is the first example where genetic manipulations completely abolished the synaptic accumulation of βPS integrin. These larvae also exhibited drastically reduced levels of synaptic α-Spectrin and Adducin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>). Together these results indicate that optimal levels of secreted Tnc are required for proper βPS accumulation at the NMJ, which ensures normal NMJ morphology and function. These experiments also uncovered a novel function for βPS integrin in anchoring α-Spectrin at synaptic locations and coupling the ECM of the synaptic cleft (Tnc) with the spectrin-based membrane skeleton.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Tnc engages integrin and spectrin at the cell membrane</title><p>To examine whether Tnc directed the recruitment of integrin and spectrin complexes at the cell membrane, we took advantage of our ability to produce full-length Tnc and Tnc-HA proteins in S2 and S2R + insect cells. Secreted Tnc-HA was concentrated from S2 conditioned media, affinity coupled to Neutravidin beads of 1 μm diameter, then presented to S2R + cells, which express relatively high levels of integrin and spectrin. Unlike control beads (coated with an unrelated HA-tagged protein), Tnc-HA-coupled beads induced a local accumulation of βPS at the periphery of S2R + cells, in the close proximity of the beads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A–B</xref>). This local recruitment of βPS was not caused by mechanical stress, since control beads, either alone or in clusters, did not trigger βPS accumulation. The βPS recruitment was dose-dependent, as beads with variable Tnc-HA levels elicited proportional βPS accumulation (not shown). The Tnc-coupled beads triggered local recruitment of αPS2 but not αPS1 integrin subunit at the surface of S2R<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C–D</xref>, and not shown). This is consistent with our NMJ observations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) and with previous reports on small Tnc fragments mediating αPS2/βPS-dependent spreading of S2 cells via RGD and RGD-like motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fraichard et al., 2010</xref>). Moreover, the Tnc-HA-coupled beads induced similar accumulation of α-Spectrin and Adducin at the bead-cell membrane interfaces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9E–J</xref>). Thus Tnc triggers the local recruitment of α-Spectrin and Adducin at the cell membrane. Whether this recruitment is mediated either directly by integrin or indirectly, via other integrin activated scaffolds, remains to be determined. Our attempts to knockdown βPS in S2R + cells, and establish a requirement for integrin for Tnc-induced α-Spectrin recruitment, were hampered by an incomplete RNAi knockdown. Nonetheless, our data establish that Tnc provides a powerful means to recruit and/or stabilize integrin and cortical skeleton components at synaptic terminals.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.35518.021</object-id><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Tnc directs accumulation of integrin and spectrin at the cell membrane.</title><p>(<bold>A–H</bold>) Phase contrast and confocal microscopy images of S2R + cells presented with control (Tld-HA-) and Tnc-HA-coated beads and stained for βPS, αPS2, α-Spectrin or Adducin (in red), HA (green), and DAPI (blue).

This suggests that Tnc positively affects the surface delivery and/or stabilization of βPS integrin. We tested this possibility by following Tnc and βPS levels and distribution in S2R + cells transiently transfected with Tnc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1</xref>). In this system, Tnc or Tnc-HA were efficiently secreted and accumulated in the media. Inside the cells, Tnc marked large aggregates, likely corresponding to secretory compartments. We found that βPS levels were significantly elevated in cells expressing Tnc; also, βPS co-localized with Tnc in large intracellular aggregates, suggesting that (a) Tnc promotes βPS secretion, and that (b) βPS and Tnc likely associate during intracellular trafficking. It is also possible that excess Tnc may trap βPS inside the secretory compartment, although Tnc appeared to be efficiently secreted and βPS levels were elevated throughout the Tnc-positive cells. Binding to Tnc may stabilize βPS at the cell surface through clustering of integrin complexes and/or by conformational changes and activation of integrins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Liddington and Ginsberg, 2002</xref>). In both cases, Tnc binding could reduce the rate of βPS integrin endocytosis as well as overall turnover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">López-Ceballos et al., 2016</xref>), which may explain the elevated levels of βPS observed in Tnc-expressing cells.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The ECM proteins and their receptors have been implicated in NMJ development, but their specific roles have been difficult to assess because of their early development functions and the complexity of membrane interactions they engage. In this study, we have shown that Tnc is a selective integrin ligand that enables distinct pre- and post-synaptic integrin activities mediated at least in part through the local engagement of the spectrin-based cortical skeleton. First, Tnc depletion altered NMJ development and function and correlated with selective disruption of αPS2/βPS integrin and spectrin accumulation at synaptic terminals. Second, manipulation of Tnc and integrin in neurons demonstrated that presynaptic Tnc/integrin modulate neurotransmitter release (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>); <italic>spectrin</italic> mutations showed similar disruptions of the presynaptic neurotransmitter release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Featherstone et al., 2001</xref>). Third, postsynaptic Tnc influenced the development of postsynaptic structures (bouton size and SSR complexity), similar to integrin and spectrin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref> and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Beumer et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Pielage et al., 2006</xref>]). Fourth, presynaptic Tnc/integrin limited the accumulation and function of postsynaptic Tnc/integrin complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref>). Fifth, secreted Tnc bound integrin complexes at cell membranes, but only the <italic>cis</italic> complexes were biologically active (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figures 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9</xref>); <italic>trans</italic> Tnc/integrin complexes can form but cannot function at synaptic terminals and instead exhibited dominant-negative activities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figures 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref>). These observations support our model that Tnc is a tightly regulated component of the synaptic ECM that functions in cis to recruit αPS2/βPS integrin and the spectrin-based membrane skeleton at synaptic terminals and together modulate the NMJ development and function.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Tnc expands the repertoire of ECM synaptic functions</title><p>Tnc appears to fulfill unique, complementary functions with the other known synaptic ECM proteins at the <italic>Drosophila</italic> NMJ. Unlike Mtg, which organizes the active zone matrix and the postsynaptic domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Rohrbough et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Rushton et al., 2009</xref>), Tnc does not influence the recruitment of iGluRs and other PSD components. LanA ensures a proper adhesion between the motor neuron terminal and muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Koper et al., 2012</xref>) and also acts retrogradely to suppress the crawling activity-dependent NMJ growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Tsai et al., 2012</xref>). The latter function requires the presynaptic βν integrin subunit and phosphorylation of Fak56 via a pathway that appears to be completely independent of Tnc. Several more classes of trans-synaptic adhesion molecules have been implicated in either the formation of normal size synapses, for example Neurexin/Neuroligin, or in bridging the pre- and post-synaptic microtubule-based cytoskeleton, such as Teneurins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Banovic et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mosca et al., 2012</xref>). However, genetic manipulation of Tnc did not perturb synapse assembly or microtubule organization, indicating that Tnc functions independently from these adhesion molecules. Instead, Tnc appears to promote expression and stabilization of αPS2/βPS complexes, which in turn engage the spectrin-based membrane skeleton (SBMS) at synaptic terminals. On the presynaptic side these complexes modulate neurotransmitter release. On the postsynaptic side, the Tnc-mediated integrin and spectrin recruitment modulates bouton morphology. A similar role for integrin and spectrin in maintaining tissue architecture has been reported during oogenesis; egg chambers with follicle cells mutant for either integrin or spectrin produce rounder eggs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bateman et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ng et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Our data are consistent with a local function for the Tnc/βPS-recruited SBMS at synaptic terminals; this is distinct from the role of spectrin in endomembrane trafficking and synapse organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kizhatil et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lorenzo et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Tjota et al., 2011</xref>). Embryos mutant for spectrins have reduced neurotransmitter release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Featherstone et al., 2001</xref>), a phenotype shared by larvae lacking presynaptic Tnc or βPS integrin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>). However, Tnc perturbations did not induce synapse retraction and axonal transport defects as seen in larvae with paneuronal <italic>α-</italic> or <italic>β- spectrin</italic> knockdown (not shown) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Pielage et al., 2005</xref>). Spectrins interact with ankyrins and form a lattice-like structure lining neuronal membranes in axonal and interbouton regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Koch et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pielage et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Goellner and Aberle, 2012</xref>). We found that Tnc manipulations did not affect the distribution of Ankyrin two isoforms (Ank2-L and Ank2-XL) in axons or at the NMJ (not shown); also loss of ankyrins generally induces boutons swelling, whereas Tnc perturbations shrink the boutons and erode bouton-interbouton boundaries. Like <italic>tnc</italic>, loss of spectrins in the striated muscle shows severe defects in SSR structure ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Pielage et al., 2006</xref>] and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Lack of spectrins also disrupts synapse assembly and the recruitment of glutamate receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Pielage et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Pielage et al., 2006</xref>). In contrast, manipulations of <italic>tnc</italic> had no effect on PSD size and composition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Instead, <italic>tnc</italic> perturbations in the muscle led to boutons with altered size and individualization and resembled the morphological defects seen in spectrin tetramerization mutants, <italic>spectrin<sup>R22S</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Khanna et al., 2015</xref>). <italic>spectrin<sup>R22S</sup></italic> mutants have more subtle defects than <italic>tnc,</italic> probably because spectrin is properly recruited at NMJs but fails to crosslink and form a cortical network. Spectrins are also recruited to synaptic locations by Teneurins, a pair of transmembrane molecule that form trans-synaptic bridges and influence NMJ organization and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mosca et al., 2012</xref>). <italic>Drosophila</italic> Ten-m has an RGD motif; we found that βPS levels were decreased by 35% at <italic>ten-m<sup>MB</sup></italic> mutant NMJs (not shown). Thus, Ten-m may also contribute to the recruitment of integrin and SBMS at the NMJ, a function likely obscured by the predominant role both play in cytoskeleton organization.</p><p>We have previously reported that α-Spectrin is severely disrupted at NMJs with suboptimal levels of Neto, such as <italic>neto<sup>109</sup></italic>- a hypomorph with 50% lethality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kim et al., 2012</xref>). These mutants also had sparse SSR, reduced neurotransmitter release, as well as reduced levels of synaptic βPS ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kim et al., 2012</xref>] and not shown). In this genetic background, lowering the dose of <italic>tnc</italic> should further decrease the capacity to accumulate integrin and spectrin at synaptic terminals and enhance the lethality. This may explain the increased synthetic lethality detected in our genetic screen.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Tnc and NMJ development</title><p>In flies or vertebrates, the ECM proteins that comprise the synaptic cleft at the NMJ are not fully present when motor neurons first arrive at target muscles. Shortly thereafter, the neurons, muscles and glia begin to synthesize, secrete and deposit ECM proteins. At the vertebrate NMJ, deposition of the ECM proteins forms a synaptic basal lamina that surrounds each skeletal myofiber and creates a ~ 50 nm synaptic cleft. In flies, basal membrane contacts the motor terminal in late embryos, but is some distance away from the synaptic boutons during larval stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Prokop et al., 1998</xref>). Nonetheless, the NMJ must withstand the mechanical tensions produced by muscle contractions. Our data suggest that Tnc is an ideal candidate to perform the space filling, pressure inducing functions required to engage integrin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pines et al., 2012</xref>) and establish a dynamic ECM-cell membrane network at synaptic terminals. First, Tnc is a large mucin with extended PTS domains that become highly O-glycosylated, bind water and form gel-like complexes that can extend and induce effects similar to hydrostatic pressure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Syed et al., 2008</xref>). In fact, Tnc fills the lumen of several epithelial tubes and forms a dense matrix that acts in a dose-dependent manner to drive diameter growth. Second, the RGD and RGD-like motifs of Tnc have been directly implicated in αPS2/βPS-dependent spreading of S2 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fraichard et al., 2010</xref>). Third, secreted Tnc appears to act close to the source (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Syed et al., 2012</xref>), presumably because of its size and multiple interactions. In addition to the RGD motifs, Tnc also contains five complete and one partial vWFC domains, that mediate protein interactions and oligomerization in several ECM proteins including mucins, collagens, and thrombospondins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bork, 1991</xref>). The vWFC domains are also found in growth factor binding proteins and signaling modulators such as Crossveinless-2 and Kielin/Chordin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lin et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Wharton and Serpe, 2013</xref>) suggesting that Tnc could also influence the availability of extracellular signals. Importantly, Tnc expression is hormonally regulated during development by ecdysone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fraichard et al., 2010</xref>). Tnc does not influence integrin responsiveness to axon guidance cues during late embryogenesis; unlike integrins, the <italic>tnc</italic> mutant embryos have normal longitudinal axon tracks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Stevens and Jacobs, 2002</xref>]). Instead, Tnc synthesis and secretion coincide with the NMJ expansion and formation of new bouton structures during larval stages. Recent studies have reported several mucin-type O-glycosyltransferases that modulate integrin signaling and intercellular adhesion in neuronal and non-neuronal tissues, including the <italic>Drosophila</italic> NMJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Tran and Ten Hagen, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dani et al., 2014</xref>).

We reveal an unprecedented role for integrin in connecting the ECM of the synaptic cleft with spectrin, in particular to the spectrin-based membrane skeleton. These Tnc/integrin/spectrin complexes are crucial for the integrity and function of synaptic structures. Our studies uncover the ECM component Tnc as a novel modulator for NMJ development and function; these studies also illustrate how manipulation of a selective integrin ligand could be utilized to reveal novel integrin functions and parse the many roles of integrins at synaptic junctions.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Fly stocks</title><p>To generate the <italic>tnc<sup>82</sup></italic> allele, transposons <italic>PBac[RB]e01245</italic> and <italic>PBac[WH]f00323</italic> were mobilized by FRT-induced recombination as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Parks et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Thibault et al., 2004</xref>).

Other primary antibodies were utilized as follow: rabbit anti-Tnc 1:100; rat anti-HA (3F10) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lu and Roche, 2012</xref>) 1:500; rabbit anti-FAK (phospho Y397) (Abcam, ab39967), 1:100; rabbit anti-GluRIIB, 1:2000; rabbit anti-GluRIIC, 1:1000 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ramos et al., 2015</xref>); rabbit anti-PAK, 1:5000 (a gift from Nicholas Harden) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Conder et al., 2004</xref>); 1:1000; rat anti-Neto, 1:1000 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kim et al., 2012</xref>); and Cy5- conjugated goat anti-HRP, 1:1000 (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.). Alexa Fluor (AF) 405-, AF488-, AF568-, and AF647- conjugated secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes) were used at 1:200. All samples were mounted in ProLong Gold (Invitrogen).</p><p>Samples of different genotypes were processed simultaneously and imaged under identical confocal settings in the same imaging session with a laser scanning confocal microscope (CarlZeiss LSM780). All images were collected as 0.2 μm optical sections and the <italic>z</italic>-stacks were analyzed with Imaris software (Bitplane). To quantify fluorescence intensities synaptic ROI areas surrounding anti-HRP immunoreactivities were selected and the signals measured individually at NMJs (muscle 4, segment A3) from ten or more different larvae for each genotype (number of samples is indicated in the graph bar). The signal intensities were calculated relative to HRP volume and subsequently normalized to control. Boutons were counted in preparations double labeled with anti-HRP and anti-Dlg. Bouton size was estimated by using the ImageJ software. All quantifications were performed while blinded to genotype. The numbers of samples analyzed are indicated inside the bars. Statistical analyses were performed using the Student t-test with a two-tailed distribution and a two-sample unequal variance. Error bars in all graphs indicate standard deviation ±SEM. ***p&lt;0.001, **p&lt;0.005, *p&lt;0.05, ns- p&gt;0.05.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Proximity Ligation Assay (PLA)</title><p>PLA was performed following published protocols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Wang et al., 2015</xref>). In brief, wandering third instar larvae were dissected, fixed and incubated with primary antibodies (anti-Tnc and anti-βPS integrin) overnight at 4°C. To detect the markers, the samples were incubated with AF-conjugated secondary antibodies (anti-rabbit- AF488, anti-mouse-AF405 and anti-HRP-AF647) for 1 hr in the dark. For PLA, the samples were washed with Wash Buffer A (DUO 92101 Kit, Sigma), incubated first with PLA probe anti-mouse MINUS and PLA probe anti-rabbit PLUS (1:5 dilution) for 2 hr at 37°C, then with 200 μl Ligation solution for 1 hr at 37°C, and finally with Amplification solution for 2 hr at 37°C. After washes in Wash Buffer B, the samples were mounted in ProLong Gold (Invitrogen) and examined by confocal imaging.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Electrophysiology</title><p>The standard larval body wall muscle preparation first developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jan and Jan (1976)</xref> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jan and Jan, 1976</xref>) was used for electrophysiological recordings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Zhang and Stewart, 2010</xref>). Wandering third instar larvae were dissected in physiological saline HL-3 saline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Stewart et al., 1994</xref>), washed, and immersed in HL-3 containing 0.5 or 0.8 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> using a custom microscope stage system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ide, 2013</xref>). The nerve roots were cut near the exiting site of the ventral nerve cord so that the motor nerve could be picked up by a suction electrode. Intracellular recordings were made from muscle 6, abdominal segment 3 and 4. Data were used when the input resistance of the muscle was &gt;5 MΩ and the resting membrane potential was between −60 mV and −70 mV. The input resistance of the recording microelectrode (backfilled with 3 M KCl) ranged from 20 to 25 MΩ. Muscle synaptic potentials were recorded using Multiclamp 700B amplifiers (Molecular Devices) and Axon Clamp 2B amplifier (Axon Instruments) and analyzed using pClamp 10 software. Following motor nerve stimulation with a suction electrode (200 μsec, 1.9 V), evoked EJPs were recorded. Four to six EJPs evoked by low frequency of stimulation (0.1 Hz) were averaged. For mini recordings, TTX (1 μM) was added to prevent evoked release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Stewart et al., 1994</xref>). To calculate mEJP mean amplitudes, 100 events from each 10 or more NMJs (only one NMJ per animal was used) were measured and averaged using the Mini Analysis program (Synaptosoft). Minis with a slow rise and falling time arising from neighboring electrically coupled muscle cells were excluded from analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gho, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Zhang et al., 1998</xref>). Paired stimuli (200 μsec, 1.9 V, 0.05 Hz) were applied with a suction electrode at 50 ms inter-stimulus intervals. The amplitude of the eEJP was determined as an average from 5 to 8 steady consecutive sweeps. The paired-pulse ratio (PPR) was expressed as the amplitude ratio of the second synaptic response to the first synaptic response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Zhang and Stewart, 2010</xref>). Quantal content was calculated by dividing the mean EJP by the mean mEJP after correction of EJP amplitude for nonlinear summation according to previously described methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Stevens, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Feeney et al., 1998</xref>). Corrected EJP amplitude = E[Ln[E/(E - recorded EJP)]], where E is the difference between reversal potential and resting potential. The reversal potential used in this correction was 0 mV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Feeney et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lagow et al., 2007</xref>). Statistical analysis was performed with KaleidaGraph 4.5 (Synergy Software) using ANOVA followed by a Tukey post hoc test. Differences were considered significant at p&lt;0.05.

The first decision letter after peer review is shown below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;Tenectin recruits integrin to stabilize boutons and regulate vesicle release at the <italic>Drosophila</italic> neuromuscular junction&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Andreas Prokop (Reviewer #2).</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>All three reviewers (see below their comments) expressed major criticism regarding the manuscript conclusions. The major comment is that the results are confusing and some time contradicting regarding the muscle, versus neuron-dependent function of Tenectin in recruiting integrins to the NMJ. In addition a direct versus indirect effect of Tenectin on the levels of Spectrins at the NMJ should be further validated. Many controls are also missing.</p><p>We hope you find our comments useful. If you address these comments and would like to make a fresh submission at <italic>eLife</italic>, rather than elsewhere, we will be happy to examine this afresh.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This paper describes the expression and function of Tenectin at the larval NMJ. While there is a lot of information in the paper, it will primarily be of interest to specialists in fly neuromuscular system development.</p><p>There are also some problematical aspects to the data, as follows:</p><p>1) Maybe I am not understanding something here, but there seems to be an unresolved contradiction about <italic>cis</italic> vs. <italic>trans</italic> action of Tnc. They show that muscle, but not neuronal Tnc knockdown reduces βPS expression (Figure 4M) and from this (subsection “Muscle Tnc recruits postsynaptic integrin”, second paragraph) they conclude that it muscle Tnc acts in <italic>cis</italic> to recruit βPS, which is primarily expressed in muscles.</p><p>However, in Figure 6 they show that in a <italic>tnc</italic> mutant the loss of expression of βPS is restored by neuronal expression of Tnc, indicating that it is acting in <italic>trans</italic> (Figure 6D). When they express Tnc in muscles they lose βPS expression. The results in Figure 4 would predict that neuronal expression of Tnc in the mutant should not rescue, since neuronal knockdown does not affect βPS, and that muscle expression of Tnc should rescue, since muscle knockdown decreases βPS. Perhaps this is a Tnc overexpression phenotype. To test this, they should use weaker muscle drivers and reduce the temperature to reduce GAL4 activity, or make a direct muscle promoter&gt;Tnc fusion. Unless I am missing something here, if they can express Tnc at physiological levels in the muscles in a <italic>tnc</italic> mutant, this should rescue βPS expression, not eliminate it.</p><p>2) The data in Figure 8 are not convincing. Looking at the high-mag views of the HA beads and placing them into the low-mag views of the cells, one can see that there is no accumulation of βPS, αPS2, or spectrin around the beads relative to their levels elsewhere in the cells. In fact the beads are in low-expression areas for all of these markers. Given this, one cannot believe that the levels of these markers are lower around the control beads. No high-mag views of the control beads are shown, and you can't even see these beads in the fluorescent images since they are not labeled. To do this experiment correctly, they need to use a different HA-tagged protein on the control beads, so that they can be seen in the fluorescent images, and show equivalent high-mag views of the beads so that it can be determined if there is really more integrin around the beads. This should also be quantitated by measuring fluorescence intensity in the bead regions in Tnc-HA vs. Control protein-HA beads.</p><p>3) Figure 8—figure supplement 1 is also unconvincing and incomplete. There is clearly a lot of βPS within the cell in Tnc-HA expressing cells, but levels at the cell surface are not clearly increased (at least the images shown do not demonstrate this). They could address this by staining live cells with anti-βPS without detergent. Maybe Tnc-HA is expressed at very high levels and sequesters βPS within a secretory compartment where it cannot be degraded, thus increasing its intracellular levels. This does not show that Tnc-HA acts in <italic>cis</italic> to increase integrin surface localization.</p><p>4) If they want to evaluate whether Tnc-HA induces βPS, they should make a stable S2 line expressing Tnc-HA, which is easily done using stable transformation vectors. If Tnc-HA expression is toxic they can drive it from a conditional promoter. Similarly, they can use stable transfection to knock down βPS with RNAi if the transient RNAi knockdown is inadequate (subsection “Tnc engages integrin and spectrin at the cell membrane”, first paragraph).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This work by Wang and colleagues has some clear merits and high potential, but I do not recommend publication, but rather rejection with the option to re-submit. The main reason for this suggestion is the lack of clarity across the paper how experiments link together into new understanding. In my view there are seemingly contradicting results in this work that suggest a very intricate role and regulation of <italic>tnc</italic>, but have to be resolved before this manuscript can be considered for publication. The contradictions mainly consist in obscure effects observed upon pre- versus post-synaptic manipulations that require a far more refined experimental approach and logic dissection. Instead, data are being uncritically reported and the reader is left alone with a highly confusing message, if any message at all. There is potential in many of the data, but the authors failed to turn them into a readable and informative manuscript. Apart from these shortcomings there are a number of further issues that need clarification. See my detailed comments below.</p><p>Detailed comments:</p><p>The Introduction reads well and provides a sound overview of ECM at mammalian and <italic>Drosophila</italic> synapses. It would be helpful to mention the obvious gaps of understanding in the field and how this work addresses these gaps. A tip: do the authors know this review: Singhal, N., Martin, P. T. (2011). Role of extracellular matrix proteins and their receptors in the development of the vertebrate neuromuscular junction. Dev Neurobiol 71, 982-1005 – https://doi.org/10.1002/dneu.20953</p><p>Introduction or start of Results: It needs to be clearly stated that <italic>tnc</italic> has no mammalian homologue.</p><p>“Using a polyclonal anti-Tnc antibody (Materials and methods) we found that Tnc signals are concentrated during late embryogenesis in the ventral cord, near the pioneer, anti-Fasciclin II (FasII) positive axons (Figure 1—figure supplement 1A, B and (Fraichard et al., 2006)): For this statement, the resolution of analyses is far too low, and I do not think that this statement is important. Delete and stay with the statement that staining it is strongly enriched in the neuropile.</p><p>“In contrast, the Tnc CNS signals were absent in a <italic>tnc</italic> mutant (<italic>tnc<sup>EP</sup></italic> – <italic>P[EPgy2]EY03355</italic>), predicted to disrupt both known <italic>tnc</italic> transcripts (Syed et al., 2012)”: Point out that Fas2 pattern is not disturbed in the mutant CNS.

The manuscript provides novel information on the role of Tnc in recruiting the integrin complex (αPS2/βPS) to the NMJ along with spectrin and adducin. Overall the manuscript presents interesting and novel insights into the role of Tnc and integrin complexes at the NMJ. Much of the data and the quantitation was convincing and supported the conclusions. However there are a number of points that need to be addressed with the explanation of the data, some of the major conclusions drawn, a need for discussion of alternative hypotheses and the confirmation of the protein complex in vivo. These points are outlined below:</p><p>For the RNAi experiments only one <italic>tnc<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> line and one <italic>mys<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> was used throughout. Neither of these lines have been previously published to be specific to Tnc or <italic>mys</italic> and thus this either needs to be proven or alternative previously verified lines used to ensure that there are not any off target effects. Specifically the experiments need at least two RNAi lines used for the Tnc and <italic>mys</italic> knockdown to ensure no off target effects or RNAi lines verified by others to be specific. The <italic>mys<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> for instance is presumably a weaker one given that muscle knockdown of <italic>mys</italic> if strong would result in embryonic lethality.</p><p>In Figure 3 comparing mEJP Frequency for the <italic>tnc<sup>EP/Df</sup></italic>was less strongly affected compared to the <italic>N&gt;tnc<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> in Figure 3E versus 3B. It is surprising that the RNAi would have a strong effect that the EP/Df combination especially given that in Figure 1 the protein levels were substantively reduced in the EP/Df but not the <italic>N&gt;tnc<sup>RNAi</sup></italic>. This disconnect between levels of protein versus phenotypes need to be addressed in the text.</p><p>With the residual Tnc immunolabeling present in the <italic>tnc<sup>EP/Df</sup></italic>, it is logical to conclude that there is significantly more Tnc present in the <italic>N&gt;tnc<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> NMJ. However the degree of reduction of Tnc at the NMJ is not shown with either <italic>N&gt;tnc<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> or <italic>M&gt;tnc<sup>RNAi</sup></italic>. This should be included or if not, explained. This becomes very relevant in Figure 4 as the effect of <italic>M&gt;tnc<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> on the recruitment of αPS2βPS to the NMJ had a stronger effect than <italic>N&gt;tnc<sup>RNAi</sup></italic>.</p><p>The degree of Tnc loss in the <italic>tnc<sup>EP/Df</sup></italic> combination in Figure 1G (and Figure 1—figure supplement 1D) was surprisingly not complete given that the allele seems to be a null. The immunolabeling in the image does not match the quantitation by Western seen in Figure 1C. The phrase &quot;much reduced&quot; in <italic>tnc<sup>EP/Df</sup></italic> could be quantified using the approaches utilized throughout the manuscript for all the other markers. The text should also address if this is truly the presence of residual Tnc at the NMJ (and the implications of this) or is this background?</p><p>The results from this manuscript suggest that αPS2βPS and Tnc may directly interact. The S2 cell experiment was a strong approach to understanding the associations of Tnc, the integrin complex, spectrin and adducin. A stronger and a necessary approach to investigating the association of these proteins was to prove that these occur in vivo using a proximity ligation assay (PLA) to determine where in the NMJ these associations happen. The advantage of this approach is that the <italic>tnc<sup>EP/Df</sup></italic> mutant would serve as a good control as would the different RNAi and overexpression approaches. The PLA experiment would also be able to address if the <italic>M&gt;tnc</italic> expression was able to recruit the αPS2βPS complex to ectopic sites away from the NMJ. This would go a long way to support many of the conclusions and how a clear link at the NMJ between these protein complexes.</p><p>Further to this point, the link between integrins to spectrin and adducin is the key point of interest but other than the S2 cells there is little in the way to support a physical link between these components. It is equally possible that the loss of spectrin or adducin itself may lead to the loss of αPS2βPS from the NMJ. What happens to spectrin or adducin when αPS2 is reduced and vice versa?</p><p>For Figure 5 it is mentioned that &quot;In the course of these experiments we noted that <italic>tnc</italic> mutant NMJs showed aberrant morphology with poorly defined bouton/interbouton boundaries and more tubular branches, particularly in the proximal region.&quot; Given that this is the first mention of these different phenotypes, an inclusion of some examples is warranted as prior indications from Figure 2—figure supplement 1 was there were little morphological changes.</p><p>For the TEM analysis comments such as &quot;However, the mutant boutons were drastically distorted and no longer maintained normal round/oval shapes&quot; and &quot;This phenotype was highly penetrant and affected all type 1B neurons&quot; should be supported by the number of boutons that were analyzed and the number of synapses/larvae analyzed in the text itself.</p><p>The distribution of Dlg should be shown (data not shown throughout the manuscript) and the quantitation provided, especially given the effects on adducin on Dlg at the NMJ. This later point should be addressed in the text as well.</p><p>The <italic>M&gt;tnc<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> data with α-spectrin showed no decrease compared to the <italic>UAS-tnc<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> control. While the <italic>N&gt;tnc<sup>RNAi</sup></italic>showed an upregulation. Yet the <italic>tnc<sup>EP/Df</sup></italic> displayed a reduction in α-spectrin. The manuscript needs to address these differences and provide a model to help guide through the different interpretations of these effects.</p><p>The manuscript makes the statement &quot;Since neuron-derived Tnc recruits βPS integrin in the motor neurons to modulate neurotransmitter release (Figure 3…)&quot; – this is a very strong statement given that <italic>N&gt;tnc<sup>RNAi</sup></italic>showed a mild increase of the distribution of βPS to the NMJ (Figure 4L, 4N) and the effect on αPS2 is not shown. Figure 3 provides no evidence that the changes observed with <italic>N&gt;tnc<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> are due to the loss of βPS. This would require a rescue experiment to provide a direct link.</p><p>The interpretations and conclusions for the role of neuronal or muscle driven Tnc need to be tempered. <italic>N&gt;tnc</italic> rescued the degree of βPS present at the NMJ in the <italic>tnc<sup>EP/Df</sup></italic> mutant while <italic>M&gt;tnc</italic> did not and this lead to the conclusion that neuronal Tnc is key to the recruitment of βPS. Yet <italic>N&gt;tnc</italic> alone decreases the βPS at the NMJ (Figure 7C, 7E) compared to controls while <italic>N&gt;tnc<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> knock down (Figure 4L, 4N) shows slight more βPS at the NMJ compared to control. This suggests that neuronal derived Tnc blocks integrin accumulation at the NMJ. On the muscle side of the equation <italic>M&gt;tnc</italic> cannot rescue the <italic>tnc<sup>EP/Df</sup></italic> which isn't too surprising given that <italic>M&gt;tnc</italic> removes all the tnc from the NMJ. Thus these experiment don't prove that neuronal derived Tnc is sufficient and necessary to recruit βPS. Especially given that Tnc knockdown in muscles but not in neurons reduced the amount of synaptic βPS.</p><p>Along these lines the <italic>tnc</italic> mutants with muscle overexpressed <italic>tnc</italic> had a dramatic reduction in βPS as well as the <italic>M&gt;tnc</italic> in a wild type background. The panels from Figure 1J, Figure 1—figure supplement 1F and Figure 1—figure supplement 2F would suggest that overexpression of <italic>tnc</italic> may be significantly deleterious to the entire NMJ not just the distribution of βPS.</p><p>The authors state that expression of <italic>N&gt;tnc</italic> in the <italic>tnc<sup>EP/Df</sup></italic> mutant was able to rescue the reduction in α-spectrin however the degree of increase in α-spectrin does not appear to be strong. For the quantitation (Figure 6J) it was not clear what was being compared –.…each experimental to control which would suggest that the <italic>N&gt;tnc</italic> was significantly different from control (and didn't rescue to a great extent) –.…or each experimental to each other which would suggest that all three experimental were significant different from each other which didn't appear to be the case. For this type of multiple experiment analysis it would also be more relevant to carry out a One Way Anova with a post hoc multi-comparison test rather than a students' t-test.</p><p>It was also intriguing that the degree of rescue of Adducin and βPS immunolabeling at the NMJ was so much better than that for α-spectrin with the <italic>N&gt;tnc</italic>. Given the strength of the statements made in the text is it possible the wrong data was included in Figure 6J?</p><p>The major conclusion from this section should be tempered to reflect that neuronal expression of Tnc can rescue the <italic>tnc<sup>EP/Df</sup></italic> spectrin, βPS and adducin levels. Whether <italic>M&gt;Tnc</italic> is able or not will require a more measured approach to ensure that muscle expressed Tnc is present at the NMJ, that the muscles themselves are not deleteriously affected. This might be case given the stronger effects on βPS by the increased expression of Tnc in wild type muscles compared to the <italic>tnc<sup>EP/Df</sup></italic> muscles. These effects may simply by an increase the deleterious effects of Tnc expression and thus lead to a great disruption of NMJ morphology rather than an specific effect on &quot;ligand redundancy and/or other mechanisms may allow for partial βPS and/or α-Spectrin synaptic accumulation&quot;. Would the increased expression of Tnc or any ECM component lead to disruption of muscles as a result from ER stress?</p><p>The statement &quot;Unlike βPS, which was completely lost at these NMJs&quot; is not supported by the images presented in Figure 4E, Figure 6B and 6E: βPS is not completely lost at these NMJs. The authors need to be more careful about making this type of absolute statement.</p><p>[Editors’ note: what now follows is the decision letter after the authors submitted for further consideration.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Tenectin recruits integrin to stabilize bouton architecture and regulate vesicle release at the <italic>Drosophila</italic> NMJ&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by K VijayRaghavan (Senior Editor), a Reviewing Editor, and three reviewers.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved and the reviewers were impressed by the quality and amount of data. However, there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>Two of the reviewers requested to add controls, including additional RNAi lines for tenectin, and for the GAL4 used. This can be done speedily. Also, the genetic interaction between βPS and tenectin mutants would further support the results indicated by reviewer 1. Please see if you can do this.</p><p>Below, please find the specific comments of three reviewers.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>Wang et al. report an interesting finding on distinct pre-synaptic and post-synaptic roles for tenectin (Tnc), a selective integrin ligand, at the <italic>Drosophila</italic> neuromuscular junction (NMJ). Tnc in the neuron interacts with βPS/αPS2 integrin to control neurotransmitter release, whereas Tnc in the muscle interacts with post-synaptic αPS2/βPS integrin to regulate bouton morphology. By manipulating Tnc, they uncovered a novel role for integrin in recruiting the spectrin based membrane skeleton at the NMJ.</p><p>This paper will be of broad interest to the readership of <italic>eLife</italic> because it advances our understanding of NMJ development and synaptic physiology, as well as integrin/extracellular matrix biology. Although Tnc has been studied at the <italic>Drosophila</italic> NMJ, Wang et al. is among the first to reveal that Tnc has differential function in neurons and muscle. The data presented in this paper is thorough, with good controls and overall high-quality figures. However, I have two major concerns that should be addressed before publication. First, the inclusion of only one RNAi line targeting Tnc is insufficient, especially given the fact that the neuronal RNAi line only knocks down Tnc levels to 43% of control. The inclusion of at least two RNAi lines showing the same phenotype would both confirm and strengthen the author's conclusions. This is not a detail and needs to be addressed.</p><p>Second, the conclusion that αPS2, βPS, and Tnc function together to modulate neurotransmitter release (Figure 2) should be strengthened by genetic interaction experiments between βPS and Tnc indicating that either a) double mutants do not have a more severe phenotype, or b) trans-heterozygotes show enhancement of phenotype.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>Tenectin recruits integrin to stabilize bouton architecture and regulate vesicle release at the <italic>Drosophila</italic> NMJ' Wang et al.</p><p>In this manuscript the authors identify the mucin class protein tenectin as an ECM component of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> NMJ synapse from an interaction screen with Neto. The description of tenectin mutants is comprehensive, the technical quality of the data is high and the authors do identify interesting interactions with integrins. However ultimately little new insight is gained into the role of the ECM in synapse development or function beyond the identification of a new component. As such, the manuscript seems better suited to a more specialised neuroscience journal.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The manuscript by Wang et al. reports a novel function of tenectin (<italic>tnc</italic>) at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. The authors have identified Tnc, a mucin-like protein in a genetic screen for regulators of Neto, that the Serpe lab has previously shown to be required at the NMJ. In this elegant study, the authors use a combination of physiology, immunostainings and genetic approaches to probe the pre- and post-synaptic roles of <italic>tnc</italic> at the NMJ. Their results show that <italic>tnc</italic> mutants have reduced mini frequency, EJPs and quantal content. Paired pulse facilitation experiments show that <italic>tnc</italic> mutants have lower release probability. Next, the authors use pre- and post-synaptic specific manipulations (knock-down and rescue) to show that <italic>tnc</italic> is required in neurons but not muscles for normal neurotransmitter release. They further show that presynaptic RNAi knock-down of α and β integrin genes phenocopy the <italic>tnc</italic> phenotypes and suggest that <italic>tnc</italic> may act as an integrin ligand. Next, the authors examine the effects of altering tnc levels pre- and post-synaptically on integrins and synaptic morphology at the NMJ and find that the source and dose of <italic>tnc</italic> are critical determinants of bouton architecture and synaptic function. S2 cell experiments nicely show the ability of Tnc to cluster integrins as also suggested by the PLA assay.</p><p>Overall, this is an interesting study that sheds key novel insights into the role of extracellular matrix ligands and receptors in shaping the NMJ architecture and function. Although in my opinion the spectrin connection does not add much to the story and the precise mechanism remains to be established (it may have to do with post-translational modifications, as suggested) this study is well executed, novel and of broad interest.</p><p>My only criticism is the absence of driver controls for phenotypic studies. While the authors use the UAS lines as background, which is fine, it is rather standard and important to control for any potential contributions of the GAL4 drivers to the phenotypes evaluated here.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.35518.026</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the first round of peer review follow.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>All three reviewers (see below their comments) expressed major criticism regarding the manuscript conclusions.

The current extensively revised manuscript includes a set of completely new ideas that were generated because of the expert comments we received from our reviewers. We have built a new, more refined model for the pre- and post-synaptic Tnc functions by carefully addressing all the suggestions from the reviewers and by expanding our study to include many additional experiments and new types of assays.</p><p>As all the reviewers pointed out, this is a complex system, distributed asymmetrically between the pre- and post-synaptic compartments, and also sensitive to the source and the dose of Tnc.</p><p>1) To clarify the contributions of pre- and postsynaptic Tnc, we first searched for additional metrics to characterize the muscle-specific functions of Tnc. On the neuron side, Tnc-dependent activities are clearly measured using very sensitive electrophysiological recordings. We found that postsynaptic Tnc is not only required for normal postsynaptic specializations, such as subsynaptic reticulum (SSR), but also for normal bouton size. Loss of muscle Tnc produces significantly smaller synaptic boutons. Bouton size appears to be a very reliable and informative read-out for Tnc activities in the muscle and was utilized throughout this revised manuscript.</p><p>2) Secondly, to deliver very low, physiologic levels of Tnc in the muscle, we first screened our large collection of individual <italic>tnc</italic> transgenes. Since none of the 20 lines screened had sufficiently low expression levels, we had to utilize a battery of muscle specific drivers and low temperature rearing conditions. These manipulations allowed us to expand the dose-dependent experiments and provide a comprehensive set of analyses for the Tnc function and distribution in rescue and overexpression settings.</p><p>3) Using these refined analyses, we were able to show that although Tnc associates with integrin even in tissue culture settings, only the <italic>cis</italic> Tnc/integrin complexes appear to have normal activity in vivo. This is a big departure from our original interpretation that extracellular Tnc can bind to integrin on either side of the synaptic cleft and engage in compartment-specific activities.</p><p>In this revised manuscript we have carefully controlled the dose of Tnc to demonstrate that:</p><p>a) Endogenous levels of muscle Tnc rescued the accumulation and function (bouton size) of the muscle Tnc/integrin complexes at <italic>tnc</italic> NMJs.</p><p>b) In contrast, complexes formed by neuronal Tnc and muscle integrin partially accumulate at <italic>tnc</italic> mutant terminals, but these <italic>trans</italic> complexes did not function properly as they did not rescue the bouton size and the levels of synaptic α-Spectrin.</p><p>c) In addition, we have successfully visualized a presynaptic pool of integrin – as suggested by one reviewer.</p><p>4) Genetic manipulations of <italic>tnc, mys/βPS</italic> and <italic>if/αPS2</italic> allowed us to assign these functions to the Tnc/integrin complexes and to establish that the synaptic accumulation of α-Spectrin is downstream these complexes.</p><p>5) The Tnc/integrin co-localization studies were greatly enhanced by new assays suggested by our reviewers, in particular the PLA.</p><p>6) The in vivo differences between <italic>cis</italic> and <italic>trans</italic> Tnc activities indicate that the motor neurons and the muscles secrete functionally different Tnc proteins, presumably with different posttranslational modifications. Our new Western blot analyses suggest the possibility of muscle specific processing, since a set of three faint bands are visible for Tnc overexpressed in muscle vs. mostly one band for neuronal Tnc.</p><p>7) As the reviewers predicted, refining our experimental approaches revealed an intricate regulation of the Tnc/integrin complexes. For example:</p><p>a) The neuron-derived Tnc and βPS integrin limit the synaptic accumulation of (i) muscle Tnc/integrin complexes, and (ii) α-Spectrin.</p><p>b) Excess neuronal Tnc appears to disperse the synaptic Tnc/integrin complexes (which are predominantly postsynaptic) and thus reduce the bouton size.</p><p>c) A short and weak pulse of <italic>tnc</italic> expression in the muscle induces elevated levels of synaptic Tnc and integrin; a longer pulse or constant muscle overexpression effectively disrupt the Tnc/integrin accumulation at synaptic terminals and produce aberrant NMJ morphology.</p><p>In summary, our revised model proposes that Tnc is a tightly regulated component of the synaptic ECM that functions in <italic>cis</italic> to recruit αPS2/βPS integrin and the spectrin-based membrane skeleton at synaptic terminals and together modulate the NMJ development and function. <italic>trans</italic> Tnc/integrin complexes can form but cannot function properly at synaptic terminals and instead appear to exhibit dominant-negative activities.</p><p>Once again, all these important insights were possible because of the thoughtful suggestions from our reviewers. We are very grateful for their consideration and help.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>This paper describes the expression and function of Tenectin at the larval NMJ. While there is a lot of information in the paper, it will primarily be of interest to specialists in fly neuromuscular system development.</p></disp-quote><p>We respectfully disagree with the reviewer as the nature and biology of integrin ligands is poorly understood across the animal kingdom. Although Tnc has no direct human homologue, Tnc is a typical mucin, with a highly recognizable organization (two large PTS domains, multiple vWFC and RGD-like motifs). Our discovery of a synaptic mucin that binds integrin and controls synapse development and function opens the door to probe for similar mechanisms that modulate integrin recruitment and function at synapses. Furthermore, this study reveals a completely novel connection between the spectrin-based membrane skeleton and the ECM/integrin complexes. This association may inform the current research on the highly ordered spectrin network observed in mammalian neurons and dendrites.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>There are also some problematical aspects to the data, as follows:</p><p>1) Maybe I am not understanding something here, but there seems to be an unresolved contradiction about cis vs. trans action of Tnc. They show that muscle, but not neuronal Tnc knockdown reduces βPS expression (Figure 4M) and from this (subsection “Muscle Tnc recruits postsynaptic integrin”, second paragraph) they conclude that it muscle Tnc acts in cis to recruit βPS, which is primarily expressed in muscles.</p><p>However, in Figure 6 they show that in a tnc mutant the loss of expression of βPS is restored by neuronal expression of Tnc, indicating that it is acting in trans (Figure 6D). When they express Tnc in muscles they lose βPS expression. The results in Figure 4 would predict that neuronal expression of Tnc in the mutant should not rescue, since neuronal knockdown does not affect βPS, and that muscle expression of Tnc should rescue, since muscle knockdown decreases βPS. Perhaps this is a Tnc overexpression phenotype. To test this, they should use weaker muscle drivers and reduce the temperature to reduce GAL4 activity, or make a direct muscle promoter&gt;Tnc fusion. Unless I am missing something here, if they can express Tnc at physiological levels in the muscles in a tnc mutant, this should rescue βPS expression, not eliminate it.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is absolutely correct and our new experiments along this line (included in Figure 7) support this view: physiological levels of Tnc in the muscle indeed rescued the defects observed in a <italic>tnc</italic> mutant.</p><p>We have followed the reviewer’s advice and refined our rescue experiments by using additional weak promoters, such as <italic>BG487-Gal4</italic>, which has graded expression (a) along the anterior posterior axis and (b) in different muscle subsets. We further reduced the Tnc expression levels by means of low rearing temperatures. Using this weak promoter and rearing the animals at 18<bold>°</bold>C, we managed to reduce the levels of Tnc in the muscles to ~2 fold more than endogenous levels. In these conditions we observed complete muscle rescue.</p><p>We apologize for the confusing way in which we previously described this complicated system. As recommended by reviewers, we performed and included in this manuscript a large number of experiments to better characterize the presynaptic and postsynaptic functions of Tnc, to distinguish between <italic>cis</italic> vs. <italic>trans</italic> Tnc activities, and to clearly describe the dose-dependent phenomena. As summarized above, our revised analyses demonstrate that in vivo Tnc functions in <italic>cis</italic>. Neuron-derived Tnc could form only unproductive complexes <italic>in trans</italic> with the muscle integrin.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The data in Figure 8 are not convincing. Looking at the high-mag views of the HA beads and placing them into the low-mag views of the cells, one can see that there is no accumulation of βPS, αPS2, or spectrin around the beads relative to their levels elsewhere in the cells. In fact the beads are in low-expression areas for all of these markers. Given this, one cannot believe that the levels of these markers are lower around the control beads. No high-mag views of the control beads are shown, and you can't even see these beads in the fluorescent images since they are not labeled. To do this experiment correctly, they need to use a different HA-tagged protein on the control beads, so that they can be seen in the fluorescent images, and show equivalent high-mag views of the beads so that it can be determined if there is really more integrin around the beads. This should also be quantitated by measuring fluorescence intensity in the bead regions in Tnc-HA vs. Control protein-HA beads.</p></disp-quote><p>As the reviewer suggested, we repeated these experiments using control beads coupled with an unrelated HA-tagged protein. We also included high-magnification views of the control and experiment beads as requested by the reviewer. This new set of data is presented in Figure 8 and clearly illustrates the ability of Tnc-HA coated beads, but not control beads, to recruit integrin and α-Spectrin.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Figure 8—figure supplement 1 is also unconvincing and incomplete. There is clearly a lot of βPS within the cell in Tnc-HA expressing cells, but levels at the cell surface are not clearly increased (at least the images shown do not demonstrate this). They could address this by staining live cells with anti-βPS without detergent. Maybe Tnc-HA is expressed at very high levels and sequesters βPS within a secretory compartment where it cannot be degraded, thus increasing its intracellular levels. This does not show that Tnc-HA acts in cis to increase integrin surface localization.</p></disp-quote><p>We fully agree with the reviewer regarding the limitations of this experiment. Therefore, we toned down our interpretation and included the alternative possibility that the reviewer suggested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) If they want to evaluate whether Tnc-HA induces βPS, they should make a stable S2 line expressing Tnc-HA, which is easily done using stable transformation vectors. If Tnc-HA expression is toxic they can drive it from a conditional promoter. Similarly, they can use stable transfection to knock down βPS with RNAi if the transient RNAi knockdown is inadequate (subsection “Tnc engages integrin and spectrin at the cell membrane”, first paragraph).</p></disp-quote><p>Whether Tnc-HA also induces βPS transcriptional expression is likely via an indirect mechanism. This has very little relevance for the phenomena characterized here and therefore has not been pursued.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>This work by Wang and colleagues has some clear merits and high potential, but I do not recommend publication, but rather rejection with the option to re-submit. The main reason for this suggestion is the lack of clarity across the paper how experiments link together into new understanding. In my view there are seemingly contradicting results in this work that suggest a very intricate role and regulation of tnc, but have to be resolved before this manuscript can be considered for publication. The contradictions mainly consist in obscure effects observed upon pre- versus post-synaptic manipulations that require a far more refined experimental approach and logic dissection. Instead, data are being uncritically reported and the reader is left alone with a highly confusing message, if any message at all. There is potential in many of the data, but the authors failed to turn them into a readable and informative manuscript. Apart from these shortcomings there are a number of further issues that need clarification. See my detailed comments below.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer very much for appreciating the clear merits and high potential of our work.

Even more, these data (double-labelling with HRP) clearly confirm previous observations that integrin localises also strongly to SSR, i.e. postsynpatic membrane.

Overall the manuscript presents interesting and novel insights into the role of Tnc and integrin complexes at the NMJ. Much of the data and the quantitation was convincing and supported the conclusions.

Neither of these lines have been previously published to be specific to Tnc or mys and thus this either needs to be proven or alternative previously verified lines used to ensure that there are not any off target effects. Specifically the experiments need at least two RNAi lines used for the Tnc and mys knockdown to ensure no off target effects or RNAi lines verified by others to be specific. The mys<sup>RNAi</sup> for instance is presumably a weaker one given that muscle knockdown of mys if strong would result in embryonic lethality.</p></disp-quote><p>As the reviewer pointed out, we too were aware of off-targeting effects and thus tested multiple tnc-RNAi lines, including an additional line from Vienna (v42326). However, the Vienna line was very weak, as indicated by Western blots from tissue-specific knockdown animals. Similar to the Tnc-RNAi line selected for this study, <italic>M&gt;tnc</italic>-v42326 induced a reduction of βPS synaptic levels (albeit much milder than <italic>M&gt;tnc</italic>-TRIP), while <italic>N&gt;tnc</italic>-v42326 induced robust increase of βPS levels.

We have mentioned the multiple RNAi lines tested and the similar outcomes in the Materials and methods section.</p><p>We have specifically selected a weak <italic>mys<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> line for this study, since strong knockdown of mys induces early lethality and/or profound defects in the muscle development and could be problematic when examining the NMJ development.</p><p>In addition, we have repeated the knockdown experiments and targeted if/α-PS2. In this case, we tested three available TRIP lines and found that two of them impaired the larval development when expressed in the muscle. We selected the one that allowed for apparently normal muscle development into third instar stages (BL-38958); this line reduced the synaptic αPS2 levels to ~55% of control NMJs, and α-Spectrin to ~65%.

In this revised manuscript, we have refrained from discussing unrelated Tnc expression patterns because of the complexity of the phenomena already described here.</p><p>Since all our data indicate that the neuronal knock down of Tnc is very efficient and induces strong postsynaptic responses (see below), we alluded to this early on and mentioned additional Tnc-expressing cells in the brains with the following sentence:</p><p>“Neuron specific RNAi knockdown reduced the Tnc levels in larval brains to 43% of the control group; this generated very strong phenotypes (below) suggesting that the residual band could reflect additional Tnc-expressing cells in the larval brain.”</p><p><italic>With the residual Tnc immunolabeling present in the tncEP/Df, it is logical to conclude that there is significantly more Tnc present in the N&gt;tncRNAi NMJ. However the degree of reduction of Tnc at the NMJ is not shown with either N&gt;tncRNAi or M&gt;tncRNAi. This should be included or if not, explained.

The RNAi results are now reported in a completely new figure (Figure 4—figure supplement 2).</p><p>Because of this careful quantification we uncovered a completely new layer of Tnc regulation, a push-pull mechanism, where removal of neuronal Tnc (in an otherwise wild-type background) induces a significant increase of the muscle-derived Tnc. This increased muscle Tnc triggers a downstream cascade that includes (a) increased integrin (Figure 4N), (b) increased Dlg (Figure 5D) and (c) increased α-Spectrin (Figure 6—figure supplement 1). We were also able to show that similar manipulations of βPS have exactly the same effect as Tnc on the synaptic α-Spectrin, that is, neuronal knockdown of βPS triggered almost doubled α-Spectrin levels (Figure 6—figure supplement 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The degree of Tnc loss in the tncEP/Df combination in Figure 1G (and Figure 1—figure supplement 1D) was surprisingly not complete given that the allele seems to be a null. The immunolabeling in the image does not match the quantitation by Western seen in Figure 1C. The phrase &quot;much reduced&quot; in tncEP/Df could be quantified using the approaches utilized throughout the manuscript for all the other markers. The text should also address if this is truly the presence of residual Tnc at the NMJ (and the implications of this) or is this background?</p></disp-quote><p>We have addressed this issue by including a careful quantification of the NMJ signals (Figure 1—figure supplement 1) as described above. Furthermore, we have provided a completely new figure (Figure 7—figure supplement 1) showing a Western blot of brain and muscle extracts of various genotypes labeled for Tnc. In the brain protein extracts, the Tnc antibodies label a single band of the expected size (300 kDa); in the muscle extracts, we detect two more bands that are independent of various <italic>tnc</italic> manipulations. This new data indicate that our Tnc antibodies show some non-specific staining in the muscle.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The results from this manuscript suggest that αPS2βPS and Tnc may directly interact. The S2 cell experiment was a strong approach to understanding the associations of Tnc, the integrin complex, spectrin and adducin. A stronger and a necessary approach to investigating the association of these proteins was to prove that these occur in vivo using a proximity ligation assay (PLA) to determine where in the NMJ these associations happen. The advantage of this approach is that the tncEP/Df mutant would serve as a good control as would the different RNAi and overexpression approaches. The PLA experiment would also be able to address if the M&gt;tnc expression was able to recruit the αPS2βPS complex to ectopic sites away from the NMJ. This would go a long way to support many of the conclusions and how a clear link at the NMJ between these protein complexes.</p><p>Further to this point, the link between integrins to spectrin and adducin is the key point of interest but other than the S2 cells there is little in the way to support a physical link between these components. It is equally possible that the loss of spectrin or adducin itself may lead to the loss of αPS2βPS from the NMJ. What happens to spectrin or adducin when αPS2 is reduced and vice versa?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer very much for this suggestion. Indeed, we have successfully exploited the PLA assay to document the close proximity of Tnc and βPS at synaptic terminals. These new data are included in Figure 4G-H’.</p><p>As mentioned above, we have performed and included some epistasis experiments in this revised manuscript. For example, neuronal knockdown of Tnc triggered a significant increase in postsynaptic Tnc, β-PS and α-Spectrin (Figure 4, Figure 4—figure supplement 2, Figure 6—figure supplement 1). Similarly, neuronal knockdown of βPS triggered almost doubling of the α-Spectrin synaptic levels (Figure 6—figure supplement 1). Muscle knockdowns of βPS or αPS2 were less informative for weak RNAi lines (Figure 6—figure supplement 1 and not shown), and induced overall defective muscle morphology and compound phenotypes for strong RNAi settings.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>For Figure 5 it is mentioned that &quot;In the course of these experiments we noted that tnc mutant NMJs showed aberrant morphology with poorly defined bouton/interbouton boundaries and more tubular branches, particularly in the proximal region.&quot; Given that this is the first mention of these different phenotypes, an inclusion of some examples is warranted as prior indications from Figure 2—figure supplement 1 was there were little morphological changes.</p><p>For the TEM analysis comments such as &quot;However, the mutant boutons were drastically distorted and no longer maintained normal round/oval shapes&quot; and &quot;This phenotype was highly penetrant and affected all type 1B neurons&quot; should be supported by the number of boutons that were analyzed and the number of synapses/larvae analyzed in the text itself.</p></disp-quote><p>As emphasized above, the request to document in details the NMJ morphology turned into a tremendously informative readout for the Tnc function in the muscle. In particular, the bouton size and the SSR density appear to be a direct consequence of the activity of postsynaptic Tnc/integrin complexes. Loss of muscle Tnc invariably led to smaller boutons with reduced SSR structures and Dlg signals; these defects could only be rescued by the <italic>cis</italic> Tnc/integrin postsynaptic complexes.</p><p>As indicated in the response to reviewer #2, we have now included a new set of EM data with extensive quantifications.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The distribution of Dlg should be shown (data not shown throughout the manuscript) and the quantitation provided, especially given the effects on adducin on Dlg at the NMJ. This later point should be addressed in the text as well.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. as careful quantifications of the Dlg levels greatly contributed to the readout for the Tnc function in the muscle.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The M&gt;tncRNAi data with α-spectrin showed no decrease compared to the UAS-tncRNAi control. While the N&gt;tncRNAi showed an upregulation. Yet the tncEP/Df displayed a reduction in α-spectrin. The manuscript needs to address these differences and provide a model to help guide through the different interpretations of these effects.</p></disp-quote><p>As outlined above, we have extensively revised this manuscript using compartment specific and dose-dependent analyses. Using these refined approaches, we showed that only the <italic>cis</italic> Tnc/integrin complexes are biologically functional in vivo, whereas the <italic>trans</italic> Tnc/integrin complexes exhibit dominant-negative activities. This is a significant departure from our previous interpretation that extracellular Tnc can bind to integrin on either side of the synaptic cleft and engage in compartment-specific activities.</p><p>In this model, the differences between α-spectrin levels in tnc mutants and <italic>N&gt;tnc<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> reflect an inhibitory role for neuronal Tnc onto the muscle Tnc/integrin complexes (and consequently spectrin recruitment).</p><p>The reviewers were correct all along and rightly confused by our original interpretation. We are very grateful for their tremendous help in sorting out this complex system.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript makes the statement &quot;Since neuron-derived Tnc recruits βPS integrin in the motor neurons to modulate neurotransmitter release (Figure 3)&quot; – this is a very strong statement given that N&gt;tnc<sup>RNAi</sup> showed a mild increase of the distribution of βPS to the NMJ (Figure 4L, 4N) and the effect on αPS2 is not shown. Figure 3 provides no evidence that the changes observed with N&gt;tnc<sup>RNAi</sup> are due to the loss of βPS. This would require a rescue experiment to provide a direct link.</p></disp-quote><p>This claim is now further supported by several new pieces of data:</p><p>1) Figure 3 now includes a similar effect (reduced mini frequency) when if/αPS2 was knocked down in the neurons but not in the muscle. Thus both integrin subunits, αPS2 and βPS, are required in the neuron for normal mini frequency.</p><p>2) Genetic manipulations suggested by reviewer #2 allowed us to visualize a presynaptic pool of βPS (Figure 8H).</p><p>The reviewer is correct: the ideal experiment would require some rescue. But since only the <italic>cis</italic> Tnc/integrin complexes appear to be biologically active, overexpression of neuronal βPS and/or αPS2 are not expected to rescue the mini defects of <italic>tnc</italic> mutants.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The interpretations and conclusions for the role of neuronal or muscle driven Tnc need to be tempered. N&gt;tnc rescued the degree of βPS present at the NMJ in the tncEP/Df mutant while M&gt;tnc did not and this lead to the conclusion that neuronal Tnc is key to the recruitment of βPS. Yet N&gt;tnc alone decreases the βPS at the NMJ (Figure 7C, 7E) compared to controls while N&gt;tncRNAi knock down (Figure 4L, 4N) shows slight more βPS at the NMJ compared to control. This suggests that neuronal derived Tnc blocks integrin accumulation at the NMJ. On the muscle side of the equation M&gt;tnc cannot rescue the tncEP/Df which isn't too surprising given that M&gt;tnc removes all the tnc from the NMJ. Thus these experiment don't prove that neuronal derived Tnc is sufficient and necessary to recruit βPS. Especially given that Tnc knockdown in muscles but not in neurons reduced the amount of synaptic βPS.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is absolutely correct and examining these points in more detail made us depart from our original thinking that extracellular Tnc can bind to integrin on either side of the synaptic cleft and engage in compartment-specific activities. Moreover, as the reviewer noted, neuronal derived Tnc limits the integrin accumulation at the NMJ. We have expanded our data set to further characterize this regulation and, as detailed above, found that removal of neuronal Tnc induces a significant increase of the muscle-derived Tnc. The elevated Tnc muscle levels next induce an increase in the synaptic accumulation of (a) integrin (Figure 4N), (b) Dlg (Figure 5D) and (c) α-Spectrin (Figure 6—figure supplement 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Along these lines the tnc mutants with muscle overexpressed tnc had a dramatic reduction in βPS as well as the M&gt;tnc in a wild type background. The panels from Figure 1J, Figure 1—figure supplement 1F and Figure 1—figure supplement 2F would suggest that overexpression of tnc may be significantly deleterious to the entire NMJ not just the distribution of βPS.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer correctly noted the toxic effect of excess muscle Tnc. We have refined these analyses by examining a wide range of Tnc doses in muscles rescue (Figure 7) and overexpression (Figure 8) experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors state that expression of N&gt;tnc in the tncEP/Df mutant was able to rescue the reduction in α-spectrin however the degree of increase in α-spectrin does not appear to be strong. For the quantitation (Figure 6J) it was not clear what was being compared – each experimental to control which would suggest that the N&gt;tnc was significantly different from control (and didn't rescue to a great extent) – or each experimental to each other which would suggest that all three experimental were significant different from each other which didn't appear to be the case. For this type of multiple experiment analysis it would also be more relevant to carry out a One Way Anova with a post hoc multi-comparison test rather than a students' t-test.</p><p>It was also intriguing that the degree of rescue of Adducin and βPS immunolabeling at the NMJ was so much better than that for α-spectrin with the N&gt;tnc. Given the strength of the statements made in the text is it possible the wrong data was included in Figure 6J?</p><p>The major conclusion from this section should be tempered to reflect that neuronal expression of Tnc can rescue the tncEP/Df spectrin, βPS and adducin levels. Whether M&gt;Tnc is able or not will require a more measured approach to ensure that muscle expressed Tnc is present at the NMJ, that the muscles themselves are not deleteriously affected. This might be case given the stronger effects on βPS by the increased expression of Tnc in wild type muscles compared to the tncEP/Df muscles. These effects may simply by an increase the deleterious effects of Tnc expression and thus lead to a great disruption of NMJ morphology rather than an specific effect on &quot;ligand redundancy and/or other mechanisms may allow for partial βPS and/or α-Spectrin synaptic accumulation&quot;. Would the increased expression of Tnc or any ECM component lead to disruption of muscles as a result from ER stress?</p></disp-quote><p>As the reviewer noted, neuronal Tnc did not really rescue of the α-spectrin levels at tnc mutant NMJs. In the revised manuscript, we further exploit this observation together with the size of type Ib boutons to argue that <italic>trans</italic> Tnc/integrin complexes could form but are not biologically active.</p><p>We have revised extensively the rescue experiments and provided expanded data analyses, including graded expression levels for muscle Tnc. As the reviewer indicated, we have now convincing evidence that excess Tnc levels in the muscle induces deleterious effects; we have revised the text accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The statement &quot;Unlike βPS, which was completely lost at these NMJs&quot; is not supported by the images presented in Figure 4E, Figure 6B and 6E: βPS is not completely lost at these NMJs.

Tnc in the neuron interacts with βPS/αPS2 integrin to control neurotransmitter release, whereas Tnc in the muscle interacts with post-synaptic αPS2/βPS integrin to regulate bouton morphology. By manipulating Tnc, they uncovered a novel role for integrin in recruiting the spectrin based membrane skeleton at the NMJ.</p><p>This paper will be of broad interest to the readership of eLife because it advances our understanding of NMJ development and synaptic physiology, as well as integrin/extracellular matrix biology. Although Tnc has been studied at the Drosophila NMJ, Wang et al. is among the first to reveal that Tnc has differential function in neurons and muscle. The data presented in this paper is thorough, with good controls and overall high-quality figures. However, I have two major concerns that should be addressed before publication. First, the inclusion of only one RNAi line targeting Tnc is insufficient, especially given the fact that the neuronal RNAi line only knocks down Tnc levels to 43% of control. The inclusion of at least two RNAi lines showing the same phenotype would both confirm and strengthen the author's conclusions. This is not a detail and needs to be addressed.</p><p>Second, the conclusion that αPS2, βPS, and Tnc function together to modulate neurotransmitter release (Figure 2) should be strengthened by genetic interaction experiments between βPS and Tnc indicating that either a) double mutants do not have a more severe phenotype, or b) trans-heterozygotes show enhancement of phenotype.</p></disp-quote><p>We are deeply grateful to this reviewer for the thoughtful consideration of our work and for her/his generous help in improving the overall presentation of our findings, and their biological relevance. Although Tnc has been studied in the context of epithelial tube morphogenesis and development of male genitalia, this is the first study reporting Tnc distribution and function at the <italic>Drosophila</italic> NMJ.</p><p>In the revised manuscript, we have addressed both reviewer’s concerns, as follows:</p><p>1) As the reviewer emphasized, because of frequent off targeted effects, one must always test two different RNAi lines. We have previously tested a second RNAi line and observed similar, though relatively milder phenotypes. Here we have expanded these knockdown experiments and included a complete set of electrophysiological recordings in a new supplementary figure (Figure 3—figure supplement 1). Together these data confirmed that we are observing Tnc-specific phenotypes.</p><p>2) The reviewer is absolutely correct, we should see a genetic interaction between tnc and αPS2 or βPS. Indeed, we tested the trans-heterozygotes (<italic>mys</italic>/+;; <italic>tnc</italic>/+) and observed severe defects that resembled the <italic>tnc</italic> mutant phenotypes, even though when tested separately both heterozygotes have no detectable defects. We have included these additional experiments in the main Figure 3M-O.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>Tenectin recruits integrin to stabilize bouton architecture and regulate vesicle release at the Drosophila NMJ' Wang et al.</p><p>In this manuscript the authors identify the mucin class protein tenectin as an ECM component of the Drosophila NMJ synapse from an interaction screen with Neto. The description of tenectin mutants is comprehensive, the technical quality of the data is high and the authors do identify interesting interactions with integrins. However ultimately little new insight is gained into the role of the ECM in synapse development or function beyond the identification of a new component. As such, the manuscript seems better suited to a more specialised neuroscience journal.</p></disp-quote><p>We respectfully disagree with reviewer #2: Tnc is a strikingly selective integrin ligand that allowed for unprecedented insights into our understanding of integrin recruitment and function at synaptic locations. Our genetic manipulations produce sharp phenotypes that uncovered novel pre- and post-synaptic functions for integrin. Also, a new signaling pathway that couples ECM/integrin with the spectrin-based membrane skeleton emerges from this work. Integrin and spectrin have pleiotropic roles in both pre- and post-synaptic compartments, and local, synaptic disruption of integrin or spectrin have not been previously possible. Our discovery provides the means to explore their local functions and to define a synaptic role for the spectrin-based membrane skeleton, a topic of intense research in neural development.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>The manuscript by Wang et al. reports a novel function of tenectin (tnc) at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) in Drosophila. The authors have identified Tnc, a mucin-like protein in a genetic screen for regulators of Neto, that the Serpe lab has previously shown to be required at the NMJ. In this elegant study, the authors use a combination of physiology, immunostainings and genetic approaches to probe the pre- and post-synaptic roles of tnc at the NMJ. Their results show that tnc mutants have reduced mini frequency, EJPs and quantal content. Paired pulse facilitation experiments show that tnc mutants have lower release probability. Next, the authors use pre- and post-synaptic specific manipulations (knock-down and rescue) to show that tnc is required in neurons but not muscles for normal neurotransmitter release. They further show that presynaptic RNAi knock-down of α and β integrin genes phenocopy the tnc phenotypes and suggest that tnc may act as an integrin ligand. Next, the authors examine the effects of altering tnc levels pre- and post-synaptically on integrins and synaptic morphology at the NMJ and find that the source and dose of tnc are critical determinants of bouton architecture and synaptic function. S2 cell experiments nicely show the ability of Tnc to cluster integrins as also suggested by the PLA assay.</p><p>Overall, this is an interesting study that sheds key novel insights into the role of extracellular matrix ligands and receptors in shaping the NMJ architecture and function. Although in my opinion the spectrin connection does not add much to the story and the precise mechanism remains to be established (it may have to do with post-translational modifications, as suggested) this study is well executed, novel and of broad interest.</p><p>My only criticism is the absence of driver controls for phenotypic studies. While the authors use the UAS lines as background, which is fine, it is rather standard and important to control for any potential contributions of the GAL4 drivers to the phenotypes evaluated here.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank very much the reviewer for the generous comments and support for our work.</p><p>As the reviewer requested, we have revised the manuscript to include the characterization of the drivers.
