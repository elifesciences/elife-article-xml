processes. Although m<sup>6</sup>A modification has been reported to regulate type I interferon (IFN) responses by targeting the mRNA of IFN-β and the interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), the detailed mechanism of how m<sup>6</sup>A methyltransferase complex (MTC) rapidly responds to conduct the modification on nascent mRNA during IFN-β stimulation remains largely unclear. Here, we demonstrate that WTAP, the adaptor protein of m<sup>6</sup>A MTC, undergoes dephosphorylation-regulated phase transition from aggregates to liquid-like condensates under IFN-β stimulation, thereby mediating m<sup>6</sup>A modification of a subset of ISGs to restrict their expression. The phase transition of WTAP promotes the interaction with nucleus-translocated transcription factor STAT1, recruits MTC to the promoter regions of ISGs and directs the co-transcriptional m<sup>6</sup>A modification on ISG mRNAs. Collectively, our findings reveal a novel regulatory role of WTAP phase transition in manipulating signaling pathways and fine-tuning immune response by orchestrating dynamic m<sup>6</sup>A modification through the cooperation of transcription factors and MTC. Our findings unveil a novel mechanism by which WTAP phase transition controls immune homeostasis via transcription factor-MTC-driven dynamic m<sup>6</sup>A modification, thereby proposing a potential therapeutic target for alleviating immune dysregulation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>m<sup>6</sup>A modification</kwd><kwd>type I interferon</kwd><kwd>phase separation</kwd><kwd>WTAP</kwd><kwd>interferon-stimulated genes</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100012166</institution-id><institution>National Key Research and Development Program of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2020YFA0908700</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cui</surname><given-names>Jun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>82341047</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cui</surname><given-names>Jun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>32270922</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cui</surname><given-names>Jun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31970700</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jin</surname><given-names>Shouheng</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>324B2026</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cai</surname><given-names>Sihui</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100021171</institution-id><institution>Guangdong Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2024B1515040009</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cui</surname><given-names>Jun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>IFN-β-induced WTAP phase transition bridges STAT1 and MTC, which orchestrates m<sup>6</sup>A dynamics on ISG mRNAs to suppress excessive immune response and sustain immune homeostasis.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Innate immunity is the first defense line against invading pathogens, mainly through the IFN and ISGs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Goubau et al., 2013</xref>). Once the type I IFN is stimulated and initiated, the signal should be tightly restricted to maintain the homeostasis of immune responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Henault et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Schneider et al., 2014</xref>). In the past few years, a large number of studies have reported the post-translational modification of signaling proteins that regulate type I IFN signaling, such as phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Uddin et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wen et al., 1995</xref>), ubiquitination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cui et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Qin et al., 2016</xref>) and methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mowen et al., 2001</xref>). However, whether post-transcriptional modification of mRNA affects type I IFN responses remains largely unclear.</p><p>Methylation at the <italic>N</italic><sup>6</sup> position of adenosine (m<sup>6</sup>A) is the most pervasive post-transcriptional modification of mRNA. Deposition of m<sup>6</sup>A is catalyzed by MTC, including a key adaptor protein Wilm’s tumor-associated protein (WTAP) and key catalyze proteins methyltransferase-like 3 (METTL3) and methyltransferase-like 14 (METTL14) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Schapira, 2016</xref>). The m<sup>6</sup>A-modified RNAs are recognized by YT521B homology (YTH) domain family proteins, including YTHDC1, YTHDC2, YTHDF1, YTHDF2, and YTHDF3. m<sup>6</sup>A modification have been found to regulate different cellular processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Knuckles and Bühler, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Meyer and Jaffrey, 2017</xref>), such as differentiation of stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Geula et al., 2015</xref>), circadian clock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zhong et al., 2018</xref>), splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zhang et al., 2010</xref>), translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wang et al., 2015</xref>) and destabilization of mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wang et al., 2014</xref>). Meanwhile, m<sup>6</sup>A modification can be reversed by demethylase fat mass and obesity-associated gene (FTO) and AlkB homolog 5 (ALKBH5) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jia et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zheng et al., 2013</xref>). m<sup>6</sup>A modification is critical for newborn mRNA produced by specific stimulation to participate in further physiological activities. While m<sup>6</sup>A modification of <italic>IFN-β</italic> mRNA suppresses antiviral responses during viral infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rubio et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Winkler et al., 2019</xref>), this modification also paradoxically enhances antiviral response through different regulation of ISG transcripts, such as enhancing translation of IFIT1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">McFadden et al., 2021</xref>) and prolonging <italic>STAT1</italic> and <italic>IRF1</italic> mRNAs stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wang et al., 2020a</xref>), demonstrating the complexity of m<sup>6</sup>A in immune modulation. Given the crucial role of precise and timely m<sup>6</sup>A modification on mRNA in fine-tuning antiviral responses, further investigation is required to clarify the function of non-catalytic protein WTAP and how MTC responds to IFN-β stimulation.</p><p>Here, we observed the phase transition from gel-like aggregates to liquid-like condensates of WTAP driven by IFN-β-induced dephosphorylation. Based on the results from the WTAP mutation assay, we revealed that under IFN-β stimulation, the liquid phase of WTAP cooperated with transcription factor STAT1 to recruit MTC at the promoter regions of ISGs<italic>,</italic> mediating the m<sup>6</sup>A modification on newborn ISG mRNAs and regulating the expression of a subset of ISGs, thereby modulating antiviral type I IFN responses.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>WTAP undergoes phase separation during IFN-β stimulation</title><p>To explore the detailed mechanism of WTAP-directed m<sup>6</sup>A modification on ISG mRNAs, we first investigated the expression of WTAP during virus infection. We infected cells with RNA virus Vesicular Stomatitis Virus (VSV) or DNA virus Herpes Simplex Virus-1 (HSV-1), and conducted the immunofluorescence experiments. Surprisingly, we found WTAP was clustered and formed condensate-like patterns in cells during virus infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). We then stimulated cells with IFN-β and observed the increasing number of WTAP condensate formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).

IDRs contain more charged and polar amino acids to present multiple weakly interacting elements, and lack hydrophobic amino acids to show flexible conformations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hou et al., 2024</xref>). By searching WTAP protein structure (within part of MTC complex) in protein structure bank (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.rcsb.org/structure/7VF2">https://www.rcsb.org/structure/7VF2</ext-link>), we found that WTAP IDR was predicted to span amino acids from 245 to 396, giving a clue that WTAP might have the ability to undergo phase separation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). To directly prove the phase separation properties of WTAP in vitro, we purified the recombinant mCherry-WTAP protein, mixed recombinant mCherry-WTAP with physiological buffer and found that the buffer became turbid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Observation under microscope showed that mCherry-WTAP automatically formed liquid-like condensates which could be reversed by 1,6-hexanediol (hex), an inhibitor of phase separation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Phase diagram of WTAP phase separation was also established under different concentrations of potassium chloride and recombinant mCherry-WTAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Fusion of condensates were observed and larger condensates were formed in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). These data together confirmed that WTAP underwent phase separation in vitro.</p><p>To further explore the protein properties, we detected the phase separation behavior of WTAP in cells. Gene expressing mCherry-WTAP was introduced in <italic>WTAP-</italic>deficient HeLa cells to generate mCherry-WTAP-rescued HeLa cells, followed by IFN-β stimulation. A few WTAP condensates were discovered in untreated cells while an increasing number of WTAP condensates were observed under IFN-β stimulation. After hex treatment, WTAP condensates in IFN-β treated cells dissipated into a dispersed pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Similarly, hex treatment in virus-infected cells also disrupted the formation of WTAP condensates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). We next checked the mobility of WTAP condensates by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) experiments. Intriguingly, WTAP exhibited lower recovery intensity in untreated cells but higher mobility with rapid recovery intensity in IFN-β-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). These results suggested a potential dynamic transformation in WTAP phase separation. While WTAP underwent gel-like phase separation under basal conditions, IFN-β induced its phase transition to form the liquid-like condensates under physiological conditions.</p><p>Previous studies have uncovered that protein phase separation could be controlled by interaction between specific regions through multiple factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Murthy et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wang et al., 2018</xref>), including electrostatic interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boyko et al., 2019</xref>), hydrophobic contacts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Reichheld et al., 2017</xref>) or hydrogen bonds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gabryelczyk et al., 2019</xref>). Therefore, we tried to figure out the phase separation-driven region of WTAP. We analyzed the net charge per region and hydropathy of WTAP, but no specific domains with opposite charge or high level of hydrophobicity were found (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A–B</xref>), indicating that electrostatic interaction and hydrophobic contacts might not be the key driving force for WTAP phase separation. We then analyzed the abundance of amino acids and found that Serine (Ser), Glutamine (Gln), Glutamate (Glu), and Leucine (Leu) were present at significantly higher levels than other amino acids within WTAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>). Gln and Leu were mainly located in the N-terminal domain (NTD) while Ser was mostly enriched in the C-terminal domain (CTD), implying the distinct properties of NTD and CTD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Notably, IDR of WTAP were predicted to cover the entire serine-rich CTD region. Previous researches reported that hydrogen bond between serine side chain mediated the intermolecular interaction and LLPS of FUS. In addition, abnormal glutamine-repeat resulted in the formation of β-sheet and solid/gel-like aggregates with lower mobility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Perutz, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tanaka et al., 2001</xref>), which were related to neurodegenerative diseases like Huntington’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gourfinkel-An et al., 1997</xref>). Therefore, we wondered whether glutamine-rich NTD and serine-rich CTD of WTAP induced the distinct phase separation. As predicted, we found full-length WTAP and CTD WTAP formed liquid condensates, while NTD of WTAP clustered and formed aggregates with lower mobility, which was confirmed through FRAP experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2D</xref>). Intriguingly, we further observed that full-length WTAP transited from liquid-like condensates to aggregates after incubation for several minutes while CTD of WTAP remained liquid phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2E</xref>). Collectively, these data validated the different phase separation potentials of NTD and CTD of WTAP.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>IFN-β-mediated dephosphorylation induces the phase transition of WTAP</title><p>Since the serine-rich CTD played the key role in liquid condensates formation of WTAP, we wondered whether IFN-β-mediated WTAP phase transition through serine-phosphorylation by electrostatic repulsion among negatively charged phosphate.

We then constructed a series of phosphorylation mimic, serine/threonine to aspartate mutants (S/T-D) or phosphorylation-deficient, serine/threonine to alanine mutant (S/T-A) of WTAP, and observed the phase separation of WTAP mutants in vitro. We found that introducing three or more phosphorylation-mimic mutations in WTAP promoted protein aggregation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E</xref>).

We next conducted FRAP experiments and found that mobility of WT WTAP as well as 5ST-A mutant was significantly higher than that of its 5ST-D mutant in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). However, hyperphosphorylated WT WTAP in untreated cells showed lower mobility as 5ST-D mutant compared to phosphorylation-deficient 5ST-A mutant, while IFN-β-induced dephosphorylation promoted the recovery efficiency of WT WTAP as higher as 5ST-A mutants of WTAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>).

By performing the chromosome immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-qPCR experiments, we found that WTAP interacted with promoter regions of ISGs along with STAT1 under IFN-β stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and B</xref>). STAT1 deficiency abolished the binding affinity between WTAP and ISG promoter regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>), implying that nucleus-translocated transcription factor STAT1 directed WTAP and MTC to promoter regions of ISGs to conduct m<sup>6</sup>A deposition process on mRNA. <italic>PPP4</italic> knockdown impaired interaction between WTAP and ISG promoter regions, linking the interaction efficiency to phase transition of WTAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>).

Based on our findings, we proposed a working model of WTAP phase transition in the regulation of m<sup>6</sup>A modification of ISG mRNAs under IFN-β stimulation. In untreated cells, hyperphosphorylated WTAP tended to form gel-like aggregates with lower mobility, restricting interaction between WTAP-dependent MTC and ISG promoter regions. After IFN-β stimulation, protein phosphatase PPP4 mediated the dephosphorylation of WTAP, resulting in the phase transition from aggregates to liquid phase of WTAP. Liquid-phase WTAP exhibited enhanced mobility, recruiting METTL3 and nucleus-translocated STAT1 to form STAT1-WTAP-METTL3 condensates. Guided by STAT1, these condensates were able to bind with ISG promoter regions and mediate the m<sup>6</sup>A modification of ISG mRNAs during the STAT1-driven transcription process, thereby prompting diverse regulation on stability of ISG mRNAs. Our work uncovered how WTAP phase transition couples gene transcription with mRNA modification, providing a novel mechanism on multi-layer regulation of ISGs expression via m<sup>6</sup>A modification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Type I IFN response is a crucial part of the antiviral immunity, which is strictly controlled by various types of regulation to avoid unexpected tissue damages. m<sup>6</sup>A deposition is one of the most widespread post-transcriptional modifications, which is involved in various aspects of RNA metabolism to regulate different biological events, including antiviral response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Garcias Morales and Reyes, 2021</xref>). m<sup>6</sup>A deposition on IFN-β mRNA is reported to dampen type-I IFN production by destabilizing transcripts, yet no m<sup>6</sup>A is detected on ISG mRNAs in the same study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Winkler et al., 2019</xref>).

Abnormal expression of WTAP is discovered in multiple diseases, including cancer or diabetes, to address dysfunctional m<sup>6</sup>A modification in specific genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Huang et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Li et al., 2022b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yu et al., 2021</xref>). However, how WTAP reacts in response to specific stimulation and selectively targets specific mRNA remains unclear. Here, we focused on the function of WTAP on antiviral response, uncovered the novel mechanism that WTAP underwent IFN-β-induced dephosphorylation-mediated gel-to-liquid phase transition, which mediated its interaction with transcription factor STAT1, directing MTC to conduct the m<sup>6</sup>A modification on nascent ISG mRNAs co-transcriptionally.</p><p>Phase separation is a well-known phenomenon associated with the formation of membraneless organelles, which concentrates the substrates and enzymes and accelerates biochemical reactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alberti et al., 2019</xref>).

However, whether other MTC components exhibits phase separation is still unknown. Here, we observed that WTAP also went through phase separation both in vitro and in vivo. We found WTAP mainly formed the aggregates with lower mobility in untreated cells, and transited to liquid condensates with IFN-β treatment, implying that phase separation participated in WTAP-dependent m<sup>6</sup>A deposition under IFN-β stimulation. We found hex treatment or phospho-mimic mutations (5ST-D) trapped WTAP in low-mobility aggregates, impaired ISG promoter binding ability and m<sup>6</sup>A deposition event. These results uncovered the mechanism and the crucial role of WTAP phase separation and phase transition in MTC assembly and ISGs m<sup>6</sup>A deposition under IFN-β stimulation. Furthermore, the phase transition of WTAP suggested a potential mechanism that aggregation of WTAP might work as a backup storage, and the stimuli-induced phase transition was developed to perform the m<sup>6</sup>A modification timely and precisely in response to the requirement of cell development or abnormal situations. Thus, the investigation of WTAP phase separation in different models could be conducted to explain the mechanism of m<sup>6</sup>A modification under complex stimulation and explore possible therapeutic targets of multiple diseases.</p><p>Post-translational modifications are one of the most common ways to modulate the characteristics of proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Luo et al., 2021</xref>), like phosphorylation of serine and threonine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Markevich et al., 2004</xref>) and methylation of arginine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Guccione and Richard, 2019</xref>).

In this study, we observed PPP4-mediated dephosphorylation of WTAP at serine/threonine residues triggered a gel-to-liquid phase transition, enabling STAT1-MTC recruitment. Consistently, phosphomimic 5ST-D mutant of WTAP mainly aggregated as lower mobility form compared to phosphodeficient 5ST-A mutant of WTAP, which formed liquid condensates in cells, indicating that phosphorylation level of WTAP balanced its phase transition. Therefore, our findings shed light on the mechanism of post-translational modification-regulated phase transition of WTAP and put forward an open question whether phosphorylation and other post-translational modifications function as the key strategy for global phase transition of proteins in vivo.</p><p>Since we found the phase transition event of WTAP and its interaction with transcription factor STAT1, we proposed that co-transcriptional m<sup>6</sup>A modification on nascent ISG transcripts might occur during IFN-β stimulation.

After stimulation, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (Meilunbio, China) for 15 min at room temperature, permeated by ice-cold methanol at –20℃ for 15 min and blocked using 6% goat serum (cat. #AR1009, Boster Biological) for 1 hr, and then incubated with indicated primary antibody at 4℃ overnight, followed by incubation with indicated secondary antibody at room temperature for 1 hr. Phosphate buffer (PBS) was used to wash three times for 5 min between each step. After staining, Leica TCS-SP8 STED 3X confocal fluorescence microscope was used to acquire images. Images were captured by Leica TCS-SP8 STED 3X confocal fluorescence microscope and analyzed by Leica Application Suite Advanced Fluorescence (LAS AF, Version 4.2) software, while deconvolution was conducted by Huygens Software (Version 23.04). The colocalization between proteins was quantified by ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health, Maryland, USA, Version 1.52) using Pearson’s correlation coefficient, ranging from –1–1. A value of –1 represents perfect negative correlation, 0 means no correlation and 1 indicates perfect correlation.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Expression, purification, and interaction of mCherry-WT WTAP, 5ST-A/ST-D mutants, CFP-METTL3, and GFP-STAT1</title><p>Procedures of the expression of proteins in <italic>E</italic>. coli were referred to Hao <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jiang et al., 2015</xref>.

This model is supported by strong evidence that the phosphorylation state of WTAP, regulated by PPP4, is regulated by IFN-B stimulation, and that this results in interactions between WTAP, the m6A methyltransferase complex, and STAT1, a transcription factor that mediates activation of ISGs. This was demonstrated via a combination of microscopy, immunoprecipitations, m6A sequencing, and ChIP. These experiments converge on a set of experiments that nicely demonstrate that IFN-B stimulation increases the interaction between WTAP, METTL3, and STAT1, that this interaction is lost with knockdown of WTAP (even in the presence of IFN-B), and that this IFN-B stimulation also induces METTL3-ISG interactions.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The evidence for the IFN-B stimulated interaction between METTL3 and STAT1, mediated by WTAP, is quite strong. Removal of WTAP in this system seems to be sufficient to reduce these interactions and the concomitant m6A methylation of ISGs. The conclusion that the phosphorylation state of WTAP is important in this process is also quite well supported. The authors have now also provided substantial evidence that phase separation of WTAP upon interferon stimulation facilitates m6A-methylation of multiple interferon stimulated genes.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.100601.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>In this study, Cai and colleagues investigate how one component of the m6A methyltransferase complex, the WTAP protein, responds to IFNb stimulation. They find that viral infection or IFNb stimulation induces the transition of WTAP from aggregates to liquid droplets through dephosphorylation by PPP4. This process affects the m6A modification levels of ISG mRNAs and modulates their stability. In addition, the WTAP droplets interact with the transcription factor STAT1 to recruit the methyltransferase complex to ISG promoters and enhance m6A modification during transcription. The investigation dives into a previously unexplored area of how viral infection or IFNb stimulation affects m6A modification on ISGs. The observation that WTAP undergoes a phase transition is significant in our understanding of the mechanisms underlying m6A's function in immunity. However, there are still key gaps that should be addressed to fully accept the model presented.</p><p>Major points:</p><p>(1) More detailed analyses on the effects of WTAPsgRNA on the m6A modification of ISGs:</p><p>a. A comprehensive summary of the ISGs, including the percentage of ISGs that are m6A-modified,</p><p>b. The distribution of m6A modification across the ISGs, and</p><p>c. A comparison of the m6A modification distribution in ISGs with non-ISGs.</p><p>In addition, since the authors propose a novel mechanism where the interaction between phosphorylated STAT1 and WTAP direct the MTC to the promoter regions of ISGs to facilitate co-transcriptional m6A modification, it is critical to analyze whether the m6A modification distribution holds true in the data.</p><p>(2) Since a key part of the model includes the cytosol-localized STAT1 protein undergoing phosphorylation to translocate to the nucleus to mediate gene expression, the authors should focus on the interaction between phosphorylated STAT1 and WTAP in Figure 4, rather than the unphosphorylated STAT1. Only phosphorylated STAT1 localizes to the nucleus, so the presence of pSTAT1 in the immunoprecipitate is critical for establishing a functional link between STAT1 activation and its interaction with WTAP.</p><p>(3) The authors should include pSTAT1 ChIP-seq and WTAP ChIP-seq on IFNb-treated samples in Figure 5 to allow for a comprehensive and unbiased genomic analysis for comparing the overlaps of peaks from both ChIP-seq datasets. These results should further support for their hypothesis that WTAP interacts with pSTAT1 to enhance m6A modifications on ISGs.</p><p>Minor points:</p><p>(1) Since IFNb is primarily known for modulating biological processes through gene transcription, it would be informative if the authors discussed the mechanism of how IFNb would induce the interaction between WTAP and PPP4.</p><p>(2) The authors should include mCherry alone controls in Figure 1D to demonstrate that mCherry does not contribute to the phase separation of WTAP.

This model is supported by strong evidence that the phosphorylation state of WTAP, regulated by PPP4, is regulated by IFN-B stimulation, and that this results in interactions between WTAP, the m<sup>6</sup>A methyltransferase complex, and STAT1, a transcription factor that mediates activation of ISGs. This was demonstrated via a combination of microscopy, immunoprecipitations, m<sup>6</sup>A sequencing, and ChIP. These experiments converge on a set of experiments that nicely demonstrate that IFN-B stimulation increases the interaction between WTAP, METTL3, and STAT1, that this interaction is lost with the knockdown of WTAP (even in the presence of IFN-B), and that this IFN-B stimulation also induces METTL3-ISG interactions.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The evidence for the IFN-B stimulated interaction between METTL3 and STAT1, mediated by WTAP, is quite strong. Removal of WTAP in this system seems to be sufficient to reduce these interactions and the concomitant m<sup>6</sup>A methylation of ISGs. The conclusion that the phosphorylation state of WTAP is important in this process is also quite well supported.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The evidence that the above mechanism is fundamentally driven by different phase-separated pools of WTAP (regulated by its phosphorylation state) is weaker. These experiments rely relatively heavily on the treatment of cells with 1,6-hexanediol, which has been shown to have some off-target effects on phosphatases and kinases (PMID 33814344).</p><p>Given that the model invoked in this study depends on the phosphorylation (or lack thereof) of WTAP, this is a particularly relevant concern.</p></disp-quote><p>We are grateful for the reviewer’s positive comment and constructive feedback. 1,6-hexanediol (hex) was considered an inhibitor of hydrophobic interaction, thereby capable of dissolving protein phase separation condensates. Hex (5%-10% w/v) was still widely used to explore the phase separation characteristic and function on various protein, including some phosphorylated proteins such as pHSF1, or kinases such as NEMO1-3. Since hydrophobic interactions involved in various types of protein-protein interaction, the off-target effects of hex were inevitable. It has been reported that hex impaired RNA polymerase II CTD-specific phosphatase and kinase activity at 5% concentration4, which led to the reviewer’s concern. In response to this concern, we investigated the phosphorylation level of WTAP under hex concentration gradient treatment. Surprisingly, we found that both 2% and 5% hex maintained the PPP4c-mediated dephosphorylation level of WTAP but still led to the dissolution of WTAP LLPS condensates (Figure 5-figure supplement 1H; Author response image 1), indicating that hex dispersed WTAP phase separation in a phosphorylation-independent manner. Consistent with our findings, Ge et al. used 10% hex to dissolve WTAP phase separation condensates5. Additionally, we found the phosphorylation level of STAT1 was not affected by both 2% and 5% hex, revealing the off-target and impairment function of hex on kinases or phosphatases might not be universal (Figure 5-figure supplement 1H). Collectively, since the 5% hex we used did not influence the de-phosphorylation event of WTAP, function of WTAP LLPS mediating interaction between methylation complex and STAT1 revealed by our results was independent from its phosphorylation status.</p><fig id="sa4fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>mCherry-WTAP-rescued HeLa cells were treated with 10 ng/mL IFN-β together with or without 2% or 5% hex and 20 μg/mL digitonin for 1 hr or left untreated.</title><p>Phase separation of mCherry-WTAP was observed through confocal microscopy.

IDR contains more charged and polar amino acids to present multiple weakly interacting elements, while lacking hydrophobic amino acids to show flexible conformations6. In our study, we used PLAAC websites (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://plaac.wi.mit.edu/">http://plaac.wi.mit.edu/</ext-link>) to predict IDR domain of WTAP, and a fragment (234-249 amino acids) was predicted as prion-like domain (PLD). However, deletion of this fragment failed to abolish the phase separation properties of WTAP, which might be the main confusion to reviewers. To explain this issue, we checked the WTAP structure (within part of MTC complex) from protein data bank (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.rcsb.org/structure/7VF2">https://www.rcsb.org/structure/7VF2</ext-link>) and found that the prediction of IDR has been renewed due to the update of different algorithm. IDR of WTAP expanded to 245-396 amino acids, encompassing the entire CTD region. Our results demonstrate that the CTD was critical for WTAP LLPS, as CTD deficiency significantly inhibited the formation of liquid condensates both in vitro and in cells. Also, phosphorylation sites on CTD were important for the phase transition of WTAP. These observations highlight the phosphorylation status on CTD region as a key driving force of phase separation, consistent with the established role of IDR in regulating LLPS. We have revised our description on WTAP IDR in our article following the reviewers’ suggestion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Taking all the data together, it is also not clear to me that one has to invoke phase separation in the proposed mechanism.</p></disp-quote><p>In this article, we observed that WTAP underwent phase transition during virus infection and IFN-β treatment, and proposed a novel mechanism whereby post translational modification (PTM)-driven WTAP LLPS was required for the m<sup>6</sup>A modification of ISG mRNAs. To verify the hypothesis, we first demonstrated the relationship between PTM and phase separation of WTAP. We constructed WTAP 5ST-D and 5ST-A mutant to mimic WTAP phosphorylation and dephosphorylation status respectively, and figured out that dephosphorylated WTAP underwent LLPS. We also found that PPP4 was the main phosphatase to regulate WTAP dephosphorylation. To further investigation, we introduced the potent PPP4 inhibitor, fostriecin. Consistent with our findings in PPP4 deficient model, fostriecin treatment significantly inhibited the IFN-β-induced dephosphorylation of WTAP and disrupted its LLPS condensates, indicating that PPP4 was the key phosphatase recruited by IFN-β to regulate WTAP, confirming that PTM governs WTAP LLPS dynamics (Figure 2-figure supplement 1C and H). Furthermore, fostriecin-induced impairment of WTAP phosphorylation and phase separation correlated with reduced m<sup>6</sup>A modification level and elevated ISGs expression level (Figure 4C and Figure 4-figure supplement 1E). These findings together emphasized that dephosphorylation is required for WTAP LLPS.</p><p>As for the function of WTAP LLPS, we assumed that WTAP might undergo LLPS to sequester STAT1 together with m<sup>6</sup>A methyltransferase complex (MTC) for mediating m<sup>6</sup>A deposition on ISG mRNAs co-transcriptionally under IFN-β stimulation. Given that hex dissolved WTAP LLPS condensates without affecting dephosphorylation status (Figure 5-figure supplement 1H; Author response image 1), various experiments we performed previously actually confirmed the critical role of WTAP LLPS during m<sup>6</sup>A modification (Figure 4A), as well as the mechanism that WTAP phase separation enhanced the interaction between MTC and STAT1 (Figure 5E-F). Subsequent to reviewer’s comments, more experiments were conducted for further validation. We found the WTAP liquid condensates formed by wild type (WT) WTAP or WTAP 5ST-A mutant (which mimics dephosphorylated-WTAP) could be dissembled by hex, which also led to the impairment of the interaction between STAT1, METTL3 and WTAP (Figure 5-figure supplement 1E). In addition, in vitro experiments demonstrated that hex treatment significantly disrupted the interaction between recombinant GFP-STAT1 and mCherry-WTAP which expressed in the <italic>E. coli</italic> system (Figure 5F and Figure 5-figure supplement 1G). Notably, this prokaryotic expression system lacks endogenous phosphorylation machinery, resulting in non-phosphorylated mCherry-WTAP. For further validation, we performed the interaction of WTAP WT or 5ST-A with the promoter regions of ISG as well as the m<sup>6</sup>A modification of ISG mRNAs were attenuated by WTAP LLPS dissolution (Figure 4E and Figure 6E). These findings together revealed that WTAP LLPS were the critical mediators of the STAT1-MTC interactions, ISG promoter regions binding and the co-transcription m<sup>6</sup>A modification.</p><p>Collectively, our results demonstrated that IFN-β treatment recruited PPP4c to dephosphorylate WTAP, thereby driving the formation of WTAP liquid condensates which were essential for facilitating STAT1-MTC interaction and m<sup>6</sup>A deposition, subsequently mediated ISG expression. Since we revealed a strong association between PTM-regulated WTAP phase transition and its m<sup>6</sup>A modification function, WTAP LLPS was a novel and functionally distinct mechanism that must be reckoned with in this study.</p><fig id="sa4fig2" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>Wild type (WT) WTAP or 5ST-A mutant-rescued <italic>WTAP</italic><sup>sgRNA</sup> THP-1-derived macrophages are stimulated with or without with 10 ng/mL IFN-β together followed by 2% or 5% 1,6-hexanediol (hex) and 20 μg/mL digitonin for 1 hr or left untreated.</title><p>Antibody and imaged using confocal microscope.

They find that viral infection or IFNb stimulation induces the transition of WTAP from aggregates to liquid droplets through dephosphorylation by PPP4. This process affects the m<sup>6</sup>A modification levels of ISG mRNAs and modulates their stability. In addition, the WTAP droplets interact with the transcription factor STAT1 to recruit the methyltransferase complex to ISG promoters and enhance m<sup>6</sup>A modification during transcription. The investigation dives into a previously unexplored area of how viral infection or IFNb stimulation affects m<sup>6</sup>A modification on ISGs. The observation that WTAP undergoes a phase transition is significant in our understanding of the mechanisms underlying m<sup>6</sup>A's function in immunity. However, there are still key gaps that should be addressed to fully accept the model presented.</p><p>Major points:</p><p>(1) More detailed analyses on the effects of WTAP sgRNA on the m<sup>6</sup>A modification of ISGs:</p><p>a.

We have conducted the related analysis accordingly to present the m<sup>6</sup>A modification in ISGs in our model as reviewers suggested. Our results showed that about 64.29% of core ISGs were m<sup>6</sup>A modified under IFN-β stimulation (Figure 3-figure supplement 1B; Figure 3G), which was consistent with the similar percentage in previous studies[7,8]. The m<sup>6</sup>A distribution of the ISGs transcripts including <italic>IFIT1</italic>, <italic>IFIT2</italic>, <italic>OAS1</italic> and <italic>OAS2</italic> was validated (Figure 3-figure supplement 1H).</p><p>Generally, m<sup>6</sup>A deposition preferentially located in the vicinity of stop codon, while m<sup>6</sup>A modification was highly dynamic under different cellular condition. However, we compared the topology of m<sup>6</sup>A deposition of ISGs with non-ISGs, and found that m<sup>6</sup>A modification of ISG mRNAs showed higher preference of coding sequences (CDS) localization compared to global m<sup>6</sup>A deposition (Figure 3H). Similarly, various researches uncovered the m<sup>6</sup>A deposition regulated by co-transcriptionally m<sup>6</sup>A modification preferred to locate in the CDS [9-11]. Since our results of m<sup>6</sup>A modification distribution of ISGs was consistent with the co-transcriptional m<sup>6</sup>A modification characteristics, we believed that our hypothesis and results were correlated and consistent.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Since a key part of the model includes the cytosol-localized STAT1 protein undergoing phosphorylation to translocate to the nucleus to mediate gene expression, the authors should focus on the interaction between phosphorylated STAT1 and WTAP in Figure 4, rather than the unphosphorylated STAT1. Only phosphorylated STAT1 localizes to the nucleus, so the presence of pSTAT1 in the immunoprecipitate is critical for establishing a functional link between STAT1 activation and its interaction with WTAP.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the constructive comments. As we showed in Figure 4, we found the enhanced interaction between phase-separated WTAP and the nuclear-translocated STAT1 which were phosphorylated under IFN-β stimulation, indicating the importance of phosphorylation of STAT1. We repeated the immunoprecipitation experiments to clarify the function of pSTAT1 in WTAP interaction. Our results showed that IFN-β stimulation induced the interaction of WTAP with both pSTAT1 and STAT1 (Figure 5-figure supplement 1C), indicating that most of the WTAP-associated STAT1 was phosphorylated. Taken together, our data proved that LLPS WTAP bound with nuclear-translocated pSTAT1 under IFN-β stimulation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) The authors should include pSTAT1 ChIP-seq and WTAP ChIP-seq on IFNb-treated samples in Figure 5 to allow for a comprehensive and unbiased genomic analysis for comparing the overlaps of peaks from both ChIP-seq datasets. These results should further support their hypothesis that WTAP interacts with pSTAT1 to enhance m<sup>6</sup>A modifications on ISGs.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for raising this thoughtful comment. In this study, MeRIP-seq and RNA-seq along with immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence experiments supported that phase transition of WTAP enhanced its interaction to pSTAT1, thus mediating ISGs m<sup>6</sup>A modification and expression by enhancing its interaction with nuclear-translocated pSTAT1 during virus infection and IFN-β stimulation. However, how WTAP-mediated m<sup>6</sup>A modification was related to STAT1-mediated transcription remained unclear. Several researches have revealed the recruitment of m<sup>6</sup>A methyltransferase complex (MTC) to transcription start sites (TSS) of coding genes and R-loop structure by interacting with transcription factors STAT5B, SMAD2/3, DNA helicase DDX21, indicating the engagement of MTC mediated m<sup>6</sup>A modification on nascent transcripts at the very beginning of transcription [11-13]. These researches inspired us that phase-separated WTAP could be recruited to the ISG promoter regions via interacting with nuclear-translocated pSTAT1. To validate this mechanism, we have conducted ChIP-qPCR experiments targeting STAT1 and WTAP, revealed that IFN-β induced the comparable recruitment dynamics of both STAT1 and WTAP to ISG promoter regions (Figure 6A-B). Notably, STAT1 deficiency significantly abolished the bindings between WTAP and ISG promoter regions (Figure 6C). These findings established nuclear-translocated STAT1-dependent recruitment of phase separated WTAP and ISG promoter region, substantiated our hypothesis within the current study. We totally agree that ChIP-seq data will be more supportive to explore the mechanism in depth. We will continuously focus on the whole genome chromatin distribution of WTAP and explore more functional effect of transcriptional factor-dependent WTAP-promoter regions interaction in the future.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor points:</p><p>(1) Since IFNb is primarily known for modulating biological processes through gene transcription, it would be informative if the authors discussed the mechanism of how IFNb would induce the interaction between WTAP and PPP4.</p></disp-quote><p>Protein phosphatase 4 (PPP4) is a multi-subunit serine/threonine phosphatase complex that participates in diverse biologic process, including DDR, cell cycle progression, and apoptosis[14]. Several signaling pathway such as NF-κB and mTOR signaling, can be regulated by PPP4. Previous research showed that deficiency of PPP4 enhanced IFN-β downstream signaling and ISGs expression, which was consistent with our findings that knockdown of PPP4C impaired WTAP-mediated m<sup>6</sup>A modification, enhanced the ISGs expression[15,16]. Since there was no significant enhancement in PPP4 expression level during 0-3 hours of IFN-β stimulation in our results, we explored the PTM that may influence the protein-protein interaction, such as ubiquitination. Intriguingly, we found the ubiquitination level of PPP4 was enhanced after IFN-β stimulation, which may affect the interaction between PPP4 and WTAP (Author response image 3). Further investigation between PPP4 and WTAP will be conducted in our future study.</p><fig id="sa4fig3" position="float"><label>Author response image 3.</label><caption><title>HEK 293T transfected with HA-ubiquitin (HA-Ub) and Flag-PPP4 were treated with 10 ng/mL IFN-β or left untreated.</title><p>Whole cell lysate (WCL) was collected and immunoprecipitation (IP) experiment using anti-Flag antibody was performed, followed by immunoblot.

The authors do not discuss the contribution of WTAP expression levels to the phase separation event observed upon IFN treatment. Similarly, METTL3 and METTL14, as well as other proteins of the MTC are upregulated upon IFN treatment. How does the MTC protein concentration contribute to the observed phase separation event?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank reviewer for pointing out the importance of the concentration dependent phase transition. Previously, Ge et al. discovered that expression level of WTAP was up-regulated during LPS stimulation, thereby promoting WTAP phase separation ability and m<sup>6</sup>A modification, indicating that WTAP concentration indeed affects the phase separation event. In our article, we have generated the phase diagram with different concentration of recombinant mCherry-WTAP in vitro (Figure 1-figure supplement 1C). For in cells experiments, we constructed the TRE-mCherry-WTAP HeLa cells in which the expression of mCherry-WTAP was induced by doxycycline (Dox) in a dose-dependent manner (Author response image 5A). We detected the LLPS of mCherry-WTAP at different concentrations by increasing the doses of Dox, and found that WTAP automatically underwent LLPS only in an artificially high expression level (Author response image 5B). However, the cells we used to detect the WTAP phase separation in our article was mCherry-WTAP-rescued HeLa cells, in which mCherry-WTAP was introduced in <italic>WTAP</italic><sup>sgRNA</sup> HeLa cells to stably express mCherry-WTAP. We had adjusted and verified the mCherry-WTAP expression level precisely to make the protein abundance similar to endogenous WTAP in wild type (WT) HeLa cells (Author response image 5C). We also repeated the IFN-β stimulation experiments and found no significant increase of WTAP protein level (Figure 5-figure supplement 1A). These findings indicated the phase separation of WTAP in our article was not artificially induced due to the extremely high protein expression level.</p><p>MTC protein expression level was crucial for m<sup>6</sup>A modification during virus infection event. Rubio et al. and Winkler et al. revealed that WTAP, METTL3 and METTL14 were up-regulated after 24 hours of HCMV infection[8,17]. Recently, Ge et al. proposed that WTAP protein was degraded after 12 hours of VSV and HSV stimulation5,18. However, these studies only focused on the virus infection event, how the MTC protein expression change after direct IFN-β stimulation was still unclear. Our study investigated the transition change of WTAP under IFNβ stimulation in a short time, we detected the expression level of MTC proteins within 6 hours of IFN-β treatment, and found no significant enhancement of WTAP, METTL3 or METTL14 protein level and mRNA level (Figure 5-figure supplement 1B and Figure 5-figure supplement 1A;). Our in vitro experiments showed that introducing CFP-METTL3 protein have no significant influence on WTAP phase separation (Figure 4H). Additionally, we performed in cells experiments and found that increased expression of METTL3 had no effect on WTAP phase separation event (Author response image 5D). Taken together, WTAP phase separation can be promoted by dramatically increased concentration of WTAP both in vitro and in cells, but the phase separation of WTAP under IFN-β stimulation in our study was not related with the expression level of MTC proteins.</p><fig id="sa4fig5" position="float"><label>Author response image 5.</label><caption><p>(A) Immunoblot analysis of the expression of mCherry-WTAP in TRE-mCherry-WTAP HeLa cells treated with different doses of doxycycline (Dox).

Representative images of n=20 cells were shown. All error bars, mean values ± SD were determined by unpaired two-tailed Student’s t-test of n = 3 independent biological experiments in (A). For (A, C), similar results were obtained for three independent biological experiments.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-100601-sa4-fig5-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>How is PP4 related to the IFN signaling cascade?</p></disp-quote><p>Both reviewer #2 and reviewer #3 raised a similar point on the relationship between PPP4 and IFN signaling. In short, protein phosphatase 4 (PPP4) participates in diverse biologic process, including DDR, cell cycle progression and apoptosis14 and several signaling pathway. Previous research showed that deficiency of PPP4 enhanced IFN-β downstream signaling and ISGs expression, which was consistent with our findings that knockdown of PPP4C impaired WTAP-mediated m<sup>6</sup>A modification, and enhanced the ISGs expression[15,16]. Since there was no significant enhancement in PPP4C expression level during 0-3 hours of IFN-β stimulation in our results, we tried to explore the post-translation modification which may influence the protein-protein interaction, such as ubiquitination. Intriguingly, we found the ubiquitination level of PPP4 was enhanced after IFN-β stimulation, which may affect the interaction between PPP4 and WTAP (Author response image 4). Investigation between PPP4 and WTAP will be conducted in our further study (also see minor points 1 of reviewer#2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In general, it is very confusing to talk about WTAP KO as WTAPgRNA.</p></disp-quote><p>As we describe above, all <italic>WTAP</italic>-deficient THP-1 cells were generated using the CRISPR-Cas9 system with <italic>WTAP</italic>-specific sgRNA, and used bulk cells instead of the monoclonal knockout cell for further experiments.

As we showed in , Figure 5-figure supplement 1H; Author response image 1 along with the explanation above, 5% hex dispersed the phase separation condensates of WTAP without affecting its phosphorylation status, proving the interaction between STAT1 and methylation complex impaired by hex was depended on WTAP LLPS but not its phosphorylation status (Figure 5E-H). To further confirmed the recruitment of WTAP LLPS on ISG promoter region, we performed the immunoprecipitation and ChIP-qPCR experiments of wild type (WT) WTAP, 5ST-D and 5ST-A rescued THP-1 cells. Our results uncovered the interaction between de-phosphorylated-mimic WTAP mutant and STAT1, and its binding ability with ISG promoter regions were depleted by hex without affecting its phosphorylation status (Author response image 2, Figure 5-figure supplement 1 F, Figure 6E). Taken together, we identified the de-phosphorylation event that regulated phase transition of WTAP during IFN-β stimulation, and proposed that LLPS of WTAP mediated by dephosphorylation was the key mechanism to bind with STAT1 and mediate the m<sup>6</sup>A modification on ISG mRNAs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>The author order is different for the main text and the supplementary file.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing out this mistake.
