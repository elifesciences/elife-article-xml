Here, we addressed how physical and chemical DNA characteristics influence genome evolution in the plant pathogenic fungus <italic>Verticillium dahliae</italic>. We identified incomplete DNA methylation of repetitive elements, associated with specific genomic compartments originally defined as Lineage-Specific (LS) regions that contain genes involved in host adaptation. Further chromatin characterization revealed associations with features such as H3 Lys-27 methylated histones (H3K27me3) and accessible DNA. Machine learning trained on chromatin data identified twice as much LS DNA as previously recognized, which was validated through orthogonal analysis, and we propose to refer to this DNA as adaptive genomic regions.

While scientific understanding of genome biology continues to grow, significant efforts in the past decade have focused on sequencing new species and additional genotypes of those species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">David et al., 2019</xref>). However, there is a great need to decode the complex information stored in these genomes, to understand genomic responses over various time scales, and ultimately to more fully understand how genotypes lead to phenotypes. With the growing number of high-quality, highly contiguous genome assemblies it is possible to analyze genome organization into chromosomes at high resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Thomma et al., 2016</xref>). Present day genome organization reflects evolutionary solutions to the challenges of information processing and adaptation; a genome must faithfully pass vast amounts of information across cell cycles and reproduction, packaged into limited physical space, while achieving correct access to the information in response to developmental, environmental, or chemical signals. In addition, there needs to be appreciable stochastic genetic variation to ensure that phenotypic variation is present for unknown future events. Organisms undergoing mainly asexual reproduction face an additional evolutionary constraint as they must generate this genetic variation in the absence of meiotic recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Seidl and Thomma, 2014</xref>). Many economically important fungal plant pathogens are either asexual or undergo more frequent asexual reproduction compared to sexual reproduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Giraud et al., 2010</xref>). Interestingly, fungal pathogens are subject to additional evolutionary pressure from their hosts, as host-pathogen interactions create dynamical systems with shifting, yet near-constant selective pressure on the two genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Jones and Dangl, 2006</xref>). These attributes make plant-fungal interactions a particularly interesting system to study aspects of genome evolution and genome organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Raffaele and Kamoun, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Möller and Stukenbrock, 2017</xref>).</p><p>Plant invading microbes use effectors to suppress, avoid, or mitigate the plant immune system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Oliveira-Garcia and Valent, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cook et al., 2015</xref>). Plants in-turn use a variety of plasma-membrane-bound and cytoplasmic receptors to recognize invasion, through recognition of the effector or its biochemical activity, creating a strong selective pressure on the microbe to modify the effector or its function to alleviate recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Couto and Zipfel, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Liang and Zhou, 2018</xref>). The plant pathogenic fungus <italic>Verticillium dahliae</italic> causes vascular wilt diseases on hundreds of plant hosts. <italic>V. dahliae</italic> is presumed asexual and generates genomic diversity in the absence of sexual recombination through large-scale chromosome rearrangements and segmental duplications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Klosterman et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">de Jonge et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Faino et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Shi-Kunne et al., 2018</xref>). The regions undergoing such duplications and rearrangements are hypervariable between <italic>V. dahliae</italic> isolates, and consequently have been referred to as Lineage-Specific (LS) regions. These LS regions are often formally defined based on presence/absence variation (PAV) between strains of a species, and regions that are not designated LS are considered core. These LS regions are enriched for in planta expressed genes and harbor many effector genes contributing to host infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">de Jonge et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">de Jonge et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Kombrink et al., 2017</xref>). Similar non-random genomic arrangement of effectors have been reported across diverse plant pathogenic fungal and oomycete genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">de Jonge et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Ma et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Raffaele et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Rouxel et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Goodwin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Dutheil et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Tsushima et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Peng et al., 2019</xref>). One summary of these observations is referred to as the two-speed genome, in which repeat-rich regions harboring effectors evolve more rapidly than genes outside these regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Dong et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Previous research in various plant-associated fungi has established a link between posttranslational histone modifications and transcriptional regulation of adaptive trait genes. These genes include effectors that facilitate host infection and secondary metabolite (SM) clusters that code for genes that produce chemicals important for niche fitness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Macheleidt et al., 2016</xref>). By removing or reducing enzymes responsible for particular repressive histone modifications, such as di- and trimethylation of Lys9 and Lys27 residues of histone H3 (H3K9me2/3 and H3K27me2/3), a disproportionally high number of effector and SM cluster genes are derepressed, although a direct role of these marks in transcriptional control was not demonstrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Soyer et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Connolly et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Studt et al., 2016</xref>). However, evidence from the fungus <italic>Epichloë festucae</italic> that forms a mutualistic interaction with its grass host <italic>Lolium perenne</italic> indicates that direct transcriptional regulation through histone modification dynamics is possible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chujo and Scott, 2014</xref>). Although there are clear indications that the epigenome (i.e. heritable chemical modifications to DNA and histones not affecting the genetic sequence) plays a role in adaptive gene regulation, additional evidence is needed to fully understand this phenomenon.</p><p>Epigenetic modifications influence chromatin structure, defined as the DNA-RNA-protein interactions giving DNA physical structure in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Sexton et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Riddle et al., 2011</xref>). This physical structure affects how DNA is organized in the nucleus and DNA accessibility. Methylation of H3K9 and H3K27 are hallmarks of heterochromatin; DNA that is tightly compacted in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Rea et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cao et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Margueron and Reinberg, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Janssen et al., 2018</xref>). H3K9 methylation is not only associated with controlling constitutive heterochromatin, but also tightly linked with DNA cytosine methylation (mC), which serves as an epigenetic mark contributing to transcriptional silencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Tamaru and Selker, 2001</xref>). A single DNA methyltransferase gene, termed <italic>Dim2</italic>, performs cytosine DNA methylation in the saprophytic fungus <italic>Neurospora crassa</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Kouzminova and Selker, 2001</xref>). Histone methylation at H3K9 directs DNA methylation by DIM2 through another protein, termed heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1), which physically associates with both DIM2 and H3K9me3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Freitag et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Honda and Selker, 2008</xref>). Some fungi possess a unique pathway to limit the expansion of repetitive DNA such as transposable elements (TEs) through repeat-induced point mutation (RIP), a mechanism that specifically mutates repetitive DNA in the genome during meiosis and induces heterochromatin formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Freitag et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Lewis et al., 2009</xref>). The mutations occur at methylated cytosines resulting in conversion to thymine (C to T mutation) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Selker et al., 2003</xref>). H3K27 methylation is associated with heterochromatin that is thought to be more flexible in its chromatin status and exist as bivalent chromatin that may be either transcriptionally repressed or active depending on developmental stage or environmental cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ernst et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bemer and Grossniklaus, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Gaydos et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dattani et al., 2018</xref>). The deposition of H3K27me3 is controlled by a histone methyltransferase that is a member of a complex of proteins termed Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2), with orthologs of the core machinery present across many eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Margueron and Reinberg, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Freitag, 2017</xref>).</p><p>In addition to the role of heterochromatin in transcriptional regulation in filamentous fungi, epigenetic marks contributing to heterochromatin also influence genome organization, and may in tun influence evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Seidl et al., 2016</xref>). For example, H3K9me2/3 is required in <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> and <italic>N. crassa</italic> to form functional centromeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Folco et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Smith et al., 2011</xref>), and H3K9me2/3 is enriched at centromeres of <italic>Cryptococcus neoformans</italic>, <italic>Fusarium graminearum</italic>, and <italic>V. dahliae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Dumesic et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Smith et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Seidl et al., 2020</xref>). Interestingly, centromeres are diverse genomic regions across fungi, and likely contribute to karyotype variation of related species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Seidl et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Sankaranarayanan et al., 2020</xref>). Heterochromatin also influences the physical arrangement of DNA in the nucleus, with strong inter- and intra-heterochromatin DNA-DNA interactions reported in <italic>N. crassa</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Galazka et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Klocko et al., 2016</xref>). Recent experimental evidence in <italic>Zymoseptoria tritici</italic>, a fungal pathogen of wheat, indicates that another histone modification associated with heterochromatin, H3K27me3, promotes genomic instability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Möller et al., 2019</xref>). In the oomycete plant pathogens <italic>Phytophthora infestans</italic> and <italic>Phytophthora sojae</italic> a clear association exists between gene-sparse and transposon-rich regions of the genome and the occurrence of adenine N6-methylation (6mA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chen et al., 2018</xref>). Collectively, these examples point toward unexplained connections between the epigenome, genome organization, and genomic variability, potentially with adaptive consequences. To examine the hypothesis that epigenetic modifications influence the adaptive LS regions of <italic>V. dahliae</italic>, we performed a series of genetic, genomic, and machine learning analyses to characterize these regions in greater detail.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>DNA cytosine methylation occurs at TEs</title><p>To understand the role of DNA methylation in <italic>V. dahliae</italic>, whole-genome bisulfite sequencing, in which unmethylated cytosine bases are converted to uracil while methylated cytosines remain unchanged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Clark et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Lister and Ecker, 2009</xref>), was performed in the wild-type and a heterochromatin protein one deletion mutant (Δ<italic>hp1</italic>). The overall level of DNA methylation in <italic>V. dahliae</italic> is low, with an average weighted methylation percentage (calculated as the number of reads supporting methylation over the number of cytosines sequenced) at CG dinucleotides of 0.4% (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). The fractional CG methylation level (calculated as the number of cytosine positions with a methylated read over all cytosine positions) is higher, averaged to 9.7% over 10 kb windows. Weighted and fractional cytosine methylation (mC) levels are statistically significantly higher in the WT compared to the Δ<italic>hp1</italic> mutant for all cytosine contexts (Mann-Whitney U-test and Holm correction, p-value&lt;2.2e-16, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). This result is consistent with the requirement of HP1 for DNA methylation in <italic>N. crassa</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Freitag et al., 2004</xref>). To understand DNA methylation in the context of the functional genome, DNA methylation was analyzed over genes, promoters, and TE. Despite statistically significant differences between WT and Δ<italic>hp1</italic> for gene and promoter methylation, the bisulfite sequencing data shows virtually no DNA methylation at these two features (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, Mann-Whitney U-test and Holm correction, p-values listed with figure). We attribute the difference to a marginal set of elements having a real difference between the genotypes, but the biological significance is likely negligible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). In contrast, there is a higher degree of methylation at TEs, and weighted mCG is five times higher in the wild-type versus Δ<italic>hp1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, bottom panel). To support this, 31% (697/2227) of the TEs in the wild-type strain have a weighted mCG value greater than or equal to the mean weighted CG methylation level (0.015), while this number is 1% (33/2227) in Δ<italic>hp1</italic>. In contrast, 0% of wild-type (1/11430) and Δ<italic>hp1</italic> (0/11430) genes have a weighted mCG value equal to this level. Notably, the Δ<italic>hp1</italic> strain displays a reduced growth rate, altered colony morphology, reduced spore production, and reduced virulence, likely attributable to the pleiotropic effects of genome-wide heterochromatin alterations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Kramer et al., 2020</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>DNA methylation is only present at transposable elements, but not at those present in Lineage-Specific (LS) regions.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Violin plot of the distribution of DNA methylation levels quantified as weighted methylation over genes, promoters, and transposable elements (TEs).

These plots clearly show that DNA methylation is not continuously present across the <italic>V. dahliae</italic> genome, and DNA methylation is significantly different between wild-type and Δ<italic>hp1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>). Furthermore, regions in the genome with higher densities of TEs and lower gene numbers have higher levels of DNA methylation, consistent with the global DNA methylation summary (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>). Interestingly, these results show that while DNA methylation is only present at TEs, not all TEs are methylated, a phenomenon that was previously described as ‘non-exhaustive’ DNA methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Montanini et al., 2014</xref>). To further understand this phenomenon, we sought to identify discriminating genomic features that could account for some TEs not being methylated. The whole-chromosome methylation data suggested a lack of DNA methylation at previously identified LS regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, gray windows). These LS regions were previously detailed for <italic>V. dahliae,</italic> and are characterized as regions that are highly variable between isolates of the species, are enriched for actively transcribed TEs, and contain an increased proportion of genes involved in host virulence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Klosterman et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">de Jonge et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Faino et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, we tested if DNA sequences at LS regions are less frequently methylated by comparing weighted mCG levels in 10 kb bins containing at least one TE for core versus LS regions. This analysis showed significantly more DNA methylation for core bins (Mann-Whitney U-test and Holm correction, p-value=2.9e-9, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), which cannot be accounted for by a simple difference in the number of TEs in the core and LS regions analyzed (Mann-Whitney U-test and Holm correction, p-value=0.8, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Higher CG methylation levels also hold true when analyzed at the level of individual TE elements (Mann-Whitney U-test and Holm correction, p-value=1.3e-13, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Analyzing the transcriptional impact of <italic>Δhp1</italic> on in vitro grown cultures identified 1522 genes that were expressed significantly higher in <italic>Δhp1</italic> compared to wild-type (log2 fold-change &gt;1 and adjusted p-value&lt;0.01, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A</xref>). Of the genes more highly expressed in <italic>Δhp1</italic>, those located in LS regions showed a greater transcriptional increase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3B</xref>). However, as we have shown that loss of DNA methylation alone does not result in altered gene transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Kramer et al., 2020</xref>), the differential gene expression caused by <italic>HP1</italic> mutation is likely caused by additional effects on chromatin and DNA compaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Jamieson et al., 2016</xref>). Collectively, these analyses demonstrate that DNA methylation occurs almost exclusively at TEs and, importantly, that not all TEs are methylated. This observation can in part be explained by mCG differences for TEs in the core versus LS regions.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>TE classes have distinct genomic and epigenomic profiles</title><p>To understand the functional status of the various TEs in the genome, DNA-histone modification location data were collected using chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq) against H3K9me3 and H3K27me3, which allows for the identification of DNA interacting with these modified histones. Characteristics of TE sequence, such as GC percentage, composite RIP index (CRI), and TE age, estimated as the Jukes-Cantor distance to the consensus sequence of the specific TE family, were calculated (see Materials and methods). To further classify genomic regions as eu- or heterochromatic, we performed an assay for transposase accessible chromatin and sequencing (ATAC-seq) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Buenrostro et al., 2013</xref>). This method uses a TN5 transposase to restrict physically accessible DNA in the nucleus and tags the DNA ends with oligonucleotides for downstream sequencing. Transcriptional activity was assayed using RNA-sequencing. To analyze all of these TE characteristics (variables) at once, dimensional reduction with principal component analysis (PCA) was employed, which facilitates data interpretation on two-dimensions to identify important variables and their relationships within large datasets. The individual TEs were grouped into four broad classes (Type I DNA elements and Type II LTR, LINEs, and Unspecified elements) and analyzed for each measured variable (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>- table 1). The first dimension of PCA shows the largest separation of the data points and variables, and largely separates the data based on euchromatin versus heterochromatin features (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, PC1). This is seen by the variables ATAC-seq, %GC, RNA-sequencing, H3K9me3 ChIP, CRI, and DNA methylation (mCG) being furthest separated along the x-axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Open chromatin features such as higher ATAC-seq, %GC, and transcriptional activity are positive on the x-axis, with small angles between the vectors, indicating correlation among those variables. Conversely, features associated with heterochromatin, such as H3K9me3 association, DNA methylation and indication of RIP (CRI) are all negative on the x-axis, and the position of their vectors indicates correlation among these variables, and negative correlation to the euchromatin features (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The second axis discriminates elements based on their H3K27me3 profile and sequence characteristics such as Jukes Cantor (TE age), Identity and Length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Regarding the TE classifications, there is a stronger association for the LTR and Unspecified elements with the heterochromatin features (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, gray and red ellipse extending along negative x-axis). Collectively, this multivariate description of TEs identifies those that are more transcribed and open as having lower association with H3K9me3, mCG, and RIP mutation. There are statistically significant differences between the TE types for each of these variables (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>- table 2, Dunns test with Benjamini-Hochberg testing correction), and the LTR elements have the highest levels of H3K9me3 and mCG, along with the highest CRI values and lowest %GC, consistent with the mechanistic link between the four variables (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Interestingly, a bimodal distribution occurs for %GC and CRI within the LTR and Unspecified elements, indicating that some of the LTR elements have undergone RIP and are heterochromatic, while other elements have not been subject to this mechanism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). This delineation occurs for the Unspecified and LTR elements with a %GC sequence content less than approximately 40%, which have positive CRI values and high H3K9me3 signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). A similar distinction is seen with ATAC-seq data that show a clear break around 40% GC content, and elements below this have lower ATAC-seq signal and higher H3K9me3 signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). These trends are not observed for the LINE and DNA elements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). The TEs were further divided into sub-classes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>- table 3), we do not detect an obvious difference to explain these data. For instance, while there is a significant difference between the nine sub-classes for %GC and CRI (Kruskal-Wallis statistic = 382.4, p-value=1.07e-77 %GC; Kruskal-Wallis statistic = 259.41, p-value=1.74e-51 CRI) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>- table 4) the two LTR subclasses (Copia and Gypsy) do not have statistically different means (Conovers test and BH correction, p-value=1 %GC; p-value=0.19 CRI) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>, table 5). The two LTR subclasses are significantly different for their association with H3K9me3 and H3K27me3 (Conover test and BH correction, p-value=1.03e-06 H3K9me3; p-value=1.08e-10 H3K27me3) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>- table 5), but the subclasses of LTRs both occur in the two bimodal states, and cannot account for the difference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). It is not possible to distinguish the unspecified elements into reliable subclasses. These results suggest that the most prominent TE classes in the genome, LTR and Unspecified elements, exist in two distinct chromatin states, which we cannot easily distinguish through sequences of sub-classes.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Individual TE families have distinct epigenetic and physical compaction profiles.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Principle component analysis for 14 variables measured for each individual transposable element (TE).

This is apparent for the LS regions that appear to have increased H3K27me3 signal, lack H3K9me3 and have an intermediate level of DNA accessibility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, regions marked by gray boxes). PCA was again employed to combine the variables into a single analysis, with the first dimension explaining nearly 60% of the variation in the data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). The first dimension largely captures the variables describing euchromatin versus heterochromatin, such that ATAC-seq and %GC are furthest separated on the x-axis from H3K9me3, DNA methylation and TE density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Interestingly, the DNA segments classified as core are mostly separated across the first dimension (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). The second and third dimensions of the PCA explained a similar amount of variation in the data; 14.4% and 10.7%, respectively. Data from the RNA-seq experiment contributed nearly all the information to the second dimension, while the H3K27me3 ChIP-seq data contributed most of the information in the third dimension (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>- table 6). Interestingly, when this third dimension is considered, we observe a separation of the core from the LS regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>,y-axis). This observation suggests that LS regions are more discernable from the core based on variation for H3K27me3, and less by variation for DNA openness, and DNA or H3K9 methylation.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Epigenome and physical DNA characteristics collectively define core and LS regions.</title><p>(<bold>A and B</bold>) Whole chromosomes plots showing TE and gene counts over 10 kb genomic windows, blue and red heatmaps respectively.

Four supervised machine learning algorithms were used to train (i.e. learn) on 80% of the data (2890 regions) using a 10-fold cross validation repeated three times, while the remaining 20% (721 regions) were used to test the model (i.e. predict). Repeated cross-validation and parameter tuning identified the best model parameters based on accuracy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Assessing the classifier’s performance using area under the receiver operating characteristic (auROC) curve suggested excellent results ranging from 0.93 to 0.95 (value of 1 is perfect prediction) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). While auROC is the <italic>de facto</italic> standard for machine learning performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bradley, 1997</xref>), it is not appropriate for assessing predictive performance of binary classification problems when the two classes are heavily skewed as it overestimates performance due to the high number of true negatives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Davis and Goadrich, 2006</xref>). This is the case for our analysis in which the test set (721 regions) contains only 33 of the known LS regions (4.6%). To more accurately assess model performance, precision-recall curves were employed as these do not use true negatives, and are therefore less influenced by skewed binary classifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Saito and Rehmsmeier, 2015</xref>).

However, subsequently we were interested to explore the relatively large number of false positives (i.e. regions classified as LS by the ML analysis that were previously classified as core). Since the original classification of core and LS in <italic>V. dahliae</italic> was based on presence/absence variation of only a limited set of strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">de Jonge et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Faino et al., 2016</xref>), we reasoned it was possible that the false positives could in fact be genuine LS regions that were originally missed. Alternatively, the false positive regions may be errors by the ML models, and therefore not genuine LS regions.</p><p>The two best models from the initial testing, GBM and RF, were used to further understand the nature of the false positives. The GBM and RF models predicted a total of 96 and 81 regions as LS, respectively, suggesting there could be two to three times more LS DNA than previously identified. We re-ran the GBM and RF algorithms on 15 new training-test splits, independently training and predicting on each set (see Materials and methods for details). This approach nearly saturated the genome, providing multiple predictions per window and only 124 of the 3611 regions were missed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>).

An additional 41 regions were classified LS using a conservative joining step in which a single predicted core region was called LS if it was flanked by LS predictions on both sides (see Materials and methods). LS regions that were consecutive or within 20 kb of each other were concatenated to form longer LS segments, resulting in a total of 91 LS regions comprised of 3.33 Mb of DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). The original LS classification liberally merged LS regions to form four main regions and an additional four smaller regions, altogether totaling 8 LS regions and 1.82 Mb of DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Faino et al., 2016</xref>). Comparing the new consensus LS classification with the original classification, we find the new LS regions have a shorter, but not statistically significantly different, mean length (mean length = 36578 bp new LS, mean length = 226898 bp old LS, Mann-Whitney U-test, Holm adjusted p-value=0.93) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4</xref>), but the total amount of DNA classified as LS has increased nearly two times. Also, the newly defined set of LS regions appears to more clearly delineate the LS and core regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s5">Figure 6—figure supplement 5</xref>). That is, using the new core and LS classification, the separation between core and LS becomes more distinct. The newly described LS regions go beyond the original definition of LS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Klosterman et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">de Jonge et al., 2013</xref>), and as such, we propose to refer to the newly defined LS regions as ‘adaptive genomic regions’.</p><p>Under the hypothesis that the newly identified classifications from ML were not errors, but represented bona fide LS regions, we expect the new classifications to maintain distinct characteristics between LS and core regions. Namely, LS regions having extensive sequence variability between <italic>V. dahliae</italic> strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Klosterman et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Faino et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">de Jonge et al., 2012</xref>), and they are enriched for in planta induced genes, and genes that are known or presumed to be involved in host infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">de Jonge et al., 2013</xref>). To this end, we analyzed PAV and performed genome-wide enrichment analyses for in planta-induced genes, for genes coding secreted proteins, and for effector genes in old and new LS regions. To analyze PAV, we summarized missing DNA segments, termed absence counts, from 42 <italic>V. dahliae</italic> strains based on whole-genome sequencing (see Materials and methods for details). The original LS classification was defined by PAV, and thus we anticipated that the updated LS classification, if valid, should still reflect higher variability for LS regions between <italic>V. dahliae</italic> strains. The analysis showed that the majority (82.6%) of 100 bp windows classified as core were present in all 42 strains, and the distribution of absence counts suggested low variation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>, mean absence count = 2.5). In contrast, only 37.3% of LS classified regions were present in all 42 strains, and had a significantly higher mean absence count of 12.3 (Wilcoxon rank sum, p&lt;2.2e-16) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). These results help validate our approach by showing the PAV disparity between LS and core elements is readily observed in this set of 42 strains. We assessed the absence counts for TEs and genes to understand what functional elements account for the differences between the LS and core. This analysis showed that the absence counts for TEs was higher than for an average 100 bp window, but there is no difference for the distribution of TE absence counts between those classified as LS versus core (Wilcoxon rank sum, p=0.99) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E,F</xref>). Interestingly, this was not the case for genes, where the majority (64.4%) of core classified genes were present in all 42 strains, while only 43.1% of LS classified genes were present in all strains (Wilcoxon rank sum, p&lt;2.2e-16; core mean absence count of 0.6 and LS mean of 10.3) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G,H</xref>). These results suggest that TEs are generally variable between strains regardless of their genomic location, but the likelihood of a gene being absent varies significantly based on its location in a core or LS region. Analyzing genes based on functional categories showed that the number of in planta-induced genes in LS regions doubled from the old to new classification, and while these genes were overrepresented in the old designations (<italic>X<sup>2</sup></italic> = 9.94, p=0.002), this overrepresentation was even more pronounced for the new LS regions (<italic>X<sup>2</sup></italic> = 29.96, p&lt;0.000001) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>- table 11). As expected, we found that in planta induction for LS genes was significantly higher than for core genes (Mann-Whitney U-test, p-value=1.34e-50) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I</xref>). Even though effectors were not overrepresented in the old LS classification (<italic>X<sup>2</sup> ~</italic>0, p=1), they were present in new LS regions far greater than by chance, increasing 3.5 times compared to the old classification (<italic>X<sup>2</sup></italic> = 11.18, p=0.0008) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>- table 12). The largest change was observed for genes coding proteins with secretion signals. Using the old classification, the LS regions were actually significantly underrepresented for genes coding secreted proteins (<italic>X<sup>2</sup></italic> = 27.05, p&lt;0.000001). This result could have a number of explanations, but under the assumption that LS regions contain a significant portion of genes involved in inter-species interactions, this analysis suggests that the old classification was missing important genes. Indeed, while the new LS classification approximately doubled the number of genes designated as LS (494 to 998), the number of LS genes with secretion signals increased 5-fold (20 to 109) (<italic>X<sup>2</sup></italic> = 3.63, p=0.05) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>- table 13).</p><p>Collectively, these analyses suggest that ML algorithms can be used to predict new LS regions based on epigenetic and physical DNA accessibility data. The identification of potentially new LS regions missed in the original classification provides new avenues to identify proteins important for host infection and adaptation. Our predictions were validated by showing enrichment for functional categories of genes known to be important for infection and host adaptation. Our results further show that the expanded classifications represent regions of the genome that are more variable across strains of the species and uncover the new finding that LS genes in particular experience greater PAV in <italic>V. dahliae</italic>. These results support that genome structure is influencing genome function and demonstrates a ML approach for predictive biology that advances our understanding of genome biology.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Unsupervised genome clustering using chromatin data supports functional differences for core and LS classification</title><p>Using the described supervised learning approach, we were able to identify new regions of the genome as LS, and subsequently validated that these new regions fit the characteristics of LS function. To further confirm these results and define the functional genome, uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">McInnes et al., 2018a</xref>) was employed for dimensional reduction of TEs and genes based on transcriptional, chromatin and DNA openness data. The significance of this alternative approach is that it is unsupervised, and does not rely on, or is influenced by, prior LS and core classifications. Under the hypothesis that genome structure influences genome function, a prediction is that LS and core classification (evolutionary function) should show a non-random spatial association when layered on-top of the UMAP clustering (genome structure and function data). This approach generated three distinct UMAP groups for TEs, which we termed Group1, 2 and 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). When the LS and core classification were applied to the UMAP groups, Group1 and Group2 displayed significant non-random associations of core- and LS-designated elements respectively (x-axis p-value=1.77e-38 and y-axis p-value=9.0e-80, Mann-Whitney U test) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Additionally, the core and LS elements were enriched in Group1 and Group2, respectively, (<italic>X<sup>2</sup></italic> = 348.84, p=1.78e-76) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>- table 14). To understand the UMAP groups, each genomic variable used for UMAP was summarized across the three groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). The TEs in Group1 have the lowest GC content, transcriptional activity, and DNA openness, along with the highest CRI, H3K9me3 signal, and DNA methylation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>- table 15, Kruskal-Wallis test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>, Conover test with Holm correction). Based on these characteristics, we conclude that Group1 TE elements from UMAP are largely heterochromatic. The TE elements in Group2 and Group3 are more similar to one another based on the per-variable analysis, although many statistically significantly differences exist (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). These findings show that unsupervised genomic clustering on functional and structural data can recapitulate a large part of our previously defined core and LS regions. We interpret this data as supporting a link between genome organization on a physical level (i.e. epigenetics and DNA accessibility), genome function (i.e. transcriptional activity), and genome adaptation to the environment (i.e. LS and core regions). Interestingly, while there was no difference in PAV for TE elements classified as core and LS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>), we did find significant PAV differences for the three UMAP groups (Kruskal-Wallis H statistic = 593.73, p-value=1.18e-129) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>, Conover test with Holm correction). Within the three UMAP groups, there were also significant differences for PAV between LS and core elements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>, Mann-Whitney U test and Holm correction). Specifically, the median absence count for all core TEs was 15 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>), but the median count is less than one for the core TEs in UMAP Group2 and Group3, which makeup 39.4% of the core TEs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). It is not clear what accounts for the core TE elements in UMAP Group2 and Group3, which are less defined by heterochromatic characteristics but experience less absence variation across the analyzed <italic>V. dahliae</italic> strains.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Genome-wide UMAP groups details that functional elements labeled core and LS have different epigenetic and DNA characteristics.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) clustering of individual <italic>V. dahliae</italic> TEs, color coded for core (blue) and LS (red).

Here, UMAP grouped the majority of the genes in the genome (89.9%) into a single cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). Within this group, we observed significant local-clustering of LS classified genes (x-axis p-value=5.45e-221 and y-axis p-value=1.84e-28, Mann-Whitney U test and Holm correction), which can be seen as an ‘island’ in the upper left section of the group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). Based on this, the large group was further sub-divided based on a visible separation, and the UMAP results were analyzed based on the resulting three groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). The UMAP Group1 genes contained four times more LS genes than expected (<italic>X<sup>2</sup></italic> = 2119.4, p-value=0) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>- table 16), and Group1 containing 75% of the LS genes. Furthermore, Group1 genes had the lowest GC content and transcription in axenic culture, and the highest H3K9 and H3K27 trimethylation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>- table 17, Kruskal-Wallis test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>, Conover test with Holm correction). Interestingly, the Group1 genes also had the highest in planta gene induction, which was not a variable used for UMAP creation, further validating that UMAP generated groups with relevant biological differences (Kruskal-Wallis H statistic = 1582.09, p-value=0) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>, Conover test with Holm correction). There was no significant difference for gene absence counts between the three groups (Kruskal-Wallis H statistic = 4.18, p-value=0.09) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3A,B</xref>), however this was influenced by the majority of genes having a zero absence count (i.e. are conserved). When only genes with an absence count greater than 0 were analyzed (i.e. the gene was missing from at least one strain), Group1 genes had a significantly higher mean absence count (Group1 = 13.4; Group 2 = 1.9; Group 3 = 3.1, Kruskal-Wallis H statistic = 583.06, p-value=2.46e-127) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3C,D</xref>, Conover test with Holm correction). Thus, the UMAP Group1 genes have characteristics of heterochromatin when grown axenically, are enriched for LS classified genes, display significantly higher in planta gene induction, and the genes have the highest absence counts across the analyzed <italic>V. dahliae</italic> strains. These results show that unsupervised UMAP groupings are able to capture functionally relevant biological groupings based on genomic and chromatin data, a previously unreported link.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Significant efforts to detail genomes of filamentous pathogens, to understand variation within species, and to a lesser extent to examine epigenetic modifications, have increased our understanding of genome function in this important group of organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Shi-Kunne et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Mondo et al., 2017</xref>). This is required to broaden our understanding of eukaryotic genome function and in order to combat emerging pathogens. Here, we present a detailed analysis of the epigenome and physical DNA accessibility of the vascular wilt pathogen <italic>V. dahliae</italic> and link these analyses to previous characterizations of genomic regions contributing to host colonization and adaptation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Klosterman et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">de Jonge et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Faino et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Shi-Kunne et al., 2018</xref>). A clear picture emerges in which the core genome is organized into heterochromatic and euchromatic regions. The heterochromatin is characterized by a high density of TEs with low GC content, high levels of DNA and H3K9 methylation, low DNA accessibility and clear signatures of RIP mutations at repetitive sequences. The euchromatin regions are opposite in all characteristics, and this collective description is consistent with previous research in many other eukaryotic genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Sexton et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bannister et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cam et al., 2005</xref>). Interestingly, we provide evidence that previously defined LS regions of the genome, characterized for their role in contributing to host infection, exist in a unique chromatin state. LS regions have higher TE density than the euchromatic regions, yet are devoid of DNA and H3K9 methylation. Furthermore, LS regions have higher DNA accessibility than the core heterochromatic regions and are more transcriptionally active, but they are less accessible than the ‘true’ euchromatic gene-rich core regions. Notably, LS regions are characterized as having a strong association with H3K27me3, similar to the discovery that SM gene clusters are enriched at H3K27me3 regions in <italic>F. graminearum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Connolly et al., 2013</xref>). Our results demonstrate that LS regions are by definition not heterochromatic, as they are far more accessible than the true heterochromatin, and yet they typically contain many heterochromatin features. These observations are akin to previous descriptions of facultative heterochromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Huisinga et al., 2006</xref>), but to our knowledge few studies have linked unique chromatin states to adaptive genomic regions. We believe this observation presents new hypotheses into the occurrence, formation and maintenance of adaptive regions of the genome. How chromatin interacts with evolutionary forces to shape organism fitness is an important question in the pursuit of understanding the genome.</p><p>Recent work from our team has shown that the eight centromeres in <italic>V. dahliae</italic> are significantly enriched in H3K9me3 and DNA methylation and are devoid of protein coding genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Seidl et al., 2020</xref>). These regions, which are critically important for genome function, appear as true heterochromatin under the conditions tested here. Our analysis of the protein HP1, an important protein for heterochromatin formation, demonstrates it is required for DNA methylation in <italic>V. dahliae</italic>, consistent with reports in other fungi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Freitag et al., 2004</xref>). The loss of DNA methylation in Δ<italic>hp1</italic> is likely driven by the need for HP1 to bind H3K9me3 and direct DNA methylation. An interesting observation here is that only some of the TEs in the genome have H3K9me3, DNA methylation and signatures of RIP. The process of RIP has been shown to occur during meiosis, yet <italic>V. dahliae</italic> is presumed to reproduce asexually. One explanation for this is that the ancestral status was characterized by sexual reporduction and included RIP, and TEs present at that time remain in the genome as heterochromatin, some of which at centromeres. Under this explanation, the occurrence of TEs in the genome which are not marked by H3K9me3, DNA methylation, and do not appear affected by RIP, would have arisen in the genome after sexual reproduction was lost. This would be consistent with the occurrence of relatively newer TEs in <italic>V. dahliae</italic> residing in LS regions and contributing to adaptive evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Faino et al., 2016</xref>). However, other possibilities cannot be ruled out, such that sexual reproduction does occur in <italic>V. dahliae</italic>, albeit incidentally in local field populations that underly the many asexual lineages that are presently mostly observed. It is also possible that RIP occurs outside of meiosis, for example during parasexual exchange while in a diploid state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Forche et al., 2008</xref>). Further experimental research is needed to further understand these mechanistic possibilities.</p><p>Our results support the hypothesis that chromatin structure underlies genome function. This is clearly true for the functional centromere, in which centrochromatin is defined by epigenetics, diverse DNA sequence, and dynamic configuration in the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Friedman and Freitag, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Nagpal and Fierz, 2020</xref>). Another example supporting this hypothesis exists in <italic>Z. tritici</italic>, where accessory chromosomes are enriched for specific histone modifications, but it remains to be determined how these accessory chromosomes impact genome function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Schotanus et al., 2015</xref>). The results presented here suggest that chromatin modifications and DNA accessibility may influence genome evolution, not only via transcriptional control, but also by contributing to genome variation. Based on the observed association between chromatin and function, we were able to predict LS regions using machine learning. The ML algorithms, trained on H3K9 and H3K27 methylation, RNA-sequencing, TE density and DNA accessibility data, show how these descriptions of chromatin can be used to classify DNA segments as core versus LS with high recall (i.e. sensitivity). Our results indicated low precision for ML classification, owing to the relatively high number of false positives. It was not our original intention to try and identify new LS regions using ML, and thus our approach was not necessarily optimized to identify novel LS regions. Despite this, we were able to identify and validate new LS regions based on enrichment for in planta-induced genes, presumed effectors, genes coding secreted peptides and genes with higher PAV, thereby improving the classification and nearly doubling the amount of LS DNA. It is a remarkable finding that, through the use of machine learning, we could substantially extend our knowledge of the <italic>V. dahliae</italic> genome and identify as of yet unconsidered genomic regions and genes, which likely contribute to adaptive traits. In addition to the supervised binary classification, we employed unsupervised uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) to cluster the genome, without any explicit information pertaining to core or LS regions. The UMAP approach reduced our multidimensional representation of the genomic data into a simple two-dimension scatterplot. Analyzing the UMAP groups for both TEs and genes showed that specific groups were enriched for LS elements. This is remarkable given that UMAP is an independent analysis from the ML approach, and was not built using a priori LS or core designation. As such, this provides strong evidence that genomic and chromatin features have a strong association with DNA conferring specific biological function and evolutionary relevance. We note that the original definition of LS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Klosterman et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">de Jonge et al., 2013</xref>) is now a too limited description of the genomic regions described here. Our hypothesis is that these regions make a substantial contribution to host adaptation because they contain many known effectors and genes induced during in planta growth, code for many proteins with secretion signals, and they show significantly more PAV between the analyzed strains. As such, we now propose to refer to these regions as ‘adaptive genomic regions’.</p><p>It is currently not possible to extend our machine learning predictions to additional filamentous pathogen genomes, as the necessary data are not currently publicly available. However, for many filamentous plant pathogens it is clear that genome variation on multiple scales, from SNPs to large structural variation, are not uniformly distributed in the genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Connolly et al., 2013</xref>). Recent reports from the fungal pathogen <italic>Z. tritici</italic> addressed the role of genome stability and H3K27me3 during asexual reproduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Möller et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Möller et al., 2018</xref>). During experimental evolution, individual strains of <italic>Z. tritici</italic> readily lose accessory chromosomes. The authors observed that a mutant lacking the enzyme responsible for H3K27me3 showed less accessory chromosome loss and concluded that H3K27me3 destabilizes chromosome structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Möller et al., 2019</xref>). However, accessory chromosome losses were clearly biased in their individual frequency and changes were not reported for core chromosomes, despite H3K27me3 being found at high levels on accessory and regions of core chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Schotanus et al., 2015</xref>). Therefore, the observed genome destabilization requires additional determinants in conjunction with H3K27me3 which remain to be discovered. Results presented here suggest that DNA and histone methylation marks, along with physical DNA accessibility are important additional determinants to distinguish functionally, and potentially evolutionarily relevant regions of the genome.</p><p>We acknowledge that our model does not strictly differentiate all regions of the <italic>V. dahliae</italic> genome, as there were LS and core regions that had similar overall chromatin profiles, and therefore these features alone are not sufficient. It is possible that variability in growth conditions or tissue used for genomic data collection affected our results. Our results also relied on the original LS classification for model training, which given the lack of ground truth, may have introduced error. Future efforts to develop higher confidence training data may improve this approach. Another explanation is that the formation of adaptive genomic regions is not fully deterministic. Evolution is a stochastic process, and it seems unlikely that adaptive genomic regions will be formed in absolute terms. Rather, it is more likely to be a probabilistic process, in which specific chromatin and physical status increases the likelihood for formation and maintenance of adaptive regions. Along these lines, it is important to note that while binary classification is useful, this model is likely overly simplified as genomic regions probably exists on a continuum for adaptive potential. Further experimental evidence is needed to to fully understand if different chromatin states directly impact genome evolution. Data present here support this hypothesis, and offer an exciting new link between the epigenome, physical DNA accessibility and adaptive genome evolution.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (<italic>V. dahliae</italic>)</td><td valign="top">JR2, wild-type</td><td valign="top">PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26286689">26286689</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Fungal Biodiversity Center (CBS), 143773</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (<italic>V. dahliae</italic>)</td><td valign="top">JR2, Δ<italic>hp1</italic></td><td valign="top"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.26.268789">https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.26.268789</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Rabbit anti H3K9me3 (Polyclonal)</td><td valign="top">Active Motif</td><td valign="top">39765</td><td valign="top">ChIP (1:200)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Rabbit anti H3K27me3 (Polyclonal)</td><td valign="top">Active Motif</td><td valign="top">39155</td><td valign="top">ChIP (1:200)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td valign="top">pRF-HU2</td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Frandsen et al., 2008</xref></td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">USER-cloning</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Commercial assay or kit</td><td valign="top">EZ DNA Methylation-Gold kit</td><td valign="top">Zymo Research</td><td valign="top">D5005</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Commercial assay or kit</td><td valign="top">Nextera DNA library Preparation</td><td valign="top">Illumina</td><td valign="top">FA-121–1030</td><td valign="top"/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Fungal growth and strain construction</title><p><italic>V. dahliae</italic> strain JR2 (CBS 143773) was used for experimental analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Faino et al., 2015</xref>).

As such, weighted methylation captures quantitative aspects of methylation, while fractional methylation is more qualitative. Weighted and fractional methylation were calculated over intervals described in the text, including genes, promoters (defined as the 300 bp upstream of the translation start site), TEs and 10 kb windows. For each feature, weighted and fractional methylation were calculated from the sum of the mapped reads or the sum of the positions, respectively, over the analyzed region. Two sample comparisons were computed using base R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">R Development Core Team, 2019</xref>) to compute the non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test (equivalent to the two-sample Wilcoxon rank-sum test) and Holm multiple testing correction was used for the associated p-values.

The full set of genomic data was used to create a data frame comprising the genome in 10 kb segments as rows and the individual collected variables as columns. The regions were classified as core or LS based on the previous observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Faino et al., 2016</xref>). The model for all algorithms was; classification = ATAC seq<sub>TPM</sub> + ChIP-H3K27me3<sub>TPM</sub> + ChIP-H3K9me3<sub>TPM</sub> + TE<sub>density</sub> + PDB-RNAseq<sub>TPM</sub>. The data were split into 80% training (i.e. learning) and 20% testing (i.e. prediction), and the proportion of core and LS regions were kept approximately equal in the two splits. Only the training data was used for parameter tuning and testing. Four algorithms used tested- logistic regression (LR), random forest (RF), stochastic gradient boosting (GBM), and boosted classification tree (BCT). The models were assessed by testing various tuning parameters, which are model specific by performing three-time 10-fold cross-validation with the training data. Final parameter settings were determined based on the highest accuracy. The logistic regression model was implemented using method <italic>glm</italic> and family <italic>binomial</italic> and this method does not have parameters to tune. The random forest model was implemented using method <italic>rf</italic> and the tuning parameter ‘Randomly Selected Predictors’ (<italic>mtry)</italic> was tried at values 1, 2, 3, and 4, with a value of 1 giving the highest mean accuracy (supp fig ML#1). The stochastic gradient boost model was implemented using method <italic>gbm</italic> and the tuning parameters ‘number of iterations’ (<italic>n.trees</italic>) was tested at 50, 500, 1000; ‘complexity of trees’ (<italic>interaction.depth</italic>) was tested at 1, 5, 10; ‘learning rate’ (<italic>shrinkage</italic>) was tested at 0.01 and 0.001; and ‘minimum node splitting’ (<italic>n.minobsinnode</italic>) was tested at 1, and 5 (supp fig ML#2).

Based on the ROC, we used a threshold of 0.05 for the LR model, 0.08 for the RF model, 0.05 for the GBM model, and 0.00001 for the BCT model.

The random forest model was implemented using method <italic>rf</italic> and parameter <italic>mtry</italic> = 3.

For each round of training/testing, the trained model was used to predict LS and core classification using the test data with a probability threshold of 0.10.

A total of 124 regions did not receive a prediction because of this approach.</p><p>For each genomic region, a consensus designation was assigned based on the highest occurrence of core versus LS prediction across the 15 trials. If a similar number of core and LS predictions were made for a region across the 15 trials, the regions were designated as core to be conservative. This was done independently between the two models. Individual 10 kb consensus predictions for the GBM and RF models were assessed based on the original LS classification from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Faino et al., 2016</xref> found in supplemental table S2. A final high confidence LS consensus was determined based on the results of the two models. Genomic regions that were predicted LS by both models were considered LS, while the rest were classified as core. Adjacent LS regions were concatenated, along with a conservative joining approach where a single core region was classified LS if it were flanked by two LS regions. The joining added 41 genomic regions (410 kb) to the LS genome.</p><p>For assessment of old and new LS designations, the following three categories of coding sequence were assessed; in planta induced genes, putative effectors and coding sequences for secreted peptides.

Your article has been overseen by Detlef Weigel as the Reviewing and Senior Editor, and three peer reviewers.

First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The fungus <italic>Verticillium dahliae</italic> is a broad host-range plant pathogen. As in other filamentous plant pathogens, its genome can be partitioned into evolutionary stable core regions and evolutionarily dynamic regions that are repeat-rich, gene-poor, devoid of house-keeping genes, and instead encode genes important for host-pathogen interactions. Identifying such &quot;adaptive&quot;, lineage-specific (LS) portions of pathogen genomes is both interesting in its own right and has implications for agricultural practices.</p><p>It has been shown before that these regions (or even entire chromosomes) can exhibit particular epigenetic marks and sequence composition (for example in Fusarium, Zymoseptorira, Leptospheria, Botrytis and others). The current study builds on these observations. It reports an impressive amount of data including whole-genome bisulfite, histone modification, DNA accessibility and RNA-seq data for <italic>V. dahliae</italic>, and these data are used to train a model to distinguish core and adaptive regions of the genome, which in turn allows a larger fraction of the genome to be identified as potentially adaptive. The model is validated with a diversity dataset, which confirms that the regions classified as adaptive are more likely to contain lineage-specific sequences.</p><p>What remains to be demonstrated is how the expanded set of &quot;adaptive&quot; regions reported here can be used to advance our understanding of the processes that underlie genome compartmentalization in filamentous plant pathogens, and how different epigenetic marks contribute to different modes of evolution, or whether they are merely a consequence of different selective forces acting on the different regions.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Too little attention is paid to chromosome organization such as centromeres and pericentromeres, which are linked to differences in epigenetic states.</p><p>2) A mutant strain impaired in DNA methylation (Δhp1) is used to show a role of HP1 in DNA methylation in <italic>V. dahliae</italic>. This functional aspect could greatly enhance the study, but is currently poorly integrated in the remainder of the work. It is not clear if the Δhp1 mutant has an overt phenotype or is altered in its gene expression pattern. The Δhp1 mutant must be more fully characterized as to changes in gene expression between core and LS regions.</p><p>3) Throughout the manuscript there is reference to repeat induced point mutations (RIP) without comments on the paradox that <italic>V. dahliae</italic> is asexual and that the RIP mechanism is associated with meiosis. Could the signatures of RIP reflect mutations that accumulated in an ancestral sexual population of <italic>V. dahliae</italic>? The absence of RIP mutations from LS regions would seem to be in agreement with these regions having evolved only after the transition to an asexual lifestyle. Also, in agreement, it has previously been shown that TEs associated with LS regions tend to be younger. We ask you to follow up on these previous conclusions.</p><p>4) You divide all TEs into four classes (subsection “Transposable element classes have distinct genomic and epigenomic profiles”). Could some patterns be obscured with this broad classification? It appears that the bimodal distributions in Figure 2B reflect different dynamics of different TE (sub)families. Please provide a more fine-scale analysis of properties associated with specific TE (sub)families. Group3 elements are associated with genes that show stronger in planta induction. You should elaborate more on this observation, for example, by describing where in the genome these Group3 elements are located.</p><p>5) The machine learning section suffers from a confusion of purpose. You begin by training four algorithms to predict core and lineage-specific (LS) regions from the chromatin data, attempting to minimize false positive and false negatives. Then you pivot, and hypothesize that the remaining false positives may in fact be true positives (previously unclassified LS regions). Validation with new Presence/Absence Variation (PAV) and RNA-seq data supports this proposal. While this approach works, it is not ideal. If you had intended from the beginning to identify new LS regions, you should have created a training data set of high quality core regions (e.g. BUSCO genes and their surrounding regions) as well as high quality LS regions (e.g. genes that encode secreted proteins and that show either PAV or are induced in planta). Furthermore, this curated training data set should contain equal numbers of positive (LS) and negative (core) examples.</p><p>6) Following on from the above, in none of the predictions (e.g. in Table 2, Table 3, Figure 6, subsection “Machine learning predicts more lineage-specific genomic regions than previously considered”) do you seem to document which parameter settings were used for each algorithm. As demonstrated in Figure 5, the actual precision and recall vary according to the threshold used to make the binary core/LS call. These threshold parameters should be shown in each case, for example in a diagram similar to Figure 5B or else by showing the optimization curves in the supplement.</p><p>Similarly, in the Materials and methods, you state that the optimal parameters for prediction were chosen by maximizing &quot;accuracy&quot;. You fail to define &quot;accuracy&quot; but let us assume that you mean [(true positives + true negatives)/all predictions]. This means that, given the heavily skewed distribution of positives and negatives, the optimization will be heavily biased towards minimizing false negatives. In fact, you state &quot;The Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) [is] an analogous measure to accuracy but more appropriate for unbalanced binary classification&quot;. You do not inform us why you used accuracy for the optimizations rather than the MCC, or whether by &quot;accuracy&quot; you intended to convey that you did actually use the MCC.</p><p>Here again is confusion of purpose. If you indeed used [(true positives + true negatives)/all predictions], and therefore biased the optimization towards true negatives (core genes) you would inadvertently have liberalized the prediction of false positives. In the absence of a high quality training set, liberalizing the prediction of false positives is actually a good way to improve the search for undetected true positives (LS regions). If this were your intent (which is not discussed), then there would be no need to introduce the MCC except perhaps to explain why it was not used.</p><p>7) With this paper, you have substantially expanded the way that LS regions are identified, introducing a much wider range of metrics. Thus, the term &quot;lineage-specific&quot; no longer accurately defines such regions, because it refers only to the use of PAV to define the regions. As you state, you are actually interested in regions responsible for host colonization and adaptation. Continuing to use the term &quot;LS regions&quot; will cause confusion as to whether you refer to regions that exhibit PAV, or regions identified with the new algorithms. This confusion is exemplified by you reference to &quot;old and new LS regions&quot; (subsection “Machine learning predicts more lineage-specific genomic regions than previously considered<bold>”</bold>). We assume that going forward you do not intend to continue to use the terms &quot;old LS&quot; and &quot;new LS&quot;. We strongly recommend you choose a new name for the new, expanded &quot;LS&quot; regions.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.62208.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Too little attention is paid to chromosome organization such as centromeres and pericentromeres, which are linked to differences in epigenetic states.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that we did not pay much attention to chromosome organization and centromeric phenomena in the original submission. However, just recently we have published a manuscript that characterizes <italic>Verticillium</italic> centromeres in detail (Seidl et al., 2020). Thus, we have now added more information on this topic to the Introduction and Discussion, which also includes integrating the major conclusions from our recent centromere study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) A mutant strain impaired in DNA methylation (Δhp1) is used to show a role of HP1 in DNA methylation in V. dahliae. This functional aspect could greatly enhance the study, but is currently poorly integrated in the remainder of the work. It is not clear if the Δhp1 mutant has an overt phenotype or is altered in its gene expression pattern. The Δhp1 mutant must be more fully characterized as to changes in gene expression between core and LS regions.</p></disp-quote><p>To provide a more comprehensive analysis of the HP1 mutation, we added information to the Results section as well as Figure 2—figure supplement 1 to address transcriptional changes caused by Δhp1 and specifically in LS versus Core genes. This protein has documented pleiotropic effects, and the exact mechanism leading to differential gene expression in the HP1 mutant is difficult to determine. We have also incorporated findings that are described in another manuscript under review, which describes a more detailed characterization of HP1 (Kramer et al., 2020) in the Results section of our revision. From this work, it is clear that DNA methylation does not control gene expression in <italic>V. dahliae</italic>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Throughout the manuscript there is reference to repeat induced point mutations (RIP) without comments on the paradox that V. dahliae is asexual and that the RIP mechanism is associated with meiosis. Could the signatures of RIP reflect mutations that accumulated in an ancestral sexual population of V. dahliae? The absence of RIP mutations from LS regions would seem to be in agreement with these regions having evolved only after the transition to an asexual lifestyle. Also, in agreement, it has previously been shown that TEs associated with LS regions tend to be younger. We ask you to follow up on these previous conclusions.</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, we did not address the paradox on the observations concerning RIP and the presumed asexual nature of <italic>Verticillium</italic> in the original submission. We agree that the signatures of RIP could reflect mutation that accumulated in an ancestral sexual population of <italic>V. dahliae</italic>, from which asexual lineages sprouted. However, despite the skewed mating type distribution and the abundant occurrence of large-scale genomic rearrangements, we also cannot exclude that local, presently active, sexual populations underly the largely asexual populations. Arguably, in absence of unambiguous proof for the occurrence of sexual activity, this matter cannot be resolved. We have now added a section to the Discussion where we discuss this paradox and its implications.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) You divide all TEs into four classes (subsection “Transposable element classes have distinct genomic and epigenomic profiles”). Could some patterns be obscured with this broad classification? It appears that the bimodal distributions in Figure 2B reflect different dynamics of different TE (sub)families. Please provide a more fine-scale analysis of properties associated with specific TE (sub)families. Group3 elements are associated with genes that show stronger in planta induction. You should elaborate more on this observation, for example, by describing where in the genome these Group3 elements are located.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added further characterization of TE sub-classes for the DNA, LINE and LTR elements to the Results section including Figure 3—figure supplement 1 and Figure 4—figure supplement 1 and Supplementary file 3, Supplementary file 4, and Supplementary file 5. There does not appear to be a clear overall profile on the basis of TE subfamilies that can account for the bimodal distribution.</p><p>We believe the question regarding group3 elements and in planta induction is related to the UMAP analysis and Figure 7F. It is actually group1 elements that are the most highly induced in planta, we have updated the y-axis label to more clearly identify the contrast was made as axenic culture over in planta, and so in plant induction is shown as a negative value. As shown in Figure 7D and in the results these genes occur in LS regions far greater than expected by chance.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The machine learning section suffers from a confusion of purpose. You begin by training four algorithms to predict core and lineage-specific (LS) regions from the chromatin data, attempting to minimize false positive and false negatives.

Furthermore, this curated training data set should contain equal numbers of positive (LS) and negative (core) examples.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewers are correct that our original purpose was not to identify new LS regions, but rather to characterize previously identified LS regions in a more comprehensive manner. However, while progressing, we realized that we were able to identify novel LS regions that had previously remained unnoticed. We have added a statement in the Results section to acknowledge this, and highlight that we did indeed pivot the analysis to determining if the “false positives” were indeed newly identified LS regions. As the reviewers note, our results were further validated by independent analysis. As such, despite the approach not being the preferred approach if the initial aim was to identify novel LS regions, we interpret the results as being both novel and providing new biological insight. The suggestions on developing a higher quality training set are valid, and make perfect sense in hind-sight. However, considering our findings and the outcome of the functional validation, it is unlikely that the outcome would be substantially different.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Following on from the above, in none of the predictions (e.g. in Table 2, Table 3, Figure 6, subsection “Machine learning predicts more lineage-specific genomic regions than previously considered”) do you seem to document which parameter settings were used for each algorithm.

These threshold parameters should be shown in each case, for example in a diagram similar to Figure 5B or else by showing the optimization curves in the supplement.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now added additional information in the Materials and methods section regarding cross-validation for parameter tuning, assessment, final model parameters and probability thresholds used for binary classification. Additional results from the ML analysis are shown in Figure 6—figure supplement 3 and Figure 6—figure supplement 5.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Similarly, in the Materials and methods, you state that the optimal parameters for prediction were chosen by maximizing &quot;accuracy&quot;.

We introduced MCC after the ML predictions to help assess model performance. This was because the standard accuracy metric indicated very good model performance (Figure 5A), but we remained skeptical and postulated this was because of the skewed data. The model could have very high accuracy by skewing results to calling most regions negative (i.e. core) generating very high True Negatives and very few False positives. We used accuracy as a metric for model training out of convention, and then later applied the MCC to address the biased results of accuracy to get a better idea of actual model performance. These points are more clearly presented in the Results section of the revision.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Here again is confusion of purpose. If you indeed used [(true positives + true negatives)/all predictions], and therefore biased the optimization towards true negatives (core genes) you would inadvertently have liberalized the prediction of false positives. In the absence of a high quality training set, liberalizing the prediction of false positives is actually a good way to improve the search for undetected true positives (LS regions). If this were your intent (which is not discussed), then there would be no need to introduce the MCC except perhaps to explain why it was not used.</p></disp-quote><p>The original intent of the ML analysis was not to identify new LS regions, as we responded above, and have stated in the revision. It is true that our approach may have relaxed predictions in a way that allowed identification of genuine LS regions as evidenced by our analysis. In regards to MCC, it was introduced after running ML to assess model performance. This was because the commonly used metrics, accuracy and auROC, were not informative because of the skewed dataset. MCC provided a more determinative assessment. We have added information to more clearly describe these points in the Results and Discussion of our revision.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) With this paper, you have substantially expanded the way that LS regions are identified, introducing a much wider range of metrics. Thus, the term &quot;lineage-specific&quot; no longer accurately defines such regions, because it refers only to the use of PAV to define the regions. As you state, you are actually interested in regions responsible for host colonization and adaptation. Continuing to use the term &quot;LS regions&quot; will cause confusion as to whether you refer to regions that exhibit PAV, or regions identified with the new algorithms. This confusion is exemplified by you reference to &quot;old and new LS regions&quot; (subsection “Machine learning predicts more lineage-specific genomic regions than previously considered<bold>”</bold>). We assume that going forward you do not intend to continue to use the terms &quot;old LS&quot; and &quot;new LS&quot;. We strongly recommend you choose a new name for the new, expanded &quot;LS&quot; regions.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added clearer language in the manuscript where we discuss the old and new LS regions to specify this language is for comparison. We agree with the reviewer that the LS designation may indeed no longer be adequate to describe the regions of interest (i.e. host colonization and adaptation to environment). We have added text in the Discussion to describe the identified DNA as “adaptive genomic regions”.</p></body></sub-article></article>
