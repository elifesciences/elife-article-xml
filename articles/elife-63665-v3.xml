Whether or not p53 is directly involved in mature adipocyte metabolic regulation remains unclear. Here we show p53 protein expression can be up-regulated in adipocytes by nutrient starvation without activating cell senescence, apoptosis, or a death-related p53 canonical pathway. Inducing the loss of p53 in mature adipocytes significantly reprograms energy metabolism and this effect is primarily mediated through a AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway and a novel downstream transcriptional target, lysosomal acid lipase (LAL). The pathophysiological relevance is further demonstrated in a conditional and adipocyte-specific p53 knockout mouse model. Overall, these data support a non-canonical p53 function in the regulation of adipocyte energy homeostasis and indicate that the dysregulation of this pathway may be involved in developing metabolic dysfunction in obesity.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>adipocyte</kwd><kwd>metabolism</kwd><kwd>lipolysis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000062</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DK-112945</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Libin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A non-canonical p53 function in adipocyte plays a critical role in energy homeostasis and is involved in obesity-associated metabolic dysfunctions.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>White adipose tissue (WAT) plays a central role in nutrient homeostasis, serving as the site of calorie storage and the source of key adipokines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Guilherme et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rosen and Spiegelman, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kahn et al., 2019</xref>). Obesity is a condition of excess lipid accumulation in white adipose tissue and has been recognized as a major risk factor for many human diseases, including type II diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and some types of cancer. As the major cell type of fat tissue, white adipocytes store triglycerides, which are synthesized from glucose and fatty acids, and can be broken down through lipolysis when needed as fuel. Controlled by multiple fine-tuned regulatory mechanisms, adipocytes have the ability to sense and coordinate responses to changes in nutrient availability during fasting and feeding, and they play central roles in lipid and glucose metabolism. Dysregulations in these processes are the direct results of insulin resistance and occur at the early stages of metabolic syndrome. Understanding the underlying regulatory mechanisms is critical for developing new early diagnostic tools and treatments for obesity-related metabolic diseases.</p><p>Traditionally, p53 has been considered a tumor suppressor that can be activated by a variety of stress signals, such as DNA damage, oncogene activation, and other stresses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Vousden and Prives, 2009a</xref>). Once activated, the p53 pathway has a wide range of downstream effects, the most prominent of which are cell death, senescence, cell cycle arrest, and autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kruiswijk et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Maddocks and Vousden, 2011</xref>). In addition, recent research has shown that p53 plays a significant role in metabolic regulation by inhibiting aerobic glycolysis while promoting mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and that the disruption of p53 function leads to the ‘Warburg effect,’ which is an enhanced conversion of glucose to lactate in cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Vousden and Ryan, 2009b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Berkers et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kung and Murphy, 2016</xref>). Although most of these studies focused on the malignant transformation of cancer cells, it is clear that p53 activation is closely associated with general metabolic regulation as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kung and Murphy, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Krstic et al., 2018</xref>). In addition, several studies have suggested that p53 is involved in normal hepatic glucose homeostasis and lipid metabolism in liver tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Prokesch et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Derdak et al., 2013</xref>). Studies of skeletal muscle also indicate that p53 is important for muscle mitochondrial function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Park et al., 2009</xref>). The metabolic role played by p53 is usually associated with cell adaptive responses for survival, which is distinct from the cell death and senescence-related regulations observed in the genotoxic stress conditions. Different regulatory mechanisms for the activation of each pathway have been identified, including upstream signaling, post-translational modifications, and downstream activated target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Vousden and Prives, 2009a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kruiswijk et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Studies of adipose tissue have observed increases in the expression and activity of p53 in the adipocytes of obese mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Yahagi et al., 2003</xref>). Adipocyte-specific knockout mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Minamino et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Shimizu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Shimizu et al., 2013</xref>) have been generated to study the role of p53 in metabolism, but these studies had a number of limitations. (i) Indirect association: Data from whole-body p53 knockout mice studies are inconsistent and suggest that the observed metabolic changes may not be directly attributed to adipose tissue, but rather the cumulative effect of p53 deficiency in other cells and tissues in those mouse models. (ii) A focus only on canonical p53 function: Other studies have manipulated p53 in adipocytes but predominantly focused on adipocyte death and apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Minamino et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Shimizu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Shimizu et al., 2013</xref>), observing that metabolic phenotypes were exclusively attributed to cell death-related tissue inflammation without addressing cellular energy flux. (iii) <italic>Fabp4</italic> promoter: In addition, all adipocyte-specific p53 studies have used a system in which p53 ablation was driven by the <italic>Fabp4</italic> (fatty-acid-binding protein 4, aP2) promoter (<italic>Fabp4</italic>-Cre mice crossed with p53 floxed mice). However, the aP2 promoter has been known to be potentially active in tissues other than adipose, such as macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fu et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fu et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Makowski et al., 2001</xref>). These inadvertent modifications of p53 levels in tissues other than adipose tissue may distort the data, especially in studies of the mechanisms of adipose tissue inflammation or systemic nutrient challenges. (iv) Lastly, a lack of attention to adipocyte differentiation affected by p53: p53 is known to regulate adipocyte differentiation and fat tissue development in various ways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Thompson et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Inoue et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Okita et al., 2014</xref>) that may significantly impact energy metabolism when common germline or embryonic p53 knockout mouse models are used. Due to these limitations, further studies into the physiological role of p53 in adipocyte metabolism are needed.</p><p>To this end, we created inducible in vitro and <italic>in-vivo</italic> working models, in which adipocyte-specific p53 expression levels could be manipulated at precisely controlled time points, so that p53 could be expressed normally during adipocyte differentiation and tissue development. The results from these working systems demonstrated a central role played by p53 in adipocyte energy metabolic reprogramming under challenging metabolic conditions. This specific regulation is mediated through lysosomal acid lipase (LAL), a downstream transcriptional target of p53. Additionally, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-dependent phosphorylation is involved. Both factors differentiate p53 metabolic function from its traditional canonical pathway that are related to cell senescence, apoptosis, and death. Furthermore, this non-canonical p53 function explains the metabolic effect of metformin in adipocytes and has the potential to generate new pharmaceutical approaches for modulating the p53 pathway and, thus, directly improving adipocyte functionality.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>In adipocytes p53 can be up-regulated by nutrient starvation, but without canonical pathway activation</title><p>In healthy mice, we observed that adipocytes express the p53 protein under normal conditions and that p53 expression can be significantly up-regulated with 24 hr fasting and down-regulated with refeeding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We also observed that a short-term (3 days) switch from a low-fat (Research Diet, D1245B) to high-fat diet (HFD) (D12492) significantly up-regulated the p53 protein abundance in the adipocytes of C57BL/6 mice as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). In addition, p53 can be up-regulated with long-term (12 wks) HFD feeding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). However, the p53 pathway downstream genes traditionally related to cell senescence, apoptosis, and death, such as <italic>Cdkn1a</italic>, <italic>Gadd45</italic>, and <italic>Cdkn2a</italic>, behaved differently. These markers were up-regulated by long-term HFD but unaffected by 24 hr fasting and short-term (3 days) HFD feeding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–E</xref>), which suggests the non-canonical function of p53 may be activated under these short-term metabolically challenging conditions. This phenomenon can be consistently observed in cultured 3T3-L1 adipocytes. To recreate the systemic effects of fasting in the cultured 3T3-L1 adipocytes of mice, we added isoproterenol (ISO, 10 μM) to a nutrient starvation medium (PBS with 1% BSA). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>, after switching from a normal culture medium (10% FBS in high-glucose DMEM) to the fasting medium for 6 hr, the p53 expression level was significantly up-regulated. However, refeeding (with a normal culture medium with 10 nM insulin) reduced the p53 expression back to a non-fasting condition. Of note, this p53 up-regulation was not associated with canonical pathway activation in contrast to doxorubicin, a DNA replication inhibitor used widely as a p53 pathway activator for cell senescence, cell cycle arrest, and cell death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). Since fasting can cause adipocytes to undergo significant reprogramming of cellular energy metabolism, these data suggest that p53 may be directly involved in adipocyte metabolic regulation.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>In adipocytes p53 can be up-regulated by nutrient starvation, but without canonical pathway activation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Three groups of WT C57 mice were either not treated (Control), fasted for 24 hr (Fasting), or followed by refeeding for 24 hr (Refeeding).

To focus on mature adipocytes and avoid these effects on adipocyte differentiation, we generated conditional CRISPR-Cas9 genome-edited p53 knockout 3T3-L1 stable cell lines (p53–KO) using an rtTA-TRE inducible lentivirus system. In this working model, <italic>Trp53</italic> was deleted after 8 days’ differentiation, when the 3T3-L1 adipocytes were fully differentiated. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, p53 can be effectively eliminated after a 3 day doxycycline treatment. To protect against any unexpected effects from doxycycline, all wild-type (WT) controls were treated with doxycycline in the same way as the KO cells. Using this working model, we first examined the role of p53 in glucose metabolism. After the p53-KO and WT 3T3-L1 adipocytes were incubated overnight with Krebs-Ringer modified buffer and 1% BSA, the culture mediums were switched with 5 mM glucose and 0.1% FBS in no-glucose DMEM, and the changes in glucose concentrations for the culture media were monitored for 60 hr. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, glucose concentration in the culture medium of p53-KO adipocytes decreased much more quickly than WT control cells, indicating that the deletion of p53 can enhance adipocyte glucose consumption. Consistent with these results, a higher glycolytic capacity and glycolytic reserve were observed in the p53-KO 3T3-L1 adipocytes, as indicated by their extracellular acidification rates, which were measured using Seahorse XF technology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C–D</xref>). When we measured the basal and insulin-stimulated glucose uptake, the differences were not statistically significant (data not shown) although the p53-KO adipocytes tended to have higher rates, and the expressions of GLUT1 and GLUT4 in the adipocytes were unaffected by the deletion of p53 (data not shown), which suggested that the p53 reduced the glucose metabolism, though not through a glucose transport-dependent mechanism. The pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) is a metabolic pathway that branches off from glycolysis and generates metabolites that can synthesize nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate hydrogen (NADPH). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, p53 deletion led to an increase in NADPH levels. However, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>, these findings did not result from gene expression changes in glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jiang et al., 2011</xref>). Additionally, glycolysis produces the intermediate metabolite pyruvate. Under anaerobic conditions, pyruvate is converted to lactic acid by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hagen and Ball, 1960</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Schmidt and Katz, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Newby et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Frayn and Coppack, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">DiGirolamo et al., 1992</xref>). In the present study, the lactate production of the p53-KO adipocytes was significantly increased, comparing to WT control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>).

Both the basal and maximum respiration rates were lower in the p53-KO adipocytes than in the WT controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), suggesting that mitochondrial function was suppressed. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are constantly produced during normal metabolism, especially through oxidative phosphorylation. When we used Amplex Red to measure the basal cellular ROS levels in the p53-KO adipocytes in vitro, we found that the p53 knockout adipocytes showed lower ROS levels when compared to the WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).

Compared to the WT cells, the p53-KO adipocytes had much higher GSH levels and redox potential (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). These data suggest that p53 plays a key role in promoting mitochondrial respiration and ROS generation in adipocytes and that deletion of p53 could have the opposite effect.

Furthermore, we also found that LAL-RNAi knockdown 3T3-L1 adipocytes impaired ISO-stimulated lipolysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C–D</xref>), suggesting that acid lipolysis was activated after long-term ISO stimulation. In comparison, ATGL (Adipose triglyceride lipase, the enzyme catalyzes the first reaction of neutral lipolysis) RNAi knockdown showed significant downregulation of total lipolysis, and double RNAi knockdowns (LAL and ATGL) further downregulated lipolysis (Fig, 4C-D). These data support LAL-mediated and neutral lipolysis are the main pathways, however, we can’t rule out the existence of other lipase that might be involved. The overexpression of LAL in p53 null adipocytes completely restored the down-regulation of lipolysis in the p53-KO adipocytes, suggesting that LAL-dependent acid lipolysis is involved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E–F</xref>).

With this model, we first examined the phenotypes under normal physiological conditions using the strategy shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>. In these baseline studies, we did not observe any obvious metabolic phenotypes, including body weight, overnight fasting glucose, and insulin, between the WT control and p53-KO mice (data not shown). However, when we challenged the mice with prolonged fasting (24 hr, started from 5 p.m.), we observed that the body and fat tissue weight losses, fasting glucose and serum-free fatty acid levels, and liver TG content were much lower in the p53-iAKO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E–I</xref>), suggesting a potentially attenuated lipolysis ability within adipose tissue.

However, these studies were conducted in long-term, diet-induced obesity (DIO) mice models. Our studies of cell culture systems led us to hypothesize that disturbances in non-canonical p53 metabolic regulations in the early stages of HFD feeding may directly contribute to metabolic dysregulation and the pathological development of insulin resistance. To test this theory, we performed a short-term HFD feeding study (60% calories from fat for six wks) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7R</xref>) and confirmed that the gene expressions related to inflammation and cell death were not up-regulated in this timeframe (data not shown).

These findings are further supported by <italic>in-vivo</italic> studies using inducible adipocyte-specific p53 knockout mouse models with HFD feeding. In general, ‘metabolic flexibility’ defines the ability of shifting energy source reliance between lipids and glucose in the whole-body or skeletal muscle in response to fasting or feeding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Goodpaster and Sparks, 2017</xref>). A similar concept can be applied when defining the metabolic functional capacities of adipocytes during continuous transitions between feeding and fasting cycles. Thus, adipocyte metabolic flexibility can be similarly determined by glucose uptake/glycolysis during feeding and lipolysis/lipid oxidation during fasting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). In a healthy state, adipocytes will select either glucose or fatty acids as the main energy source in feeding and fasting conditions, continuously and cyclically switching between the two substrates. This transition is crucial for metabolic homeostasis and is achieved through multiple regulatory mechanisms for controlling the energy fuel flux. Our studies suggest that a non-canonical p53 pathway plays a key role in the regulation of adipocyte metabolic flexibility. This finding is distinct from previous studies, which concentrated on mediating genotoxic stress responses related to cell death or senescence. These results also suggest that adipocyte dysfunction in obesity may be caused by prolonged activation of this non-canonical p53 pathway. Therefore, p53-suppression-based approaches that beneficially reprogram adipocyte metabolic homeostasis in obesity may provide a new strategy for treating obesity and other metabolic diseases, including type II diabetes.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>A working model for non-canonical p53 pathway-regulated adipocyte metabolic flexibility.</title><p>Nutrient starvation causes an AMPK-dependent p53 non-canonical pathway activation, which leads to the upregulation of LAL-mediated lysosome acid lipolysis.

It is not a surprise that these known regulators, which were identified in cancer cell studies, do not play significant roles in adipocytes. Instead, we found that p53 metabolic effects are mediated through its newly identified transcriptional target, LAL, which is an enzyme responsible for the breakdown of triglycerides and cholesteryl esters in lysosomes at pH 4.5–5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dubland and Francis, 2015</xref>). It is known that lipophagy-mediated acid lipolysis is involved in the degradation and turnover of lipid droplets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Singh et al., 2009a</xref>), particularly in hepatocytes. Prior studies have considered the major lipophagy function in adipocytes to be pre-adipocyte differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Singh et al., 2009b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zhang et al., 2009</xref>); however, the role of lipophagy in lipid droplet turnover in mature adipocytes remains unclear. The majority of studies have examined adipocyte lipolysis in relation to cytosolic neutral lipolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Schweiger et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Frühbeck et al., 2014</xref>). However, studies using knockout mouse models revealed residual lipolytic activity, independent of neutral lipolysis, and suggested that LAL may potentially be involved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Haemmerle et al., 2006</xref>). Further studies have shown that lipophagy can be induced by fasting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lettieri Barbato et al., 2013</xref>) or ISO stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lizaso et al., 2013</xref>) during 3T3-L1 adipocyte lipolysis. In addition, significant micro-lipid droplet (mLD) formation can be observed in 3T3-L1 adipocytes when stimulated by ISO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Marcinkiewicz et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Londos et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brasaemle et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Moore et al., 2005</xref>). Similar mLDs can be observed in the adipocytes of mice when treated with CL316,243 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wang et al., 2016</xref>), which provides a potential opportunity to engage lysosomes for mLD degradation. To investigate this idea, we generated LAL knockdown 3T3-L1 adipocytes and found that the cells had a decreased ISO-stimulated lipolysis in comparison to the WT controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). These data indicate that LAL is directly involved in overall lipolysis during ISO stimulation. Furthermore, previous studies of human subjects with different types and degrees of obesity have revealed a direct correlation between autophagic activity and insulin sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kovsan et al., 2011</xref>). Collectively, these studies indicate that LAL-mediated lysosome acid lipolysis plays a potential role in adipocyte lipid metabolism. Future studies need to clarify how LAL mediates the changes in glucose metabolism and mitochondrial functions and whether other p53 downstream targets exist.</p><p>Previous studies of non-adipocytes have suggested that glucose starvation causes p53 up-regulation, which is associated with p53 phosphorylation through AMPK or ATM (ataxia telangiectasia mutated) kinase-dependent pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jones et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Feng et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Feng et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Assaily et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Armata et al., 2010</xref>), and is mainly associated with p53 cell apoptosis. In the present study, we demonstrated AMPK is also necessary for this non-canonical p53 pathway. In this regard, metformin has been believed to reduce hepatic glucose production by AMPK activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zhou et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hundal et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Shaw, 2005</xref>) and it is a widely used anti-diabetic drug with clear benefits for glucose metabolism and diabetes-related complications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sivalingam et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Foretz et al., 2014</xref>), but the mechanisms underlying these pleiotropic benefits are complex and still not fully understood. Research findings related to metformin also vary greatly depending on the dosing and duration of treatment, with clear differences between acute and chronic administration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Foretz et al., 2014</xref>). Our studies show metformin treatment in adipocytes can activate p53 phosphorylation to some degree, but lead to the inhibition of fasting effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). This apparent discrepancy may be explained through a negative-feedback regulatory mechanism. Metformin treatment may cause a pre-condition of AMPK-p53 pathway inhibition, however, the molecular details remains to be determined in future studies. Nevertheless, our data support metformin acts through a p53-dependent mechanism to affect adipocyte glucose consumption and lactate production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E-F</xref>). AMPK seems to be a necessary factor for this non-canonical pathway, as a lower ATP/AMP ratio under fasting conditions can trigger the activation of AMPK, leading to the phosphorylation and transcriptional activation of p53. However, this finding cannot fully explain through AMPK-dependent mechanism in other challenging metabolic conditions, such as high-fat diet feeding, when a non-canonical p53 pathway is activated without a significant change in the ATP/AMP ratio. It is entirely possible that other factors are involved, which might also explain the regulation of LAL transcription observed in this study. More studies are needed to fully understand the mechanistic details of the process.</p><p>Lastly, previous research has established a tight association between obesity and cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Deng et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zwezdaryk et al., 2018</xref>).

In addition, 50% of cancer patients suffer from cachexia, which is a severe metabolic ‘wasting’ syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Vegiopoulos et al., 2017</xref>). Previous studies have reported that metformin has anti-cancer effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jalving et al., 2010</xref>). It will be interesting to further study the connection between non-canonical and canonical p53 pathways and determine whether one can lead to the activation of the other. Future studies about the effect of the tumor suppressor p53 on adipocyte cellular metabolism may help us better understand the links between obesity and cancer.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or <break/>reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>Mus. musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">B6.Cg-Tg(tetO-cre) (TRE-Cre mouse)</td><td valign="top">Jackson Laboratory</td><td valign="top">JAX stock #006234; <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_JAX:006234">IMSR_JAX:006234</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>Mus. musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>Adipoq</italic>-rtTA <break/>mouse</td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sun et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wang et al., 2013</xref></td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">A kind gift from Dr. Scherer.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>Mus. musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">B6.129P2-Trp53tm1Brn/J (floxed-<italic>Trp53</italic> mouse)</td><td valign="top">Jackson Laboratory</td><td valign="top">JAX stock #008462; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_JAX:008462">IMSR_JAX:008462</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">other</td><td valign="top">Doxycycline diet</td><td valign="top">BioServ</td><td valign="top">#S3888</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">other</td><td valign="top">Control diet</td><td valign="top">BioServ</td><td valign="top">#S4207</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">other</td><td valign="top">60% high-fat diet</td><td valign="top">Research Diets</td><td valign="top">D12492</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Cell line (mouse)</td><td valign="top">3T3-L1 cell line.

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by David James as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Vishwajeet Puri (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As the editors have judged that your manuscript is of interest, but as described below that additional experiments are required before it is published, we would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This is a very interesting study that breaks new ground related to a new role of p53 in regulating adipocyte metabolism. The experiments are well done, and appear to reveal a new axis of high importance in modulating mitochondrial flux and in turn whole body metabolism. In particular, p53 is shown to modulate the lysosomal acid lipase LAL expression which in turn regulates fatty acid availability for mitochondrial oxidation. Such regulation effects circulating glucose and fatty acid levels in fasting, thus controlling systemic metabolic control.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Subsection “Inducible adipocyte-specific p53 knockout (p53-iAKO) mice show decreased lipolysis after fasting and improved metabolic phenotypes upon high fat diet feeding”, Figure 7E: This is one of the most interesting data points, in that both blood FA and glucose are decreased in fasting. Is the decreased glucose due to decreased hepatic glucose output in agreement with the concept that fatty acids derived from adipocytes drive hepatic gluconeogenesis? Or increased glucose utilization in muscle? Have clamps been done to check on this hypothesis? Related to this issue of systemic metabolism, the p53-KO cells have more lactate production. What happens to the lactate in the in-vivo mouse model? Do they show elevated lactate in their circulation? Does it cause lactic acidosis in animals? The authors could provide at least a better picture of the overall in vivo metabolic profile in the KO mice?</p><p>2) In Figure 4, the authors claim that the change in lipolysis was not due to the traditional neutral lipolysis pathway, although knocking down LAL alone is not sufficient to suppress ISO stimulated lipolysis. Comparing blue bars in Figure 4D (control vs. ISO) shows that there is a significant increase in lipolysis that is independent of LAL/p53. Did the authors look at ATGL expression? The simultaneous knockdown of ATGL and LAL followed by induced lipolysis analysis would reveal the role of other lipases. Please show the total and phosphor-HSL and PLIN western blots (might be supplementary data?).</p><p>3) It is crucial to show the levels of phospho-p53 (instead of total), and p-AMPK in Figure 7B and C in the fat pads of the -/+ dox treated animals to support the conclusions. Western blots of phospho-p53 and phospho-AMPK are also crucial for interpreting the results among control, fasted, and refed animals and its correlation, as shown in Figure 7.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;An AMPK-dependent, non-canonical p53 pathway plays a key role in adipocyte metabolic reprogramming&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by David James as the Senior Editor and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there is one remaining issue that you may want to address before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>In your model figure you have &quot;Nutrient Availability&quot; leading to (arrow) AMPK, but in fact your hypothesis is that decreased nutrient availability is what causes AMPK activation. You may want to clarify this apparent inconsistency, since the model will get the attention of the readers and should be clear.

Specifically, we measured hepatic gluconeogenesis by using lactate tolerance test and glucose utilization by in vivo glucose uptake assay. We conclude the main cause of decreased glucose and FA levels is the glucose utilization, probably due to downregulated lipolysis in adipose tissue. We provide new data supporting the level of lactate was not up-regulated in p53-KO mice, and blood pH did not change either.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) In Figure 4, the authors claim that the change in lipolysis was not due to the traditional neutral lipolysis pathway, although knocking down LAL alone is not sufficient to suppress ISO stimulated lipolysis.

We measured ATGL expression levels and performed additional ATGL RNAi knockdown and double knockdown (LAL and ATGL) in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. It seems double knockdown significantly abolished lipolysis, but it was not as low as basal control. Therefore, we cannot completely rule out the potential possibility of other lipase that might be involved. Nevertheless, these data clearly demonstrate LAL-mediated lipolysis plays a key role in lipolysis. The detailed relationships among LAL and other lipases are interesting for future studies.</p><p>New total and phosphor-HSL and PLIN western blots have been added in Figure 4—figure supplement 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) It is crucial to show the levels of phospho-p53 (instead of total), and p-AMPK in Figure 7B and C in the fat pads of the -/+ dox treated animals to support the conclusions.

It needs to mention we demonstrate AMPK is the upstream signal pathway for metabolic p53 activation, however it is unclear how p53 affects AMPK pathway in a feedback manner. Our new data show p-AMPK was slightly lower in p53-KO mice, but not significant. Previously a number of publications reported some key components in AMPK pathway were the transcriptional targets of p53. Future studies are needed to rule out the relationship between these two pathways in adipocyte metabolism.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript has been improved but there is one remaining issue that you may want to address before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>In your model figure you have &quot;Nutrient Availability&quot; leading to (arrow) AMPK, but in fact your hypothesis is that decreased nutrient availability is what causes AMPK activation. You may want to clarify this apparent inconsistency, since the model will get the attention of the readers and should be clear. We will leave it to your decision if you wish to change this model cartoon or not. Once you have made that decision, we will be able to accept the manuscript for publication.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank reviewers for the comment on the model figure, and have changed “Nutrient Availability” to “Nutrient starvation”, which causes AMPK activation. This change has been updated in all files.</p></body></sub-article></article>
