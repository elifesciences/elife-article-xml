The receptor’s maximum response depends on the difference in agonist binding energy, O minus C. In nicotinic receptors, efficiency (η) represents the fraction of agonist binding energy applied to a local rearrangement (an induced fit) that initiates gating. In this receptor, free energy changes in gating and binding can be interchanged by the conversion factor η. Efficiencies estimated from concentration-response curves (23 agonists, 53 mutations) sort into five discrete classes (%): 0.56 (17), 0.51(32), 0.45(13), 0.41(26), and 0.31(12), implying that there are 5 C versus O binding site structural pairs. Within each class efficacy and affinity are corelated linearly, but multiple classes hide this relationship. η unites agonist binding with receptor gating and calibrates one link in a chain of coupled domain rearrangements that comprises the allosteric transition of the protein.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>acetylcholine</kwd><kwd>allostery</kwd><kwd>induced fit</kwd><kwd>receptor theory</kwd><kwd>dose-response</kwd><kwd>efficacy</kwd><kwd>affinity</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000135</institution-id><institution>NIH Blueprint for Neuroscience Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS-064969</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Auerbach</surname><given-names>Anthony</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Efficiency measures the fundamental link between agonist binding and protein conformational change, and in nicotinic receptors has 5 values that calibrate energy changes in the induced fit that triggers activation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The primary job of a receptor is to convert chemical energy from ligand binding into mechanical work of protein conformational change. Each agonist has two affinities that measure how strongly it binds to resting and active target sites, and an efficacy that measures how well it activates once bound (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cecchini and Changeux, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ehlert, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Foreman et al., 2011</xref>). A third agonist property, efficiency (η; eta), is the correlation between efficacy and affinity and is the receptor’s output/input energy ratio (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nayak et al., 2019</xref>). Here, we describe and interpret the distribution of η values estimated from concentration(dose)-response curves (CRCs) of adult-type skeletal muscle nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) activated by different agonists and having different binding site mutations.</p><p>AChRs are five subunit, ligand-gated ion channels that have two neurotransmitter sites in the extracellular domain (ECD), and a narrow equatorial gate in the lumen of the transmembrane domain (TMD) that governs the passive flow of cations across the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gharpure et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Unwin, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zarkadas et al., 2022</xref>). AChRs are allosteric proteins that alternate spontaneously between global off (C, closed-channel) and on (O, open-channel) conformations in which each neurotransmitter site binds agonists weakly (with low affinity; LA) or strongly (with high affinity; HA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cecchini and Changeux, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jackson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Phillips, 2020</xref>). The AChR neurotransmitter sites and gate are separated by ~60 Å, but both regions change structure and function within the gating isomerization, C<sub>LA</sub>⇄O<sub>HA</sub>.</p><p>In adult-type AChRs and without any bound agonists, the probability of the O conformation (P<sub>O</sub>) is small (~10<sup>–6</sup>) so baseline current is negligible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jackson, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nayak et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Purohit and Auerbach, 2009</xref>). However, when both agonist sites are occupied by the neurotransmitter ACh, the increase in favorable binding free energy realized in the spontaneous isomerization from C to O increases P<sub>O</sub> substantially (to ~0.96), to generate a cellular current (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Bind and gate.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Potential energy surfaces (landscapes) for receptor activation without (left) and with (right) bound agonists (<bold>A</bold>).

Energy and structure are related, and a longer term goal is to associate these energy changes with those in structure. Briefly, we use electrophysiology to compile a CRC and from the minimum, maximum and midpoint calculate the ligand’s LA and HA equilibrium dissociation constants for binding to C and to O (K<sub>dC</sub> and K<sub>dO</sub>). The logs of these are proportional to the LA and HA binding free energies, ΔG<sub>LA</sub> and ΔG<sub>HA</sub>. As shown below, agonist efficiency depends only on these two values.</p><p>Previously, it was observed that in AChRs the ratio ΔG<sub>LA</sub>/ΔG<sub>HA</sub> is approximately the same for a group of agonists despite wide variation in individual affinities and efficacies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jadey and Auerbach, 2012</xref>). Within this group, whose members included full agonists (like ACh), partial agonists (like nicotine) and extremely weak agonists (like choline), the binding free energy ratio was 0.51±0.01 (mean ± sd). That is, for all members in the group binding to O is ~two-fold stronger than to C, regardless of agonist affinity or efficacy. Additional experiments revealed two more groups having a shared binding energy ratio, either 0.58 (for example, epibatidine) or 0.46 (for example, tetramethylammonium) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Indurthi and Auerbach, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nayak et al., 2019</xref>). In these groups, agonist binding free energy increases by ~1.7 and ~2.2-fold in the channel-opening conformational change.</p><p>The observation of a common ΔG<sub>LA</sub>/ΔG<sub>HA</sub> ratio for even one group of ligands is remarkable because it implies that the only 2 events in receptor activation that involve the agonist directly - LA binding to C and the switch to HA that happens within gating - are not independent. Rather, the constant ratio indicates that the energy (structure) changes that underpin LA binding to C and HA binding to O are related (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Auerbach, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jadey and Auerbach, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Purohit et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Below, we define η empirically as the receptor’s output/input energy ratio, and propose that in AChRs it is the fraction of agonist binding energy applied to the mechanical work of a local rearrangement of the neurotransmitter site (an induced fit) that initiates the gating conformational cascade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nayak et al., 2019</xref>). In principle, η can be calculated from any CRC to estimate the degree of coupling between the maxima of receptor output (efficacy) and agonist input (affinity).</p><p>We measured η for various agonists of AChRs, both wild-type (wt) and following mutation of a binding site residue. Here we report 16 new values (shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1 table2">Tables 1 and 2</xref>) that, combined with 60 previous measurement describe a spectrum of 5 η classes. The presence of multiple η classes obscures the underlying correlations between affinity and efficacy and, further, suggests that there are multiple C versus O binding site structures. Importantly, the existence of efficiency classes highlights that binding and gating are energy-linked stages of a unified allosteric transition.</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Agonist efficiencies.</title><p><supplementary-material id="table1sdata1"><label>Table 1—source data 1.</label><caption><title>Agonist efficiency.</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx" xlink:href="elife-86496-table1-data1-v1.docx"/></supplementary-material></p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Agonist</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">EC<sub>50</sub> (μM) (sem)</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">P<sub>O</sub><sup>max</sup> (sem)</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">K<sub>dC</sub> (μM)</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">K<sub>dO</sub> (nM)</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">c</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">η</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">n</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">BzTMA<sup>a</sup></td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">1070 (200)</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">0.60 (0.05)</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">930 (112.0)</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">650 (90)</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">1424 (18.0)</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">0.51 (0.01)</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">3</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Dec<sup>b</sup></td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">190 (20)</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">0.79 (0.03)</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">90 (7.0)</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">140 (10)</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">643 (21)</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">0.41 (0.01)</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">4</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">SCh<sup>a</sup></td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">20 (3)</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">0.84 (0.02)</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">50 (4.0)</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">20 (1)</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">3177 (118)</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">0.45 (0.01)</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">3</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">BzTEA<sup>b+c</sup></td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">2 (0.1)</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">0.85 (0.02)</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">0.80 (0.3)</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">3 (2)</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">316 (14)</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">0.29 (0.00)</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">3</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">TriMAa<sup>b</sup></td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">16000 (1200)</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">0.78 (0.03)</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">7720 (316.0)</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">12580 (670)</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">615 (18)</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">0.57 (0.01)</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">4</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><p>Mean EC<sub>50</sub> and P<sub>o</sub><sup>max</sup> were measured from each CRC (intra-cluster interval duration histograms in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>), with standard error of mean (sem).

However, as described below (Figure 2), in AChRs these are composite reactions and are connected by a pair of local, induced-fit rearrangements of the agonist site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jadey and Auerbach, 2012</xref>).</p><p>For clarity, we define the universal agonist attributes affinity and efficacy. Affinity is the strength at which the ligand binds to its target site. In receptors ligands have two affinities, weak binding to C and strong binding to O (Figure 1). The corresponding binding free energies, ΔG<sub>LA</sub> and ΔG<sub>HA</sub>, are calculated (in kcal/mol) as +RT times the natural logarithms of the apparent K<sub>dC</sub> and K<sub>dO</sub>, where R is the gas constant and T is the absolute temperature (RT = 0.59 at 23 °C). For ACh at adult-type binding sites K<sub>dC</sub> = 174 μM (ΔG<sub>LA</sub> = −5.1 kcal/mol) and K<sub>dO</sub> = 29 nM (ΔG<sub>HA</sub> = −10.2 kcal/mol) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jadey and Auerbach, 2012</xref>).</p><p>Efficacy can be defined in several ways. Oftern, it is simply the high-concentration asymptote (maximum response) of an unnormalized CRC that in our experiments is P<sub>O</sub><sup>max</sup>. Considering just bind and gate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), this limit depends only on the fully-liganded gating equilibrium constant L<sub>2</sub> so this constant, too, defines agonist efficacy (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ5">Equation 4a</xref>). Another definition derives from considering the full cycle of receptor activation. In adult-type AChRs the 2 neurotransmitter binding sites are approximately equivalent and independent and there is no significant input of external energy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nayak and Auerbach, 2017</xref>), so<disp-formula id="equ1"><label>(1)</label><mml:math id="m1"><mml:mrow><mml:mfrac><mml:msub><mml:mi>L</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:msub><mml:mi>L</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:msub><mml:mi>K</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mi>C</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:msub><mml:mi>K</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mi>O</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:mo>.</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>The subscripts of the gating equilibrium constants (L) refer to the number of bound agonists, and the equilibrium dissociation constant (K<sub>d</sub>) ratio is called the coupling constant (c).

Insofar as K<sub>dC</sub> and K<sub>dO</sub> apply generally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), η is a universal agonist attribute that depends only on these two constants. In AChRs, K<sub>dC</sub> and K<sub>dO</sub> are set mainly by energy changes in a pair of local rearrangements of the binding site (the catch-and-hold induced fit), with η being the fraction of the total used to initiate the allosteric transition of the receptor. As such, η calibrates the fundamental connection that defines receptor action.</p><p>Converting ligand binding energy into energy for an otherwise unfavorable protein conformational change is an induced fit. We assume that without an agonist present, both catch and hold rearrangements (of an aromatic pocket) are energetically unfavorable and generate the high barrier to unliganded opening (Figure 1). In enzymes, a fraction of substrate binding energy is used to promote a local protein rearrangement that stabilizes the reaction transition state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Richard, 2022</xref>). In AChRs, neurotransmitter binding energy is divided equally between two stages of an intrinsically unfavorable rearrangement that forms the LA and HA complexes and starts the gating isomerization. In brief, η quantifies the split in ligand binding energy between the two steps in the catch-and-hold induced fit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>η classes</title><p>Agonists having radically different resting affinities and efficacies can have the same η. For example, ACh (K<sub>dC</sub> = 175 μM, PO<sub>m</sub><sup>ax</sup> = 0.96) and choline (K<sub>dC</sub> = 4 mM, PO<sub>m</sub><sup>ax</sup> = 0.05) both divide their binding energy equally between catch and hold. In AChRs, agonists segregate into discrete ηclasses within which all members use approximately the same fraction of their post-diffusion binding energy for catch. So far we have identified 5 η classes with catch percentages ranging from 47% to 71% (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Below, we discuss the possibility that larger ligands apply a larger percentage of their binding energy to catch.</p><p>η classes are notable because its two component energy changes (Equation 3) are realized in bind and in gate, usually considered to be qualitatively different processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Nevertheless, the existence of an η class indicates that in AChRs these two binding energy (structure) changes are correlated and joined in a linear free energy relationship (LFER) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Any change in bind (catch) free energy compels one in gate (hold), reciprocally. Rather than being independent processes, bind and gate are completely entangled even if they are depicted as different dimensions of a reaction scheme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).</p><p>Although an empirical η value can be calculated for every agonist of every receptor, the generality of η classes is less certain. The components, K<sub>dC</sub> and K<sub>dO</sub> for many agonists, have not been measured extensively in other receptors, but some results suggest that a catch-and-hold induced fit, with stages linked in a LFER, is not uncommon.</p><p>Regarding hold, it is likely that an increase in affinity caused by a local binding site rearrangement inside the gating isomerization is typical (AC<sub>LA</sub>⇄AC<sub>HA</sub>). In enzymes and receptors, agonists induce a ‘clamshell’ closure of the ligand site that is associated with increased binding strength (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Armstrong and Gouaux, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Masiulis et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Pless and Lynch, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Traynelis et al., 2010</xref>). Also, in many receptors agonists increase the opening rate constant as well as P<sub>O</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Clements et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Clements and Westbrook, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Maconochie et al., 1994</xref>) indicating that the stabilization by the lgiadn of an otherwise unfavorable rearrangement (the affinity increase) occurs early in the isomerization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Finally, in other receptors an AC<sub>HA</sub> intermediate state has been detected directly in single-channel currents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lape et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Shi et al., 2023</xref>) or identified in structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sauguet et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Regarding catch, this first step in the induced fit serves a purpose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>) and may also pertain to other receptors. As in AChRs, in several receptors k<sub>on</sub> to C is slower than diffusion and correlated with agonist potency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dravid et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Grewer, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lewis et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mortensen et al., 2010</xref>). Further, a catch-and-hold LFER is implied in other receptors (including a GPCR; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sykes et al., 2009</xref>) because efficiency plots are linear, with outliers that possibly indicate different η classes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nayak et al., 2019</xref>). In biological reactions, LFERs are empirical descriptors and more experiments are needed to determine the generality of η classes. In addition to measurements of K<sub>dC</sub> and K<sub>dO</sub> in other receptors, and identifying the structures of intermediate liganded states <sup>A</sup>C and AC<sub>LA</sub> would corroborate catch.</p><p>In AChRs, multiple η classes together preclude the appearance of a global affinity-efficacy correlation. If η classes turn out to be common, then the consensus view that there is no correlation between these agonist properties needs to be reexamined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Colquhoun, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kenakin and Onaran, 2002</xref>). The clear correlation between log affinity and log efficacy within each class vanishes when agonists from different classes are lumped together (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).</p><p>We detected 5 η classes in AChRs but additional experiments could reveal more. In particular, agonist classes with the highest and lowest η values have the greatest scatter and could be amalgams. Nonetheless, the ability to corral 76 different agonist-receptor combinations into just 5 classes represents a significant reduction in complexity. If nothing else, η is a useful way to classify agonists and, possibly, binding sites. Also, η could prove to be useful CRC analysis because it allows EC<sub>50</sub> to be computed from P<sub>O</sub><sup>max</sup> and <italic>vice versa</italic> by using (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ4">Equation 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ5">Equation 4a</xref>, <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ6">Equation 4b</xref>, <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ7">Equation 4c</xref>, <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ8">Equation 4d</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Indurthi and Auerbach, 2021</xref>).</p><p>Mutations of binding site residues segregate into the same 5 efficiency classes as do agonists. This supports the idea that an agonist at a binding site is much like an ordinary side chain, with exceptions. Most importantly, agonists are not linked covalently and so are both hypermobile in the pocket and free to come and go to serve as a signal. Also, by definition a bound agonist is more stable in O versus C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) but this is the opposite of most AChR wt side chains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Purohit et al., 2013</xref>). η measurements reinforce the standard view that ligands only perturb the intrinsic activity of allosteric proteins.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>η and structure</title><p>In AChRs, the pair of structural changes at the binding sites associated with energy changes in hold (ΔG<sub>HA</sub>-ΔG<sub>LA</sub>) and in catch (ΔG<sub>LA</sub>) are not known with certainty. Although there are structures of apo-C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zarkadas et al., 2022</xref>) and desensitized (perhaps the same as AO<sub>HA</sub>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Auerbach, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Rahman et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zarkadas et al., 2022</xref>), those of the three relevant liganded-closed intermediate states <sup>A</sup>C, AC<sub>LA</sub> and AC<sub>HA</sub> are not available. Here, we discuss inferences about the structures of these three transient states that can be made from η.</p><p>If every agonist had a unique η then little could be said about the underlying conformational changes. However, the existence of an η class and, therefore, an LFER between catch-and-hold energy changes suggests that the corresponding structural changes, too, are correlated, although perhaps not linearly. That is, catch and hold are two related stages of a single induced fit rearrangement of the binding site.</p><p>Regarding hold, at HA sites loop C covers (‘caps’) the aromatic pocket (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Nys et al., 2013</xref>) that appears to be contracted. Also, simulations suggest the possibilities that in the hold step the ligand flips its orientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tripathy et al., 2019</xref>), and that water is extruded from the binding interface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Young et al., 2007</xref>). The components of the hold free energy change arise from these and other restructuring events, but the breakdown is not known. Regarding catch, little is known about this rearrangement directly because the structures of neither end state have been solved. (Note that apo-C and <sup>A</sup>C are different). However, because of the LFER, we hypothesize that all or some of the above putative rearrangements in hold (cap, contract, flip, de-wet) also happen in catch, but perhaps to lesser extents.</p><p>A surprising inference about the binding site structural change comes from measurements of agonist association rate constants (k<sub>on</sub>) to C versus O (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Grosman and Auerbach, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nayak and Auerbach, 2017</xref>). Whereas k<sub>on</sub> to C is slower than diffusion and correlated strongly with agonist potency, k<sub>on</sub> to O is approximately at the diffusion limit and weakly agonist dependent. Hence, slow association to C cannot be attributed to the ligand itself but rather suggests that the hold stage of the induced fit removes a barrier(s) that otherwise prevents free entry of the ligand into the aromatic binding pocket (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Neither the site of the encounter complex nor the nature of this barrier are known. Because loop C capping and pocket contraction would be expected to decrease rather than increase k<sub>on</sub>, we speculate that in AChRs other, still-unidentified structural changes in hold serve to remove the barrier. Removing loop C eliminates activation by agonists but not unliganded gating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Purohit and Auerbach, 2009</xref>). Apparently, clamshell closure is necessary for transducing ligand binding energy into the receptor isomerization, but not for the global isomerization itself. However, it is uncertain if other rearrangements in the binding site induced fit occur in unliganded gating after loop C removal (see below).</p><p>Energy change reflects a change in structure, so multiple η classes (logK<sub>dC</sub>/logK<sub>dO</sub> ratios) imply there are multiple pairs of C versus O (post-catch and post-hold) binding site conformations. The existence of 5 discrete ΔG<sub>LA</sub>/ΔG<sub>HA</sub> ratios indicates that there are at least this many AC<sub>LA</sub>/AC<sub>HA</sub> binding site structural pairs. Possible combinations that give rise to 5 η classes are (number of AC<sub>LA</sub>/number of AO<sub>HA</sub>) 1/5, 2/3, 3/2, 4/2, and 5/1. For example, with the 1/5 combination a single AC<sub>LA</sub> binding site structure selects its target AO<sub>HA</sub> structure from among 5 alternatives.</p><p>The discrete distribution of η classes suggests that the structural changes in the two stages of the induced fit also are discrete rather than continuous. The AChR allosteric transition combines elements of induced fit (use of binding energy to drive a local rearrangement) and conformational selection (constitutive activity and the adoption of pre-existing target structures) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Changeux and Edelstein, 2005</xref>).</p><p>The binding energy increase (in hold) occurs at the onset of the channel-opening gating isomerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Grosman et al., 2000</xref>). The existence of multiple, distinct C versus O structural pairs at each binding site indicates that the end states in the simple activation scheme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) do not represent single stable structures but rather ensembles made up of receptors having at least five distinct binding site structural pairs. This raises the possibility that there could be five isomerization pathways that might culminate in five different structural perturbations of the gate region. Although there is no evidence in AChRs of any agonist-dependent variations in output properties (conductance or ion selectivity), in other receptors functional output is agonist dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kenakin and Christopoulos, 2013</xref>). Efficiency measurements of these receptors would test the possibility that η classes are associated with the phenomenon of biased agonism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ehlert, 2018</xref>).</p><p>Finally, regarding the agonist (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), there is a trend for those with cationic centers that occupy smaller volumes <italic>in vacuo</italic> to have greater η (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Indurthi and Auerbach, 2021</xref>). That is, agonists with larger volumes tend to use a greater fraction of their binding energy for catch. In AChRs and other receptors, the volume of the binding pocket appears to be smaller in O versus C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tripathy et al., 2019</xref>), so it is also possible that unfavorable VdW interactions caused by pocket contraction guide the selection of (for example) the target O structure, to decrease η. The relationship between catch and hold energy change and the corresponding structural elements (agonist, protein, water) is complex and further investigations are needed.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Extending η</title><p>The catch-and-hold LFER implied by an η class indicates that structure (energy) changes in these two binding site rearrangements are related. Microscopic reversibility demands that if catch promotes hold, then hold promotes catch. Below, we present evidence suggesting that this bidirectional linkage is the tip of an iceberg, and that the entire AChR activation cascade - from an agonist at the encounter complex to water at the gate (<sup>A</sup>C to AO) - is linked as an extended, multi-stage LFER (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>There have been several proposals in AChRs regarding structural changes that link the neurotransmitter sites and the gate, but these are difficult to assess because they are without corroborating energy measurements. Likewise, η measurements reveal a binding-gating energy link at the agonist site, but lack corroborating structural information. However, separate activation domains in AChR activation have been identified. For instance, η calibrates the catch-hold connection at the agonist binding site, mutations decouple the ECD-TMD interface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cymes and Grosman, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Shi et al., 2023</xref>) and interactions between gate residues and pore water have been investigated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Beckstein and Sansom, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rasaiah et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yazdani et al., 2020</xref>). Analyses of the gating transition state suggest that there are 5 discrete domain rearrangements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). In opening, hold is followed by movements of the ECD, TMD, gate region, and, finally, pore water and membrane lipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gupta et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Evidence for the extended LFER hypothesis is the experimental measurements of k<sub>on</sub> to C versus O. As mentioned above, when an unliganded AChR opens constitutively, k<sub>on</sub> increases to approach the diffusion limit, and also loses its agonist dependence. This indicates that with loop C intact, adopting the global O shape in the absence of agonists is sufficient to induce the local change in structure that removes the entry barrier, in hold. That a distant mutation (for example, of a gate residue) increases constitutive opening and also influences the ligand association rate constant is evidence that binding and gating are entangled.</p><p>This result, along with η and Φ measurements, leads us to propose that everything in the protein’s activation cascade, <sup>A</sup>C to AO, is energy-linked in a reversible, extended LFER. In this sequence, each individual domain energy change (rearrangement) influences those of its neighbors, bidirectionally. Usually, the first link in activation (after the encounter complex) is catch-and-hold, and the last is gate-and-water. However, in a LFER the consequence of a perturbation propagates both forward and backward, so a gate mutation would also perturb the agonist site and one at the ECD-TMD would induce rearrangements both there and at the gate. An extended LFER offers a way to transfer energy (change structure) over distance by using only local domain rearrangements. In AChRs, the allosteric transition appears to be a energy-coupled chain of domain rearrangements that crosses seamlessly the traditional divide between binding and gating. η is at the core receptor operation insofar as it links the induced fit with the conformational gating cascade, Φ reveals the cascade’s components (and the sequence of domain rearrangements), and k<sub>on</sub> to O reveals that a reverse cascade, gate→binding site, exists without agonists. Transit across the whole extended LFER is rapid (~5 μs; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lape et al., 2008</xref>), with each interemdiate states lasting on the order of 100 ns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gupta et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>There are many unanswered questions. We do not know the structural changes in the induced fit, or their energy consequences. Regarding agonists, we do not know the full spectrum of η classes, or their structural correlates. Regarding mutations, we do not know the reasons specific agonist/side chain combinations change η or whether mutations of additional residues (including at a distance from the agonist site) can also do so. Regarding binding sites, we know little about the location of the encounter complex, why agonists are more efficient at the fetal AChR neurotransmitter site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nayak et al., 2019</xref>), or η values in other subtypes of nicotinic receptor or atl allosteric modulator binding sites. The extended LFER hypothesis needs to be tested, with both structure and energy changes identified and quantified. Regarding other receptors, there are few reports of the key experimental values (K<sub>dO</sub>, k<sub>on</sub> to O, Φ) so it is unknown whether η classes, a staged induced fit, a conformational cascade, or an extended LFER apply generally. We anticipate that additional structure and energy measurements, in combination with computation, will reveal the molecular forces that underpin activation and lead to a deeper understanding of how ligands promote conformational change in allosteric proteins.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Expression</title><p>Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s minimal essential medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin–streptomycin (pH 7.4).

Since the goal was to measure the correlation rather than the magnitude difference between classes, Pearson’s correlation was used instead of Cohen’s. The P-value (two-tail) and r<sup>2</sup> value for that 3 agonist efficiency classes with &gt;2 elements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>) were 0.019 and 0.96 (<italic>η</italic>=0.56), &lt;0.0001 and 0.99 (<italic>η</italic>=0.51) and &lt;0.0001 and 0.99 (<italic>η</italic>=0.41). Significance for classes with &lt;3 data points (<italic>η</italic>=0.31 and 0.46) could not be determined. The p-value (two-tail) and r<sup>2</sup> value for mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>) were 0.0006 and 0.83(<italic>η</italic>=0.56), &lt;0.0001 and 0.98 (<italic>η</italic>=0.51), &lt;0.0001 and 0.97 (<italic>η</italic>=0.45), &lt;0.0001 and 0.93 (<italic>η</italic>=0.41), and &lt;0.0001 and 0.98 (<italic>η</italic>=0.31). η is the ratio of logarithms and as such is precise.</p><p>The position of the intermediate state AC<sub>LA</sub> in the catch-and-hold reaction sequence (1-η; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) is analogous to the position of the transition state (Φ orβ) in a single-step reaction. With Φthe intermediate state in the LFER is an energy barrier, whereas with η it is an energy well. Φ gives the fraction of the total energy change at ‡, and 1-η gives the fraction of the total energy change at AC<sub>LA</sub>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Agonists</title><p>Abbreviations: acetylcholine (ACh), trimethyl ammonium (TRiMA), tetramethyl ammonium, dimethylpyrrolidium (DMP), dimethylthiazolidinium (DMT), nornicotine, nicotinic (Nic), carbamylcholine (CCh), anabasine (Singh et al.), dimethylphenylpiperazinium (DMPP), benzyltrimethyl ammonium (BzTMA), choline (Cho), 3-hydroxypropyltrimethylammonium (3-OH), 4-hydroxybutyltrimethylammonium (4-OH), dimethylthiazolidinium (DMT), dimethylpyrrolidium (DMP), succinylcholine (SCh), decamethonium (Dec), epiboxidine (Ebx), epibatidine (Ebt), cytisine (Cyt), tetraethyl ammonium (TEA), tetramethyl phosphonium (TMP), varenicline (Var) and benzyltriethyl ammonium (BzTEA), Choline (Cho).

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including László Csánady as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Kenton Swartz as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Andrew J R Plested (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. Generality</p><p>The authors repeatedly state that the concept of efficiency is generally applicable, but this is not demonstrated. Moreover, &quot;efficiency&quot; (eta) is defined in multiple different ways. E.g.: (i) In the Table 1 legend: &quot;eta=1-logKdC/logKdO&quot;. That definition is certainly applicable to any receptor, as KdC and KdO values always exist. (ii) On line 325: &quot;efficiency is the correlation between affinity and efficacy. It is a universal parameter that applies to every agonist of every receptor.&quot; Not only is the latter definition not shown to be universally applicable, but it is not even meaningful: the data presented here shows that affinity and efficacy are not &quot;correlated&quot;, as their ratio can scatter between &lt;0.3 and &gt;0.6 (Figure 7B). Thus, the authors should more exactly define what they mean by &quot;the concept of efficiency&quot;, and clearly spell out what is generally true vs. what is shown to be true specifically for the nAChR and only assumed to be true in general.</p><p>2. Definition of eta-classes</p><p>One concern is related to the statistical treatment of the measured and calculated values.</p><p>No statistical evaluation (SD, confidence intervals, p-values) is given for the calculated metrics- KdC, KdO, c, eta. Surely, the errors of the values used in calculations should propagate to the resulting calculus results. Uncertainty of these calculated metrics matter because based on them principal conclusions are made. It is not clear at all if variability of efficiencies would affect grouping of them as shown in Figure 7. Presenting the points with the error bars would give the reader a test of how confident one could be in groups of efficiencies.</p><p>The reviewers are concerned about the clustering of the data set into exactly five classes. First, the statistical treatment of the measured and calculated values is a major concern. The symbols in the efficiency plots (Figures 5a-b, 7a-b) lack error estimates: no statistical evaluation (SD, confidence intervals, p-values) is given for the calculated metrics KdC, KdO, DDG, or eta. Surely, the errors of the values used in the calculations should propagate to the resulting calculated variables. Uncertainty of these calculated metrics matter because based on them principal conclusions are made. It is not clear if the variability of efficiencies would affect grouping of them as shown in Figure 7. Presenting the points with the error bars would give the reader a taste of how confident one can be in the grouping of efficiencies. Second, even without error estimates, if the dots in Figure 5b were not color coded they would not appear to be segregated into exactly five clusters each of which fall on distinct straight lines. Third, there is no theoretical foundation for the existence of a discrete number of eta-classes as opposed to a continuum of possible eta values: the catch&amp;hold LFER model presented in Figure 2 does not predict this.</p><p>3. Uniqueness of the catch&amp;hold LFER model</p><p>The authors do not discuss the uniqueness of the proposed catch&amp;hold LFER model (Figure 2) used for data interpretation. It seems that the existence of eta-classes might be explained just as well by an alternative model which assumes a single gating mechanism for the receptor, but distinct patterns of ligand-protein interactions for the different agonists (see Review Figure linked to the decision letter). This fact should be acknowledged, or if data exist to differentiate between these possibilities they should be presented and discussed.</p><p>4. Differentiating new from old data</p><p>The authors should clearly indicate what new data and what old data are included in each figure so the readers can judge the claimed advance. Replotting old data in a new way is acceptable, but throughout the manuscript it should be clearly spelt out what are actual new data and what are published data that have been replotted.</p><p>5. Clarity of presentation</p><p>All three reviewers have pointed out numerous places where the presentation is unclear. The paper would benefit from a major re-writing along the following specific guidelines: the authors should (i) provide only a single definition for a given variable (e.g., eta), (ii) avoid introduction of unnecessary parameters (e.g., kappa), (iii) expose the theory in a single block in the main text (e.g., in Intro or beginning of Results), and (iv) address specific comments regarding lack of clarity raised in all three reviews.</p><p>Finally, the reviewers feel that the attached movie does not provide additional information relative to that presented in the paper, and it is also much longer than a typical concise summary video. Thus, linking it to the manuscript seems unnecessary.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. What exactly is plotted in Figure 7b? What does the x axis represent?</p><p>2. Normalization (line 577): &quot;The free energies DeltaG(LA) and DeltaG(HA) (Figure 1B), proportional to logKdC and logKdO, are each a sum of a ligand-protein binding energy and a chemical potential that incorporates the energy consequence of removing the ligand from solution&quot;.</p><p>Shouldn't DeltaG(LA) and DeltaG(HA) actually represent standard free energies of binding, which are devoid of the log-concentration term? (The expression -RT*lnKeq gives standard free energy change.)</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>There are many interesting points made – it is not necessarily new to think of agonists like mutations but this paper underlines the similarity.</p><p>1. One criticism I have is exemplified by statements like the following:</p><p>line 214 &quot;Every agonist of every receptor has an affinity, efficacy and efficiency.&quot;</p><p>line 39 &quot;Recently, a third universal agonist property, efficiency (; eta), was introduced as the correlation between affinity and efficacy&quot;</p><p>I know that these assertions make sense to the authors. On paper, they seem reasonable. But they are not tested. There is no general demonstration. There is no information that they apply to any other receptor. Of course, the senior author's lab has developed tools over decades to test these ideas in muscle nicotinic receptors. And this is a totally valid approach. But we have no information about whether this concept is universal or special to the nAChR.</p><p>I am not expecting the authors to go back and prove that this idea is general for this paper. But the statements could be toned down because they lack evidence.</p><p>As a side note, how would this apply for example to g-protein coupled receptors? Is it generally applicable to receptors with co-ligands, co-factors? Is it applicable for other types of receptors? Or is it limited to (in as much as I mean, only useful for) ion channel receptors with nice gating properties. I think the reader deserves an honest assessment. Can it be reasonably concluded that it is too difficult to assess these properties in other systems?</p><p>A related problem is that, as was discussed in the past, the citations are overwhelmingly papers from the senior author's own lab. I did not count the percentage. It's close to half, I think. I know that there is some justification for this, but it speaks against the generality of the work. It suggests that this concept is in fact rather narrow.</p><p>2. Overall I am not sure why the treatment oscillates in the paper between kappa and eta. It took me quite a long time reading to recognise that kappa = 1 – eta and this makes understanding this technical work a tick harder.</p><p>I would stick to one and only mention the other in exceptional circumstances.</p><p>3. line 202 We measured kappa and eta in AChRs having wild-type (wt) binding sites for 5 previously unstudied agonists</p><p>I think this is the wrong way to put it. Decamethonium has been studied a great deal (e.g. https://www.pnas.org/doi/pdf/10.1073/pnas.75.6.2994), as has SCh. Do you mean, comparatively understudied by single channel recording? But there were already a few papers…</p><p>4. It would be nice in Figure 3 to note the voltage, and the mutants that are employed. It's not the same mutant for each curve. I think these records should have been recorded at +70 mV (as described in the methods, to avoid block) but the openings are downwards. Is this right? Inward currents that were flipped? Sorry, I think I have something backwards but I don't understand.</p><p>5. line 341 The main results are as follows. (1) Empirically, efficiency is the log-log correlation between affinity and efficacy. It is a universal parameter that applies to every agonist of every receptor.</p><p>Is that a result that is shown in this paper? Same goes for result (2) in this list, which seems not to be a result from this paper but rather a postulate taken on the basis of existing results.</p><p>6. line 317 &quot;Figure 7A shows a kappa-plot for all mutations that have been measured so far.&quot;</p><p>I'm confused. This panel includes results from previous work. There are &gt;50 measurements of Kappa in Figure 7. But there are not 50 measurements of mutants in Table 2-supplement 1 and anyway nearly half of those in the table are repeats on different agonists. Can you be explicit about the mutants that are in Figure 7? The strength of the conclusion that the groups are the same for binding site mutations and for agonists rests on a more precise report of what is plotted here.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>First of all, I would like to compliment the Authors for producing an impressive set of experimental data. The amount of single channel recordings produced is truly formidable.</p><p>One concern is related to the statistical treatment of the measured and calculated values. Only the EC50 and Po estimates have standard errors of the mean presented in Table 1. However, no statistical evaluation (SD, confidence intervals, p-values) is given for the calculated metrics- KdC, KdO, c, nu. Surely, the errors of the values used in calculations should propagate to the resulting calculus results. Uncertainty of these calculated metrics matter because based on them principal conclusions are made.</p><p>It is not clear at all if the variability of efficiencies would affect the grouping of them as shown in Figure 7. Presenting the points with the error bars would give the reader a test of how confident one could be in groups of efficiencies.</p><p>One example of the problems related to the statistical treatment is the following. A dissociation rate constant, koff, value used in calculations is 15,000 1/s. The Authors accept that it is approximate (lines 556 and 557), however, no standard deviation or confidence intervals are given. Surely, the error of this value should propagate into all calculated values where k<sub>off</sub> is used. On the other hand, k<sub>off</sub> was estimated and is approximately the same for few agonists tested in Jadey &amp; Auerbach 2012 but is it the same for many more agonists in this study?</p><p>Another concern about this manuscript is that it is written in a very confused and convoluted style. The manuscript is very difficult to follow. The entire section of 'Theory' in the results and a corresponding section in the Methods should be united (for fluency of reading) and use more straightforward and exact language. Indeed, I might have misunderstood some of the arguments the Authors make and I'm not sure I fully understood the theoretical background.</p><p>Here are a few comments in order of appearance I wrote down before giving up. It is in no way an exhaustive list.</p><p>Line 36: It is not clear what 'Receptor theory' refers to.</p><p>Lines 38-39: efficiency- universal agonist property. Is it really universal? There is no supporting evidence for that beyond the AChR receptor analysed in this particular framework advocated by the authors.</p><p>Lines 46-47: activation to a first approximation… What is activation to a second and further approximations?</p><p>Lines 49-50: 'regions change structure and function conjointly'. It is not a very clear expression. Do authors say that conformation of both- binding site and gate- change concertedly/instantaneously? Does the binding site change conformation as well when spontaneous opening happens?</p><p>Line 53-55: sentence is very unclear. Is reference to Figure 1 supposed to show an increase in Po and membrane current? What exactly does 'membrane current' in this sentence mean? Is the reference to Figure 1 supposed to be to Figure 1A to demonstrate 'favorable binding free energy to O…'? Yet it is not clear from Figure 1A what it is.</p><p>Lines 55-57: very confusing sentence. 'Asymptotes of CRC' come out of the blue and a nonexpert reader could be left very disconcerted.</p><p>Lines 58-59: Without finishing proper introduction (Introduction will continue in a paragraph below) the Authors declare what their intention is. The intention 'is to estimate free energy changes associated with each step in the process'. At this stage we have no idea what 'the process' is and even less idea about the steps in 'the process'. The rest of this paragraph does not get much clearer.</p><p>Line 64: 'weak/strong ratio': ambiguous.</p><p>Lines 108-109: 'two apparently independent steps'- do the Authors mean events? Surely, there are more than two steps in the scheme in Figure 1B.</p><p>Figure 1, text and several equations: it is not clear why L is used for efficacy in this manuscript despite the fact that letter E is used in the field and, indeed, in an earlier paper by the same authors.</p><p>Words 'bind' and 'gate' seem to be used in a very liberal way.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.86496.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>New statistics Ln 258 (Figure 4A), 291-297 (Figure 4B), 345-349 (Figure 7A), 353-355 (Figure 7B).

Presenting the points with the error bars would give the reader a taste of how confident one can be in the grouping of efficiencies. Second, even without error estimates, if the dots in Figure 5b were not color coded they would not appear to be segregated into exactly five clusters each of which fall on distinct straight lines.

Rather, schemes and patch clamp recordings are approximations that do not reflect the reality of proteins. In a scheme, each capital letter (state) represents an ensemble and each arrow (transition) contains intermediates, both of which are invisible in recordings. Figure 2A and SI Figure 2 expand the standard scheme to allow us to interpret experimental measurements that are aggregates (DG<sub>LA</sub>, DG<sub>HA</sub>, k<sub>on</sub>, F). One needs to imagine 5 stable C/O pairs and jittering intermediate transitions between states having ns-us lifetimes.
