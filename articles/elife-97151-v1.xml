X-linked intellectual disability (XLID) is often ascribed to neuronal deficits, but here we report that expression of human and mouse ZDHHC9 orthologs is far higher in myelinating oligodendrocytes (OLs) than in other CNS cell types. <italic>ZDHHC9</italic> codes for a protein acyltransferase (PAT), and we found that ZDHHC9 is the most highly expressed PAT in OLs. Wild-type ZDHHC9 localizes to Golgi outposts in OL processes, but other PATs and XLID mutant forms of ZDHHC9 are restricted to OL cell bodies. Using genetic tools for OL progenitor fate tracing and sparse cell labeling, we show that mice lacking <italic>Zdhhc9</italic> have grossly normal OL development but display extensive morphological and structural myelin abnormalities. Consistent with the hypothesis that these deficits are OL-autonomous, they are broadly phenocopied by acute <italic>Zdhhc9</italic> knockdown in cultured conditions. Finally, we found that ZDHHC9 palmitoylates Myelin Basic Protein (MBP) in heterologous cells, and that palmitoylation of MBP is impaired in the <italic>Zdhhc9</italic> knockout brain. Our findings provide critical insights into the mechanisms of <italic>ZDHHC9</italic>-associated XLID and shed new light on the palmitoylation-dependent control of myelination.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>palmitoylation</kwd><kwd>S-acylation</kwd><kwd>intellectual disability</kwd><kwd>oligodendrocyte</kwd><kwd>myelination</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS125202-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Thomas</surname><given-names>Gareth M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS089586</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kang</surname><given-names>Shin H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/03e8tm275</institution-id><institution>Shriners Hospitals for Children</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>87400PHI</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Thomas</surname><given-names>Gareth M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000863</institution-id><institution>Ellison Medical Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AG-NS-1101-13</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kang</surname><given-names>Shin H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Loss of ZDHHC9, a protein acyltransferase that is highly expressed in oligodendrocytes, does not grossly impact myelination but markedly alters oligodendrocyte morphology and myelination at the micro/nano-scale.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Mutations in the <italic>ZDHHC9</italic> gene cause XLID (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baker et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Raymond et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Masurel-Paulet et al., 2014</xref>). XLID-associated <italic>ZDHHC9</italic> mutations include nonsense mutations and missense mutations affecting key amino acids, as well as splice site mutations, insertions, and deletions that result in frameshifts. Importantly, all these genetic changes are predicted to be loss-of-function. These findings suggest that ZDHHC9 is essential for higher brain function.</p><p>Given that many XLID genes are neuronally enriched (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Devys et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Budreck and Scheiffele, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Toya et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Rusconi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Guarnieri et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Murphy et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bienvenu et al., 2002</xref>), an a priori hypothesis is that ZDHHC9 acts in neurons. However, patients with <italic>ZDHHC9</italic> mutations have grossly normal gray matter (GM) but reduced brain white matter (WM) volume, especially in the corpus callosum (CC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baker et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Raymond et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Masurel-Paulet et al., 2014</xref>). <italic>ZDHHC9</italic> mutations are also linked to cerebral palsy, a condition in which intellectual disability is often associated with WM impairment (WMI) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jiang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Odding et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">van Eyk et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">McMichael et al., 2015</xref>). These findings raise the possibility that ZDHHC9 may be crucial for normal WM development and/or proper function of oligodendrocytes (OLs), the myelin-forming CNS glia abundant in WM. Notably, <italic>Zdhhc9</italic> knockout (KO) mice exhibit WM volume reductions and seizure-like activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kouskou et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Shimell et al., 2019</xref>), as well as behavioral phenotypes seen in other mouse models of ID (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kouskou et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, <italic>Zdhhc</italic>9 KO mice have the potential to serve as an excellent model for human ZDHHC9 mutations. However, their phenotype is yet to be fully characterized.</p><p><italic>ZDHHC9</italic> codes for a protein acyltransferase (PAT), an enzyme that catalyzes the modification of protein cysteine residues with palmitate and related fatty acids. This process, termed palmitoylation (also known as <italic>S-</italic>palmitoylation or <italic>S</italic>-acylation), plays a critical role in targeting proteins to specific subcellular membrane locations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Linder and Deschenes, 2007</xref>). Nearly 30 years ago, it was reported that major myelin proteins in the nervous system, including Proteolipid protein (PLP), Myelin basic protein (MBP), Myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG), and Myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG), are palmitoylated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bizzozero and Good, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agrawal et al., 1983</xref>). However, at that time, methods were lacking to define the roles of palmitoylation of these proteins in myelin formation and function. Later proteomic studies revealed many other palmitoylated myelin proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Wan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gorenberg et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Edmonds et al., 2017</xref>), and an isolated study suggested that palmitoylation targets myelin proteins to the plasma membrane of cultured OLs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Schneider et al., 2005</xref>). Despite these findings, little is known regarding how myelin protein palmitoylation is regulated and the functional importance of this process for higher brain function.</p><p>We hypothesized that ZDHHC9-dependent palmitoylation plays a critical role in proper myelination and WM formation. Consistent with this notion, we report that ZDHHC9 is the most highly expressed PAT in mouse and human OLs. Moreover, ZDHHC9 localizes to puncta in OL processes that are likely Golgi outposts, whereas other PATs tested and <italic>ZDHHC9</italic> XLID mutant forms are restricted to OL cell bodies. These findings may explain why <italic>ZDHHC9</italic> loss of function cannot be compensated by other PATs. In mice lacking <italic>Zdhhc9</italic>, we did not detect changes in OL lineage cell generation or total MBP expression levels, but we found that at the micro-scale <italic>Zdhhc9</italic> KO OLs are dysmorphic and myelin ultrastructure is highly abnormal, with both hypo- and hypermyelination of axons in WM tracts. We show that with the help of Golga7, a ZDHHC9 partner protein that also localizes to Golgi outposts, ZDHHC9 robustly palmitoylates the major myelin protein MBP, and that MBP palmitoylation is impaired in <italic>Zdhhc9</italic> KO brain. Palmitoyl- and total levels of another myelin protein, Myelin-associated Glycoprotein (MAG) are also affected by <italic>Zdhhc9</italic> KO, suggestive of a broader deficit in myelin protein regulation and organization in these mice. Interestingly, the XLID mutant ZDHHC9-P150S still palmitoylates MBP in a Golga7-dependent manner in transfected non-neuronal cells, raising the possibility that impaired subcellular localization in OLs, rather than impaired catalytic activity, may cause or contribute to WM abnormalities in some cases of <italic>ZDHHC9-</italic>associated XLID. Together, our findings provide new insights into mechanisms of <italic>ZDHHC9</italic>-associated XLID and the palmitoylation-dependent control of myelination, a process first reported decades ago, but about which almost nothing is known.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Cell-specific transcriptomics reveals that ZDHHC9 and its partner protein GOLGA7 are enriched in oligodendrocytes in the mouse and human brain</title><p>To assess <italic>Zdhhc9</italic> expression in OLs, we performed FACS using cerebral cortex (CTX) of P30 <italic>Mobp-EGFP</italic> BAC transgenic (Tg) mice, which express EGFP only in mature OLs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gong et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kang et al., 2013</xref>).

Like 21.5 kDa MBP, the 17.0 kDa form of MBP contains a cysteine residue and may be subject to palmitoylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akiyama et al., 2002</xref>).

This latter finding is consistent with a report ascribing Cadm4 palmitoylation to a different PAT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chang et al., 2022</xref>). Together, these results suggest that ZDHHC9 directly palmitoylates MBP with the support of Golga7 and that <italic>Zdhhc9</italic> loss impairs MBP palmitoylation.

Surprisingly, though, ZDHHC9-R96W palmitoylated MBP only approximately 50% as effectively as ZDHHC9wt in the presence of Golga7. Moreover, ZDHHC9-P150S did not differ significantly from ZDHHC9wt in its ability to palmitoylate MBP in the presence of Golga7.

Moreover, autopalmitoylation (sometimes used as a surrogate marker of ZDHHC-PAT activity) of ZDHHC9wt and ZDHHC9-P150S also did not differ significantly in the presence of Golga7, suggesting that ZDHHC9-P150S may have sufficient catalytic activity to drive palmitoylation of an array of substrates.

However, knowledge of the cellular/molecular processes controlled by XLID-associated gene products is often limited. The cognitive deficits and epilepsy that are hallmarks of <italic>ZDHHC9-</italic>associated XLID are often ascribed to malformations of neocortical gray matter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Stevenson et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Guerrini and Dobyns, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lim and Crino, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Zhang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Juric-Sekhar and Hevner, 2019</xref>). Indeed, ZDHHC9 is expressed in a subset of forebrain neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Doyle et al., 2008</xref>), and ‘<italic>Zdhhc9</italic> knockdown’ primary hippocampal neurons display impaired dendritic branching and an altered ratio of excitatory-to-inhibitory synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Shimell et al., 2019</xref>). However, there is an increasing appreciation that ID can also result from impaired WM formation and/or function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Shangguan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Wong, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Yu et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Spencer et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Soldán and Pirko, 2012</xref>). Consistent with this notion, both ZDHHC9 and its partner protein Golga7 are far more highly expressed in OLs than in other CNS cell types, in both mice and humans (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E and F</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Zeisel et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>). In support of a key role for ZDHHC9 in normal WM formation and function, we found that <italic>Zdhhc9</italic> KO does not affect axon number in the CC, but greatly impacts microscale OL morphology and myelin ultrastructure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref>—<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>). We recognize that using conventional <italic>Zdhhc9</italic> KO mice, in which <italic>Zdhhc9</italic> is globally deleted, cannot directly address whether impaired myelination in these mice is due to a cell-autonomous role for ZDHHC9 in OLs, a role for ZDHHC9 in neurons, or a combination of these factors. However, the impaired OL morphology and maturation seen in culture conditions after acute <italic>Zdhhc9</italic> loss (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) supports the first of these possibilities. While a conditional KO mouse could more directly help test the OL-autonomous role of ZDHHC9 in vivo, in this study, we focused on conventional KO mice to more accurately mirror the situation in human patients with <italic>ZDHHC9</italic> loss or mutation.</p><p>It is perhaps surprising that, despite the clear changes in OL morphogenesis, we did not detect changes in overall numbers of OPCs or OLs in <italic>Zdhhc9</italic> KO mice. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that such changes could be revealed by different methods. In addition, different OL subtypes express different subsets of other marker genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Soldán and Pirko, 2012</xref>) and it remains possible that <italic>Zdhhc9</italic> loss preferentially directs OL maturation towards or away from one or more of these subtypes. Furthermore, we cannot exclude the possibility that assessment of other brain regions might also reveal differences in OPC and/or OL numbers in <italic>Zdhhc9</italic> KO mice. Lastly, we also note that acute <italic>Zdhhc9</italic> loss in cultured OLs causes more striking phenotypes than seen with KO mice in vivo. However, it is not uncommon for acute knockdown to cause more dramatic effects than germline KO, possibly due to longer-term compensatory mechanisms in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">George et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Elias et al., 2006</xref>). Together, though, our findings suggest that OL and WM abnormalities could significantly contribute to <italic>ZDHHC9</italic>-associated XLID.</p><p>We also recognize that although <italic>Zdhhc9</italic> loss affects OL morphology both in vitro and in vivo, the specific nature of these changes differs between the two systems (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>). However, several non-mutually exclusive factors could account for these differences. First, morphology in vivo may well be influenced by the axons and/or other extrinsic components around each OL that are not present in our primary cultures. Second, OL growth in vivo is highly 3-dimensional, whereas growth in culture is largely 2-dimensional – it may be difficult to support formation of spheroids (by definition, a 3-dimensional structure) in the latter situation. Finally, ZDHHC9 is absent in vivo from the beginning of development until the time points examined, whereas in our cultured OL experiments, Zdhhc9 shRNA is virally delivered to OPC cultures at DIV2 and likely acutely affects Zdhhc9 expression predominantly in committed OLs (following the switch to differentiation medium at DIV3). These differences may also affect the ability of other PATs or, potentially, palmitoylation-independent subcellular processes, to compensate for Zdhhc9 loss. Further experiments, perhaps involving longitudinal imaging of the development of fluorescently labeled OLs in the two systems, could provide more insights into how <italic>Zdhhc9</italic> loss affects OL morphological elaboration.</p><p>Based on behavioral milestones, patients with <italic>ZDHHC9</italic>-associated XLID have been diagnosed as young as two years of age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Schirwani et al., 2018</xref>), suggesting that ZDHHC9 is important for higher brain function during early development. Consistent with this notion, we observed dysmyelination (both hyper and hypomyelination) in P30 mice, approximately equivalent to a 3-year-old human (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dutta and Sengupta, 2016</xref>). These findings suggest that the myelin abnormalities observed in adult <italic>Zdhhc9</italic> KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) are due to impaired initial myelination, rather than impaired myelin maintenance, and further support the use of <italic>Zdhhc9</italic> KO mice as a model for human <italic>ZDHHC9</italic>-associated XLID.</p><p>Although difficult to prove causation in a global, conventional KO line, the myelin abnormalities in <italic>Zdhhc9</italic> KO mice are also associated with behavioral impairments that have some overlap with human patients with <italic>ZDHHC9</italic>-associated XLID. Most notably, <italic>Zdhhc9</italic> KO mice have seizures, reminiscent of the rolandic epilepsy reported in many human patients with <italic>ZDHHC9</italic> mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baker et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Shimell et al., 2019</xref>). <italic>Zdhhc9</italic> KO mice also have impaired latency to reach a hidden platform in the Morris Water Maze (MWM), a task designed to assess spatial learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kouskou et al., 2018</xref>). However, the KO mice do not differ significantly in reference memory in a subsequent probe trial, suggesting that, despite the increased latency, they do learn the location of the platform as effectively as wt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kouskou et al., 2018</xref>). In addition, performance in both the open field and in an elevated plus maze (EPM, in which the KO mice spend significantly more time in the open arms) suggests that <italic>Zdhhc9</italic> KO mice also have decreased levels of anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kouskou et al., 2018</xref>). Decreased anxiety is reported in several other mouse models of ID (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Zang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Samaco et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Escorihuela et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Peier et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Altafaj et al., 2001</xref>). Finally, <italic>Zdhhc9</italic> KO mice spend significantly less time on a hanging wire task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kouskou et al., 2018</xref>), a phenotype consistent with hypotonia, a phenotype also reported in patients with <italic>ZDHHC9</italic> mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Raymond et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Masurel-Paulet et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Han et al., 2017</xref>). Like reduced anxiety, hypotonia is seen in several human neurodevelopmental conditions and relevant mouse models (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kouskou et al., 2018</xref> and references therein for a fuller discussion). While either OL-specific conditional KO of <italic>Zdhhc9</italic> or OL-specific rescue in a KO background would be required to determine causation. However, these findings are consistent with a model in which the impaired myelination in the absence of <italic>Zdhhc9</italic> causes behavioral abnormalities reminiscent not just of <italic>ZDHHC9</italic> mutation in humans, but also in other forms of ID.</p><p><italic>Zdhhc9</italic> is also expressed at higher levels than other PATs in OLs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C, E and F</xref>), potentially explaining much of the impact of <italic>Zdhhc9</italic> loss in these cells. However, it is also intriguing that ZDHHC9wt localization in OLs differs markedly from that of other PATs examined, and of three ZDHHC9 XLID mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). These findings suggest that specific subcellular localization of ZDHHC9wt is central to the role of this PAT in OLs and explain why other PATs, and ZDHHC9 XLID mutant forms cannot compensate for loss of ZDHHC9wt. This notion is further supported by our findings that the XLID-associated P150S and, to a lesser extent, R96W mutant forms of ZDHHC9 are still capable of palmitoylating MBP in cotransfected cells. Indeed, despite its reduced catalytic activity in an in vitro assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mitchell et al., 2014</xref>), ZDHHC9-P150S does not differ significantly from ZDHHC9wt in its ability to palmitoylate MBP, or to autopalmitoylate, in our cell-based assay. This residual autopalmitoylation, which was also observed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mitchell et al., 2014</xref>, suggests that ZDHHC9-P150S might still be capable of palmitoylating MBP and/or other substrates in OLs, if it were to be targeted to the correct subcellular location. Impaired subcellular targeting thus represents an additional possible contributory factor, not mutually exclusive with impaired catalytic activity, to explain impairments in ZDHHC9-associated XLID. More broadly, these results emphasize the importance of precise subcellular localization in palmitoylation-dependent regulation, a key take home message from prior studies by ourselves and others e.g., (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">George et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Zhang and Thomas, 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Furne et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>What, then, is the identity of the puncta in OL subcellular processes to which ZDHHC9wt can localize, but which other PATs and ZDHHC9 XLID mutants cannot? Our immunostaining results with subcellular organelle markers suggest that these puncta represent Golgi outposts or satellites, and that ZDHHC9’s key partner Golga7 also localizes to this location (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Govind et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fu et al., 2019</xref>). Golgi outposts have long been known in neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Horton and Ehlers, 2003</xref>), and we previously reported that ZDHHC9 localizes to such structures in primary hippocampal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Shimell et al., 2019</xref>). Golgi outposts were also recently described in OLs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Wang and Gleeson, 2020</xref>). However, the function of these structures in OLs remains to be fully determined, so the role(s) of ZDHHC9 at this subcellular organelle is challenging to infer. Nonetheless, we speculate that ZDHHC9 could be involved in either or both of the best-described roles of Golgi outposts, protein glycosylation and microtubule nucleation, for the following reasons. First, ZDHHC9-positive Golgi outposts in OL processes are also positive for the enzyme Mannosidase II, suggesting they represent sites at which protein glycosylation is regulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>). In addition, although ZDHHC9 colocalization with TPPP, a protein implicated in microtubule nucleation, is less apparent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C</xref>), knockout/knockdown of either ZDHHC9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>) or TPPP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fu et al., 2019</xref>) affects branching and complexity of OL processes, a process that involves microtubule nucleation. However, more investigation is needed to determine the functions of Golgi outposts in OLs, in order to define the associated contribution of ZDHHC9.</p><p>Another intriguing question is whether and how the loss of ZDHHC9 action at Golgi outposts might contribute to the myelination deficits we observed in <italic>Zdhhc9</italic> KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>). Our sparse genetic labeling studies revealed that <italic>Zdhhc9</italic> KO OL processes are distended, with numerous spheroid-like swellings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). We reason that these spheroids are enclosed by the OL lipid membrane because if the membrane were ruptured, the EGFP signal would likely diffuse. This, in turn suggests that the caliber of the OL process at the position of the spheroid is grossly abnormal, i.e., the membrane has hyper-expanded. Given that OL membrane growth during myelination extends in two directions, i.e., spiral growth to the axonal surface and longitudinal growth along the axon, it is possible that spheroid-like structures are formed by uneven myelin growth. We recognize that we cannot yet conclude whether and how spheroid formation might relate to the myelination deficit in Zdhhc9 KO mice that we observe by EM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). However, it is not inconceivable that the hypo- and hypermyelination of <italic>Zdhhc9</italic> KO axons seen in single-plane EM cross-sections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) represents this same distension phenotype, observed using a different method. Although beyond our current technical abilities, we speculate that EM-based reconstruction in three dimensions would reveal regions of both hypo- and hypermyelination of individual callosal axons in <italic>Zdhhc9</italic> KO mice.</p><p>How, though, might <italic>Zdhhc9</italic> loss cause dysmyelination? Several myelin proteins are palmitoylated, and we found that a ZDHHC9/Golga7 complex palmitoylates the major myelin protein MBP and that MBP palmitoylation is reduced in forebrain WM of <italic>Zdhhc9</italic> KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Given that palmitoylation can sort proteins to the myelin membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Schneider et al., 2005</xref>), the simplest explanation might be that impaired palmitoylation of MBP, and potentially other myelin proteins, in the absence of ZDHHC9 affects myelin structure per se. It would be of considerable interest to investigate whether and how <italic>Zdhhc9</italic> loss alters the distribution of specific MBP splice variants. However, the anti-MBP antibody used in this study recognizes all forms of MBP, not just the specific splice variants whose palmitoylation is affected by <italic>Zdhhc9</italic> loss. Specifically assessing nanoscale distribution of these splice variants would require a way (e.g. anti-MBP splice form-specific antibodies that are compatible with immuno-EM) to distinguish these variants from other, non-palmitoylated forms of MBP. Developing such an antibody could greatly facilitate future studies of nanoscale MBP distribution in the presence and absence of ZDHHC9.</p><p>We also observed slight but significant reductions in palmitoyl- and total levels of MAG in the absence of ZDHHC9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>), which may also contribute to impaired myelination. In contrast, ZDHHC9 loss did not alter palmitoyl- or total levels of Cadm4, a myelin protein whose palmitoylation is ascribed to the Golgi-localized PAT ZDHHC3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chang et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1C and D</xref>). This latter finding suggests that, although ZDHHC9 loss may affect additional myelin proteins, gross, widespread dysregulation of myelin protein levels and/or palmitoylation in the absence of ZDHHC9 is unlikely. Importantly, several mutant forms of ZDHHC9 fail to localize to Golgi outposts in OLs and lead to XLID, even when showing apparently normal catalytic activity. This latter observation is consistent with a model in which ZDHHC9 action at OL Golgi outposts is critical for normal myelination. An additional factor to consider, however, is that the key ZDHHC9 substrate(s) may not be the myelin proteins themselves, but rather other proteins that act at Golgi outposts to direct myelin proteins to the correct region of the myelin membrane and/or to ensure uniform distribution of myelin proteins within that membrane. Another non-mutually exclusive possibility is that ZDHHC9 acts at Golgi outposts but indirectly, for example, to drive the expression of myelin protein genes. A comparison of WT and <italic>Zdhhc9</italic> KO palmitoyl-proteomes could help determine which of these possibilities (which are not mutually exclusive) best accounts for impaired myelination in the absence of ZDHHC9.</p><p>Interestingly, despite their marked differences in basal catalytic activity (as assessed by autopalmitoylation), wt and all XLID forms of ZDHHC9 appear to show enhanced activity (measured by both auto- and MBP palmitoylation) in the presence of Golga7, suggesting that the association with Golga7 (which also localizes to Golgi outposts) is central to ZDHHC9 activity. This model is also highly consistent with the biased expression of Golga7 in OLs, compared to other CNS cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E and F</xref>). Moreover, XLID-associated mutant forms of ZDHHC9 also show reduced protein stability and are impaired in their ability to form complexes with Golga7 (also known as Golgi Complex Protein 16 kDa; GCP16)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Nguyen et al., 2023</xref>). ZDHHC9 XLID mutations may thus affect ZDHHC9 trafficking to Golgi outposts per se, but alternatively, or in addition, may decrease formation/stabilization of ZDHHC9/Golga7 complexes at these locations. Either or both of these mechanisms, which are not mutually exclusive, may contribute to impaired MBP palmitoylation and/or myelination deficits caused by <italic>ZDHHC9</italic> mutation.</p><p>In summary, we reveal an unexpectedly non-heterogeneous expression of <italic>Zdhhc9</italic> in both mice and humans, with biased expression in mature OLs. Moreover, within OLs, WT ZDHHC9 localizes uniquely compared to other PATs examined, and to XLID-associated forms of ZDHHC9. Although we did not detect changes in overall OL numbers or gross myelin staining, we found that <italic>Zdhhc9</italic> loss greatly impairs OL morphology and myelination at the microscale. These findings provide new insights into mechanisms of <italic>ZDHHC9</italic>-associated XLID and into other conditions marked by WMI.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice and rats</title><p><italic>Zdhhc9</italic> KO mice (B6;129S5-Zdhhc9tm1Lex/Mmucdm) were originally obtained from Mutant Mouse Resource and Research Center (MMRRC), UC Davis, and were previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Shimell et al., 2019</xref>).

To analyze potentially hypermyelinated small axons in P56 mice, g-ratio was calculated using the ratio of inner-to-outer diameter (distance values derived from pixel intensity along plot profile generated in ImageJ/Fiji) of each myelinated axon. To analyze myelination of all axons in P30 mice, inner and outer diameters of axons were traced manually in ImageJ/Fiji and the resultant diameters calculated.</p></sec><sec id="s4-17"><title>Acyl biotinyl exchange assay</title><p>HEK293T cells were transfected using a calcium phosphate-based method as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Thomas et al., 2012</xref>). The identity of this cell line was authenticated by ATCC using STR profiling and was found to be an exact match to CRL-3216 (HEK293T) in the ATCC STR database. The cells were tested for mycoplasma and were found to be negative. Cells were lysed 8 hr post-transfection and ABE assays performed as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Thomas et al., 2012</xref>. For WM tissue collection from <italic>Zdhhc9</italic> knockout and littermate control mice, mice were anesthetized with pentobarbital sodium (100 mg/kg, i.p). Brains were isolated and briefly rinsed with ice-cold HBSS buffer (no calcium, no magnesium). Using a Mouse Brain Slicer, 1 mm block coronal brain sections were prepared on ice and WM-enriched tissues, including corpus callosum and striatum were dissected from slices under a dissection microscope. Dissected WM tissue was homogenized in a glass-teflon dounce homogenizer (20 strokes, 200 rpm) in 4 mM HEPES, 0.32 M sucrose, containing freshly diluted Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (PIC; Roche). Homogenized samples were transferred to a fresh tube, rapidly brought to room temperature, and solubilized by addition of 1/10 volume of 10% (w/v) SDS. Samples were centrifuged for 10 min at 4 ºC at 13,000 rpm to pellet insoluble material and protein concentrations in supernatants determined by BCA assay (Pierce). Protein concentrations were normalized by addition of homogenization buffer containing SDS and PIC and were used for ABE assay as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Thomas et al., 2012</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-18"><title>Quantification and statistical analysis</title><p>All data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism software (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA).

After confirming the specific enrichment of the Zdhhc9 transcript in mouse and human OLs, the authors examine the subcellular localization of the protein in vitro and observed that in comparison with other isoforms, ZDHHC9 localizes at OLs cell bodies and at discrete puncta in the processes. These observations (Figures 1 and 2) led the authors to hypothesize that ZDHHC9 plays an important role in myelination. No gross changes were detected in OL development in Zdhhc9 KO mice and analyses from P28 Zdhhc9 KO mice crossed with Mobp-EGFP reporter mice did not show changes in EGFP+ OL differentiation (Figure 3).</p><p>However, and given the observed subcellular localization of ZDHHC9 in OL processes (Figure 2) and the observation that the percentage of unmyelinated axons is increased in Zdhhc9 KO (Figure 6), early time points to examine the differentiated pools of OLs and their capacity to extend processes/contact axons need to be considered.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this point, but due to the order in which experiments were performed, the ZDHHC9 KO mouse colony that we maintained after initial submission of this work contains homozygous MOBP-EGFP, but not the mT/mG transgene that would be most optimal for the proposed experiment. We hope the reviewer appreciates that it would take considerable time and effort regarding mouse breeding to cross out the MOBP and add back the mT/mG. We nonetheless appreciate the importance of the point raised and therefore examined an earlier developmental time point (P21, 3 weeks) to quantify OLs and NG2+ OPCs. In our updated Fig 3C1-C3, we use Mobp-EGFP mice to show that Zdhhc9 KO does not significantly affect the number of EGFP+ OLs at this time point in the cortex, corpus callosum and spinal cord. We also show that in corpus callosum, Zdhhc9 KO does not significantly affect the number of NG2+ OPCs at this earlier time point (Fig 3D, E). Furthermore, immunostaining to detect BCAS1, a marker of pre-mature OLs, also revealed no qualitative difference with ZDHHC9 loss at P21. We show representative images from these BCAS1 experiments in an updated Fig S3. While these new experiments do not address the morphology of OLs in Zdhhc9 KO, they do provide further evidence that deficits in myelination in young Zdhhc9 KO mice (Figure 6) are not likely due to gross differences in OPC or OL numbers during development.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Maturation of OL in Zdhhc9 KO was examined by crossing Zdhhc9 KO with Pdgfra-CreER;R26- EGFP and following the newly EGFP-labelled OPCs following tamoxifen administration. No changes in the numbers of EGFP+ OL were detected. The authors concluded that the loss of ZDHHC9 does not alter oligodendrogenesis in either the young or mature CNS. The authors observed defects in Zdhhc9 KO OL protrusions that they attributed to abnormal OL membrane expansion (Fig 4 and 5). Can they show evidence for this?</p></disp-quote><p>This is an important point, and we appreciate the opportunity to explain the reasoning behind our initial statement more fully, while noting that other explanations are possible. Fig 5B (an Imaris-assisted reconstruction using the EGFP cell fill/morphology marker) highlights large spheroid-like distensions along OL processes. We reason that these spheroids are enclosed by the OL lipid membrane because if the membrane were ruptured, the EGFP signal would likely diffuse. This in turn suggests that the caliber of the OL process at the position of the spheroid is grossly abnormal i.e. the membrane has hyper-expanded. Given that OL membrane growth during myelination extends in two directions, i.e., spiral growth to the axonal surface and longitudinal growth along the axon, it is possible that spheroid-like structures are formed by uneven myelin growth. We recognize that we cannot yet conclude whether and how spheroid formation might be linked to the myelination deficit that we observe in Zdhhc9 KO mice. However, defining the subcellular mechanism for spheroid formation may provide further insights into this issue. We have therefore largely retained the original statement but have added the reasoning above to our revised Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors report that Zdhhc9 KO primary and secondary branches in OL were longer, some contained spheroid-like swellings and the OL protrusion complexity was higher.

How to reconcile this?</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s interest in this issue. Several non-mutually exclusive factors could account for the differences in OL morphology in vitro versus in vivo caused by Zdhhc9 loss. First, morphology in vivo may well be influenced by the axons and/or other extrinsic components around each OL that are not present in our primary cultures. Second, OL growth in vivo is highly 3-dimensional, whereas growth in culture is largely 2-dimensional – it may be difficult to support formation of spheroids (by definition, a 3-dimensional structure) in the latter situation. Finally, Zdhhc9 is absent in vivo from the beginning of development until the time points examined, whereas in our cultured OL experiments, Zdhhc9 shRNA is virally delivered to OPC cultures at DIV2 and likely acutely affects Zdhhc9 expression predominantly in committed OLs (following the switch to differentiation medium at DIV3). These differences may also affect the ability of other PATs or, potentially, palmitoylation-independent subcellular processes, to compensate for Zdhhc9 loss. We have more fully explained these points in our revised Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>This study provides an in-depth exploration of the impact of X-linked ZDHHC9 gene mutations on cognitive deficits and epilepsy, with a particular focus on the expression and function of ZDHHC9 in myelin-forming oligodendrocytes (OLs). These findings offer crucial insights into understanding ZDHHC9-related X-linked intellectual disability (XLID) and shed light on the regulatory mechanisms of palmitoylation in myelination. The experimental design and analysis of results are convincing, providing a valuable reference for further research in this field. However, upon careful review, I believe the article still needs further improvement and supplementation in the following aspects:</p><p>(1) Regarding the subcellular localization experiment of ZDHHC9 mutants in OL, it is currently limited to in vitro cultured OL, lacking validation in vivo OL or myelin sheath. Additionally, it is necessary to investigate whether the abnormal subcellular localization of ZDHHC9 mutants affects their enzyme activity and palmitoylation modification of substrate proteins.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an important point but is technically challenging to address in vivo as it would likely require delivery of AAV to express ZDHHC9wt and XLID mutants specifically in OLs, preferably in the absence of endogenous ZDHHC9. We hope the reviewers would agree that this experiment is beyond the scope of the current study. However, we did compare the ability of ZDHHC9wt and XLID mutants to palmitoylate MBP, and to autopalmitoylate (sometimes used as a surrogate measure of PAT activity) in transfected heterologous cells. Although we recognize that this over-expression system is less physiological than a native OL, it has the benefit of being able to readily compare transfected wt vs mutant forms of ZDHHC9 with minimal contribution from endogenous ZDHHC9. Intriguingly, using this system, we found that autopalmitoylation activity of the XLID ZDHHC9-P150S mutant does not differ significantly from that of ZDHHC9wt, and that this mutant is still capable of palmitoylating MBP. Moreover, the R96W mutant, while impaired in autopalmitoylation, still palmitoylated MBP approximately 50% as effectively as ZDHHC9wt in our cell-based assay. These findings suggest that ZDHHC9-P150S and, probably, ZDHHC9-R96W mutants might still be able to palmitoylate substrates in OLs if they were properly localized. This possibility in turn suggests that impaired subcellular targeting in addition to, or instead of, impaired catalytic activity, may be a key factor in certain cases of ZDHHC9-associated XLID. We have expanded our Figure 8 (new panels 8E-G) to show these additional experiments and have summarized the conclusions above in our revised Discussion. We thank the reviewer for suggesting that we further investigate this issue.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The experimental period (P21+21 days) using genetic labeling to track the development of myelinating cells may not be long enough.

However, we note for the reviewer that our preliminary studies did not reveal any effect of Zdhhc9 KO on the number of MOBP-EGFP+ OLs in 6-month-old mice (not shown), consistent with a model in which Zdhhc9 loss does not affect OPC-OL commitment per se.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) The author speculates that Zdhhc9 may regulate myelination by affecting the membrane localization of specific myelin proteins, but lacks direct experimental evidence to support this.

The main protein we would implicate and seek to test is MBP, but we already found that there is no gross change in MBP distribution in vivo in Zdhhc9 KO mice (Fig 3A). However, an anti-MBP antibody recognizes all forms of MBP, not just the specific splice variants whose palmitoylation is affected by ZDHHC9 loss. Specifically assessing nanoscale distribution of these splice variants would require a way (e.g. anti-MBP splice form-specific antibodies that are compatible with immuno-EM) to distinguish these variants from other, non-palmitoylated forms of MBP. Although such an antibody could be an important tool, we hope the reviewers would agree that developing and characterizing such a reagent is beyond the scope of the current study.</p><p>We do, however, note that the lack of gross change in MBP distribution and levels in Zdhhc9 KO mice is consistent with the relatively mild phenotype of these mice, compared with shiverer (shi/shi) mice, in which MBP is completely lost. In shiverer, CNS compact myelin is almost absent (PMID: 671037; PMID: 88695; PMID: 460693) and, as the name suggests, mice display a shivering gait, and exhibit seizures and early death. In contrast, Zdhhc9 mice show only subtle behavioral deficits (PMID: 29944857). These differences are all consistent with a model in which Zdhhc9 KO mice, despite their significantly reduced MBP palmitoylation (Fig 8) have grossly normal distribution and levels of MBP when all splice variants are assessed (Fig 3, Fig 8). It is not inconceivable that Zdhhc9 KO mice have a nanoscale change in the distribution of MBP, particularly of specific palmitoylated splice variants, within myelin that profoundly affects myelin ultrastructure, without grossly altering MBP distribution. However, an alternative and not mutually exclusive possibility is that aberrant palmitoylation of other Zdhhc9 substrates accounts for, or contributes to, the abnormalities in myelin at the ultrastructural level. Addressing this issue would require a multi-pronged approach, not just to assess palmitoylation and distribution of such proteins in Zdhhc9 KO, but also to test whether they are direct Zdhhc9 substrates, in order to rule out indirect effects. We hope reviewers would agree that this is best left to a separate study. However, in our revised Discussion we now summarize what can be inferred regarding Zdhhc9-dependent effects on total and splicevariant specific distribution and levels of MBP.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Although the article mentions the association of Zdhhc9 with intellectual disabilities, it does not involve behavioral analysis of Zdhhc9 KO mice.

The behavior of the same ZDHHC9 KO mouse line that we used was reported in PMID: 31747610 and in PMID: 29944857.

Convincing evidence of a causative mechanism would require an exhaustive identification of ZDHHC9 in vivo substrates, followed by point mutation of substrate palmitoylation site(s) to determine the extent to which palmitoylation of such protein(s) phenocopies ZDHHC9 loss. Nonetheless, it is possible to break this question down and to summarize what we do and do not know. For example, our experiments in cultured OLs show that ZDHHC9 loss causes call-autonomous deficits in morphological maturation of these cells. We also know that ZDHHC9 loss results in impaired palmitoylation of MBP, a direct substrate for ZDHHC9. Moreover, loss of ZDHHC9 at Golgi outposts in OLs (a phenotype observed with several XLID-associated mutant forms of ZDHHC9, even those with no significant loss of catalytic activity) correlates with intellectual disability. Together, these findings are consistent with a model in which ZDHHC9 action at OL Golgi outposts is critical for normal myelination. However, it is yet to be determined whether the key substrates of ZDHHC9 include MBP, other palmitoyl-proteins that are key constituents of CNS myelin, or proteins whose palmitoylation is important for myelin protein trafficking and targeting. Another non-mutually exclusive possibility is that ZDHHC9 acts at Golgi outposts but indirectly, for example to drive the expression of myelin protein genes. Future experiments, including but not limited to palmitoyl-proteomics in ZDHHC9 (OL-specific) KO mice, will be needed to provide more definitive insights into this issue. We have expanded our Discussion of links between ZDHHC9 mutation and impaired myelination to summarize the above points.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) The function of ZDHHC9 in OL may be related to the Golgi apparatus, but its exact role in these structures is still unclear. It is suggested to discuss in more detail the role of ZDHHC9 in the Golgi apparatus in the discussion section.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this point, which we considered as related to point (5) above. In our revised Discussion we highlight how ZDHHC9 action at Golgi outposts may involve direct palmitoylation of myelin proteins, palmitoylation of proteins that direct myelin proteins to the myelin membrane and/or activation of gene expression programs that serve to drive myelination. We further note that these possibilities are not mutually exclusive.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) More experimental support and in-depth research are needed on the detailed mechanism of how ZDHHC9 and Golga7 cooperatively regulate MBP palmitoylation, and how this decrease in palmitoylation level leads to myelination defects.</p></disp-quote><p>This is another important point – our new experiments suggest that, although some XLID mutations markedly affect ZDHHC9’s ability to palmitoylate MBP, others do not, yet all of the mutant forms fail to localize to Golgi outposts. These findings are consistent with a model in which the subcellular location at which ZDHHC9 palmitoylates MBP, and potentially other substrates, is critical for normal myelination. Interestingly, despite their marked differences in basal catalytic activity (as assessed by autopalmitoylation), wt and all XLID forms of ZDHHC9 appear to show enhanced activity (measured by both auto- and MBP palmitoylation) in the presence of ZDHHC9, suggesting that the association with Golga7 (which also localizes to Golgi outposts) is central to ZDHHC9 activity. This model is also highly consistent with the biased expression of Golga7 in OLs, compared to other CNS cell types (Fig 1E, 1F). Moreover, XLID-associated mutant forms of ZDHHC9 also show reduced protein stability and are impaired in their ability to form complexes with Golga7 (also known as Golgi Complex Protein 16kDa; GCP16; PMID: 37035671). Failure of ZDHHC9 XLID mutants to localize to Golgi outposts may thus be due to aberrant trafficking of mutant ZDHHC9 per se, but may also involve impaired association/stabilization of ZDHHC9/Golga7 complexes at these locations. Again, it is possible that either or both of these mechanisms, which are not mutually exclusive, contribute to impaired MBP palmitoylation and/or myelination deficits. We summarize these points in our revised Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In summary, it is recommended that the authors address the above issues through additional experiments and improved discussions to further strengthen the credibility and clinical relevance of the article.</p><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>No gross changes were detected in OL development in Zdhhc9 KO mice and analyses from P28 Zdhhc9 KO mice crossed with Mobp-EGFP reporter mice did not show changes in EGFP+ OL differentiation (Figure 3). However, and given the observed subcellular localization of ZDHHC9 in OL processes (Figure 2) and the observation that the percentage of unmyelinated axons is increased in Zdhhc9 KO (Figure 6), ***early time points to examine the differentiated pools of OLs and their capacity to extend processes/contact axons need to be considered***.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this point, but due to the order in which experiments were performed, the ZDHHC9 KO mouse colony that we maintained after initial submission of this work contains homozygous MOBP-EGFP, but not the mT/mG transgene that would be most optimal for the proposed experiment. We hope the reviewer appreciates that it would take considerable time and effort regarding mouse breeding to cross out the MOBP and add back the mT/mG. We nonetheless appreciate the importance of the point raised and therefore examined an earlier developmental time point (P21, 3 weeks) to quantify OLs and NG2+ OPCs. In our updated Fig 3C1-C3, we use Mobp-EGFP mice to show that Zdhhc9 KO does not significantly affect the number of EGFP+ OLs at this time point in the cortex, corpus callosum and spinal cord. We also show that in corpus callosum, Zdhhc9 KO does not significantly affect the number of NG2+ OPCs at this earlier time point (Fig 3D, E). Furthermore, immunostaining to detect BCAS1, a marker of pre-mature OLs, also revealed no qualitative difference with ZDHHC9 loss at P21. We show representative images from these BCAS1 experiments in an updated Fig S3. While these new experiments do not address the morphology of OLs in Zdhhc9 KO, they do provide further evidence that deficits in myelination in young Zdhhc9 KO mice (Figure 6) are not likely due to gross differences in OPC or OL numbers during development.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors observed defects in Zdhhc9 KO OL protrusions that they attributed to abnormal OL membrane expansion (Fig 4 and 5).
