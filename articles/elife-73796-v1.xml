Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are abundant, and they are important mediators of disease progression and invasion. TAMs are polarized in situ to a tumor promoting and immunosuppressive phenotype via cytokine signaling and metabolic crosstalk from malignant epithelial cells and other components of the tumor microenvironment. However, the specific distinguishing features and functions of TAMs remain poorly defined. Here, we generated tumor-educated macrophages (TEMs) in vitro and performed detailed, multiomic characterization (i.e., transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics). Our results reveal unique genetic and metabolic signatures of TEMs, the veracity of which were queried against our in-house single-cell RNA sequencing dataset of human pancreatic tumors. This analysis identified expression of novel, metabolic TEM markers in human pancreatic TAMs, including ARG1, ACLY, and TXNIP. We then utilized our TEM model system to study the role of mutant Kras signaling in cancer cells on TEM polarization. This revealed an important role for granulocyte–macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and lactate on TEM polarization, molecules released from cancer cells in a mutant Kras-dependent manner. Lastly, we demonstrate that GM-CSF dysregulates TEM gene expression and metabolism through PI3K–AKT pathway signaling. Collectively, our results define new markers and programs to classify pancreatic TAMs, how these are engaged by cancer cells, and the precise signaling pathways mediating polarization.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>pancreatic cancer</kwd><kwd>tumor-associated

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Pancreatic cancer is the deadliest major cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Siegel et al., 2020</xref>). Early metastasis and insufficient detection methods compound an inability to effectively treat the disease, subjecting patients to a poor prognosis and high mortality rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rhim et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chan et al., 2013</xref>). The tumor microenvironment (TME), composed of a dense fibroinflammatory stroma, has been shown to contribute to the difficulty in treating this disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Feig et al., 2012</xref>). In fact, the numbers of malignant cancer cells within pancreatic tumors are typically exceeded by the immune and fibroblast populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Feig et al., 2012</xref>). Accordingly, recent efforts have sought to characterize these nonepithelial components of the TME in pursuit of identifying new and improved detection and treatment modalities. A predominant cell type of interest in the pancreatic TME are tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), a myeloid cell population that mediates therapeutic resistance and disease aggression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Di Caro et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Halbrook et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zhu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zhu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Beatty et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Candido et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>The impact of pancreatic TAMs on tumor growth and aggression has been relatively well established. As the major inflammatory component of solid tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Balkwill and Mantovani, 2012</xref>), TAM abundance correlates with worse response to pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Di Caro et al., 2016</xref>). The mechanisms by which TAMs mediate this outcome are rather diverse. For example, TAMs promote cancer cell proliferation and metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Qian and Pollard, 2010</xref>) and protect malignant cells from antitumor T-cell activity through immunosuppression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Candido et al., 2018</xref>). TAMs have also been linked to promoting chemoresistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zhu et al., 2014</xref>), and recent work by our groups demonstrated that these pancreatic TAMs are capable of directly inhibiting the effect of chemotherapy agent gemcitabine on cancer cells through their release of the pyrimidine nucleoside deoxycytidine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Halbrook et al., 2019</xref>). These unique immunosuppressive and metabolic characteristics of TAMs are attributed in part to the phenotypic rewiring macrophages experience in response to the pancreatic TME.</p><p>TAMs have long been considered anti-inflammatory ‘M2-like’ macrophages, with in vitro models occasionally polarizing naive macrophages with type-2 cytokines to study TAMs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Yuan et al., 2020</xref>). Although overlap exists between the phenotypes of M2 and TAMs, including oxidative metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Halbrook et al., 2019</xref>) and immunosuppressive properties, such as the expression of Arginase-1 (Arg1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arlauckas et al., 2018</xref>), the diverse molecular stimuli found throughout the TME polarize TAMs into macrophages with properties not shared with other classical subtypes. The focus of this study aimed to define the mechanistic aspects relating to TAM polarization by directly interrogating tumor cell–macrophage communication.</p><p>To recapitulate the signaling and metabolic factors present in the pancreatic TME, we polarized murine bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) in vitro with conditioned media from a PDA cell line in which we can regulate the activity of mutant Kras. We refer to macrophages polarized under these conditions as tumor-educated macrophages (TEMs) to distinguish them from TAMs arising in a tumor. We then utilized a systems biology approach integrating our multiomic profiling (i.e., transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics) to define biomarkers for, and the properties of, TEMs. Contrasting this with data from proinflammatory ‘M1-like’ and ‘M2-like’ macrophages revealed a panoply of markers and pathways that illustrate distinct functional characteristics of TEMs relative to classical subtypes. We then queried our in-house, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Steele et al., 2020</xref>) and verified the expression of several of these markers in human pancreatic TAMs, demonstrating persistence of the TAM phenotype across different species and pancreatic cancer models.</p><p>Further inquiry into the role of cancer cell mutant Kras activity in TEM polarization led us to observe an important function of a Kras-driven signaling protein (i.e., granulocyte–macrophage colony-stimulating factor, GM-CSF) and a metabolite (i.e., lactate) for the expression of several unique TEM markers. Finally, we show that GM-CSF instructs TEM gene expression and metabolism through the PI3K–AKT pathway. Together, these data provide new insights into the crosstalk pathways between cancer cells and macrophages and establish a mechanism by which malignant epithelial cells promote some of the most distinguishing features of TEM function.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>In vitro modeling and multiomic analysis of tumor-associated macrophages</title><p>To model pancreatic TAMs in vitro, we modified the classical BMDM differentiation and polarization paradigm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Celada et al., 1984</xref>), as follows (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). First, we isolated and plated bone marrow in media containing macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) to differentiate and expand macrophages for 5 days. These naive macrophages (M0) were then polarized to a tumor-associated phenotype for 2 days in conditioned media from PDA cells. Fresh media was included at a ratio of one to three parts conditioned media to account for nutrients consumed by the cancer cells. The resultant in vitro-derived cells are herein defined as TEMs, as they are educated by, and not directly associated with, cancer cells. Furthermore, the pancreatic cancer-conditioned media was generated from a cell line (iKras*3) derived from our murine pancreatic tumor model in which reversible mutant Kras expression is under the control of doxycycline (dox) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Collins et al., 2012</xref>).

We also assessed how the removal of Kras from the cancer cells, via dox withdrawal for 3 or 5 days, impacted TEM polarization. In parallel with the TEM polarization strategies, we also polarized M0 macrophages into the canonical in vitro phenotypes with 2-day treatment of either lipopolysaccharide (LPS; proinflammatory ‘M1’) or interleukin-4 (IL4; anti-inflammatory ‘M2’). M0 macrophages were maintained in the naive state by 2-day treatment with M-CSF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

TAMs are one of the most abundant cell types in PDA and participate in therapeutic resistance through a variety of mechanisms, including resistance to chemotherapy, immunosuppression, and promotion of tumor growth. However, the factors that contribute to the unique functional properties of TAMs remain insufficiently characterized.</p><p>Here, we employed a multiomic approach to molecularly define pancreatic TAMs. Bulk RNA sequencing, MS-based proteomics, and LC/MS-based metabolomics revealed several distinctions between TEMs and classical macrophage subtypes. Our focus on metabolism and cytokine signaling as two primary drivers of cellular function revealed Txnip, Acly, and Arg1 as unique contributors to TEM metabolism. The top 20 proteins correlated with Txnip showed enrichment in metabolism. Acly revealed strong correlation with Slc25a1, the mitochondrial citrate transporter, along with an increase in citrate abundance with respect to other macrophage subtypes, suggesting an important role for this pathway in TEM function. Arg1 was strongly correlated with Pik3cd, a catalytic subunit of PI3K, suggesting a role for this pathway in TEM polarization. Indeed, we also observe upregulation of several PI3K-related genes.</p><p>Next, we queried our in-house scRNA-seq dataset of human tumors, from which we observed expression of several important TEM markers in human TAMs. We also note expression of PI3K-related genes in human TAMs, indicating persistence of this pathway in macrophage polarization in clinically relevant models. As confirmation of the general understanding of TAMs, we see that proinflammatory markers are not substantially expressed in human TAMs, while anti-inflammatory markers are more abundant.</p><p>We then directed our attention to the features of pancreatic cancer cells that drive TEM polarization. Using our isogenic, dox-inducible mutant Kras PDA model, we polarized TEMs with conditioned media from either Kras-expressing or -extinguished cells. Indeed, we observed that the most distinct markers of TEM metabolism and cytokine signaling are reliant on Kras expression in PDA cells. Kras is known to impact cancer cell glucose metabolism and growth factor expression. Specifically, lactate and GM-CSF are known to be released from cancer cells in greater abundance when mutant Kras is expressed. By querying our bulk RNA-seq dataset, we observed several GM-CSF- or lactate-responsive genes differentially expressed in Kras-On TEMs compared to Kras-Off TEMs. We then investigated how these factors may affect the expression of significant TEM markers and found that naive BMDMs treated with GM-CSF displayed increased expression of <italic>Ccr1</italic>, <italic>Ccr5</italic>, and <italic>Acly</italic>. Further, BMDMs treated with both lactate and GM-CSF displayed increased expression of Arg1 and Txnip. These data suggest that TEM and TAM polarization occurs in response to both metabolic crosstalk and growth factor signaling, and build upon previous reports of the role of tumor-derived lactate in TAM polarization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Colegio et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>In consideration of the GM-CSF–PI3K pathway, and the strong correlation between Arg1 and Pik3cd, we treated BMDMs with either a PI3K inhibitor, AKT inhibitor, or GM-CSF-neutralizing antibody, and observed that both PI3K–AKT inhibition and GM-CSF neutralization reduced Arg1 expression relative to vehicle and IgG control, respectively. We also note changes in TEM metabolism in response to GM-CSF neutralization, most notably an increase in citrate, which may potentially be correlated with reduced <italic>Acly</italic> expression. Collectively, these data demonstrate an important role for mutant Kras in TEM and TAM polarization, and suggest that mutant Kras exhibits its most significant effects through increased release of GM-CSF and lactate from pancreatic cancer cells. This improved an understanding of epithelial–myeloid communication and distinct features of tumor-associated macrophages will hopefully provide new insights into potential pathways for exploitation to improve pancreatic cancer therapy.</p><p>Finally, it is important to note a few limitations in our current investigation of TEM activation in the pancreatic TME. First, the epithelial–myeloid axis provides only one node of the complex network of interactions in pancreatic tumors. In particular, fibroblasts make up a significant part of the overall cellularity of pancreatic tumors, and the heterogeneity of fibroblast populations are only now beginning to be understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Helms et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Garcia et al., 2020</xref>). Among these populations, many are noted to be strongly immunosuppressive, potentially providing another source of GM-CSF for the myeloid cells. Further, the pancreatic TME is characterized by poor vasculature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kamphorst et al., 2015</xref>). Future studies will be needed to address the impact of the resulting hypoxia and low-nutrient availability on the epithelial–myeloid signaling axis, features that were not well recapitulated using the cell culture-based approaches presented herein.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell culture</title><p>The dox-inducible (iKras*3) primary mouse PDA cell line used in this study was described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>).

These need to be greatly enhanced for publication as described below.</p><p>Figure 1 – Differential analyses refer to performing a one-way anova with dunnett's post-hoc test, but the methods describe DESeq2 analysis for the RNA-seq data. This should be clarified in the figure. The presentation for panels C / D would benefit from lines over the *** to clarify that comparisons are relative to the TEM population. In the heatmaps in D, it's unclear why the particular group of TEM is boxed or what comparisons are made to obtain the subset of genes/proteins that are plotted. Moreover, in absence of gene names these heatmaps do not provide considerable information. Recommend adding volcano plots, considering annotations of genes, or similar to help obtain biological insights from the heat maps presented.

The authors perform extensive metabolomics on cultured macrophages, correlate these findings with transcriptional and protein-level data, and connect the dots between Kras, GM-CSF, PI3K/AKT signaling, and the suppressive enzyme Arg1. They also find that GM-CSF and lactate are sufficient to synergistically induce Arg1 transcription.</p><p>Overall, these data support and extend a wealth of prior literature showing suppressive effects of GM-CSF on tumor-associated myeloid cells, including two seminal papers in Cancer Cell in 2012 reporting that pancreatic cancer cells secreted high levels of GM-CSF. GM-CSF can come from a number of sources in the tumor microenvironment, notably fibroblasts (PMID: 27184426), which are not modeled in the work as currently presented and should be mentioned in the discussion as a limitation/opportunity for future directions.</p><p>There are several limitations to the work that modestly detract from the authors' conclusions. First, the in vitro studies were performed in standard tissue culture conditions and the contribution of hypoxia was not addressed. This should be mentioned in the discussion in a paragraph about ways to improve the cross-talk in vitro model along with inclusion of other cell types such as fibroblasts. Second, the connection to human PDAC macrophages is tenuous. Examination of Supplemental Figure 3 reveals that both TXNIP and ACLY are robustly expressed across most cell types, and indeed all of the TEM macrophage genes shown here are shared with at least one other cell type. I believe the authors are trying to say that human PDAC macrophages show a signature of having been polarized by GM-CSF and lactate. It is possible that the other cell types in the tumor microenvironment are not the best comparison; a better strategy might be to compare macrophages differentiated from peripheral blood CD14+ cells +/- human PDAC conditioned media. Alternatively, the authors could examine macrophages from their chronic pancreatitis cohort (PMID: 34296197) or other non-PDAC tissue macrophages as a comparison to show the PDAC-induced upregulation of a TEM signature.</p><p>Line 140 and Figure 2B: What is an &quot;enzyme marker&quot;? Please define the specific enzymes that are differentially regulated in TEMs.</p><p>Lines 261-263: &quot;In addition, blocking GM-CSF led to a modest decrease in expression of ACLY and TXNIP (Figure 6B, Supplementary Figure 5B), which builds upon our M0 + GM-CSF + lactate qPCR data, in support of an activating role of GM-CSF on enzymatic TEM markers.&quot; Awkward phrasing. Please rewrite for clarity and remove the phrase &quot;enzymatic TEM markers&quot;.</p><p>Figure 6 legend: Please include a reminder to the reader what the drugs target (pan-PI3K inhibitor, BKM120; pan-AKT inhibitor, MK-2206).</p><p>Lines 266-267: GM-CSF blockade appears to have no effect on phosphorylated sugars as shown in Supplemental Figure 5C. Please modify this statement accordingly.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The paper by Boyer et al., is an excellent multi-omic approach to try to link changes in macrophage metabolism with RNAseq and proteomic changes. The authors show PDAC-cell derived cytokines (GM-CSF) along with metabolic mediators (lactate) regulate key features in macrophage phenotype and metabolism. This is overall an excellent study with high impact. I have no formal suggestion of new experiments needed, as the studies already done are excellent.

I would love to see them run traditional pathway analysis, GSEA on proteomics and RNAseq, and layer this into the story line. There are some hints at this with limited string analysis and Figure 2C.

In Figure 4, agin the data are excellent. But I would really love to see more formal pathway analysis and GSEA approaches to identify biologic process. And then I would love to see the authors comment on how these changes in biologic process, require or cross talk with the metabolism. Of course, this can take place in analysis added to results and commentary in the discussion.</p><p>3. There is some ambiguity in the results presented in Figure 2B-ED The legend and figure say genes and proteins. Which is it. Did the authors look for overlapping changes (ven diagram style) and then map these to the results? The authors should be explicit here what they did and it they are showing RNA or protein data.
