control. Commonly, one donor nerve is transferred to one target muscle. However, the transfer of multiple nerves onto a single target muscle may increase the number of muscle signals for myoelectric prosthetic control and facilitate the treatment of multiple neuromas. Currently, no experimental models are available. This study describes a novel experimental model to investigate the neurophysiological effects of peripheral double nerve transfers to a common target muscle. In 62 male Sprague-Dawley rats, the ulnar nerve of the antebrachium alone (n=30) or together with the anterior interosseus nerve (n=32) was transferred to reinnervate the long head of the biceps brachii. Before neurotization, the motor branch to the biceps’ long head was transected at the motor entry point. Twelve weeks after surgery, muscle response to neurotomy, behavioral testing, retrograde labeling, and structural analyses were performed to assess reinnervation. These analyses indicated that all nerves successfully reinnervated the target muscle. No aberrant reinnervation was observed by the originally innervating nerve. Our observations suggest a minimal burden for the animal with no signs of functional deficit in daily activities or auto-mutilation in both procedures. Furthermore, standard neurophysiological analyses for nerve and muscle regeneration were applicable. This newly developed nerve transfer model allows for the reliable and standardized investigation of neural and functional changes following the transfer of multiple donor nerves to one target muscle.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>nerve injury</kwd><kwd>peripheral nerve</kwd><kwd>nerve transfer</kwd><kwd>targeted muscle reinnervation</kwd><kwd>rat model</kwd><kwd>motor unit</kwd><kwd>prosthetic interfacing</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ERC Synergy Grant: No 810346</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Luft</surname><given-names>Matthias</given-names></name><name><surname>Tereshenko</surname><given-names>Vlad</given-names></name><name><surname>Festin</surname><given-names>Christopher</given-names></name><name><surname>Laengle</surname><given-names>Gregor</given-names></name><name><surname>Politikou</surname><given-names>Olga</given-names></name><name><surname>Maierhofer</surname><given-names>Udo</given-names></name><name><surname>Farina</surname><given-names>Dario</given-names></name><name><surname>Aszmann</surname><given-names>Oskar C</given-names></name><name><surname>Bergmeister</surname><given-names>Konstantin Davide</given-names></name><name><surname>Ibáñez</surname><given-names>Jaime</given-names></name><name><surname>Muceli</surname><given-names>Silvia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Chalmers Life Science Engineering Area of Advance</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Muceli</surname><given-names>Silvia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A murine model for a novel surgical concept demonstrates potential advances of neuroprosthetic interfacing.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Nerve transfers offer a variety of therapeutic possibilities in modern extremity reconstruction, such as treating peripheral nerve injuries, neuromas, phantom limb pain, improving prosthetic control, or restoring function following spinal cord injuries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aszmann et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Farina et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dumanian et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Van Zyl et al., 2019</xref>). Compared to conventional nerve repair modalities, nerve transfers are capable of bypassing slow peripheral nerve regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Terzis and Papakonstantinou, 2000</xref>), thus preventing irreversible muscle fibrosis before reinnervation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Mackinnon and Novak, 1999</xref>). For this purpose, nearby nerves with a sufficient axonal load and lesser functional importance are neurotomized and transferred to the injured nerve (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Oberlin et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bertelli et al., 1997</xref>). Because of overall faster regeneration and better functional outcomes compared to nerve grafting, this surgical procedure has been able to improve the devastating effects of peripheral nerve and brachial plexus lesions, which have otherwise often led to long-term health impairment and subsequent socioeconomic costs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Mackinnon and Novak, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Terzis and Papakonstantinou, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bergmeister et al., 2020</xref>). Additionally, they are used in a procedure termed targeted muscle reinnervation (TMR) to improve myoelectric prosthetic control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kuiken et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kapelner et al., 2016</xref>), treat neuromas or phantom limb pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Mioton et al., 2020</xref>). Here, amputated nerves within an extremity stump are transferred to residual stump muscles, thus significantly improving the recording of neural activity about motor intent and the control of myoelectric prostheses. Generally, one donor nerve is transferred to one target muscle head and this concept has been well studied with high clinical success (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kuiken et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aszmann et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Farina et al., 2017</xref>). The use of multiple nerve transfers to a single target muscle may further enhance TMR surgery. It could provide additional neuroprosthetic signals and overcome certain limitations in neuromuscular interfacing. Furthermore, transferring multiple nerves to a single target muscle may facilitate neuroma treatment, as not only one but multiple nerves are implanted in a muscle graft or residual limb muscle in an extremity stump (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Herr et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Although several nerve transfer models have been established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kuiken et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bergmeister et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aman et al., 2019b</xref>), none of them has investigated multiple peripheral nerve transfers in the upper extremity. Only one model where multiple donor nerves are used to restore muscle function in the rat hindlimb has been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kuiken et al., 1995</xref>). However, as most nerve injuries occur in the upper extremity, an upper extremity model for experimental investigation of this concept is needed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Scholz et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we propose a surgical nerve transfer model to allow the transfer of multiple donor nerves to a single muscle head and we validate this model in the rat forelimb. This model allows for reliable analyses with all standard neurophysiological investigations of the motor unit for possible implementation of this concept to clinical application.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Nerve transfer surgery</title><p>All animals survived the surgical nerve transfers and showed normal gait and grasping behavior in the 12-week follow-up period (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>).

We offer detailed step-by-step instructions on how to reproduce this model, including potential pitfalls. For comparison, the model also offers a description of a SNT to the same target muscle. We employed nerve crush, neurotomy, behavioral analysis, and retrograde labeling which indicated that neuromuscular regeneration of two donor nerves occurred into one target muscle.</p><p>To our knowledge, only one rat model for multiple peripheral innervation of a single target has been described. However, that previous model was for the lower extremity and did not provide a detailed description for step-by-step reproduction of the model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kuiken et al., 1995</xref>). Hindlimb models do not adequately represent the physiology of upper extremity nerve transfers and TMR procedures. The key differences between upper and lower extremities are amount of usage of the limbs, complexity of movement, weight-bearing, and of course sensorimotor circuitry. This notion is supported by the clinical discrepancy between the excellent outcomes for upper extremity compared to the poor outcomes for lower extremity nerve transfers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ray et al., 2016</xref>). Furthermore, most nerve transfers are currently conducted in the upper extremity for both nerve reconstruction and prosthetic control. We already established single peripheral nerve transfer models in the upper extremity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bergmeister et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aman et al., 2019b</xref>), which were considered for developing this novel model. For this purpose, we conducted anatomical dissections in eight rat cadavers to design the DNT concept to allow tension-free approximation of the two motor nerves to the target biceps muscle. Theoretically, many other target muscles are also feasible due to the sufficient length of both the UN and AIN. However, the biceps muscle provides an optimal target that is accessible for all standard structural and functional analyses and accurately represents a surgical target in clinical nerve transfer scenarios as well.</p><p>The implementation of this model requires an operating microscope, a set of microsurgery tools, and advanced microsurgical skills to achieve reproducible results. In our experience, dissection of the UN in the antebrachium can be performed in a straightforward manner and preservation of the motor branch to the flexor carpi ulnaris muscle, the dorsal sensory branch, and the ulnar artery is easily feasible. Subsequently, transecting the UN as distally as possible allows for tension-free coaptation to the proximal target muscle. Exposure of the MCN’s motor branch to the long head of the biceps is best achieved in the bicipital groove by retracting the overlaying pectoral muscles medially. Here, considerable care must be taken when dividing the two bicep heads to preserve the bicipital artery, which enters the long head in the distal portion and advances in proximal direction. Injury to this vessel has shown to affect functional measures in previous experiments. Another hazard in the DNT model is potential injury of the median vessels in the cubital fossa. To prevent this scenario, special attention is required during the dissection of the median nerve, because the median vessels are either found directly beneath or above the nerve. It is mandatory to dissect the AIN intraneurally to its proximal branching point to enable tension-free coaptation to the original motor point of the biceps. Due to the target to donor nerve diameter discrepancies, we chose to suture the donor nerves to the motor entry point epimysially. In previous models, this approach led to reliable reinnervation of the target muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bergmeister et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Our behavioral observations indicate that the procedures did not cause extraordinary distress or pain under adequate analgesia postoperatively. As early as 1 week after surgery, behavioral testing was carried out in randomly selected individual animals, and all of them achieved the maximum score. Likewise, after a 12-week regeneration period, all animals from both the control and the experimental DNT group achieved the maximum score of Terzis grooming test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Inciong et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). Hence, it seems that two motor nerves of different origins governing the same muscle did not hamper activities of daily living. Additionally, no substantial pain or neuroma pain was evident. When comparing the two procedures, it takes only marginally longer to perform the DNT, while no additional physical stress or motor deficits were observed postoperatively.</p><p>The donor nerves reinnervated the target muscle within 12 weeks in all animals as indicated macroscopically during dissection and by the fact that nerve crush or neurotomy induced fasciculations of the muscle (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">Videos 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video4">4</xref>). Likewise, intramuscular retrograde labeling showed the uptake and transport of tracer dye into the motor neuron columns of the two transferred nerves. Retrograde labeling further indicated that the overall number of motor units was reduced to 75.47% in SNT but increased to 119.26% in DNT compared to the untreated control side. Most interestingly, there was a statistically significant increase of 58.02% in motor units following DNT compared to SNT. This suggests that DNT may be more likely to sufficiently innervate muscle fibers and furthermore potentially increase myosignals for prosthetic interfacing, as has been previously shown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bergmeister et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, after 12 weeks, muscle mass of the UN reinnervated muscles only recovered to 80.25% of the contralateral side. This is in contrast with previous studies performed by the authors of this work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bergmeister et al., 2019</xref>). A possible explanation for this mismatch is the difference of the levels at which the UN was cut and transferred in the two studies. Unlike in the previous study where the entire UN was transferred, here the UN was transferred at the wrist level. This may have caused that the donor nerve was not able to fully regenerate the long head of the biceps due to the lower motor axon numbers. Detailed analyses exist for humans, where the UN at wrist level only contains 1226±243 motor axons compared to the entire UN (2670±347) whereas the MCN contains 1601±164 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gesslbauer et al., 2017</xref>). Considering that the muscle mass of double reinnervated muscles regenerated to 98.83%, it appears that the two donor nerves were better able to reinnervate and adequately restore 24.72% more muscle mass than the SNT. This additionally indicates that both SNT and DNT procedures were successful and that DNT with a high axonal load may lead to higher muscle reinnervation and functional regeneration.</p><p>Previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bergmeister et al., 2019</xref>) reported neuroma formation at the insertion point following nerve transfer. These consisted presumably mainly of sensory axons and the surplus of motor neurons which was not able to innervate motor endplates. We did not observe neuroma formation in this study and believe, that this is because the donor nerves comprised only a few sensory axons and the donor-to-recipient ratio of motor axons and targets was more balanced than in the previous study, as mentioned above. Therefore, we assume that no fibers were lost at the insertion site to the muscle, which may have formed a neuroma. Although the question of the optimal donor-to-recipient ratio for optimal outcome remains unsolved, further investigations in this surgical model are ongoing to answer this question and contribute to the surgical refinement of nerve transfers.</p><p>The presented nerve transfer model finds broad application in many research fields. It offers the possibility to investigate basic neurophysiology, but also clinical applications of surgical nerve transfers for biological reconstruction. Additionally, the application of the DNT to already established neuromuscular interfacing approaches for bionic reconstruction could be explored. Regenerative peripheral nerve interfaces RPNIs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Vu et al., 2020</xref>), for example, are created by implanting transected peripheral nerves into small free muscle grafts, which serve as neuronal control signal amplifiers. Particularly with RPNIs, the DNT could be advantageous as muscle mass is currently constrained by the axonal count and therefore limiting EMG output for neuroprosthetic control. Potentially beneficial applications could also be explored with the agonist-antagonist myoneural interface (AMI) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Srinivasan et al., 2017</xref>). An AMI consists of a pair of muscles connected to each other by its tendons whereas the contraction of one causing the stretching of the other and vice versa. The contraction and its EMG signals serve as control signal for the prosthesis and the stretch as afferent proprioceptive feedback.</p><p>Another method that could most likely benefit from the DNT is TMR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kuiken et al., 2009</xref>). After amputation, TMR can create additional myosignals to improve basic prosthetic control. In TMR, neuromas within the stump are cut and the healthy fascicles are then transferred to intact muscle segments, after denervation from their original innervation. Earlier studies revealed that EMG technology can record and decipher neuronal signals from those reinnervated areas into signals for prosthetic movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bergmeister et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Muceli et al., 2019b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Salminger et al., 2019</xref>). The biceps’ long head is suitable to perform various EMG examinations, as we have previously shown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bergmeister et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Muceli et al., 2019a</xref>). Especially with novel multichannel EMG technology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Muceli et al., 2015</xref>), individual motor unit action potentials can potentially be decoded from such signals as we have previously shown in SNT models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Muceli et al., 2019a</xref>).</p><p>We want to emphasize that this was a first attempt at controlled multiple innervation of a single target in a murine model. Furthermore, we would like to point out that the clinical translatability of validated rat models may require the verification of scalability in larger animal models first (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aman et al., 2019a</xref>). An obvious limitation is the lack of investigation of voluntary motor activity since this is not feasible in rats. It remains unclear whether a human could access a single muscle via two different nerves. Another potential limitation of this study is the use of the mixed UN containing both sensory and motor nerve fibers. For better outcomes of surgical nerve transfers, ‘pure’ motor nerves should be preferred, such as the AIN used here, to avoid sensory to motor axon incongruence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ray et al., 2016</xref>). We decided to transfer the UN at a level, where it also contains sensory fibers of the superficial branch because unlike in humans, intraneural fascicular dissection to identify the two branches proximal to Guyon’s canal is impossible due to the intermingling of axons at the level of Guyon’s canal. Uncomplicated dissection, significant transfer leeway, and the lack of better alternatives made the UN the best option.</p><p>In conclusion, this study demonstrated that a single target muscle can host two separate donor nerves. Our results suggest that both the SNT and DNT models are suitable for common neurophysiological examinations in peripheral nerve research. The concept of transferring multiple nerves to a single target may improve muscle reinnervation, prosthetic interfacing, neuroma therapy or facilitate phantom limb pain management. Until first clinical interfacing applications can be translated, further EMG analysis and validation are needed to fully understand the neurophysiological changes following multiple nerve transfers.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Experimental design</title><p>Eight rat cadavers were dissected to design the DNT procedure.

Following the dissection of the subcutaneous tissue, the antebrachial fascia was opened through an incision placed over the palmaris longus muscle to preserve the underlying ulnar collateral vessels. Then, the flexor carpi ulnaris muscle was bluntly mobilized and retracted ulnarly using a Magnetic Fixator Retraction System (Fine Science Tools, Heidelberg, Germany) to expose the UN. Further exposure of the dorsal and palmar cutaneous branches of the UN was carried out using an operating microscope (Carl Zeiss, Munich, Germany) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). The palmar branch was cut right after its emergence and the UN was subsequently transected as distally as possible. The UN was dissected proximally to its distal exit from the cubital tunnel while preserving the ulnar artery and basilic vein. Intraneural dissection allowed for conservation of the dorsal cutaneous and flexor carpi ulnaris motor branches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), while facilitating a tension-free nerve coaptation. Next, the incision of the antebrachial fascia was extended proximally to open the brachial fascia above the cubital fossa and biceps.

Significant caliber differences between the motor branch of the biceps’ long head and the two transferred nerves required neurotization directly to the epimysium.

In eight additional untreated control animals, both the UN in the antebrachium and the AIN were transected and placed into conduit reservoirs for 1 hr, either filled with 5 µl of 10% Fluoro-Ruby (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) or 5 µl of 2% Fast-Blue (Polysciences, Warrington, PA). Tracer leakage was prevented by sealing the reservoir around the nerve with Vaseline (Vaselinum album, Fagron, Glinde, Germany). Hence, the corresponding motor neuron pools in the spinal cord (C8-Th1) were localized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). To further prevent bias due to differences in penetration of the tracers, the nerves were alternately colored with Fluoro-Ruby and Fast-Blue. Additionally, 12 weeks following SNT (n=15), DNT (n=15), and in another seven untreated control animals, motor neurons reinnervating the long head of the biceps were studied. Through a 15-mm incision above the biceps, the biceps’ long head and its insertion site were exposed.

All data analyses were performed using SPSS Statistics for Macintosh, version 25.0 (IBM, Armonk, NY).</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Project administration, Validation, Visualization, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Methodology, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Validation, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Validation, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Methodology, Validation, Visualization, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Validation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Methodology, Validation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Methodology, Project administration, Resources, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con11"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Resources, Supervision, Validation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con12"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Supervision, Validation, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>The protocols for the experiments were approved by the ethics committee of the Medical University of Vienna and the Austrian Ministry for Research and Science (reference number BMBWF- 66.009/0413-V/3b/2019) and strictly followed the principles of laboratory animal care as recommended by the Federation of European Laboratory Animal Science Associations (FELASA).</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec id="s6" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="transrepform"><label>Transparent reporting form</label><media mime-subtype="docx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-71312-transrepform1-v2.docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="scode1"><label>Source code 1.</label><caption><title>The Syntax code for SPSS 25 for Mac is divided into analysis for muscle mass on page 1 (ANCOVA) and retrograde labeling analysis (Kruskal Wallis H-Test) on page 2.</title><p>The respective headings for the code sections are highlighted using asterisks.</p></caption><media mime-subtype="zip" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-71312-supp1-v2.zip"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec id="s7" sec-type="data-availability"><title>Data availability</title><p>Muscle mass data have been deposited in Dryad under the DOI: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.3j9kd51jb">https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.3j9kd51jb</ext-link>.

It develops a new model for double nerve transfers in the forelimbs of rodents, and is therefore likely to be of great utility as a model for a range of studies related to nerve injury and therapeutics. It provides extensive guidance on how to reproduce this model, as well as detailed methods to characterize the success of neuromuscular regeneration.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Double nerve transfer to a single target muscle: experimental model in the upper extremity&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Samantha R Santacruz as Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Tamar Makin as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: David Lumenta (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Elaborate on the retrograde labeling results. We suggest to include results of differences of retrograde labeling, comparison of single vs. double nerve transfers (eg. labeling single nerve vs. only one branch of corresponding double nerve transfer).</p><p>2) Provide additional details on statistical analyses in the Methods.
