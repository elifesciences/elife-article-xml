contribute to these deficits remains unclear. To clarify this, we reversibly blocked cerebellar outflow in monkeys engaged in planar reaching tasks. This intervention led to a spatially selective reduction in hand velocity, primarily due to decreased muscle torque, especially in movements requiring high inter-joint torque coupling. When examining repeated reaches to the same target, we found that the reduced velocity resulted from both an immediate deficit and a gradually developing compensatory slowing to reduce passive inter-joint interactions. However, the slowed hand velocity did not account for the fragmented and variable movement trajectories observed during the cerebellar block. Our findings indicate that cerebellar impairment results in motor deficits due to both inadequate muscle torque and an altered motor control strategy for managing impaired limb dynamics. Additionally, impaired motor control elevates noise, which cannot be entirely mitigated through compensatory strategies.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>macaque fascicularis</kwd><kwd>cerebellum</kwd><kwd>interaction torques</kwd><kwd>motor noise</kwd><kwd>weakness</kwd><kwd>muscle torques</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003977</institution-id><institution>Israel Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ISF-1801/18</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Prut</surname><given-names>Yifat</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003977</institution-id><institution>Israel Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ISF 1207/23</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Prut</surname><given-names>Yifat</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>431549029-SFB 1451</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Prut</surname><given-names>Yifat</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NIH R01NS110901</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Prut</surname><given-names>Yifat</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01NS105759</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dewald</surname><given-names>Julius PA</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100005385</institution-id><institution>Council for Higher Education</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PhD Sandwich Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sinha</surname><given-names>Nirvik</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Baruch Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Financial support</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Prut</surname><given-names>Yifat</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Reversible cerebellar disruption in non-human primates reveals an acute muscle torque deficit and an adaptive slowing strategy to manage limb dynamics, underscoring distinct primary, and compensatory mechanisms underlying motor impairment.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The ability to coordinate well-timed movements greatly relies on the cerebellum as evident from studies of individuals with cerebellar ataxia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Beppu et al., 1984</xref>).

However, motor impairments exhibited by individuals with cerebellar deficits extend much beyond poor motor timing. For example, during the acute phase of cerebellar injury, there is a loss of muscle tone and weakness of voluntary movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Holmes, 1917</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Goldstein, 1927</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Holmes, 1939</xref>). Cerebellar patients also exhibit movement-related sensory deficits such as an impaired visual perception of stimulus movement and perception of the limb position sense (i.e. proprioception or state estimation) during active movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Therrien and Bastian, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Weeks et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Clinical studies of cerebellar patients have yielded conflicting insights into the pathophysiology caused by a loss of cerebellar function. Some researchers suggest that motor impairments stem primarily from an inability to compensate for inter-joint interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bastian et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bastian et al., 2000</xref>), while others argue that insufficient muscle torque generation is the central issue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Topka et al., 1998a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Boose et al., 1999</xref>). These discrepancies likely arise from the variability among individuals with chronic cerebellar deficits, where primary and compensatory effects are intertwined and difficult to separate. Moreover, individuals with cerebellar lesions often have differences in lesion etiology and associated damage beyond the cerebellum itself. As a result, the specific sequence of events that leads to motor impairments following the loss of cerebellar signals remains unclear.</p><p>To investigate this issue, we trained monkeys to perform a planar reaching task with arm support provided by an exoskeleton. We then reversibly disrupted cerebellar communication with other neural structures using high-frequency stimulation (HFS) of the superior cerebellar peduncle, assessing the impact of this perturbation on subsequent movements. Although our approach primarily affects cerebellar output to the motor cortex, it also disrupts fibers carrying input signals (e.g. spinocerebellar) and pathways to various subcortical targets (e.g. cerebello-rubrospinal). Thus, our manipulation broadly interferes with cerebellar communication. Previously, we have shown that HFS can effectively and reversibly interfere with the normal outflow of cerebellar signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Nashef et al., 2019</xref>) since this perturbation accurately replicated the behavioral deficits identified in cerebellar patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bastian, 1997</xref>) and the changes in motor cortical activity that appear after dentate cooling in monkeys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Meyer-Lohmann et al., 1975</xref>). In the present study, we found that the loss of cerebellar outflow led to reduced hand velocity during reaching movements, reflecting two parallel underlying mechanisms. First, there was a reduction in muscle torques, even for movement directions where inter-joint interactions were low. Second, the reduction in hand velocity exhibited a spatial tuning and was greater in directions that generated large inter-joint interactions, thereby reflecting an inability to compensate for limb dynamics. The time course of these two mechanisms was identified by analyzing the sequences of movements made to the same target during the cerebellar block. During such movements, hand velocity was low initially, reflecting a primary muscle torque deficit, and declined further in successive trials, revealing an adaptive motor strategy to minimize inter-joint interactions. Finally, we found that the decrease in velocity during cerebellar block could not fully explain the noisy and decomposed movements observed under these conditions, which may be due to an impaired state estimate of the limb that leads to the faulty control of inter-joint interactions. Taken together, we show that cerebellar output is essential for generating sufficient muscle torques to allow for fast and stereotypical movements while overcoming the complex inter-joint interactions inherent in such actions. The loss of this output triggers a sequence of early primary effects followed by compensatory responses aimed at mitigating these impairments. Together, these processes result in significantly slower movements.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Slower reaching movements in cerebellar block are due to weakness and impaired limb dynamics</title><p>We trained four adult female monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) to sit in a primate chair with their upper limb supported by an exoskeleton (KINARM system) and perform planar center-out movements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). The spatial location of the targets enabled us to dissociate between shoulder-dominant (lateral targets) vs. shoulder-elbow movements (diagonal and straight targets, respectively). Each trial began with the monkey holding a cursor within a central target. After 500â800 ms, one of eight peripheral targets appeared (cue). Following a 450â850 ms delay, the central target disappeared ('go' signal), prompting the monkey to reach the peripheral target within 500â900 ms and briefly hold the cursor there (100â150 ms) to receive a reward. Between successive trials, monkeys repositioned the cursor back to the central target. The experiment was conducted across several sessions (i.e. days). Each session was divided into 3â4 sub-sessions. Each sub-session comprised a block of control trials (~80) followed by a block of trials (~50) with high-frequency stimulation (130 Hz) of the superior cerebellar peduncle.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Effect of cerebellar block on peak hand velocity.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Schematic of the monkey performing the delayed reaching task in the KINARM exoskeleton to eight peripheral targets on the horizontal plane.

Since the monkeys had to meet strict timing criteria to perform the movements successfully during the task, we began by examining the hand kinematics. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref> shows profiles of hand velocity in sample trials collected during the control (blue) and cerebellar block (vermillion) conditions. This example shows that movements exhibited a significant reduction in the peak hand velocity during cerebellar block. However, when compared across the targets, we found that the reduction in hand velocity was strongly modulated by the target direction (one-way ANOVA of the change in peak hand velocity, the effect of cerebellar block: p=0.01, the effect of targets: p&lt;0.001; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). <italic>Post hoc</italic> comparisons further revealed that the effect of cerebellar block on outward reaching movements (targets 1â4) i.e., movements involving shoulder flexion was significantly higher than on inward reaching movements (targets 5â8) i.e., movements involving shoulder extension (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>; mean decrease of 9.7%, CI [8.2, 11.2], p&lt;0.001 for targets 1â4 compared to mean decrease of 2.5%, CI [0.9, 4.0], p=0.21 for targets 5â8) even though there was no difference in the peak hand velocity between the movements to the two target groups during control (p=0.88, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>).</p><p>Previous studies have demonstrated that Purkinje neurons of the cerebellar cortex exhibit weaker modulation during task-irrelevant movements compared to task-related movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Pi et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hage et al., 2025</xref>). Therefore, we examined whether the impact of the cerebellar block was limited specifically to target-directed, reward-associated movements or if it generalized to all movements performed during the task. To this end, we compared peak hand velocities between target-directed (within-trial, reward-relevant) movements and subsequent return-to-center (out-of-trial) movements. Our analysis revealed that cerebellar block resulted in a significantly larger reduction in peak velocity for target-directed movements compared to return-to-center movements (7.5%, CI [6.5, 9.0] vs. 1.7%, CI [â1.8, 3.0]; p&lt;0.001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>). These findings suggest that the cerebellum plays a preferential role in optimizing reward-associated, within-trial movements rather than equally influencing all movements.</p><p>In the task used in our study, hand movements were made by controlling the muscle torque at the shoulder and elbow joints (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Scott, 2004</xref>). However, simultaneous movements of both joints also generated coupling torques due to passive interactions between limb inertial properties and joint velocities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">BernshteiÌn, 1967</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hollerbach and Flash, 1982</xref>). To identify the target-specific muscle and coupling torques, we employed an inverse dynamics model of the upper limb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fagg et al., 2009</xref>) which enabled us to distinguish between the different contributions to the net torque experienced by each joint. According to this model, the net torque at each joint is the sum of both the active muscle torque and the passive coupling torque acting at that joint (see Methods section for details).</p><p>Using the inverse dynamics model, we found that the target-specific reduction in hand velocities was produced by changes in muscle commands (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a and b</xref>). Specifically, we observed that the muscle torque impulses calculated by integrating the torque profiles over the early phase of movements when acceleration was positive, were reduced in a target-specific manner during the cerebellar block (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>).

In contrast, the slight reduction in elbow torques due to the cerebellar block did not reach significance for any of the targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>).

Normally, smooth execution of multi-joint movements relies on precise temporal synchronization across joints. However, cerebellar lesions disrupt this temporal coordination, resulting in asynchronous, sequential joint activation resulting in movement decomposition as described earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bastian et al., 1996</xref>). Moreover, the disrupted temporal control of joint activation introduces variability from trial to trial, causing increased spatial variability in the resulting movement trajectories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Day et al., 1998</xref>). Thus, movement decomposition and trajectory variability can both be viewed as direct consequences of impaired temporal coordination due to cerebellar dysfunction. These properties of movement are also velocity-dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bastian et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Osu et al., 2015</xref>). Therefore, it is conceivable that the combination of primary deficit and adaptive reduction in velocity to reduce the effects of coupling torque observed in our results is the main driver of abnormal motor timing. To evaluate this, we examined movement decomposition and trajectory variability during the outward reaching movements (which exhibited a significant reduction in hand velocity during cerebellar block) and measured the impact of hand velocity on these measures.</p><p>To quantify movement decomposition, we normalized the movement times of individual trials to range from 0 to 1 and identified the bins where either the shoulder or the elbow joint paused (speed &lt;20Â°/s) while the other joint continued moving (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bastian et al., 1996</xref>).

To quantify this effect, we calculated a decomposition index for each trial, representing the proportion of movement time during which the movement was decomposed, as defined above. Overall, the cerebellar block increased movement decomposition by 53.5% (CI [42.2, 66.0], p&lt;0.001). Next, we asked whether movement decomposition was mainly due to lower hand velocities. We, therefore, selected a subset of control trials that matched the cerebellar block trials in their peak velocities.

Understanding the impairments that follow cerebellar lesions is often complicated by the fact that the studies of this question mostly rely on a heterogeneous population due to various levels and types of cerebellar pathologies. Here, we addressed this question by using high-frequency stimulation to reversibly block cerebellar output to the motor cortex in behaving monkeys wearing an exoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Nashef et al., 2019</xref>) and comparing the post-block motor behavior to control conditions. Our results indicate that cerebellar block leads to decreased hand velocity, particularly during the outward reaching movements via two mechanisms: a reduction in muscle torques suggesting motor weakness, and spatially tuned decreases in velocity in targets where large inter-joint interactions occur, indicating a failure to compensate for limb dynamics. Analyzing the time course of these impairments revealed partially overlapping processes: an initial reduction in hand velocity due to the inability to generate sufficient muscle torques, followed by a further progressive decline in hand velocities during subsequent movements during the cerebellar block. This secondary decline was observed only in the case of movements with high inter-joint interactions, suggesting an adaptive strategy to minimize these interactions. Finally, we observed increased motor noise in terms of movement decomposition and trial-to-trial trajectory variability which were independent of the slower movements observed during the cerebellar block.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Target-dependent reduction in hand velocity and coupling torques during reaching movements during the cerebellar block</title><p>Cerebellar block led to a target-specific reduction in hand velocity, even though the arm was fully supported by the exoskeleton and thus the limb weight did not play any role.

It is, therefore, conceivable that studies in humans with cerebellar deficits, which often included subjects at the chronic stage of the lesion, may have underestimated the contribution of muscle weakness which by that time was already less pronounced.</p><p>We explored the acute outcome of the cerebellar block, a phase in which agonist muscle weakness may play a more prominent role. Importantly, we showed that deficits in the self-generated muscle torque appear immediately after the cerebellar block, resulting in lower hand velocity already in the first few trials of movements. This kind of fast response is less likely to be a strategic response aimed at mitigating the loss of cerebellar signals. This finding is consistent with the initial weakness followed by a gradual recovery of function observed in acute lesions of other neural structures involved in movement control, including the primary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Pressman and Rosen, 2015</xref>) and premotor cortices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Freund, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Freund and Hummelsheim, 1985</xref>). It also aligns with the understanding that cerebellar output provides a strong excitatory drive to the motor cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Shinoda et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hore and Flament, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nashef et al., 2018a</xref>) and several subcortical descending motor systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Ruigrok, 2013</xref>), beyond its well-known role in motor timing and coordination. Following the initial reduction in hand velocity observed in our study, there was a further gradual decline across subsequent trials specifically for the movements with high coupling torques, a behavior profile that is more consistent with strategic effort, most likely in response to the inability to compensate for limb dynamics.</p><p>The muscle torque, representing the sum of all muscle forces acting at a joint, can also be reduced by co-contraction of agonist and antagonist muscles rather than by agonist weakness alone. However, in cerebellar ataxia, co-contraction has been proposed as a strategy to stabilize stationary joints during decomposed multi-joint movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bastian et al., 1996</xref>). In our experiments, this strategy would likely emerge gradually following cerebellar block similar to the adaptive slowing of movements aimed at reducing inter-joint interactions. We, therefore, argue that the observed acute deficiency in muscle torque was mainly driven by agonist weakness. Our argument is further supported by previous studies which attributed reduced agonist muscle activity as a cause for slowing of voluntary movements in individuals with cerebellar lesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hallett et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Wild et al., 1996</xref>).</p><p>In summary, the slower movements in the absence of cerebellar signals are likely due to two main factors: (i) a primary inability to generate sufficient muscle torques due to the lack of synchronized recruitment of the cortical and sub-cortical descending motor systems via the cerebellar output, and (ii) a secondary adaptive strategy aimed at compensating for the impaired prediction of limb dynamics due to the loss of signals from the cerebellum.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Insufficient muscle torques vs. poor inter-joint coordination</title><p>Unlike most previous clinical studies that examined motor deficits in individuals with chronic cerebellar injuries, our study utilized a reversible model of cerebellar block. This approach enabled us to track the temporal evolution of motor deficits from the onset of the block within the same study participant. Although several studies have explored the nature of motor deficits following cerebellar injuries, there remains considerable debate regarding the fundamental mechanisms driving these deficits. Some studies have suggested that the inability to compensate for inter-joint interactions is the primary driver of the observed motor abnormalities in cerebellar injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bastian et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bastian et al., 2000</xref>). In contrast, other studies have emphasized the inability to generate sufficient muscle torques as the core deficit in cerebellar ataxia while claiming that inter-joint coordination is unaffected following cerebellar lesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Topka et al., 1998a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Boose et al., 1999</xref>). Given these conflicting findings, our study aimed to systematically explore the entire spectrum of motor deficits using a model of reversible cerebellar block. First, we found that the deficits in muscle torque are more pronounced for the reaching movements as compared to the retrieval movements. We identified both an acute insufficiency in muscle torque generation and the inability to compensate for coupling torques as potential mechanisms underlying the observed slowness during the reaching movements. Moreover, we delineated the time course of these deficits, providing insights into their evolution from the onset of cerebellar block.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>The asymmetric effect of cerebellar block on outward vs. inward reaching movements</title><p>We observed a notable distinction in the impact of cerebellar blockage on outward vs. inward reaching movements. At a collective level, this variance could be attributed to the disparity in magnitude of coupling torque impulse, with movements towards targets 2â4 exhibiting 18.7% (CI [13.1, 24.1], p=0.008) higher coupling torque impulse compared to those towards targets 6â8. However, this explanation does not hold consistently when examined at the individual target level. For instance, while the coupling torque was higher for movements towards target 7, the effects of cerebellar blockage were less pronounced compared to those observed for target 1, where the coupling torques are considerably lower. There are two possible explanations for this discrepancy. One possibility is that the effect of cerebellar block exhibits a bias in the direction of shoulder flexion (i.e. for movements to targets 1â4). Several early studies in cats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hare et al., 1936</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chambers, 1947</xref>), non-human primates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Magoun et al., 1935</xref>), and humans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nashold and Slaughter, 1969</xref> have all reported a bias towards the activation of ipsilateral flexors of the arm following stimulation of the deep cerebellar nuclei and the superior cerebellar peduncle. Furthermore, lesioning of these structures led to the reduction of ipsilateral flexor tone and power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Schneider and Crosby, 1963</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nashold and Slaughter, 1969</xref>). The cerebellar output influences the excitability of spinal interneurons either directly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bantli and Bloedel, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Asanuma et al., 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sathyamurthy et al., 2020</xref>) or via indirect relays in the subcortical descending motor systems like the rubrospinal and the reticulospinal pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Ruigrok, 2013</xref>). Since the spinal interneurons influence the activity of flexor muscles twice as often as extensor muscles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Perlmutter et al., 1998</xref>), this might explain why the cerebellar block had a stronger effect on movements involving shoulder flexion (i.e. outward reaching movements) relative to shoulder extension (i.e. inward reaching movements) in our study. Alternatively, the initial position of the limb in our experimental setup (i.e. on the central target) might have been favorable for movements in the direction of shoulder extension, thereby making them easier to perform.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Asynchronous joint movements and motor variability occur despite slower movements in cerebellar block</title><p>Abnormally high motor variability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Day et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Timmann et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Schlerf et al., 2013</xref>) and decomposition of multi-joint movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bastian et al., 1996</xref>) are core deficits in cerebellar patients. We showed that the cerebellar block decomposed the dual-joint movements into temporally isolated single-joint actions and led to an increased trial-to-trial spatial noise. These two measures can be affected by the reduction in movement velocities. Our results showed that even though movement decomposition increased with a reduction in velocity in control trials, they were still significantly lower than that of velocity-matched cerebellar block trials. Second, the trial-to-trial spatial noise in hand trajectories increased during cerebellar block despite the slower movement speeds. The cerebellum is known to participate in the planning of movements by providing an internal model of the limb which is necessary for predicting the sensory outcomes of motor commands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Wolpert et al., 1998</xref>). For this purpose, the cerebellum aids in estimating the state of the limb by integrating the sensory information of its last known state with predictions of its response to the latest motor command (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Miall et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Miall and King, 2008</xref>). Therefore, in the absence of cerebellar signals, there are programming errors in the motor command required to launch the limb accurately toward a target (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Day et al., 1998</xref>). These errors may in turn translate into the noisy joint activation patterns and variable hand trajectories observed in our results. Moreover, the persistence of these deficits independently of the movement speeds observed during cerebellar block indicates that they cannot be compensated for, unlike the impaired prediction of inter-joint interactions which are strategically dealt with by reducing the movement velocity.</p><p>In summary, our study systematically investigated the temporal progression and distinct mechanisms of motor deficits in a controlled, reversible animal model of cerebellar block. These include an acute onset muscle torque deficit, impaired compensation of limb dynamics, and increased motor noise. We aim to further explore the neural correlates of these deficits in future studies.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Experimental subjects</title><p>This study was performed on four adult female monkeys (<italic>Macaca fascicularis</italic>, wt 4.5â8 kg).

During the task, the left upper arm was abducted 90Â° and rested on cushioned troughs secured to links of a two-joint exoskeleton (KINARM, BKIN Technologies Ltd.). The sequence of events in each trial of this task was as follows. First, the monkey located a cursor (projected on a horizontal screen immediately above its arm) within a central target (2â3 cm in diameter). After 500â800 ms, a randomly selected peripheral target (out of 8 evenly distributed targets) was displayed. The monkey had to wait 450â850 ms until the central target disappeared (i.e. the âgo signal) and then reached the cued peripheral target (2â3 cm in diameter) located 4â5 cm away. For monkeys C and M, we inserted a 200 ms grace period before the âgoâ signal to encourage predictive timing. The onset of movement within this time before the âgoâ signal did not abort the trial. We limited the time to reach the peripheral target after the âgoâ signal to 500 ms for monkeys M and C and 800â900 ms for monkeys S and P. Following successful reach, the monkeys were rewarded with a drop of applesauce. It is important to note that the monkeys were required to hold at the target brieflyâ100 ms for Monkeys S and P, and 150 ms for Monkeys C and Mâbefore receiving the reward. However, given the size of the targets and the velocity of movements, it often happened that the monkeys didnât have to stop their movements fully to obtain the reward. Importantly, we relaxed the taskâs requirements (by increasing the target size and reducing the temporal constraints) to enable the monkeys to perform a sufficient number of successful trials under both the control and the cerebellar block conditions. This was necessary as we found that strict criteria for these parameters yielded a very low success rate in the cerebellar block condition. Given these practical constraints, we note that this task design is likely suboptimal for studying endpoint accuracy which is an important aspect of cerebellar control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Low et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Becker and Person, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Calame et al., 2023</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Insertion of the stimulating electrode into the superior cerebellar peduncle</title><p>After the training was completed, a square recording chamber (24Ã24 mm) was attached to the monkeyâs skull above the upper limb-related area of the motor cortex in a surgical procedure under general anesthesia. To insert a chronic stimulating electrode into the ipsilateral superior cerebellar peduncle (SCP), a round chamber (diameter = 19 mm) was also implanted above the estimated insertion point (as per stereotactic measurements) during the surgery for the cortical chamber implantation. Subsequently, a post-surgery MRI was used to plan the trajectory for the electrode insertion into the SCP. After a recovery and re-training period, a bipolar concentric electrode (Microprobes for Life Science Inc) was inserted through the round chamber along the planned trajectory. During the process of insertion, the evoked multi-unit activity in the primary motor cortex was simultaneously monitored to identify the precise location where the stimulating electrode should be secured (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nashef et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Nashef et al., 2018b</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>High-frequency stimulation to block the cerebellar outflow to the motor cortex</title><p>The superior cerebellar peduncle was blocked using high-frequency stimulation (HFS). This stimulation protocol consisted of a train of biphasic rectangular-pulse stimuli (where each phase was 200 Âµs) applied at 130 Hz. Each train was delivered at a fixed intensity of 150â250 Î¼A. In our earlier study, we demonstrated that by using this manipulation, we can successfully replicate the impaired motor timing and coordination characteristic of cerebellar ataxia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Nashef et al., 2019</xref>). Furthermore, we also demonstrated that at the motor cortical level, this manipulation leads to a loss of response transients at movement onset and decoupling of task-related activity, similar to findings observed in studies where the dentate nucleus was cooled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Meyer-Lohmann et al., 1975</xref>). Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a perturbation similar in properties to the HFS we used, which is routinely used in clinical practice for similar purposes of interfering with neural circuitries that underwent pathological changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Perlmutter and Mink, 2006</xref>) although in both applications there is no accurate measure for the extent of the block (i.e. the fraction of fibers which become ineffective in these conditions) other than the behavioral consequences.

Therefore, we cannot rule out the fact that the effect of HFS may be mediated in part through pathways other than the cerebello-thalamo-cortical pathway (as mentioned in the Discussion section). However, in primates, the cerebellar-thalamo-cortical pathway greatly expanded (at the expense of the cerbello-rubro-spinal tract) in mediating cerebellar control of voluntary movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Horne and Butler, 1995</xref>). The cerebello-subcortical pathways diminished in importance throughout evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Padel et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Nathan and Smith, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">ten Donkelaar, 1988</xref>). Previously, we found that the ascending spinocerebellar axons which enter the cerebellum through the superior cerebellar peduncle (SCP) are weakly task-related and the descending system is quite small (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cohen et al., 2017</xref>).

A total of 46, 29, 36, and 54 sessions of data were collected from Monkeys S, C, M, and P, respectively. Each session was divided into three or four sub-sessions. Each sub-session included blocks of control trials (~80 trials) and trials with the superior cerebellar peduncle blocked using high-frequency stimulation (~50 trials) as described above. During the task performance, the following behavioral data was obtained at 1000 Hz using the KINARMâs motor encoders: (i) Hand position in the x-y plane of movement, (ii) Elbow and shoulder joint angular positions, velocities, and accelerations. The lengths of the upper arm and forearm of each monkey were measured as the distances from the head of the humerus to the lateral epicondyle and from the lateral epicondyle to the palm, respectively.

This cutoff meant that a major portion of the extracted segment of each trial was the acceleration phase of the movement. The movement onset was defined as the time when the radial hand velocity exceeded 5% of its peak. Subsequently, all the trials were zero-centered around the calculated movement onset.

We computed the change in the measured outcome variable due to the cerebellar block per session using the following formula:<disp-formula id="equ3"><alternatives><mml:math id="m3"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi>M</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mspace width="thinmathspace"/><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mspace width="thinmathspace"/><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mi>u</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>g</mml:mi><mml:mspace width="thinmathspace"/><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>b</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mspace width="thinmathspace"/><mml:mi>b</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mi>k</mml:mi><mml:mo>â</mml:mo><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mspace width="thinmathspace"/><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mspace width="thinmathspace"/><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mi>u</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>g</mml:mi><mml:mspace width="thinmathspace"/><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>M</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mspace width="thinmathspace"/><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mspace width="thinmathspace"/><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mi>u</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>g</mml:mi><mml:mspace width="thinmathspace"/><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>Ã</mml:mo><mml:mn>100</mml:mn></mml:mstyle></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math><tex-math id="t3">\begin{document}$$\displaystyle \frac{Median\,response\,during\,cerebellar\,block- median\,response\,during\,control}{Median\,response\,during\,control}\times 100$$\end{document}</tex-math></alternatives></disp-formula></p><p>For post-hoc comparisons, we used the âcoefTestâ function from MATLABâs âfitlmeâ to perform hypothesis testing on the fixed effects. This involved specifying the contrast matrices to evaluate specific hypotheses regarding the differences in the response variables across the levels of the predictor variables. The âcoefTestâ function allowed us to obtain p-values for these comparisons. The computed p-values were then corrected using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure to control the false discovery rate for multiple post-hoc comparisons, wherever applicable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Haynes, 2013</xref>). A significance level of 0.05 was used for all comparisons in this study. For the estimation of the group means and their confidence intervals, we pooled the per session data from all monkeys after ensuring that effects are consistent across the monkeys. For further clarity, we have also overlayed the means of the measured variables from individual monkeys on all our plots of summary statistics.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing â original draft, Writing â review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Writing â original draft, Writing â review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Conceptualization, Software, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Writing â original draft, Project administration, Writing â review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>This study was performed on four adult female monkeys (Macaca fascicularis, weight 4.5-8 kg).

This goal is an important one, given the diversity of movement related phenotypes in patients with cerebellar lesion or injury, which are especially difficult to dissect given the chronic nature of the circuit damage. To address this goal, the authors use high-frequency stimulation (HFS) of the superior cerebellar peduncle in monkeys performing reaching movements. HFS provides an attractive approach for transiently disrupting cerebellar function previously published by this group.

Next, the authors examine the temporal evolution of movement phenotypes over successive blocks of HFS trials. Using this analysis, they find that in addition to the acute, specific effects on torques in early HFS trials, there was an additional progressive reduction in velocity during later trials, which they interpret as an adaptive response to the inability to effectively compensate for interaction torques during cerebellar block.

We found no interaction effect between trial sequence x cerebellar block on movement decomposition.

First, there is an emphasis on signals transmitted to the neocortex. As the authors state several times in the Discussion, there are many subcortical targets of the cerebellar nuclei as well, and thus it is difficult to disentangle target-specific behavioral effects using this approach. Second, the superior cerebellar peduncle contains both cerebellar outputs and inputs (e.g., spinocerebellar). Therefore, the selectivity in perturbing cerebellar output feels overstated. Readers would benefit from a more agnostic claim that HFS affects cerebellar communication with the rest of the nervous system, which would not affect the major findings of the study. In the revised manuscript, the authors do provide additional anatomical and evolutionary context and discuss potential limitations in the selectivity of HFS in the Materials and Methods. However, I feel that at least a brief mention of these caveats in the Introduction, where it is stated, &quot;we then reversibly blocked cerebellar output to the motor cortex&quot;, would benefit the reader.</p></disp-quote><p>Following the advice of the reviewer, we have now revised the introduction section of our manuscript in the following way (lines 61-67):</p><p>ââ¦We then reversibly disrupted cerebellar communication with other neural structures using high-frequency stimulation (HFS) of the superior cerebellar peduncle, assessing the impact of this perturbation on subsequent movements.
