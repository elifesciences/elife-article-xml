Using both in vivo and in vitro approaches, we show that cavin-3 dictates the balance between ERK and Akt signaling. Loss of cavin-3 increases Akt signaling at the expense of ERK, while gain of cavin-3 increases ERK signaling at the expense Akt. Cavin-3 facilitates signal transduction to ERK by anchoring caveolae to the membrane skeleton of the plasma membrane via myosin-1c. Caveolae are lipid raft specializations that contain an ERK activation module and loss of the cavin-3 linkage reduces the abundance of caveolae, thereby separating this ERK activation module from signaling receptors. Loss of cavin-3 promotes Akt signaling through suppression of EGR1 and PTEN. The in vitro consequences of the loss of cavin-3 include induction of Warburg metabolism (aerobic glycolysis), accelerated cell proliferation, and resistance to apoptosis. The in vivo consequences of cavin-3 knockout are increased lactate production and cachexia.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00905.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00905.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00905.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The plasma membrane separates cells from their environment, and surface receptors in this membrane allow cells to respond to changes in their environment by converting external cues into intracellular signals. This process, which is known as signal transduction, plays a central role in the biology of cells, and abnormal signaling is a common cause of human disease. In cancer for example, signals tend to be too strong or they are sent at the wrong time.</p><p>Signal transduction frequently occurs at specialized regions of the plasma membrane. Caveolae are small indentations of the plasma membrane that comprise one type of signaling specialization. A protein that is concentrated in caveolae, cavin-3, suppresses tumor formation and is commonly absent from cancer cells. These observations suggest that cavin-3 participates in signal transduction and pathways that are associated with cancer, but the details of this involvement are not well understood.</p><p>Hernandez et al. now show that cavin-3 controls the balance between two key intracellular signals, ERK and Akt. High levels of cavin-3 promote activation of the ERK signaling pathway but suppress activation of the Akt signaling pathway. Loss of cavin-3 has the opposite effect, activating Akt at the expense of ERK. The consequences of loss of cavin-3 include accelerated cell proliferation, the induction of Warburg metabolism (a metabolic state that supports rapid cell division), and the suppression of the apoptosis pathway. (Suppression of this pathway, which leads to cell death, allows cancer cells to proliferate in the body.) While deletion of the cavin-3 gene in mice is not sufficient to cause spontaneous cancer, animals that are deficient in cavin-3 die prematurely of cachexia, a tissue wasting sequela experienced by nearly half of all cancer patients.</p><p>Hernandez et al. also show that cavin-3 influences cellular signaling by linking caveolae to the membrane skeleton—a network of proteins that underlies the plasma membrane. This linkage is necessary to ensure that cells have the correct abundance of caveolae, and it also facilitates signal transduction to the ERK signaling pathway. ERK activation in this context drives expression of two proteins, EGR1 and PTEN, which suppress Akt signaling. Hernandez et al. propose that the membrane skeleton functions as a scaffold that adaptors, such as cavin-3, use to assemble signaling modules with surface receptors for the purpose of controlling the signal transduction output from these receptors.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00905.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00905.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>Cavin-3</kwd><kwd>hSRBC</kwd><kwd>PRKCDBP</kwd><kwd>ERK</kwd><kwd>Akt</kwd><kwd>aerobic glycolysis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HL085218</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Michaely</surname><given-names>Peter</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CA130821</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mishra</surname><given-names>Lopa</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM052016</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Anderson</surname><given-names>Richard GW</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Cavin-3 is a tumor suppressor protein that inhibits Akt signaling, suppresses Warburg metabolism, promotes apoptosis, and protects against cachexia.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cavin-3 (<italic>PRKCDBP</italic><italic>, hSRBC</italic>) is a tumor suppressor protein of unclear function. In humans, cavin-3 is encoded in the 11p15.5 tumor suppressor locus and loss of cavin-3 expression is common in many epithelial and glial derived cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Zochbauer-Muller et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lee et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Martinez et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Tong et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Caren et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lee et al., 2011</xref>). Cavin-3 expression is also absent in many cancer cell lines and ectopic expression of cavin-3 in these cells is sufficient to suppress their tumorigenesis in athymic mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Xu et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lee et al., 2011</xref>). How cavin-3 expression suppresses tumorigenesis is not clear; however, forced over-expression of cavin-3 can induce G1 arrest and promote apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lee et al., 2011</xref>), suggesting that cavin-3 may suppress mitogenic signaling.</p><p>Cavin-3 is one of four cavin family members, all of which are localized to caveolae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bastiani et al., 2009</xref>). Caveolae are invaginated, lipid-raft microdomains of the plasma membrane that may play roles in mitogenic signaling because a population of EGF, PDGF, and insulin receptors have been visualized by immuno-EM either in or adjacent to caveolae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Liu et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Foti et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Nagy et al., 2010</xref>). Caveolae are not, however, required for cell proliferation because caveolae are not present in all cell types, caveolae do not appear until late in embryogenesis and animals with mutations that prevent caveolae formation are viable and of normal size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Engelman et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Drab et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Razani et al., 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fang et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Liu et al., 2008</xref>). Caveolae may instead limit cell proliferation because some mutations that prevent caveolae formation are associated with hyperplasia and fibrosis in lung (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Drab et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Razani et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p>Cavins likely serve both structural and functional roles in caveolae through their interactions with the caveolin family of integral membrane proteins. Cavin-1 provides a structural function by binding to the principal caveolin, caveolin-1, stabilizing the invaginated morphology of caveolae and providing an interaction surface for other cavins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hill et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Liu and Pilch, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bastiani et al., 2009</xref>). Cavin-2 and Cavin-4 show restricted expression and may serve cell-type specific functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bastiani et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hansen et al., 2013</xref>). By contrast, cavin-3 is broadly expressed and has been proposed to function in caveolae internalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">McMahon et al., 2009</xref>). How cavin-3 might participate in cellular signaling is not clear.</p><p>Here we show that cavin-3 dictates the balance between ERK and Akt signaling with consequences for cell metabolism, apoptosis and cell proliferation. We also characterize the molecular mechanisms by which cavin-3 influences cellular signaling.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Loss of cavin-3 alters cell signaling, induces Warburg metabolism and inhibits apoptosis</title><p>We employed two model systems to investigate whether loss of cavin-3 influences cell signaling.

The second model system examined chronic effects by knocking out the cavin-3 locus in the mouse and characterizing the consequences of loss of cavin-3 in embryonic fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).

Suppressed transcripts fell into two categories: those that were fully suppressed by 3 days of knockdown and those that fell gradually during the 15-day time course. Many IE transcripts in the first group encoded proteins whose expression is driven by ERK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). This observation suggested that loss of cavin-3 suppressed ERK signaling and 3 days of knockdown proved sufficient to inhibit EGF-dependent phosphorylation of ERK (pERK), translocation of ERK to the nucleus and induction of the ERK-responsive transcription factor, cFos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>). The impact of cavin-3 depletion on ERK signaling was not specific to EGF because 3-day knockdown also impaired ERK activation by serum and diverse stimuli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Cavin-3 expression is thus necessary for efficient ERK activation.</p><p>pERK is a potent driver of cell proliferation and knockdown of cavin-3 initially slowed cell growth; however, proliferation returned to a normal rate after 3 days and exceeded the normal rate after 10 days of knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). pERK levels did not recover during the time course (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), indicating that cavin-3 depleted cells compensated through other means. To identify the mechanism, we queried the IE microarray data and noted that the transcript whose expression showed the greatest suppression following cavin-3 depletion was early growth response protein 1 (EGR1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). EGR1 is an ERK-induced transcription factor that drives expression of phosphatase and tensin homolog protein (PTEN) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Yu et al., 2011</xref>). PTEN opposes the action of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) by dephosphorylating phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3) back to phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2). PIP3 generation by PI3K is necessary for the recruitment and activation of Akt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Engelman et al., 2006</xref>). Knockdown of cavin-3 caused progressive loss of both EGR1 and PTEN. Loss of EGR1 and PTEN coincided with a fivefold increase in steady state levels of activated Akt (pAkt) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,C</xref>). The switch from ERK to Akt signaling resulted in cell growth that was resistant to the MAPK/ERK Kinase (MEK) inhibitor, PD98059, and more sensitive to the PI3K inhibitor, LY294002 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). These findings show that loss of cavin-3 shifts cellular signaling to an Akt-dominated state.</p><p>Activation of Akt can suppress apoptosis through inhibition of cytochrome c release from mitochondria and induction of inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAPs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kennedy et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Papapetropoulos et al., 2000</xref>). To determine whether loss of cavin-3 suppresses apoptosis, we compared cell sensitivity to tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα), an apoptosis-inducing cytokine. Treatment of SV589 fibroblasts with TNFα potently induced apoptosis as evidenced by the robust cleavage of the caspase-3 target, Poly [ADP-Ribose] Polymerase 1 (PARP1), and the prevalence of TUNEL positive cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Knockdown of cavin-3 progressively reduced cell sensitivity to TNFα in both assays. Resistance to TNFα correlated with induction of the IAP, survivin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), one of several anti-apoptosis proteins induced by Akt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Duronio, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Guha and Altieri, 2009</xref>). These findings show that loss of cavin-3 inhibits apoptosis.</p><p>Akt can also promote cell proliferation through activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Manning and Cantley, 2007</xref>). mTORC1 activates many biosynthetic pathways through phosphorylation and activation of S6K (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Duvel et al., 2010</xref>). Loss of cavin-3 potently increased levels of phosphorylated S6K (pS6K) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), indicating that cavin-3 loss activates mTORC1. Microarrays comparing transcript profiles cells depleted of cavin-3 for 0, 3, 8, and 15 days showed that the rapid proliferation of 15-day knockdown cells was associated with substantial changes in gene transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1 fig3">Figures 1A and 3A</xref>). Many of transcripts that were up-regulated in the 15-day knockdowns are part of protein and nucleic acid biosynthetic pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Cells fuel these biosynthetic pathways with metabolites derived from glycolysis. To increase metabolite levels, some rapidly dividing cells switch to aerobic glycolysis (Warburg metabolism), a metabolic state that is characterized by increased use of fermentative glycolysis even under normoxic conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">DeBerardinis et al., 2008</xref>). Entry into aerobic glycolysis normally requires hypoxia induced factor 1 (HIF1), a transcription factor whose activity is controlled by the protein level of its α-subunit (HIF1α) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Lunt and Vander Heiden, 2011</xref>). Akt and mTORC1 increase HIF1α protein levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Schleicher et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Duvel et al., 2010</xref>) and knockdown of cavin-3 progressively increased both HIF1α levels and the use of fermentative glycolysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2 fig3">Figures 2B and 3C</xref>). Glucose consumption and lactate production reached rates that were equivalent to those observed in H1299 cells, a non-small cell lung carcinoma cell line that lacks cavin-3 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Xu et al., 2001</xref>). These findings show that prolonged loss of cavin-3 activates the Akt/mTORC1/HIF1 pathway and induces aerobic glycolysis. Activation of these pathways likely facilitates rapid cell proliferation.</p><p>To test whether chronic loss of cavin-3 could recapitulate phenotypes observed in acute knockdown experiments, a germline knockout of the cavin-3 gene (<italic>Prkcdbp</italic>) was generated in mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). As observed with 15-day knockdowns in SV589 cells, embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) from cavin-3 knockout (Cavin-3 KO, <italic>Prkcdbp</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup>) animals displayed reduced levels of pERK, EGR1 and PTEN, elevated levels of survivin, pAkt, pS6K and HIF1α, increased rates of fermentative glycolysis, faster proliferation, heightened sensitivity to LY294002, resistance to PD98059 and insensitivity to TNFα as compared to wild-type MEFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B–G</xref>). Thus, genetic ablation of cavin-3 expression recapitulates phenotypes induced following long-term knockdown of cavin-3 by siRNA.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Cavin-3 facilitates ERK activation by anchoring caveolae to F-actin of the membrane skeleton</title><p>To characterize the molecular mechanisms by which loss of cavin-3 alters cellular signaling, we first explored how cavin-3 facilitates ERK signaling. The loss of pERK but not pAkt that is associated with loss of cavin-3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2 fig4">Figures 2B and 4B</xref>) suggested that cavin-3 acts downstream of mitogen receptors. Consistent with this conclusion, knockdown of cavin-3 did not inhibit EGF-dependent autophosphorylation of EGF receptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Furthermore, inhibition of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), which normally prevents the basal activity of mitogen receptors from activating downstream signaling cascades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Wang et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Van Kanegan et al., 2005</xref>), was unable to activate ERK despite potent activation of Akt in cells depleted for cavin-3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>).

Caveolae have been implicated in both ERK and Akt signaling, though whether caveolae promote or suppress either pathway is not clear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Liu et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Mineo et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Engelman et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Furuchi and Anderson, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Teixeira et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Park et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cohen et al., 2003</xref>). To determine whether cavin-3-dependent facilitation of ERK signaling involves caveolae, we used light and electron microscopy to test whether loss of cavin-3 influences caveolae abundance. We found that knockdown of cavin-3 both reduced caveolae abundance and re-localized the principal caveolae coat protein, caveolin-1, to the Golgi region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). The reduction in caveolae abundance correlated with loss of ERK responsiveness to EGF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). These findings indicate that cavin-3 is necessary for surface caveolae and suggest that caveolae facilitate signal transduction to ERK.</p><p>Caveolae associate with actin filaments at the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Rohlich and Allison, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Singer, 1979</xref>) and disruption of F-actin impaired mitogen-dependent stimulation of ERK to the same extent as cavin-3 depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aplin and Juliano, 1999</xref>), suggesting that cavin-3 may increase caveolae abundance by anchoring caveolae to F-actin at the cell surface.

To determine whether cavin-3 associates with an actin-binding protein, we tested candidate actin-binding proteins that had previously been identified in a proteomic screen as lipid raft/caveolae proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Foster et al., 2003</xref>) for their ability to satisfy the following five criteria: (i) co-localization with caveolin-1, (ii) reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation with cavin-3, (iii) knockdown that mislocalizes caveolin-1, (iv) knockdown that reduces surface caveolae and (v) knockdown that impairs ERK activation. Myosin-1c satisfied all five criteria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C–F</xref>), indicating that myosin-1c participates in a cavin-3 linkage that anchors caveolae to peripheral actin.</p><p>To determine how caveolae might participate in ERK signaling, we reasoned that the role of caveolae should be downstream of ras because ras participates in both ERK and Akt activation. MEK and ERK have been shown to co-fractionate with mitogen receptors and caveolin-1 in cellular membranes of low protein-to-lipid density (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Liu et al., 1997</xref>). Consistent with these published observations, we found that EGFR, caveolin-1, MEK and ERK co-fractionated in low-density membrane fractions isolated from untreated SV589 fibroblasts; however, knockdown of cavin-3, knockdown of myosin-1c or brief treatment with the actin-depolymerization compound, latrunculin-A, caused MEK and ERK to accumulate in the high-density fractions, which contain the bulk of cellular membrane protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). The distribution of EGFR and caveolin-1 in the gradients became broader and heavier, but the majority of both EGFR and caveolin-1 remained in lighter fractions as compared to MEK and ERK. The EGFR remained on the plasma membrane because EGF treatment induced autophosphorylation of EGFRs in the absence of cavin-3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). These observations indicate that a cytoskeletal linkage involving cavin-3, myosin-1c and F-actin positions MEK and ERK for activation by mitogen receptors, most likely by anchoring caveolae at the cell surface.</p><p>Cavin-3 associates with caveolae as part of a complex with caveolin-1 and other cavins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bastiani et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">McMahon et al., 2009</xref>), suggesting that caveolin-1 and other cavins may participate in the cavin-3 linkage. Mammalian genomes encode four cavins of which two (cavin-1 and cavin-3) are readily detectable in fibroblasts grown under normal culture conditions. We tested whether cavin-1 and caveolin-1 are components of the cavin-3 linkage using immunoprecipitation with antibodies to myosin-1c and found that in addition to cavin-3 both cavin-1 and caveolin-1 co-precipitated with myosin-1c (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). To test whether cavin-1 and caveolin-1 are necessary for the signaling function of the cavin-3 linkage, pERK and pAkt levels were compared in fibroblasts treated with siRNA against cavin-1, cavin-3, caveolin-1 or myosin-1c. Like the cavin-3 and myosin-1c knockdowns, knockdowns of caveolin-1 and cavin-1 increased pAkt at the expense of pERK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B,C</xref>). However, unlike the myosin-1c knockdown, knockdown of cavin-1 reduced the protein level of cavin-3, while knockdown of caveolin-1 reduced protein levels of both cavin-1 and cavin-3. To test whether the effects of cavin-1 and caveolin-1 knockdowns on pERK and pAkt depend upon changes in cavin-3 protein levels, we over-expressed cavin-3 in SV589 fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>) and repeated the four knockdowns. Cavin-3 over-expression partially protected cavin-3 levels from knockdown of cavin-1, cavin-3 or caveolin-1. This protection muted the effects of these knockdowns on pERK and pAkt levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E,F</xref>). Importantly, cavin-3 levels correlated better with pERK/ERK and pAkt/Akt ratios than did levels of either cavin-1 or caveolin-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C,F,G</xref>). The strength of this correlation suggests that cavin-3 is the limiting component of the cavin/caveolin complex for caveolar influence on ERK and Akt signaling. Both caveolin-1 and cavin-1 are required for normal abundance of caveolae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Drab et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Razani et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hill et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Liu et al., 2008</xref>). Caveolin-1 is an integral membrane protein that polymerizes to form filaments that coat the cytosolic surface of caveolae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fernandez et al., 2002</xref>). Cavin-1 has been proposed to serve as an adaptor that links other cavins to the caveolin coat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bastiani et al., 2009</xref>).

To test whether loss of the cavin-3 linkage is necessary for the altered cell signaling, metabolism and apoptosis phenotypes of cancer cells we tested whether reconstitution of the cavin-3 linkage was sufficient to normalize ERK/Akt signaling, cell metabolism and apoptosis. To facilitate this reconstitution, we looked for a cancer cell line that lacks cavin-3, but expresses normal levels of all other linkage components. While many cancer cell lines lack cavin-3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Xu et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bastiani et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lee et al., 2011</xref>), some lines such as PC-3 lacked additional linkage components (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bastiani et al., 2009</xref>). H1299 cells are a line of non-small cell lung carcinoma cells that lacked detectable cavin-3, but exhibited levels of cavin-1, caveolin-1, myosin-1c and actin that were similar to the endogenous levels of SV589 fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Comparison of the pERK and pAkt responses to mitogens showed that H1299 cells had pERK and pAkt responses that were similar to SV589 fibroblasts following cavin-3 knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). To reconstitute cavin-3 in H1299 cells, retroviral vectors were used to stably express either GFP alone (H/GFP) or GFP and cavin-3 (H/Cavin-3). Use of a weak promoter-expression system generated levels of cavin-3 expression in H/Cavin-3 cells that were similar to endogenous levels expressed in SV589 fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). Re-expression of cavin-3 restored the cavin-3 linkage as evidenced by the ability of myosin-1c antibody to co-precipitate cavin-1, cavin-3, and myosin-1c from lysates of H/Cavin-3 cells, but not H/GFP cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). Restoration of the cavin-3 linkage resulted in a 7.6-fold increase in surface caveolae and redistribution of caveolin-1 to the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). As compared to parental H1299 or H/GFP cells, H/Cavin-3 cells displayed higher levels of pERK and EGR1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B,E</xref>); lower levels of pAkt, HIF1α and pS6K (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B,E</xref>); and increased sensitivity to PD98059 and resistance to LY294002 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>).

Lung tissue from <italic>Prkcdbp</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> (Cavin-3 KO) animals showed decreased pERK, EGR1, and PTEN levels and increased pAkt and HIF1α levels as compared to lung tissue from wild-type animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A,B</xref>). The elevated HIF1α of Cavin-3 KO lung tissue was associated with increased fermentative glycolysis ex vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>). Thus, in vivo loss of cavin-3 promoted Akt signaling at the expense of ERK and increased glycolytic metabolism. However, these signaling changes were not associated with developmental defects, as would be expected if apoptosis were compromised, or hyperplasia, as would be expected if cell proliferation were augmented. Cavin-3 KO mice did have shorter lifespan than control animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9D</xref>) and the principal cause of death was cachexia as exemplified by a 40% reduction in body weight and severe lipodystrophy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9E,F</xref>). Lipodystrophy is frequently associated with hepatic steatosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Huang-Doran et al., 2010</xref>) and areas of steatosis were observed in livers of Cavin-3 KO animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9G</xref>).

Cavin-3 promotes ERK signaling by anchoring the ERK activation module of caveolae to F-actin at the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5 fig6">Figures 5 and 6</xref>) and suppresses Akt signaling by promoting EGR1 and PTEN expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7 fig8">Figures 7 and 8</xref>). The in vitro consequences of loss of cavin-3 include induction of Warburg metabolism, faster cell proliferation and resistance to apoptosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1 fig2 fig3 fig4 fig7">Figures 1–4, 7</xref>). The in vivo consequences of loss of cavin-3 include elevated use of glycolysis and cachexia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>).</p><p>The cavin-3 dependent coupling of caveolae to F-actin is analogous to linkages that generate other specialized domains of the plasma membrane. Peripheral F-actin is crosslinked by spectrins into a viscoelastic network (the membrane skeleton) that associates with the plasma membrane through diverse linkages. The spatial organization of specific linkages allows the membrane skeleton to generate specializations within the plasma membrane and loss of different organizing linkages results in loss of specific specialized domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bennett and Healy, 2008</xref>). Our findings show that cavin-3 is part of a linkage necessary for the caveolae specialization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5 fig6 fig7">Figures 5–7</xref>). Intriguingly, insulin receptors also associate with F-actin and are enriched at the border between caveolae and the rest of the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Foti et al., 2007</xref>). The combination of a receptor-actin linkage with the cavin-3 linkage suggests that the skeleton assembles mitogen receptors with the caveolar ERK activation module to facilitate signal transduction coupling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>). Other adaptors may link additional downstream signaling modules to the skeleton and different assemblies of receptors and signaling modules may dictate temporal, spatial, and cell-specific responses to common environmental cues. Skeleton-dependent integration of signaling pathways may promote cell differentiation because the sophistication of the skeleton correlates with the degree of cellular differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bennett and Healy, 2008</xref>) and defects in the skeleton are associated with dedifferentiation, increased cell proliferation and resistance to anoikis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Mishra et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kumar et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Whereas most linkages to the membrane skeleton are static, the cavin-3 linkage involves the motor molecule, myosin-1c, and the use of this motor may contribute to caveolae function in at least two ways. First, myosin-1c participates in the transport of lipid raft components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bond et al., 2013</xref>) and the use of myosin-1c may couple delivery of caveolar components with caveolae anchorage. Second, caveolae are endocytic structures and myosin-1c may control movement of caveolae vesicles within the cortical actin network. The majority of caveolae-derived vesicles remain at the cell periphery where they re-fuse with the plasma membrane in a cyclic process referred to as potocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anderson et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Boucrot et al., 2011</xref>). Myosin-1c may drive caveolae-derived vesicles back to the cell surface in a calcium-regulated manner because calcium channels are enriched in caveolae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Isshiki et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Pani and Singh, 2009</xref>), the Donnan effects generated by endocytosis promote calcium channel opening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Saito et al., 2007</xref>) and calcium promotes both myosin-1c motor activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barylko et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Zhu et al., 1998</xref>) and recycling of caveolae-derived vesicles back to the cell surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lin et al., 2012</xref>). Potocytosis of caveolae may regulate the strength of signal transduction from surface receptors to ERK or allow ERK signal transduction to be moved to different sites along the plasma membrane.</p><p>Importantly, the effects of cavin-3 on ERK signaling are matched by inverse changes in Akt signaling. EGR1 can participate in a reciprocal relationship between ERK and Akt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Yu et al., 2011</xref>) and our findings show that cavin-3 suppresses pAkt via EGR1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). EGR1 induces PTEN expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baron et al., 2006</xref>); however, our findings show that induction of PTEN expression is not the only mechanism by which EGR1 suppresses Akt activation. How EGR1 suppresses Akt activation is currently under investigation. Alterations in cavin-3 protein levels have proportionate effects on pERK and pAkt levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>) and the tightness of this correlation may be the result of positive and negative feedback loops involving EGR1 and cavin-3. EGR1 can promote ERK activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Shen et al., 2011</xref>) and ERK activation drives EGR1 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cohen, 1996</xref>). This positive feedback loop requires cavin-3 because both pERK and EGR1 expression are suppressed in the absence of cavin-3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1 fig2 fig3 fig4 fig7">Figures 1–4, 7</xref>). Cavin-3 and EGR1 also act within a negative feedback loop because EGR1 down-regulates cavin-1 and caveolin-1 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Joshi et al., 2012</xref>) and loss of either cavin-1 or caveolin-1 suppresses cavin-3 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Regulation within these feedback loops may set the balance point between pERK and pAkt.</p><p>Interestingly, modulation of cellular phenotypes in response to changes in this balance point involves substantial hysteresis. Treatment with cavin-3 siRNA reduces cavin-3 protein levels by more than 80% within 3-days; however, the phenotypic effects of cavin-3 depletion require 10–15 days to manifest fully (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1 fig2 fig3">Figures 1–3</xref>). Many of these phenotypic effects involve extensive changes in gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1 fig3">Figures 1A and 3A</xref>). While the extent of these cellular changes may require some time to complete, our data suggest that more active processes are responsible for the hysteresis. EGR1 protein levels fall slowly during the 15-day time course, despite rapid loss of pERK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) and the short half-life of EGR1 protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Waters et al., 1990</xref>). EGR1 expression can be supported by means other than ERK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hallahan et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Guillemot et al., 2001</xref>) and these mechanisms may slow the loss of EGR1. The gradual loss of EGR1 coincides with gradual increases in survivin, pS6K and HIF1α (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). The slowly evolving changes in these and other factors likely dictate the time-dependence for the manifestations of resistance to apoptosis, aerobic glycolysis and acceleration in cell proliferation. The length of time required to reach the final phenotypic state also provides a general note of caution with respect to knockdown experiments. siRNA knockdowns are typically assayed 3 days post-transfection; however, our data show that this time window may capture an intermediate state that differs substantially from chronic loss-of-function. Characterization of intermediate states may improve understanding of how proteins such as cavin-3 impact the panoply of cellular processes.</p><p>The ability of cavin-3 to influence cell signaling, proliferation, metabolism, and apoptosis provides explanations for how cavin-3 functions as a tumor suppressor; however, Cavin-3 KO animals do not show substantial increases in spontaneous cancers. These observations imply that loss of cavin-3 is not sufficient for tumorigenesis. Consistent with this conclusion, loss of cavin-3 expression is more prevalent in late-stage/high-grade cancers than in early-stage/low-grade cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lee et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Caren et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Wikman et al., 2012</xref>). A potential clue as to the role of cavin-3 in cancer comes from the observation that 35–55% of glial, lung, gastric, ovarian, breast, and colorectal cancers show hypermethylation in their cavin-3 promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Xu et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Zochbauer-Muller et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lee et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Martinez et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Tong et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lee et al., 2011</xref>). Methylation of the cavin-3 promoter also occurs normally in trophoblasts when they invade the endometrium during pregnancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Grigoriu et al., 2011</xref>). Trophoblast invasion shares many features with cancer cell metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ferretti et al., 2007</xref>) and the degree of methylation in the cavin-3 promoter correlates with both trophoblast invasion potential and cancer metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Wikman et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">van Dijk et al., 2012</xref>). The accelerated cell proliferation, induction of Warburg metabolism and resistance to apoptosis that results from loss of cavin-3 may facilitate the ability of invading cells to survive and proliferate in new environments and may thus provide strong selection for loss of cavin-3 function in cancer cells. Strong selection pressure for loss of cavin-3 in cancer cells is suggested by the observation that while 41% of primary non-small cell lung carcinomas show methylation of their cavin-3 promoters, 81% of these carcinomas (N = 93) lack detectable cavin-3 expression by immunohistochemistry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Zochbauer-Muller et al., 2005</xref>). Lung cancers are not commonly detected until late in disease progression and loss of cavin-3 may facilitate stage progression to metastatic disease.</p><p>The most apparent defect in Cavin-3 KO animals is cachexia as evidenced by a 40% reduction in weight and severe lipodystrophy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). Lipodystrophies have also been noted in humans and animals lacking either cavin-1 or caveolin-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cao et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kim et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Liu et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hayashi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Asterholm et al., 2012</xref>) and the association of cavin-3 with cavin-1 and caveolin-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bastiani et al., 2009</xref>) combined with the dependence of cavin-3 protein on cavin-1 and caveolin-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) suggests that these lipodystrophies are caused by a common mechanism. Loss of cavin-3 linkage components may cause lipodystrophy through selective death in adipocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Martin et al., 2012</xref>); however, lipid mobilizing factors are elevated in the circulation of Cavin-3 KO animals (data not shown), suggesting that lipolysis is responsible for the loss of triglyceride stores. Cavin-3 KO animals exhibit increased use of fermentative glycolysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>) and this increase may promote lipolysis for the purpose of clearing lactate. Glycolysis generates lactate and hepatocytes convert lactate back to glucose through the Cori cycle, which fuels the necessary gluconeogenesis via oxidative phosphorylation of fatty acids. Loss of caveolae increases flux through the Cori cycle as evidenced by the increased rates of lactate production, hepatic gluconeogenesis and adipocyte lipolysis in <italic>Cav1</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> (Caveolin-1 KO) mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Asterholm et al., 2012</xref>). Whole body lactate production increases with age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Wallace, 2005</xref>) and loss of cavin-3 may exasperate lactate production to a point after which fatty acid demand for gluconeogenesis triggers lipolysis of triglycerides stored in adipose tissue. As lactate production continues to increase, host responses to lactate may drive cannibalization of protein from muscle, which in the absence of cancer is the source of most lactate production. Cancers that commonly elicit cachexia include lung, breast, and colorectal cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Fox et al., 2009</xref>) and these cancers frequently lack cavin-3 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Xu et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Zochbauer-Muller et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lee et al., 2011</xref>). Thus, the absence of cavin-3 in tumors may predispose patients to the development of cancer-associated cachexia, a condition that is the immediate cause of death for more than 20% of all cancer patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Tisdale, 2002</xref>).</p><p>Recent work has shown that caveolae of different tissues and cell types have different cavin compositions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bastiani et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hansen et al., 2013</xref>). The fibroblasts and epithelial cells examined here express cavin-1 and cavin-3, but lack cavin-2 and cavin-4. By contrast, adipocytes abundantly express cavin-2, myocytes have abundant cavin-4 and endothelial cells have different compositions depending upon tissue localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Stan et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Ogata et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bastiani et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hansen et al., 2013</xref>). Use of different cavins may provide alternative linkages that can support surface caveolae or provide novel functions for caveolae in different cell types. Many functions have been ascribed to caveolae including mitogen signaling, mechanosensing, nitric oxide signaling, endocytosis, and transcytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Boscher and Nabi, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kiss, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Mineo and Shaul, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Nassoy and Lamaze, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Parton and del Pozo, 2013</xref>). Different cavin compositions may support different functions in different cellular settings. We show here that cavin-3 plays a critical role in the signal transduction function of caveolae and that cells, which normally express cavin-3, rely upon cavin-3 for normal ERK and Akt signaling with consequences for cell metabolism, apoptosis, and cell proliferation.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Antibodies</title><p>The following antibodies were used in this study.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor and 3 reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The reviewers found that your study of cavin-3 was novel and interesting. However, a number of questions arose during the review that will need to be addressed in a revised manuscript.</p><p>1) No RNAi sequences are described and it appears that, in each case, only a single sequence was used; no control RNAi was employed; and no rescue studies were performed. Moreover, control studies using RNAi on WT cells are missing (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>).</p><p>2) The phenotype described indicates defects in growth factor-stimulated signaling pathways (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). However, in two instances, no overt stimulation was employed (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2 fig7">Figures 2BC &amp; 7A</xref>). This should be corrected.</p><p>3) The authors show that TNF causes cell death when added to human and murine fibroblasts. Others have found that TNF does not cause cell death in such cells unless combined with inhibition of NF-kB, protein synthesis or RNA synthesis.</p><p>4) The authors state that the IEC profile is “driven by ERK”. What is the evidence for this?</p><p>5) The authors present a number of criteria for identifying the interacting protein as myosin-1c. The implication of the presentation is that proteins other than myosin-1c were tested and rejected. Please explain.</p><p>6) How general is the mechanism that cavin-3 dictates the balance between ERK and pAkt signaling? It is argued that control of PTEN is responsible for the effects of cavin-3 on Akt regulation. This cannot be the entire story, since PC3 cells are genetically deficient in PTEN – there must be an alternative mechanism. Presumably this is why analysis of PC3 was left out for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>. Some discussion is in order.</p><p>7) Cavin-3 knock-out mice have recently been reported by Hansen et al. (Nat. Commun. 4:1831. doi: <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.1038/ncomms2808">10.1038/ncomms2808</ext-link>).

In response to these comments, the following data have been added to the resubmission: (1) Edge analysis of the IE microarray data. This analysis illustrates that depletion of cavin-3 suppresses expression of ERK-induced transcripts. (2) Knockdowns of cavin-1, cavin-3, caveolin-1 and myosin-1c in SV589 fibroblasts over-expressing cavin-3. Comparisons of pERK/ERK and pAkt/Akt vs cavin-3 level in this data set together with that of the prior data set using SV589 fibroblasts expressing endogenous levels of cavin-3 show that pERK/ERK and pAkt/Akt levels correlate with the level of cavin-3, but not the levels of cavin-1 or caveolin-1. This finding indicates that the cavin-3 component of the cavin/caveolin complex dictates the pERK/pAkt ratio. (3) Immunoprecipitation data using H/GFP and H/Cavin-3 cells. These data show that the association of cavin-1 and caveolin-1 with myosin-1c requires the presence of cavin-3. (4) Time courses of pERK/pAkt responses to EGF for SV589 fibroblasts, SV589 fibroblasts treated with cavin-3 siRNA, PC-3 and H1299 cells. (5) pS6K/S6K data for the knockdown, MEF and H1299 models. These data show that loss of cavin-3 activates mTORC1 and that cavin-3 normally suppresses mTORC1 via EGR1. (6) Glucose uptake and lactate production for EGR1 and cavin-3 reconstitutions in the MEF and H1299 models. These data show that cavin-3 suppresses aerobic glycolysis via EGR1. (7) TNFα sensitivity for the EGR1 and cavin-3 reconstitutions in the MEF and H1299 models. These data show that cavin-3 drives an essential process for TNFα-dependent apoptosis that is EGR1-independent. In order to accommodate the new data, the figures have been restructured. Of particular note is that <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> of the original submission has been broken into 3 figures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1 fig2 fig3">Figures 1–3</xref>). The writing in the manuscript has been altered to incorporate both the new data and specific critiques made by the reviewers. Responses to individual critiques are detailed below.</p><p><italic>1) No RNAi sequences are described and it appears that, in each case, only a single sequence was used; no control RNAi was employed; and no rescue studies were performed. Moreover, control studies using RNAi on WT cells are missing (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>)</italic>.</p><p>Response 1: siRNA sequences are now provided in the Methods. Initial experiments showed similar effects on ERK signaling by three different cavin-3 RNAi sequences. All experiments shown in the manuscript used an equal molar mixture of these three cavin-3 oligos.</p><p>Response 2: To validate that the effects of cavin-3 siRNA treatment were due to loss of cavin-3 as opposed to off-target effects, we chose to test whether loss of cavin-3 had similar effects in different model systems in which loss of cavin-3 resulted from different means: the MEF model uses a genetic knockout of the cavin-3 locus and the H1299 model is an epigenetic hypomorph of cavin-3. All three in vitro models showed similar effects on ERK/Akt signaling, cell proliferation, cell metabolism and apoptosis.</p><p>Response 3: Rescue experiments were performed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5 fig6">Figures 5 and 6</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7 fig8">Figures 7 and 8</xref> in the resubmission) with the MEF and H1299 models. The original submission provided immunoblots, ERK/Akt quantification and caveolin-1 immunofluorescence data in cells stably expressing either EGR1 or cavin-3 under control of a viral promoter. In the resubmission, we now provide cell metabolism and apoptosis data for the rescue experiments in both the MEF and H1299 models. This additional data now show that cavin-3 expression is sufficient to fully normalize both H1299 and MEF models, but that EGR1 expression is only able to normalize Akt/mTORC1/HIF1 signaling and cell metabolism. EGR1 is unable to normalize sensitivity to TNFα. This new finding suggests that cavin-3 supports an EGR1-independent process that is necessary for TNFα-induced apoptosis. The EGR1-independent process may involve caveolae or pERK, neither of which are normalized by EGR1 expression.</p><p>Response 4: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> in the resubmission) does not contain an siRNA experiment. This figure details the viral expression of EGR1 and cavin-3 in Cavin-3<sup>-/-</sup> MEFs and H1299 cells, neither of which express cavin-3 or EGR1 natively. The WT MEFs and SV589 fibroblasts are positive controls for the viral expressions. The writing in the Results has been changed to better indicate this point.</p><p><italic>2) The phenotype described indicates defects in growth factor-stimulated signaling pathways (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). However, in two instances, no overt stimulation was employed (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2 fig7">Figures 2BC &amp; 7A</xref>). This should be corrected</italic>.</p><p>We began this study looking for an effect of cavin-3 loss on the EGF signaling pathway because of the importance of EGFR signaling in many carcinomas; however, results of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> show that loss of cavin-3 suppresses the ability of multiple mitogens individually and collectively (serum) to drive ERK activation. This finding spurred us to focus on cavin-3 function in the presence of serum. We have altered the wording throughout the manuscript to better reflect this focus.</p><p><italic>3) The authors show that TNF causes cell death when added to human and murine fibroblasts. Others have found that TNF does not cause cell death in such cells unless combined with inhibition of NF-kB, protein synthesis or RNA synthesis</italic>.</p><p>The methods detailing the apoptosis assays were inadvertently left out. All apoptosis assays used cycloheximide. The Methods section now describes both the TUNEL and PARP1 cleavage assays in detail and the use of cyclohexamide is now indicated in the figure legends.</p><p><italic>4) The authors state that the IEC profile is “driven by ERK”. What is the evidence for this</italic>?</p><p>The full statement was “Suppressed transcripts fell into two categories: those that were fully suppressed by three days of knockdown and those that fell gradually during the 15-day time course. Most IE response transcripts in the first group encoded proteins whose expression is driven by ERK.” This statement was based upon microarray data and the immunoblot in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>. These observations showed that ERK-induced transcripts were selectively suppressed following cavin-3 knockdown. We now provide edge analysis in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> showing the 15 transcripts with the highest induction in the absence of knockdown together with their relative induction following 3, 8 and 15 days of knockdown. A literature search identified 8 of the 15 transcripts as genes whose transcription is promoted by ERK. All eight fail to be induced by EGF following 3 or more days of cavin-3 knockdown. References for ERK-dependent induction of these transcripts are provided.</p><p><italic>5) The authors present a number of criteria for identifying the interacting protein as myosin-1c. The implication of the presentation is that proteins other than Myosin1c were tested and rejected. Please explain</italic>.</p><p>The caveolae/lipid raft associated actin binding proteins that were identified in the Foster paper were α-catenin, cofilin, ezrin, talin, myosin heavy chain, myosin-1a, myosin-1c, myosin-X and myosin-XV. Because this proteomic screen did not distinguish between caveolae and lipid rafts, we used literature data to exclude proteins that did not co-localize with caveolae. Myosin heavy chain forms filaments that pull on actin stress fibers, but caveolae are not associated with actin stress fibers. Myosin-X and myosin-XV are localized to filopodia, but caveolae are not. Myosin-1a is localized to brush borders, but caveolae are not. Talin is localized to cell adhesions, but caveolae are not. α-catenin participates in actin bundling but does not show strong caveolae co-localization. Cofilin is an actin disassembly factor. Tossing these proteins left myosin-1c and ezrin. Both proteins co-localized with caveolae, but only knockdown of myosin-1c was able to phenocopy the effects of cavin-3 knockdown on pERK. Subsequent experiments (co-IP, cell fractionation) validated a role for myosin-1c in the cavin-3 linkage.</p><p><italic>6.1) How general is the mechanism that cavin-3 dictates the balance between ERK and pAkt signaling</italic>?</p><p>There are undoubtedly other mechanisms that influence the balance between ERK and Akt. First, loss of cavin-3 suppresses pERK levels ∼4-fold but does not eliminate pERK. Second, genetic loss of both ERK1 and ERK2 is lethal, but loss of cavin-3 is not. Third, not all cells that elicit pERK responses have caveolae. For example neurons and hepatocytes have few caveolae, but are able to mount ERK responses to trophic factors. Fourth, not all caveolae are equivalent. Caveolae of adipocytes have abundant cavin-2, myocyte caveolae have high levels of cavin-4 and endothelial caveolae are varied in their composition. What our data says is that for cells that normally express cavin-3, cavin-3 is necessary for a normal pAkt/pERK ratio with consequences for cell growth, metabolism and apoptosis. Of key significance is that epithelial cells appear to be a cell type that uses cavin-3 for this purpose and we show that reconstitution of cavin-3 in carcinoma cells that have lost cavin-3 expression is sufficient to normalize Akt/ERK signaling, cell metabolism, cell growth and sensitivity to TNFα. Given that loss of cavin-3 expression is widespread in cancer cells, loss of cavin-3 linkage function may be a common mechanism by which cancer cells achieve an Akt-dominated state that exhibits Warburg metabolism, rapid cell proliferation and resistance to apoptosis. We are beginning to look at other cell types to address the generality of the role we observe for cavin-3 in ERK and Akt signaling. The last paragraph of the Discussion now discusses the generality of our results.</p><p><italic>6.2) It is argued that control of PTEN is responsible for the effects of cavin-3 on Akt regulation. This cannot be the entire story, since PC3 cells are genetically deficient in PTEN – there must be an alternative mechanism. Presumably this is why analysis of PC3 was left out for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>. Some discussion is in order</italic>.</p><p>The reviewers are absolutely correct about additional mechanisms. H1299 cells suppress PTEN through promoter methylation and neither cavin-3 nor EGR1 was capable of substantially increasing PTEN levels, yet both cavin-3 and EGR1 normalized pAkt levels. We hypothesize that EGR1 drives expression of other proteins that inhibit Akt activation and are starting to explore how this suppression works using candidates identified in our microarray data. Regarding PC-3 cells, we chose not to pursue this cell line because these cells lack cavin-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> in the resubmission) and loss of cavin-1 suppresses cavin-3 levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). PC-3 cells are of interest to us for future experiments both because these cells lack all four cavins, which will facilitate isogenic reconstitution experiments, and because caveolin-1 promotes cell migration and metastasis in PC-3 cells. Loss of cavin-3 is associated with both cancer cell metastasis and trophoblast migration and loss of cavin-3 may drive caveolin-1 into a process that facilitates cell migration. A discussion of additional mechanisms beyond PTEN protein level is now provided in both the Results and Discussion.</p><p><italic>7) Cavin-3 knock-out mice have recently been reported by Hansen et al. (Nat. Commun. 4:1831. doi: <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.1038/ncomms2808">10.1038/ncomms2808</ext-link>). These authors demonstrate no effect on caveoli formation in endothelial tissues and also show that, similar to the current study, the loss of caveolin-1 or cavin-1 results in reduced cavin-3 protein levels. The authors should discuss how this paper relates to their own study</italic>.</p><p>The Hansen paper is now referenced and discussed.</p><p><italic>8) The authors propose a model whereby cavin-3 forms a complex with cavin-1 and caveolin-1 that links to F-actin and growth signals via an interaction between cavin-3 and myosin-1c (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). The data presented demonstrates that myosin-1c can immunoprecipitate with all three proteins so it is unclear what the evidence is for cavin-3 directly interacting with myosin-1c</italic>.</p><p>We now provide immunnoprecipitation experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> that show that cavin-3 is required for the ability of cavin-1 and caveolin-1 to co-precipitate with myosin-1c. This dependence coincides with cavin-3-dependent normalization of caveolae abundance, pERK, pAkt, pS6K, EGR1, PTEN, HIF1α, survivin, growth rate, glycolysis and sensitivity to PD98059, LY294002 and TNFα. While we recognize that direct tests of interaction using purified proteins would have been preferable, these experiments are not currently feasible. Cavin-3 is a phosphoprotein and we now have preliminary data showing that phosphorylation is required for cavin-3 function. We have identified two serines that must be phosphorylated for cavin-3 function and prediction algorithms suggest that an additional three residues may also be phosphorylated. Myosin-1c binds to negatively charged cargos and we suspect that these phosphorylations provide the complementary charges that drive myosin-1c interaction with cavin-3; however, until we know which residues must be phosphorylated and whether aspartate/glutamate substitutions can substitute for phosphorylation we cannot begin to test for direct interactions with purified proteins.</p><p><italic>9) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>: siRNA knockdown of caveolin-1 or cavin-1 leads to loss of cavin-3 protein, correlating with reduced ERK phosphorylation and increased Akt phosphorylation. Complementation studies should be performed to test the proposed model. Are the changes in ERK/Akt signaling after caveolin-1/cavin-1 knock-down due to reduced cavin-3 protein levels, or due to loss of the complex</italic>?</p><p>Complementation studies are now provided in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>. We over-expressed cavin-3 by 2.5-fold in human fibroblasts and repeated the knockdown comparisons of pERK/ERK and pAkt/Akt. We find that over-expression of cavin-3 hindered the ability of cavin-1 and caveolin-1 knockdowns to suppress cavin-3 levels with commiserate effects on pERK/ERK and pAkt/Akt levels. Myosin-1c knockdown by contrast had little effect on cavin-1, cavin-3 or caveolin-1 level despite near maximal effect on pERK and pAkt levels. These observations indicate that cavin-3 and myosin-1c provide limiting activities that are necessary for normal ERK and Akt signaling. Caveolin-1 and cavin-1 play a required role in that their expression is necessary to stabilize cavin-3 levels. Caveolin-1 is an integral membrane protein that forms the core of the filamentous coat of caveolae. Cavin-1 has been proposed to act as an adaptor for the binding of other cavins. This published literature together with our data led to our proposal that cavin-3 bridges between the cavin-1/caveolin-1 complex and myosin-1/F-actin. Additional support for this conclusion comes from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>, which as described in the response to critique 8, shows that cavin-3 is necessary for the ability of antibodies to myosin-1c to co-precipitate cavin-1 and caveolin-1. Literature in support of the model is now provided.</p></body></sub-article></article>
