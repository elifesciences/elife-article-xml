By binding adenosine triphosphate (ATP) or deoxyadenosine triphosphate (dATP) it regulates the enzyme activity of all classes of RNR. Functional and structural work on aerobic RNRs has revealed a plethora of ways in which dATP inhibits activity by inducing oligomerisation and preventing a productive radical transfer from one subunit to the active site in the other. Anaerobic RNRs, on the other hand, store a stable glycyl radical next to the active site and the basis for their dATP-dependent inhibition is completely unknown. We present biochemical, biophysical, and structural information on the effects of ATP and dATP binding to the anaerobic RNR from <italic>Prevotella copri</italic>. The enzyme exists in a dimer–tetramer equilibrium biased towards dimers when two ATP molecules are bound to the ATP-cone and tetramers when two dATP molecules are bound. In the presence of ATP, <italic>P. copri</italic> NrdD is active and has a fully ordered glycyl radical domain (GRD) in one monomer of the dimer. Binding of dATP to the ATP-cone results in loss of activity and increased dynamics of the GRD, such that it cannot be detected in the cryo-EM structures. The glycyl radical is formed even in the dATP-bound form, but the substrate does not bind. The structures implicate a complex network of interactions in activity regulation that involve the GRD more than 30 Å away from the dATP molecules, the allosteric substrate specificity site and a conserved but previously unseen flap over the active site. Taken together, the results suggest that dATP inhibition in anaerobic RNRs acts by increasing the flexibility of the flap and GRD, thereby preventing both substrate binding and radical mobilisation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>Prevotella copri</italic></kwd><kwd>ribonucleotide reductase</kwd><kwd>glycyl radical</kwd><kwd>allosteric regulation</kwd><kwd>ATP-cone</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004359</institution-id><institution>Vetenskapsrådet</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2019-01400</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sjöberg</surname><given-names>Britt-Marie</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004359</institution-id><institution>Vetenskapsrådet</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2016-04855</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Logan</surname><given-names>Derek T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002794</institution-id><institution>Cancerfonden</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CAN 20 1210 PjF</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sjöberg</surname><given-names>Britt-Marie</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100014437</institution-id><institution>Wenner-Gren Stiftelserna</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sjöberg</surname><given-names>Britt-Marie</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The first structural and biochemical study of the role of the ATP-cone in anaerobic ribonucleotide reductases shows that dATP allosterically prevents transfer of a glycyl radical to the substrate.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Ribonucleotide reductases (RNRs) are a family of enzymes with sophisticated radical chemistries and allosteric regulation. RNRs produce all four deoxyribonucleotides and are the only enzymes providing de novo building blocks for DNA replication and repair in all free-living organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mathews, 2016</xref>). Virtually all RNRs possess an allosteric site regulating substrate specificity (the s-site), a crucial aspect of RNR that ultimately provides a balanced supply of deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mathews, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mathews, 2018</xref>). A second allosteric site (the a-site) is located in an N-terminal domain called the ATP-cone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aravind et al., 2000</xref>), found in the majority of RNRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jonna et al., 2015</xref>). Whereas the s-site binds all dNTPs and usually ATP, the a-site in the ATP-cone can only bind ATP and dATP. Binding of ATP activates RNR, and binding of dATP inhibits it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hofer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Martínez-Carranza et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>The RNR family consists of three evolutionarily related classes (I–III) with a common radical-based reaction mechanism but differing in the mode of radical generation and in quaternary structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wiley, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lundin et al., 2015</xref>). Class I, strictly aerobic RNRs are heterotetramers consisting of two α subunits (NrdA) with binding sites for substrates and allosteric nucleotides and two β subunits (NrdB) that harbour a radical initiator in the form of a stable radical or an oxidised metal cluster (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wiley, 2001</xref>). Class II RNRs are either dimers or monomers with an α subunit (NrdJ) that, in addition to binding sites for substrate and allosteric nucleotides, also harbours the radical initiator cofactor adenosylcobalamin. Class III RNRs, which only function anaerobically, are dimers of an α subunit (NrdD) with a stable radical close to the active site, and binding sites for allosteric nucleotides. The radical is introduced via encounter with a specific radical-SAM enzyme called NrdG, and once activated NrdD can perform multiple turnovers in the absence of NrdG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Backman et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Torrents et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p>The dATP-dependent inhibition has been biochemically characterised in representatives of all three RNR classes, but only structurally studied in class I. A common denominator of all inhibited class I RNRs is oligomerisation, leading to disturbed radical transfer between the α and β subunits. Hitherto four different inhibitory oligomerisation mechanisms have been identified: heterooctameric α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>4</sub> complexes in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, <italic>Clostridium botulinum</italic>, and <italic>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ando et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Martínez-Carranza et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wei et al., 2014</xref>), an α<sub>4</sub> complex in <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Johansson et al., 2016</xref>), α<sub>6</sub> complexes in the eukaryotes <italic>Homo sapiens</italic>, <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, and <italic>Dictyostelium discoideum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ando et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brignole et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Crona et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fairman et al., 2011</xref>), and a β<sub>4</sub> complex in the bacterium <italic>Leeuwenhoekiella blandensis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rozman Grinberg et al., 2018a</xref>). All of these class I oligomers involve protein–protein interactions mediated by the ATP-cone domain.</p><p>The ATP-cone is in essence restricted to RNRs and the RNR-specific repressor NrdR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rozman Grinberg et al., 2022</xref>). Among RNRs it is found in about 80% of class III enzymes and about 50% of class I enzymes, but less than 10% of class II enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jonna et al., 2015</xref>). The presence and function of the ATP-cone domain distinguish anaerobic RNRs from the other members of the large glycyl radical enzyme (GRE) family that are otherwise structurally related (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Backman et al., 2017</xref>). The allosteric regulation mechanisms of class III RNRs (NrdDs) from <italic>E. coli</italic>, bacteriophage T4 and <italic>Lactococcus lactis</italic> were determined several decades ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andersson et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Eliasson et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Torrents et al., 2000</xref>). T4NrdD was the first class III RNR structure solved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Logan et al., 1999</xref>), and later, structures of <italic>Thermotoga maritima</italic> NrdD (TmNrdD) have been published (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Aurelius et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wei et al., 2014</xref>). However, these two NrdDs lack an ATP-cone and the structural basis for allosteric activity regulation in the class III RNRs is still an outstanding question. Here, we present structural, biochemical, and biophysical studies on the ATP-cone-containing NrdD from the human pathogen <italic>Prevotella copri</italic> (PcNrdD; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nii et al., 2023</xref>), showing that the binding of dATP causes increased flexibility of the C-terminal glycyl radical-bearing domain, as well as a flap-like loop that binds across the top of the active site in the active form. This increase in dynamics is coupled to enzymatic inactivation by inhibition of substrate binding and radical transfer. The final outcome of dATP inhibition is thus blocked radical transfer in both class I and III RNRs, but it is achieved by completely different mechanisms, i.e. oligomerisation prevents radical transfer between subunits in class I RNRs but long-range modulation of the flexibility of key structural elements prevents substrate binding in class III RNRs.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Allosteric activity regulation by ATP and dATP</title><p>The amino acid sequence of PcNrdD suggests that it belongs to the formate-requiring class III RNRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Burnim et al., 2022b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wei et al., 2014</xref>), and initial optimisation of the assay composition showed that this was the case (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). ATP-cone-mediated activation of PcNrdD enzyme activity by ATP or inhibition by dATP was tested with two different substrates. With guanosine triphosphate (GTP) as substrate the s-site was filled with dTTP as effector, and in absence of any a-site effector the basal level of GTP reduction was 21 ± 2 nmol/min/mg.

It is obvious from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref> that increasing concentrations of ATP initially stimulate activity and that high levels of ATP cause inhibition, plausibly by ATP also acting as substrate.

Addition of dATP initially results in a stimulation of enzyme activity, conceivably when the s-site is filled with dATP, after which competing inhibition appears when dATP also binds to the ATP-cone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). All in all, these results suggest that the ATP-cone in PcNrdD responds similarly to inhibition by dATP as has been observed before for several class I RNRs.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Binding of nucleotides to the ATP-cone</title><p>To confirm binding of ATP or dATP to the ATP-cone we used isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and microscale thermophoresis (MST) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Substrate GTP and s-site effector dTTP were used to fill up the other nucleotide-binding sites in PcNrdD.

Collectively, ITC and MST instead suggested that ATP and dATP may interact at two distinct sites in the ATP-cone for the functional readout of dATP inhibition, as has earlier been observed in the transcriptional repressor NrdR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rozman Grinberg et al., 2022</xref>). To test this hypothesis, apo-PcNrdD was incubated with ATP only, dATP only, or a combination of ATP and dATP, then desalted, boiled, centrifuged, and the nucleotide content of the supernatant analysed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref> shows that only dATP was bound when PcNrdD was incubated with a combination of ATP and dATP. This was also the case when incubations were performed in the presence of s-site effector and substrate, and also when the desalting was performed in the presence of s-site allosteric effector and substrate. In incubations with only ATP, s-site effector and substrate were needed during the entire work-up procedure for ATP to be retained by the protein. In conclusion, the binding experiments suggest that the PcNrdD ATP-cone can bind either ATP or dATP but not both simultaneously. Importantly, the results point to allosteric communication between the s-site, the active site, and the a-site in the ATP-cone, as dTTP and GTP are required for any ATP to be retained.

The ATP-cones containing the a-site are flexible, but the reconstruction from a subset of particles allowed the modelling of two ATP molecules per ATP-cone and many of the most important side chains. The ATP molecules are bound similarly to the twin dATP molecules seen in the ATP-cones of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> NrdA (PaNrdA) and <italic>L. blandensis</italic> NrdB (LbNrdB) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Johansson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rozman Grinberg et al., 2018a</xref>), and to dATP bound to PcNrdD itself (see below). However, the ATP-cones in PcNrdD exhibit a hitherto unobserved relative orientation in which the four triphosphate groups are projected towards each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b, d</xref>). The large negative charge is compensated for by the proximity of as many as 12 Arg and Lys side chains from both monomers. The ATP-cones interact by contacts involving the ‘roof’ of the domain (residues 1–18). Arg11 of each ATP-cone reaches over to interact with the α-phosphate group of one of the ATP molecules in the other ATP-cone, and a salt bridge is formed between Asp9 at the end of the lid and Arg91 at the end of the last helix of the other ATP-cone. Strikingly, the dimer of ATP-cones is slightly offset from the dimer axis of the core protein, such that the ATP-cone of the inactive monomer approaches the core domain of the active monomer, while the ATP-cone of the active monomer is more distant from the core domain of the inactive one (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a, b</xref>). However, the closest atom of any ATP molecule is over 30 Å from the substrate CTP in the active site.</p><p>The glycyl radical site is found at Gly711, at the tip of a loop projected from the C-terminal region of the enzyme into the barrel, where it approaches the radical initiator cysteine Cys416 at the tip of a loop stretching through the barrel from the other side (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). The second cysteine necessary for the radical mechanism of PcNrdD is Cys171 on the first β-strand of the barrel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6e</xref>). Consistent with the fact that PcNrdD belongs to the group of anaerobic RNRs that use formate as overall reductant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Burnim et al., 2022a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mulliez et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wei et al., 2014</xref>), there is no third cysteine residue on the sixth β-strand, and its place is taken by Asn435. As usual for GREs, Gly711 is completely buried within the barrel, with no solvent-accessible surface area. The base, phosphate, and most of the ribose of substrate CTP are well-defined but the density is weaker around the 5′ C-atom (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6e</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>The intricate network of interactions between the NxN flap, C-terminal glycyl radical domain (GRD), loop 2, and substrate in the ATP–CTP complex of PcNrdD.</title><p>The NxN flap is coloured light green, the GRD orange, loop 2 dark red, and the Cys radical loop yellow.

This conformation of the C-terminus is very similar to the one seen for TmNrdD in PDB entry 4U3E (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wei et al., 2014</xref>). This tail makes few specific interactions with other residues in the core.</p><p>When compared to previously determined NrdD structures, the first common structural element is a long α-helix in the core domain stretching from Thr123 to Leu141. Between this and the ATP-cone are the linker (92–110), followed by the flap over the substrate in the active site (111–122). Two residues from the flap make H-bonds to CTP: Asn114 to the γ-phosphate group and Asn116 to the amino group of the cytosine base. We call this region the ‘NxN flap’, as the NxN motif (114–116) is one of the most highly conserved sequence motifs in the NrdD family (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6f</xref>). This is the first time such interactions have been observed in an NrdD, as the flap corresponds to a disordered segment of 17 residues in the structures of TmNrdD and T4NrdD. However, an AlphaFold2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jumper et al., 2021</xref>) model of TmNrdD (entry Q9WYL) suggests that this linker potentially has the same conformation in TmNrdD and possibly all other NrdDs, whether or not they have an ATP-cone. As seen previously in TmNrdD, the triphosphate moiety is recognised through the conserved HxHD motif (157–160), H-bonds to the main chain atoms of a loop (577–581) following the third-last strand of the α/β barrel and the dipole of the following helix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6f</xref>).</p><p>Significantly, the NxN flap forms the nexus of a network of interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) between the substrate, the linker to the ATP-cone, the C-terminal GRD, and ‘loop 2’ (residues 304–311) that is responsible for communicating the substrate specificity signal from the s-site at the dimer interface to the active site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Aurelius et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Larsson et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Logan et al., 1999</xref>). Important interactions linking the NxN flap to the C-terminus include H-bonds from Tyr712, which immediately follows the radical Gly711, to Glu581, which bridges to both the substrate and Ala115 in the flap, as well as from Arg719 in the GRD to the main chain carbonyl groups of Asn114 and Met117 in the flap. Tyr712 is highly conserved in the NrdD family (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6f</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>). This nexus is crucial for allosteric activity regulation, as will be discussed later.</p><p>As the NxN flap appears to close off the top of the active site, we used the web server Caver Web v1.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Stourac et al., 2019</xref>) to analyse substrate access to the active site in the ATP-bound form, and identified a tunnel ~12 Å long leading from the surface of the protein to the active site that is 5.6 Å in diameter at its narrowest point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). Thus, in principle a fresh substrate could diffuse into the active site on each catalytic cycle.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Cryo-EM structure of the ATP–dTTP–GTP dimer</title><p>In order to probe the generality of the conformations observed in the ATP–CTP complex, we also solved the structure of PcNrdD in complex with ATP in the a-site, specificity effector dTTP in the s-site, and substrate GTP in the active site (c-site). Again, 2D classes show a predominantly dimeric form with no more than ~10% tetramers. From a set of 437,886 particles selected from 2D classes with the best apparent density for the ATP-cone region, we obtained a volume at 2.40 Å resolution for the dimer with C1 symmetry that was further improved using DeepEMhancer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>). dTTP is clearly visible in the s-site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2a</xref>) as is GTP in the active site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s3">Figure 8—figure supplement 3a</xref>). A Mg<sup>2+</sup> ion can be modelled in the s-site, coordinated by Glu290 and all three phosphate groups of dTTP. A β-hairpin loop between residues 185 and 192 that is disordered in the ATP–CTP structure in the absence of an s-site nucleotide is here ordered, due to an H-bond to the 2′-OH group of dTTP. Readout of the s-site nucleotide’s identity is achieved through an H-bond to Asn298 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2a</xref>).</p><p>Like the ATP–CTP complex, the ATP–dTTP–GTP complex can also be partitioned into an active and an inactive monomer. The ATP-cone region is very flexible, but the last helix of the ATP-cone in the active monomer can be traced back to residue 85 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8a, b</xref>). The helix is not kinked at residue 91 as in the ATP–CTP dimer but forms an uninterrupted helix between residues 85 and 104. The volume for the ATP-cone region lies entirely on one side of the PcNrdD dimer axis, as is also apparent in some of the 2D classes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s4">Figure 8—figure supplement 4</xref>). The ATP-cone cannot be modelled in detail, but if the volume is contoured at very low level, there is almost enough density for one ATP-cone. Taken together, this suggests that there is one partially disordered ATP-cone and one highly flexible in the ATP–dTTP–GTP complex. In the active monomer, the NxN flap and entire C-terminus are ordered while in the inactive monomer, the entire assembly of linker and NxN flap up to residue 120 and the entire GRD are so flexible that they cannot be seen in the cryo-EM volumes. We expect that the GRD behaves largely as a rigid body whose displacements relative to the core domain become larger in the dATP-bound form.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Structure of PcNrdD in complex with a-site effector ATP, s-site effector dTTP, and substrate GTP.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Volume for the PcNrdD dimer in complex with ATP, dTTP, and GTP.

In the active monomer, loop 2 is projected towards the aforementioned network of interactions between NxN flap, GRD, and substrate, packing against the flap, though no polar interactions are apparent. However, loop 2 also makes extensive interactions with its equivalent in the inactive monomer, which forces the latter into a conformation where it would sterically clash with an ordered NxN flap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8d</xref>). Furthermore, Phe412, which stacks on the substrate base in the active monomer, and Arg305, which is projected from the substrate-distal side of loop 2, sterically prevent the substrate binding in the inactive monomer. These may be important contributing factors to the disorder of the NxN flap and GRD.

No Mg<sup>2+</sup> ion is observed between the triphosphate tails, but this may be an artefact of the cryo-EM method, as the PaNrdA and LbNrdB crystal structures suggest that this ion is necessary for charge neutralisation. As in the ATP-bound form, further charge compensation is achieved by extensive coordination by, or proximity of, basic side chains, for example Lys7, Arg8, Arg87, and Arg91. As previously observed in PaNrdA and LbNrdB, the adenosine base of the ‘inner’ dATP (dATP1) fits into a pocket under the β-hairpin roof of the ATP-cone and the base of the ‘outer’ nucleotide (dATP2) is sandwiched between an aromatic residue (Tyr83) and the side of the first α-helix in the domain. No direct contacts are seen between the dATP molecules bound to the ATP-cone and residues in the core domain.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s3">Figure 9—figure supplement 3</xref> shows the differences in binding modes of dATP in the dATP-bound tetramer and ATP in the ATP–CTP dimer. The high mobility of the ATP-cone in the latter precludes a detailed analysis. However, it is clear that the triphosphate tails have very different orientations. In the ATP complex, the tail of ATP2 is oriented away from the C-terminal helix towards the base of ATP1, such that the β-phosphate moiety may even H-bond to the base of ATP1. The side chain of Arg87 fills the space vacated by the γ-phosphate of ATP2. Instead of H-bonding to the γ-phosphate of ATP2, Arg91 swings away and interacts with the equivalent moiety of ATP2 in the ATP-cone of the other chain. The structures suggest that the additional 2′-OH group in ATP may cause conformational changes in the ribose ring that propagate to the phosphate tail, but further analysis requires improved resolution.</p><p>As in PaNrdA and LbNrdB, the ATP-cones in the dATP-bound tetramer self-interact through a pair of α-helices at the C-terminal end of the ATP-cone. Remarkably, the pair of ATP-cones is highly asymmetrically positioned with respect to the twofold axis of its core dimer, being displaced as a rigid body towards the other dimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9b</xref>). Both pairs of ATP-cones are displaced in the same way, giving the complex overall C2 symmetry around an axis bisecting the pair of dimers. Consequently, the twofold axes of the ATP-cones and the core dimer are not aligned (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9b</xref>). The asymmetric arrangement is associated with two distinct conformations of the linker 93–103 between the fourth helix of the ATP-cone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s4">Figure 9—figure supplement 4</xref>) and the core domain. In chains A and C, a small kink leads from helix 4 into a short helical segment that packs antiparallel to helix 122–142 in the core domain. In contrast, in chains B and D, the short helix is parallel to helix 122–142 and is joined to helix 4 at a 45° angle. The rest of the polypeptide between residues 103 and 121, including the NxN flap, is disordered in both linkers.</p><p>Interestingly, all contacts between the two dimers of the tetramer are mediated by interactions between one of the ATP-cones in one dimer (B or D) and one of the core domains of the other dimer (C or A, respectively). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9d</xref> shows the interactions of the roof of the ATP-cone with two outer helices from the C-terminal half of the barrel domain (residues 458–485 and 550–569, preceding the sixth and seventh strands). The interactions are mostly hydrophobic but are reinforced by several H-bonds, for example between Gln3D–Gln458A, Ser53D–Gln458A, Arg11D–Asp468A, the main chain amide of Ile12D and Tyr557A. The amount of buried surface area is small: 717 Å<sup>2</sup>, or around 1% of the total surface area of each dimer. For comparison, the monomer–monomer interactions within each dimer bury 11.7% of the total area. The residues on the core domain of PcNrdD involved in interactions with the ATP-cone of the other dimer do not show high sequence conservation, even when the alignments are restricted to the most similar sequences.</p></sec><sec id="s2-11"><title>Cryo-EM structures of PcNrdD–dATP complexes produced in the presence of CTP</title><p>To investigate whether substrate had any allosteric effect on the conformations of the ATP-cone, flap, and GRD, we determined separate cryo-EM structures of tetrameric and dimeric PcNrdD, from the same grid, in the presence of 0.5 mM dATP and 0.5 mM CTP, achieving a resolution of 2.6 Å from 1,105,348 particles before post-processing for the tetramer and 2.6 Å from 1,132,695 particles for the dimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s5">Figure 9—figure supplement 5</xref>). Both forms were almost identical to those seen in the presence of dATP alone, and no CTP could be seen bound to the active site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>). This strongly suggests that substrate binding is dependent on ordering of the flap region by binding of ATP to the ATP-cone.</p></sec><sec id="s2-12"><title>Hydrogen–deuterium exchange mass spectrometry</title><p>To validate our structural and biochemical hypotheses, we further examined the degree of order of the different structural elements of PcNrdD in solution using hydrogen–deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS).

Three different samples were analysed: apo-PcNrdD and the complexes with dATP–CTP and ATP–CTP.</p><p>The apo form shows high deuterium uptake over the entire ATP-cone, linker, and NxN flap, from residues 1 to 117 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10a</xref>).

Peptides spanning residues 2–84 exhibit clear protection from HDX in both nucleotide-bound states. Furthermore, bimodal deuterium uptake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">James et al., 2022</xref>) was observed for N-terminal peptides spanning residues 2–23 and 83–99. For peptides very close to the N-terminus (2–23), the apo form only exhibits one high uptake (dynamic) conformational state while for the two ligand bound states there was a clear bimodal behaviour with one high uptake and one protected state of an approximately equal ratio (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig10sdata1">Figure 10—source data 1</xref>). In-depth analysis of the causes is difficult, but possible interpretations are that the bimodality is due to a mixture of occupied and empty ATP-cones, or more likely to the mixture of dimers and tetramers.</p><fig id="fig10" position="float"><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><title>Summary of the hydrogen–deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) experiments.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Heat map showing the deuterium uptake of the apo state for time points 30, 300, and 3000 s.

This suggests a mixture of conformational states with flexible and locked linkers, consistent with the highly dynamic nature of residues 85–100 observed in the cryo-EM structures, where in the dATP-bound tetramer, the linker is ordered to residue ~100, while in the dimer the ATP-cone and linker are highly dynamic and the first ordered structure is observed from residue 120.</p><p>The NxN flap at residues 101–117 has a high H/D exchange rate already at the shortest labelling time, with no change at longer times for any state.

This is consistent with the structures that show no ATP bound at the s-site but full occupancy of dATP. Peptides between 330 and 348, which are in contact with the β-hairpin, are also protected in the dATP complex. The regions 295–312, that is loop 2, are deprotected in the dATP form relative to ATP. This is also in agreement with the cryo-EM structures, in which loop 2 is partially disordered in the dATP complex but ordered in the ATP complex in the monomer with bound CTP.</p><p>The HDX-MS results show a high degree of deuterium uptake in the GRD in all forms, indicating a high degree of mobility. This is consistent with the cryo-EM structures, in which the GRD overall has <italic>B</italic>-factors higher than the core domain (though the glycyl-radical containing loop has similar <italic>B</italic>-factors to the core, being buried). From the HDX-MS data, it is clear that the GRD is highly dynamic, and while a trend of increased dynamics for some C-terminal peptides in the GRD can be seen for the dATP–CTP state, a detailed analysis is confounded by the limited time resolution and the complexity of the sample, which consists of a mixture of conformations.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>RNR is an essential enzyme for all free-living organisms. Its complex regulation at the levels of transcription, overall activity and substrate specificity makes it quite unique in Nature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mathews, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mathews, 2018</xref>). A fundamental understanding of this regulation could for example pave the way for better antibiotics. The ATP-cone is a small, genetically mobile domain frequently found at the N-terminus of RNR catalytic subunits of all major classes, as well as in the bacterial RNR-specific transcription factor NrdR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rozman Grinberg et al., 2022</xref>). Its role in allosteric regulation of class I aerobic RNRs has been extensively studied. In the presence of dATP, the ATP-cone mediates the formation of a surprising variety of different oligomeric complexes that nevertheless have in common that they block the formation of an (observed or inferred) active complex between the catalytic and radical generating subunits that permits proton-coupled electron transfer on each catalytic cycle (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Martínez-Carranza et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Despite their catalytic subunits being evolutionarily related to those of class I, anaerobic class III RNRs have a fundamentally different activation mechanism that is likely common to all GREs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Backman et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lundahl et al., 2022</xref>). Once generated on the catalytic subunit by encounter of the reductase with its radical-SAM family activase, the glycyl radical can catalyse hundreds of cycles of turnover before being exhausted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Torrents et al., 2001</xref>). Allosteric inhibition could thus in principle proceed by two mechanisms: by blocking the initial encounter of the reductase and activase, or by preventing subsequent transfer of the radical to the substrate. The first of these hypotheses is intuitively more similar to the steric blocking mechanisms encountered in class I RNRs; the latter is more challenging to understand, as the glycine and cysteine are buried in close proximity in the active site.</p><p>In this work, we present the first biochemical, biophysical, and structural characterisation of an anaerobic, class III RNR containing an ATP-cone, providing the first picture of the structural basis for allosteric activity regulation in this large family. We show that the ATP-cone can bind two molecules of ATP or dATP, but not both simultaneously. HDX-MS confirms that binding of either nucleotide reduces the exposure of the ATP-cone to deuterium exchange and supports the biophysical findings of dATP binding to the s-site. As expected, the presence of an ATP-cone confers inhibition of enzyme activity at high dATP concentrations. GEMMA experiments show that PcNrdD exists in a mixture of dimeric and tetrameric states under most experimental conditions studied, with the equilibrium shifted towards dimers in the presence of ATP. Addition of inhibiting concentrations of dATP shifts the equilibrium towards tetramers. The equilibria are not affected by substrate or specificity effector. EPR spectroscopy clearly shows that the glycyl radical is formed even in the presence of dATP. Together, these results show that dATP inhibition in class III RNRs does not occur by blocking the initial encounter of reductase and activase. Instead, our nucleotide-binding results and structures show that dATP inhibition prevents binding of substrates.</p><p>The seven cryo-EM structures of PcNrdD in a variety of nucleotide complexes presented here suggest a mechanism in which binding of ATP or dATP modulates activity by affecting the dynamics of a tightly knit network of structural elements including the critical GRD in the C-terminal region of the enzyme. A summary of the conformational states is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>. In the presence of ATP and substrate CTP, the GRD is fully ordered in one monomer and Gly711 is found at its expected position proximal to Cys416, to which it will deliver its radical to initiate each catalytic cycle and accept it back at the end of the cycle. The CTP substrate is bound in this monomer and a conserved but previously unobserved flap containing two Asn residues (NxN flap) forms over the top of the substrate, making H-bonding interactions with it. Loop 2, which mediates between the substrate specificity site and the active site, is fully ordered. In contrast, in the other monomer, no substrate is bound, loop 2 is disordered and the flap and C-terminus are more dynamic. At the same time, the ATP-cones themselves are relatively flexible. This is not unexpected for this type of ATP-cone, which binds two nucleotides and was first observed in the class I RNR PaNrdA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Johansson et al., 2016</xref>). SAXS studies showed that the ATP-cone in PaNrdA is flexible in the presence of ATP, while in its dATP-bound form it forms a symmetric interaction with an ATP-cone on another dimer, causing the enzyme to tetramerise. A similar behaviour was seen even when this type of ATP-cone was evolutionarily ‘transplanted’ to the N-terminus of the radical generating subunit, as seen in LbNrdB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rozman Grinberg et al., 2018a</xref>).</p><fig id="fig11" position="float"><label>Figure 11.</label><caption><title>Schematic showing the different structural states of PcNrdD described in this work.</title><p>The glycyl radical domain (GRD) is coloured orange where present. Inactive and active monomers are labelled I and A, respectively. The a-site in the ATP-cone is labelled with ‘a’ on a green background, the s-site at the dimer interface with ‘s’ on a red background and the active site with ‘c’ on an orange background. Labels are only present when a nucleotide is observed in the structure. The ligands bound are listed, coloured according to the sites they bind to. In the dATP/dATP–CTP tetramer, one of the inactive monomers and its s-site are hidden behind the dimer in the foreground.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-89292-fig11-v1.tif"/></fig><p>By careful isolation of a subset of particles, we were able to characterise an unusual dimer of ATP-cones in the ATP–CTP complex, where four ATP molecules bind with all their triphosphate tails pointing towards each other. Such an orientation is unprecedented for RNRs, but such tail-to-tail orientations, compensated by extensive positive charges, are found in for example adenylate kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Berry et al., 1994</xref>). The relevance of this arrangement remains to be elucidated. Interestingly, when dTTP was added to the s-site in the ATP–dTTP–CTP complex, the ATP-cones became even more dynamic and could only be observed in one monomer of the dimer as diffuse density. This behaviour was reproduced with dGTP in the s-site. Both complexes with s-site effector are functionally more relevant forms than the ATP–CTP complex, as in the cell, a form with empty s-site is unlikely to exist. The partitioning of monomers into active and inactive is amplified by the presence of s-site effector (dTTP or dGTP) in both complexes with ATP. Only one of the active sites is occupied by substrate, with ordered NxN flap and C-terminal GRD. This is correlated with two distinct conformations of loop 2 in the two monomers. In the inactive monomer, the NxN flap and GRD are disordered, as loop 2 blocks their active conformation and concomitantly substrate binding. These results point to only one of the PcNrdD monomers being active at a given time and also to a significant cross-talk between the a-site, s-site, and active site. This is corroborated by the finding that an s-site effector is necessary for retention of ATP by the ATP-cone when PcNrdD is first incubated with these nucleotides then purified without them.</p><p>In the presence of inhibitory concentrations of dATP we were able to isolate structures of both dimers and tetramers from the same cryo-EM sample, in agreement with the GEMMA results that show a shift towards the tetrameric form. In both forms, the C-terminal GRD is highly mobile in all monomers such that it cannot be seen in the cryo-EM reconstructions. An exposed glycyl radical is incompatible with its stability, so it is possible that the dynamics of the GRD are exaggerated somewhat by the vitrification process. Consistent with this, the HDX-MS results show a small but noticeable deprotection of peptides from the GRD in the presence of dATP–CTP compared to ATP–CTP.</p><p>In the tetramers, pairs of ATP-cones asymmetrically disposed relative to the twofold axes of their respective PcNrdD dimers associate through the ‘roof’ of the ‘inner’ dATP-binding site to the core domain of the other dimer. While this allowed us to build complete models for the ATP-cones and analyse dATP binding, the role of tetramerisation in the inhibition mechanism is unclear. The tetrameric structures appear to be facilitated by a dATP-induced ‘stiffening’ of the pair of ATP-cones, similar to what was seen in PaNrdA and LbNrdB, and their interaction with a second dimer of PcNrdD, but the interaction area is small (1% of the total surface area) and the residues involved are not highly conserved in NrdDs, even from the most similar sequences. Therefore, further studies of NrdDs containing ATP-cones are required in order to determine whether oligomerisation is a general phenomenon in the family. Furthermore, the GRD is mobile in all complexes with dATP in the a-site, whether dimeric or tetrameric. Since both the ATP-cone and the GRD are disordered in the dATP-bound dimers, the exact molecular mechanism by which dATP induces disorder of the GRD remains somewhat elusive.</p><p>Taken together, our results show a clear correlation between ATP or dATP binding to the ATP-cone and activity or inhibition, respectively. The dynamical transitions involve a previously uncharacterised but highly conserved structural element, the NxN flap, that folds over the substrate and furthermore acts as a structural bridge between the ATP-cone and the C-terminal GRD. An increase in dynamics of these elements prevents substrate binding and thus transfer of the radical from the GRD to the substrate. Interestingly, a similar flap is formed over the top of the active site in the <italic>E. coli</italic> active complex, but it is formed by part of the C-terminal region of the separate radical generating subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kang et al., 2020</xref>). Thus, a locking of the substrate in the active site appears to be a conserved feature of active class I and III RNRs. However, in class I RNR there is no tunnel allowing substrate access to the active site in the locked state. This is consistent with the fact that the class I subunits dissociate on each catalytic cycle, while in class III the glycyl radical can catalyse many substrate reductions before having to be regenerated. It remains enigmatic exactly how the tiny chemical difference between dATP and ATP (the 2′-OH group) results in such major conformational changes, as in the ATP–CTP complex, where the ATP-cones are visible, the a-site in the ATP-cone is separated from the NxN flap by at least 30 Å and in the most biologically relevant complexes with additional s-site effector, the ATP-cone is very disordered. Nevertheless, the present results give first insights into allosteric activity regulation in anaerobic RNRs and add yet another aspect to the surprisingly wide range of allosteric conformational changes that can be mediated by the binding of the two highly similar nucleotides ATP and dATP to a small, evolutionarily mobile protein domain.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cloning of <italic>nrdD</italic> and <italic>nrdG</italic> from <italic>P. copri</italic></title><p>The genes encoding the reductase (NrdD) and activase (NrdG) proteins from <italic>P. copri</italic> were synthesised by GenScript with codon optimisation for <italic>E. coli</italic> and subcloned into the pBG102 plasmid (pET27 derivative) (Center for Structural Biology, Vanderbilt University) between the BamHI and EcoRI restriction sites to produce His6–SUMO–NrdD and His6–SUMO–NrdG protein constructs.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Overexpression and purification of PcNrdD and PcNrdG</title><p>Plasmids containing the <italic>nrdD</italic> gene or the <italic>nrdG</italic> gene were transformed into <italic>E. coli</italic> BL21 (DE3) star and <italic>E. coli</italic> BL21 (DE3) competent cells, respectively.

acid (HEPES), pH 7.5, 100 mM KCl, 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, and 0.5 mM TCEP with a stirring speed of 1000 rpm. An initial injection volume was 0.6 µl over a duration of 1.2 s. ApoPcNrdD was prepared in the ITC buffer using SEC, followed by the addition of 1 mM dTTP and 1 mM GTP and incubation at room temperature for 5 min prior to loading to the cell. ATP and dATP ligands were directly diluted in the ITC buffer. Titration of ligand into buffer was also performed to control for heats of dilution and/or buffer mismatch. For dATP-binding analysis, the concentration of PcNrdD in the cell was 50–100 µM and dATP concentration in the syringe 0.6–1 mM. For ATP titration into PcNrdD, protein concentration in the cell was 200 µM and ATP concentration in the syringe was 0.6–1.5 mM. All subsequent injection volumes were 1.7–2.5 µl over 3.4–5 s with a spacing of 160 s between the injections. Data for the initial injection were not considered. The data were analysed using the one set of sites model of the MicroCal ITC-200 analysis software (Malvern Panalytical).

Binding of GTP and CTP was assayed in MST buffer containing 40 mM HEPES pH 7, 50 mM KCl, 50 and 100 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 5 mM DTT, 0.1% Tween-20, 1 mM dTTP (only for GTP binding), and either 5 mM ATP or 1 mM dATP. The 16 reaction tubes were prepared by the addition of 2 μl MST buffer (concentrated five times), 5 μl GTP or CTP of the desired concentration and 1 μl RED dye-labelled NrdD in a total volume of 10 μl. Final NrdD concentration in the binding reaction was 11 nM while the binding partner concentrations were between 70 mM and 2 μM for CTP and 50 mM and 1.5 μM for GTP.

A 4-point calibration (pH 2, 4, 7, 10) was made prior to all measurements. The HDX-MS analysis was made using automated sample preparation on a LEAP H/D-X PAL platform interfaced to an liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC–MS) system, comprising an Ultimate 3000 micro-LC coupled to an Orbitrap Q Exactive Plus MS.</p><p>HDX was performed on 2 mg/ml PcNrdD with and without ligands (5 mM ATP + 5 mM CTP or 1 mM dATP + 5 mM CTP) in 25 mM HEPES, 100 mM KCl, 20 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, and 0.5 mM TCEP, pH 7.5. The HDX-MS was performed in one continuous run, the apo state being run before both complexed states. For each labelling time point, 3 μl HDX samples were diluted with 27 μl labelling buffer (containing the ligands) of the same composition prepared in D<sub>2</sub>O, pH<sub>(read)</sub> 7.4. The HDX labelling was carried out at <italic>t</italic> = 0, 30, 300, and 3000 s at 20°C. Each time point was run in four to six replicates. The labelling reaction was quenched by dilution of 30 μl labelled sample with 30 μl of 1% trifluoroacetic acid, 0.4 M TCEP, 4 M urea, pH 2.5 at 1°C. 50 μl of the quenched sample was directly injected and subjected to online pepsin digestion at 4°C on an in-house immobilised pepsin column (2.1 × 30 mm). The online digestion and trapping were performed for 4 min using a flow of 50 µl/min 0.1% FA, pH 2.5. The peptides generated by pepsin digestion were subjected to online solid phase extraction (SPE) on a PepMap300 C18 trap column (1 × 15 mm) and washed with 0.1% FA for 60 s. Thereafter, the trap column was switched in-line with a reversed-phase analytical column (Hypersil GOLD, particle size 1.9 µm, 1 × 50 mm). The mobile phases were (A) 0.1% FA and 95% acetonitrile/0.1% FA (B) and separation was performed at 1°C using a gradient of 5–50% B over 8 min and then from 50 to 90% B for 5 min. Following the separation, the trap and column were equilibrated at 5% organic content until the next injection. The needle port and sample loop were cleaned three times after each injection with mobile phase 5% MeOH/0.1% FA, followed by 90% MeOH/0.1% FA and a final wash of 5% MeOH/0.1% FA. After each sample and blank injection, the pepsin column was washed by injecting 90 μl of pepsin wash solution 1% FA/4 M urea/5% MeOH. In order to minimise carry-over, a full blank was run between each sample injection. Separated peptides were analysed on a Q Exactive Plus MS, equipped with a HESI source operated at a capillary temperature of 250°C with sheath gas 12, Aux gas 2, and sweep gas 1 (au). For HDX analysis, MS full scan spectra were acquired at 70 K resolution, AGC 3e6, max IT 200 ms and scan range 300–2000.

The search was done on a FASTA file with only the NrdD sequence. The search criteria were a mass error tolerance of 15 ppm and a fragment mass error tolerance of 0.05 Da, allowing for fully unspecific cleavage by pepsin. Peptides identified by PEAKS with a peptide score value of log p &gt; 25 and no modifications were used to generate a peptide list containing peptide sequence, charge state, and retention time for the HDX analysis. HDX data analysis and visualisation were performed using HDExaminer, version 3.3 (Sierra Analytics Inc, Modesto, US). The analysis was made on the best charge state for each peptide, allowed only for EX2 (except for bimodal parts of the protein for which EX1 calculation of uptake was allowed) and the two first residues of a peptide were assumed unable to hold deuteration. Due to the comparative nature of the measurements, the deuterium incorporation levels for the peptic peptides were derived from the observed relative mass difference between the deuterated and non-deuterated peptides without back-exchange correction using a fully deuterated sample (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Engen and Wales, 2015</xref>). As a full deuteration experiment was not made, full deuteration was set to 75% of maximum theoretical uptake. The presented deuteration data are the average of all high and medium confidence results. The allowed retention time window was ±0.5 min. The spectra for all time points were manually inspected; low scoring peptides, obvious outliers, and any peptides where retention time correction could not be made consistent were removed. As bottom-up labelling HDX-MS is limited in structural resolution by the degree of overlap of the peptides generated by pepsin digestion, the peptide map overlap is shown for the respective state in

More specifically, the authors aimed to characterize the mechanism by how (d)ATP modulates nucleotide reduction in this anaerobic RNR, using a combination of enzyme kinetics, binding thermodynamics, and cryo-EM structural determination, complemented by hydrogen-deuterium exchange (HDX). One of the principal findings of this paper is the ordering of a NxN 'flap' in the presence of ATP that promotes RNR catalysis and the disordering (or increased protein dynamics) of both this flap and the glycyl radical domain (GRD) when the inhibitory effector, dATP, binds. The latter is correlated with a loss of substrate binding, which is the likely mechanism for dATP inhibition.

The cryo-EM structural characterization of the system is solid, but some open questions remain about the interpretation of activity/binding assays and the newly incorporated HDX-MS results. The work will be of interest to biochemists and structural biologists working on ribonucleotide reductases and other allosterically regulated enzymes.</p><p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>The goal of this study is to understand the allosteric mechanism of overall activity regulation in an anaerobic ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) that contains an ATP-cone domain. Through cryo-EM structural analysis of various nucleotide-bound states of the RNR, the mechanism of dATP inhibition is found to involve order-disorder transitions in the active site. These effects appear to prevent binding of substrate and a radical transfer needed to initiate the reaction.</p><p>Strengths of the manuscript include the comprehensive nature of the work - including both numerous structures of different forms of the RNR and detailed characterization of enzyme activity to establish the parameters of dATP inhibition. The manuscript has been improved in a revision by performing additional experiments to help corroborate certain aspects of the study. But these new experiments do not address all of the open questions about the structural basis for mechanism. Additionally, some questions about the strength of biochemical data and fit of binding or kinetic curves to data that were raised by other referees still remain. Some experimental observations are not consistent with the proposed model. For example, why does dATP enhance Gly radical formation when the proposed mechanism of dATP inhibition involves disorder in the Gly radical domain?</p><p>The work is impactful because it reports initial observations about a potentially new mode of allosteric inhibition in this enzyme class. It also sets the stage for future work to understand the molecular basis for this phenomenon in more detail.</p></disp-quote><p>We express our gratitude to the reviewer for dedicating time to review our work and for the overall favorable assessment. We agree that the question of exactly how much the glycyl radical domain becomes more mobile without losing the glycyl radical entirely is an unresolved one but we also think that our work sets a solid basis for future experiments by us and others.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>The manuscript by Bimai et al describes a structural and functional characterization of an anaerobic ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) enzyme from the human microbe, P. copri. More specifically, the authors aimed to characterize the mechanism by how (d)ATP modulates nucleotide reduction in this anaerobic RNR, using a combination of enzyme kinetics, binding thermodynamics, and cryo-EM structural determination, complemented by hydrogen-deuterium exchange (HDX). One of the principal findings of this paper is the ordering of a NxN 'flap' in the presence of ATP that promotes RNR catalysis and the disordering (or increased protein dynamics) of both this flap and the glycyl radical domain (GRD) when the inhibitory effector, dATP, binds. The latter is correlated with a loss of substrate binding, which is the likely mechanism for dATP inhibition. It is important to note that the GRD is remote (&gt;30 Ang) from the binding site of the dATP molecule, suggesting long-range communication of the structural (dis)ordering. The authors also present evidence for a shift in oligomerization in the presence of dATP. The work does provide evidence for new insights/views into the subtle differences of nucleotide modulation (allostery) of RNR, in a class III system, through long-range interactions.</p><p>The strengths of the work are the impressive, in-depth structural analysis of the various regulated forms of PcRNR by (d)ATP using cryo-EM.

The HDX analysis was of course undertaken with the intention of identifying differences in disorder of the NxN flap and GRD region. From an HDX perspective both regions were found to be highly susceptible to HDX regardless of state/ligand, due to surface accessibility and/or very fast dynamics. However, this does not mean that there is no difference in the degree of order of these regions upon ligand addition, simply that we with HDX-MS, in the limited time span of 30-3000 seconds, could not conclusively support an increased disorder. We have rephrased the discussion text to reflect this fact</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>On page 5 (and throughout the manuscript) there are some inconsistencies in how dissociation constants for effectors and inhibitors are described - for example, D in KD is sometimes subscripted and sometimes not.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for noticing these remaining errors. We hope that we have fixed all of them now.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>The authors addressed many of the initial concerns raised. The addition of the HDX-MS data in this revision is a welcomed contribution to the work and complements the cryo-EM data. In select cases, the data may be over-interpreted. This reviewer suggests that the authors revise the text in this section so that it is more consistent with the presented data.</p><p>Specific points:</p><p>(1) The bimodal mass spectral features in the N-terminal domain complicate the data interpretation. Specifically for peptides in 81-99 region, the fast exchanging feature shows protection in the presence of (d)ATP/CTP, but the opposite trend is observed for the slow exchanging species. It is therefore advisable to not make absolutes about the HDX results in this region, as the data are complicated.</p></disp-quote><p>As stated by the reviewer, it is not possible from the presented HDX data to deduce if this is a result of 50% loaded dimer or the oligomerization state of the protein. We have remedied this by removing mentions of a difference between the dATP and ATP in bimodality. Also, we have addressed this in the text by stating that the main reason is most likely the different oligomerization states present in solution. Nevertheless, it is clear from the HDX data that the N-terminal region and 81-99 are very interesting, and it was somewhat disappointing that due to the dynamics of the oligomerization it was not possible to SEC-purify pure dimer or tetramer samples for HDX-MS, in order to deconvolute the cause.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Related to #1, the authors assign the bimodal HDX behavior to EX1 mechanism, but this is not necessarily (and unlikely) true based on the limited time points. The authors also state that it originates from the heterogeneity of the sample: &quot;a mixture of states&quot; which could reflect the mixture of oligomerization states. The authors should be careful assigning EX1 mechanism unless there are compelling results to support it.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the unfortunate phrasing. It was not our intention to imply that the bimodality is due to true EX1 kinetics. See the above answer. The mention of EX1 has been removed from the discussion text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) The deuterium uptake for peptide 118-126 is very small (~1Da) compared to the length of the peptide. The change in deuterium uptake (&lt;0.25Da) from dATP is very small; the authors should proceed with caution when presenting interpretations of such small differences.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that extra caution should be taken when dealing with such a small difference. However, the 118-126 peptide has been significance tested in both HDExaminer and Deuteros 2.0, and we also observed this for more than one run. The difference in uptake is small but increases to significance at the longer labelling times. The proximity to the NxN flap makes it interesting in context of an allosteric conformational change. i.e the dynamics of the NxN might be too fast so we can only see some secondary effects. We would like to keep the data in Figure 10 for reasons of transparency. In essence this is similar to the observed bimodality mentioned above: we cannot fully explain the observation but present the data as it was observed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) On p. 22, the authors should consider revising the following statement: &quot;confirming dATP binding to the s-site.&quot; Even though the HDX data are most compelling for the protection of peptides 178-204 and 330-348 that are adjacent to the beta-hairpin at the s-site, these data cannot &quot;confirm&quot; a binding site for a small molecule, such as dATP.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate that the reviewer has pointed out that the statement can be misleading, and we agree that the binding site of small molecules can’t be confirmed based solely on HDX data. The sentence reformulated to clarify that the binding site was confirmed based on the combined evidence of HDX data and the previously presented biochemical and structural data on the s-site.</p></body></sub-article></article>
