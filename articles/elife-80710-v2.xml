exercise are well known. Even so, there is increasing evidence that the exercise regimes of elite athletes can evoke cardiac arrhythmias including ventricular fibrillation and even sudden cardiac death (SCD). The mechanism of exercise-induced arrhythmia and SCD is poorly understood. Here, we show that chronic training in a canine model (12 sedentary and 12 trained dogs) that mimics the regime of elite athletes induces electrophysiological remodeling (measured by ECG, patch-clamp, and immunocytochemical techniques) resulting in increases of both the trigger and the substrate for ventricular arrhythmias. Thus, 4 months sustained training lengthened ventricular repolarization (QTc: 237.1±3.4 ms vs. 213.6±2.8 ms, n=12; APD90: 472.8±29.6 ms vs. 370.1±32.7 ms, n=29 vs. 25), decreased transient outward potassium current (6.4±0.5 pA/pF vs. 8.8±0.9 pA/pF at 50 mV, n=54 vs. 42), and increased the short-term variability of repolarization (29.5±3.8 ms vs. 17.5±4.0 ms, n=27 vs. 18). Left ventricular fibrosis and HCN4 protein expression were also enhanced. These changes were associated with enhanced ectopic activity (number of escape beats from 0/hr to 29.7±20.3/hr) in vivo and arrhythmia susceptibility (elicited ventricular fibrillation: 3 of 10 sedentary dogs vs. 6 of 10 trained dogs). Our findings provide in vivo, cellular electrophysiological and molecular biological evidence for the enhanced susceptibility to ventricular arrhythmia in an experimental large animal model of endurance training.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>endurance training</kwd><kwd>dog</kwd><kwd>electrophysiology</kwd><kwd>arrhythmia</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group

(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lawler et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Quindry and Franklin, 2021</xref>). However, there is increasing evidence that chronic high-level exercise in elite athletes can evoke cardiac arrhythmias including atrial fibrillation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aschar-Sobbi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baldesberger et al., 2008</xref>) and even sudden cardiac death (SCD; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Maron and Pelliccia, 2006</xref>). For the better understanding of this complex issue, it may be helpful to be familiar with the U-shaped relationship between exercise intensity and the risk of adverse cardiovascular events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Merghani et al., 2016</xref>); although both moderate- and vigorous-intensity exercise improve health, exercise at a competitive level may be an additional potential risk factor for arrrhythmogenesis in certain individuals or in situations where repolarization reserve is impaired. It is usually due to frequently silent underlying conditions, such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, long QT syndrome, diabetes, electrolyte imbalances, doping, or otherwise harmless presumed medications.</p><p>Fortunately, sport-related SCD is rare, although its incidence may often be underestimated. Thus, SCD seems to be 2.8 times more frequent in elite athletes than in age-matched populations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Corrado et al., 2008</xref> who do not engage in sporting activity. It has to be mentioned that SCD incidence was found much higher than that in certain young athletes population such as male college basketball players (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Raukar et al., 2017</xref>). In addition, in only a few cases, the cause of death has been satisfactorily established by autopsy findings; part of the remaining cases of SCD has been attributed to ventricular fibrillation of ischemic origin. However, the latter explanation can be challenged because, very often, SCD in elite athletes does not occur during peak performance when oxygen demand is indeed very high in the myocardium. Instead, SCD occurs during warmup, after exercise, or even at home during rest. Therefore, the cause and mechanism of SCD due to heavy chronic exercise should be also sought elsewhere.</p><p>It was recently reported that high levels of exercise in rats or mice induce electrophysiological remodeling resulting in atrial fibrillation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aschar-Sobbi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Guasch et al., 2013</xref>), sinus bradycardia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">D’Souza et al., 2015</xref>) and atrioventricular (AV) node dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mesirca et al., 2021</xref>). Also, in a recent study in rats after high-intensity chronic exercise, it was found that exercise-trained rats developed eccentric cardiac hypertrophy, together with both left ventricular (decreased S-wave in pulmonary vein flow and increased left ventricular isovolumic relaxation time) and right ventricular (decreased E-wave velocity and prolonged E-wave deceleration time) diastolic dysfunction and with atrial enlargement. Also, collagen deposition in the right ventricle was significantly higher, which were associated with enhanced vulnerability to arrhythmia at the supraventricular level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Benito et al., 2011</xref>). The mechanism of SCD in human elite athletes is, for obvious reasons, very hard to study, while animal studies which were focused on AF after chronic endurance training were carried out in mice or in rats in which cardiac function, e.g., heart rate and repolarization properties, differs in important ways from human (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aschar-Sobbi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Benito et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">D’Souza et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Guasch et al., 2013</xref>). With the exception of one incomplete and preliminary study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Polyák et al., 2018</xref>) and a very recent report on AV dysfunction in race horses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mesirca et al., 2021</xref>), there have been no experimental studies of the subject in large animals which would have better translational value (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Varró et al., 2021</xref>). Accordingly, the aim of the present study was to determine the effect of 4 months of sustained exercise on cardiac remodeling and possible arrhythmia susceptibility in a canine model that better reflects human physiology and pathophysiology.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Sustained exercise-induced cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis</title><p>All echocardiographic parameters and autopsy outcomes are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>. The 16 weeks of endurance training led to increased left atrial volume (LAV) in the trained group, suggesting left atrial enlargement. Additionally, thickening of the interventricular septal (IVS) and left ventricular posterior walls (LVPW), greater end-diastolic diameter (LVEDD) in the left ventricle, and increased left ventricular mass and left ventricular mass index (LVM and LVMi), as signs of left ventricular hypertrophy, is also developed in trained animals. End-diastolic left ventricular volume (EDV) was also increased in the trained dogs compared to the sedentary controls. The differences between the groups persisted after normalization of the measured echocardiographic parameters to body weight (IVS/BW; LVPW/BW) or BSA (LAVi; left ventricular end-systolic diameter [LVESD]/BSA; LVEDD/BSA; EDV/BSA). End-systolic volume (ESV), its BSA adjusted value (ESV/BSA), and the ejection fraction (EF) did not differ between the examined groups.</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><label>Table

(2) Morphological adaptations characteristic of the athlete’s heart, such as left ventricular hypertrophy, increased atrial and ventricular volumes also developed. (3) Sustained training increased the expression of HCN4 channels in the ventricular myocardium, which, in parallel with increased levels of fibrosis, may contribute to the increased arrhythmia sensitivity observed in this model. (4) Following chronic endurance training, repolarization prolongation was a consistent observation, manifesting as moderate, but significant QTc prolongation in conscious dogs and APD prolongation accompanied with reduced I<sub>to</sub> current density in cellular measurements. These findings were associated with increased variability of cardiac repolarization. (5) Also, sustained exercise training appeared to increase the risk of fibrillation in ventricles subjected to electrical stimulation. Our results imply an increased sensitivity to arrhythmias in trained canine hearts. Considering also the limitations, our canine model with the applied exercise protocol may be a useful experimental model to further investigate cardiovascular effects of long-term endurance exercise.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Animal models of the human athlete’s heart</title><p>There is an increased incidence of unexpected death among elite athletes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Corrado et al., 2008</xref>), the exact cause of which is poorly defined and, as such, is an open issue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Raukar et al., 2017</xref>). Our working hypothesis proposed the question whether these tragic events are related to changes in ventricular repolarization and also to fibrosis that may develop following prolonged high-intensity exercise in competitive athletes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Domenech-Ximenos et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Małek and Bucciarelli-Ducci, 2020b</xref>). However, investigating the relevant mechanisms in humans is difficult for several reasons, and therefore, appropriate animal models with human relevance are needed. The majority of animal experiments in this field have so far been conducted in small animal models. In rodents, for example, electrophysiological remodeling, cardiac fibrosis, development of bradycardia, and increased risk of atrial fibrillation have been reported after exercise training (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aschar-Sobbi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Benito et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">D’Souza et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gazdag et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Guasch et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Oh et al., 2020</xref>). While it is undeniable that these experiments have revealed several important aspects about the athlete’s heart, these species differ from humans in important aspects of cardiac electrophysiology; for example, the expression pattern of ion channels differs greatly between species and tissue types which strongly limits or even eliminates their translational value to humans. While some chronic exercise models have been reported using rabbits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Polyák et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Yuan et al., 2018</xref>), no such studies have been performed in dogs or other large animals with high relevance to human cardiac electrophysiology. Available data in canine models indicate that both acute (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Babai et al., 2002</xref>) and adequate levels of chronic exercise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bonilla et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Holycross et al., 2007</xref>) are beneficial in preventing acute ischemia-induced ventricular fibrillation through delayed preconditioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Babai et al., 2002</xref>) or restoration of the distorted parasympathetic–sympathetic balance observed after myocardial infarction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Billman, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Holycross et al., 2007</xref>). Although these data confirm the effects of exercise on the cardiovascular and autonomic nervous systems, the responses to training at above-optimal levels by elite athletes are still unclear. Limited data are available on cardiac electrophysiological remodeling after sustained exercise in sled dogs, and these data are mostly derived from in vivo ECG recordings of long-term racing sled dogs and their controls. They revealed a widened QRS complex and a prolonged QT interval (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Constable et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Constable et al., 2000</xref>); however, no increased arrhythmogenesis or cellular electrophysiological alternations have been investigated in association with these changes.</p><p>To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to provide comprehensive experimental data on arrhythmic electrophysiological remodeling and the associated increased arrhythmic risk at the ventricular level in a canine model of sustained chronic endurance training. Based on our findings, we propose a novel hypothesis based on enhanced arrhythmia substrate and trigger on the mechanism of SCD associated with vigorous endurance exercise, according to which severe ventricular arrhythmias are associated with alterations in cardiac repolarization that may be observed after chronic high-intensity endurance exercise.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Cardiac morphological adaptation to long-term exercise</title><p>Since the frequency and the specific nature of each sporting activity have a fundamental influence on the exercise-induced physiological cardiac response and adaptation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Morganroth et al., 1975</xref>), it was essential to validate the cardiac morphological changes induced by the exercise modality applied. In this model, the structural changes were left ventricular chamber enlargement with increased wall thickness occurring in the trained group, as confirmed by both echocardiography and autopsy measurements. However, similar to human data, the EF remained unchanged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Pelliccia et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Tahir et al., 2019</xref>).

Although the limitation of the model is that it does not correlate perfectly with any human physical activity, the change in left ventricular architecture suggests that it is close to that of ‘isotonic exercise’ activities (e.g., long-distance running, cycling, and swimming), as both ventricular size and LVM increased, similar to chronic volume overload (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kim and Baggish, 2016</xref>).</p><p>Our findings of trained dogs correspond to highly trained athletes, who also develop moderately enlarged LAV and LAV index (LAVi), as a potential physiological adaptation to exercise conditioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">D’Andrea et al., 2010</xref>).

Although bradycardia is a general and well-established finding in elite athletes and in animal models of endurance exercise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Billman et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gourine and Ackland, 2019</xref>), its exact mechanism is still a matter of debate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Billman, 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Billman, 2017b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Boyett et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gourine and Ackland, 2019</xref>). The most common interpretation attributes bradycardia to increased vagal tone both in athletes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gourine and Ackland, 2019</xref>) and in animal exercise studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Billman et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Flannery et al., 2017</xref>) as well. However, this theory has generated some disagreement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Coote and White, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">D’Souza et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">D’Souza et al., 2015</xref>), and a more satisfactory approach remains to be explored. A very recent publication by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mesirca et al., 2021</xref> revealed that the slowing of AV conduction persisted after vegetative blockade in race horses and in mice after swimming-induced exercise. This study further argues for the electrical remodeling of the sinoatrial node (SAN), more specifically the reduction in hyperpolarization-activated ‘funny’ current (I<sub>f</sub>) density and the remodeling of the underlying HCN4 ionic channel, as previously published in SAN preparations of mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">D’Souza et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>The present data partially support the observations of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">D’Souza et al., 2014</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mesirca et al., 2021</xref>, as ionic mechanisms underlying SAN cell automaticity including the I<sub>f</sub> and the SAN hyperpolarization‐activated cyclic nucleotide-gated channel (HCN) isoforms have not been investigated in this work. Despite the limited data, however, our model seemed to support the findings of the previously mentioned works, as it revealed a significant degree of sinus bradycardia in isolated right atrial preparations from trained hearts after the termination of the autonomic system. On the other hand, the increased beat-to-beat variability of cycle length and first-degree AV block argue for an important contribution of enhanced vagal tone as well, as these values are considered parameters of parasympathetic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aubert et al., 2003</xref>) and are especially common among athletes with high aerobic resistance.</p><p>It should also be emphasized that the pacemaker function of the SAN is complex and cannot be satisfactorily explained by the I<sub>f</sub> current alone. Since activation of I<sub>f</sub> occurs largely at voltages more negative than the maximal diastolic potential of SAN cells, the special importance of I<sub>f</sub> as the main pacemaker current of the SAN has even been questioned (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Morad and Zhang, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Noma et al., 1983</xref>). In addition, other mechanisms based on calcium handling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Maltsev and Lakatta, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Verkerk et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Vinogradova et al., 2005</xref>) or on the contribution of other ion channels have been proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kohajda et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Ono et al., 2003</xref>) to explain the cardiac pacemaker effect of SAN. In summary, our present data suggest that both parasympathetic activity and intrinsic SAN changes are parallel responses to vigorous endurance exercise, irrespective of the still unexplored mechanisms.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Possible mechanisms of arrhythmias in the canine athlete’s heart model</title><p>Regardless of the nature of the bradycardia, a slower heart rate would itself result in a longer APD and enhanced dispersion of cardiac repolarization. This may be reflected as an increase in the arrhythmic substrate factor in the classical concept of the ‘arrhythmic triangle,’ which postulates that arrhythmia appears under a certain combination of substrates, arrhythmia triggers, and arrhythmia-promoting modulators. In addition, bradycardia resulting in longer diastolic intervals would increase the chance of spontaneous diastolic depolarization reaching the firing threshold, which may act as a potential arrhythmia trigger (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Varró and Baczkó, 2010</xref>).</p><p>It should also be emphasized that in the present experiment, significant bradycardia was associated with an increased number of escape beats.

Escape arrhythmia is considered to be a compensatory mechanism caused by increased vagal tone and/or disturbance in the SAN or other parts of the cardiac conduction system. It can also be interpreted as a form of ectopic pacemaker activity that is unveiled by lack of other pacemakers to stimulate the ventricles. In athletes, however, it is generally considered to be a benign ECG pattern that disappears during exercise as the vagal tone decreases. The morphology of the widened QRS complex associated with the P wave on the ECG also suggests an electrical conduction abnormality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Crescenzi et al., 2020</xref>). These findings again highlight the fact that vigorous exercise induces significant changes in the cardiac conduction system that are not yet completely understood.</p><p>Evidence now suggests that HCN channels are highly expressed in the left ventricle of hypertrophic heart and heart failure, contributing to increased arrhythmogenic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cerbai et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cerbai et al., 2001</xref>). Interestingly, in contrary to the bradycardia observed in vivo and in vitro, a concomitant increase in HCN4 protein expression was also observed in the left ventricular myocytes after chronic exercise in this model. This controversy might be explained by tissue-specific regulation of HCN4 channels in the heart. In parallel with the increased expression of HCN4 protein and other potential arrhythmia promoters discussed previously, the incidence of ventricular electrical stimulation-induced ventricular fibrillation also increased in trained animals.</p><p>Another consistent finding in this study was the significantly higher level of fibrosis in the left ventricular muscle of trained dogs. Our histopathological results share similarities with several previously reported human and animal studies after chronic endurance exercise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kui et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Małek and Bucciarelli-Ducci, 2020a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Topal et al., 2022</xref>). Since our working hypothesis focused on possible repolarization abnormalities, the molecular mechanisms of enhanced fibrosis were not investigated. However, earlier works have explored this issue in some depth in mice and rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aschar-Sobbi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Benito et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Oh et al., 2020</xref>). Despite the fact that this type of structural abnormality is usually silent by different non-invasive methods, e.g., electrocardiography and echocardiography, it may greatly impact the onset and the modulation of re-entry ventricular arrhythmias, as a potentially dangerous myocardial arrhythmia substrate.</p><p>Although the exercise-induced compensatory adaptive mechanisms of the athlete’s heart have been considered as a phenomenon completely distinct from pathological conditions, the electrical remodeling observed in our model indicates that such intense exercise may not always be beneficial to cardiovascular system and that increased arrhythmia susceptibility may also develop after vigorous exercise.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Ventricular repolarization in the canine athlete’s heart model</title><p>The prolongation of cardiac repolarization was a consistent observation in our experiments and manifested as a prolonged QTc interval in conscious dogs in vivo and also a prolonged APD at the cellular level in isolated left ventricular myocytes in the trained group. This finding was associated with increased short-term variability – STV of QT interval on the ECG and also STV of APD in cellular measurements – suggesting increased spatial and temporal dispersion of repolarization. It is notable that variability changes were detected in both in vivo and in vitro, suggesting that this variability parameter may be a valuable and easily measurable biomarker even for further human studies, as a sign of repolarization abnormalities on the electrocardiogram (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lengyel et al., 2011</xref>), which is potentially present at the cellular level. Although prolongation of the QTc interval, bradycardia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bjørnstad et al., 1991</xref>), and increased spatial and temporal dispersion of repolarization have been reported in athletes, reflected in the prolongation of the Tpeak-Tend interval on ECG and STV-QT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lengyel et al., 2011</xref>), their putative association with increased incidence of mortality is unclear. Notably, similar repolarization changes have been reported in the failing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kääb et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kääb et al., 1996</xref>) or in the hypertrophied heart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Coppini et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>The possible underlying cellular mechanism of repolarization prolongation in the chronically trained dogs in our model was a reduction in the magnitude of I<sub>to</sub> current in the midmyocardial myocytes. Its important role in phase 1 repolarization of the action potential in the left ventricular midmyocardial myocytes is well established. A previous study by our research group also found that inhibition of I<sub>to</sub> current in the canine subepicardial muscle significantly prolonged the APD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Virág et al., 2011</xref>). Similar results, i.e., APD prolongation with reduced I<sub>to</sub> current, were the most consistent findings published in failing canine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kääb et al., 1996</xref>) or human (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kääb et al., 1998</xref>) hearts. In agreement with the transmembrane current data, significant APD lengthening was observed only in myocytes harvested from the left ventricular midmyocardial region, where strong I<sub>to</sub> is expected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Antzelevitch, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Zicha et al., 2003</xref>) but not in subendocardial left ventricular papillary muscle preparations, where a relatively weak magnitude of I<sub>to</sub> current was reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Zicha et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Zicha et al., 2004</xref>). Interestingly, under the currently used experimental patch-clamp measuring conditions, the magnitudes of different transmembrane ionic currents, which have a key role in the onset and maintenance of repolarization and the plateau phase of action potential (I<sub>Kr</sub>, I<sub>Ks</sub>, I<sub>K1</sub>, I<sub>CaL</sub>, I<sub>NaL</sub>, and I<sub>NCX</sub>), in native canine left ventricular myocytes showed no significant differences between the examined groups. However, it cannot be excluded that - under different conditions - possible intracellular signaling pathways may influence their function.</p><p>The repolarization changes, in combination with the mild fibrosis in the left ventricle, would result in enhanced arrhythmia substrate, providing slightly wider vulnerable window for extrasystoles to provoke severe ventricular arrhythmias.</p><p>In the present study, the lower I<sub>to</sub> current density in trained dogs did not seem to be the result of reduced expression of Kv4.3 alpha or KChIP2 beta accessory channel proteins, as neither western blotting nor immunohistochemistry revealed any difference in protein expression between sedentary and trained heart. Similar results, i.e., a decrease in I<sub>to</sub> current density without changes in the expression of Kv4.2 and KChIP2 proteins, have been reported earlier in chronically exercised rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Stones et al., 2009</xref>). Although Kv4.3 and KChIP2 are considered to be the most important proteins determining I<sub>to</sub> in the canine heart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akar et al., 2005</xref>), it should be emphasized that the expression of other I<sub>to</sub> accessory proteins not investigated in the present study, such as Kvbeta1, Kvbeta2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Patel and Campbell, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Pérez-García et al., 1999</xref>), I<sub>Na</sub> beta1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Deschênes and Tomaselli, 2002</xref>), DPP6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Nadal et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Radicke et al., 2005</xref>), and DPP10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Jerng et al., 2004</xref>), may also influence the function of the I<sub>to</sub> channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Patel and Campbell, 2005</xref>). In addition, I<sub>to</sub> may be modulated by the activation of protein kinase A (PKA), protein kinase C (PKC), or both (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Fedida et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Parker and Fedida, 2001</xref>) and may also change after exercise. Since we have not investigated this issue in the present study, some effect of PKA and PKC modulation also cannot be ruled out.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>Limitations</title><p>Arrhythmias associated with the athlete’s heart, including ventricular fibrillation, have a very low incidence, and the underlying cardiac electrophysiological alterations are relatively modest. In addition, due to the limited capacity of our research laboratory, in this study, we had to focus on the main transmembrane ionic currents, whereas other cellular mechanisms like intracellular calcium handling or calcium-dependent chloride, potassium, and I<sub>f</sub>-pacemaker currents were not investigated. The same was true for the molecular biological mechanism of enhanced myocardial fibrosis. Also, in order to mimic these changes in experimental animal models, chronic experiments over several months with a relatively large number of animals were required. This is not particularly difficult with small animals like mice or rats, but it is more complicated with large animals like the dog. Such canine experiments are not only costly but, more importantly, require substantial facilities and trained personnel. Although the translational value of canine experiments is high (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Nánási et al., 2021</xref>) and better than that of mice or rat, important electrophysiological differences regarding the repolarization reserve between the canine and human heart are still known (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Jost et al., 2013b</xref>). Taking into consideration that the maximum number of animals used in each training session is usually less than in rodent studies, the advantage of the canine experiments itself is also their limitation. Another possible limitation is that elite athletes train for several years to reach peak performance, but in this study, we only used 4 months of intense training, and translating the exercise duration between species is also difficult. Also, athlete’s cardiac arrhythmias and SCD cannot be attributed only to compensated cardiac hypertrophy, but rather to a combination of several co-existing factors such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, different kinds of drugs, doping agents, and hypokalemia, which have not been investigated in the present study. As further limitations we think at the time of our study, no dedicated software was available at the Department of Pathology for the fully quantitative measurement of the fibrotic area per total area on digitized slides; therefore, a widely accepted semi-quantitative method for the evaluation of fibrosis was used by a pathologist blinded to the treatment of the animals. Also, the complexity of the present study and the capacity of our laboratory precluded the assessment of right ventricular myocardium and the experimental setup and sequence of in vivo and in vitro experiments led us to use open chest procedures and epicardial stimulation for the induction of ventricular arrhythmias instead of using a transvenous catheter approach to reduce the time passed until the isolation of cardiac tissue and cells for in vitro experiments.</p></sec><sec id="s3-7"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The present study suggests that vigorous endurance training by chronic treadmill exercise results in prolongation of cardiac repolarization and increased repolarization instability associated with mild ventricular fibrosis in the canine model of the human athlete’s heart. This does not necessarily indicate that at a competitive level, endurance exercise is harmful since the evidences regarding the beneficial effect of exercise are overwhelming. However, in certain individuals or in situations where the repolarization reserve is impaired due to hidden diseases, such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, long QT-syndromes, diabetes or electrolyte imbalances, doping substances, or drugs, the observed changes in repolarization and mild fibrosis induced by endurance training in our study may present additional potential risk factors to be considered in the prevention of possible adverse events in competitive sport.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>General methods</title><p>Animal maintenance and research were conducted in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.

Before starting the experiments, the dogs were conditioned to the training protocol, where they were familiarized with the research personnel and were given a few minutes of continuous walk on the treadmill to minimize the distress during training. Those animals (two dogs), which did not voluntarily adhere to the exercise protocol, were excluded from further experiments. After the 3-week conditioning period, beagle dogs of either sex, weighing 9–15 kg, were randomized into sedentary (SED, n=12) or trained (TRN, n=12) groups. The TRN animals underwent a 16-week-long training period, while the SED group did not receive any training. Running sessions were performed on a special canine treadmill system (Dogrunner K9 Racer Treadmill, Dendermonde, Belgium) with controllable gradient and speed intensity. During the a 16-week-long training period, TRN animals were trained for 5 days a week for 2×90 min per day at speeds of 12–18 km/hr (gradually increasing protocol) and with 2×50 min interval running per day at fixed speeds of 4 and 22 km/hr. Regular resting periods were applied to maintain proper hydration; however, the total daily training interruption did not exceed 1.5 hr. The training intensity was maintained with the use of 5–14% inclination. The training protocol was tested in preliminary experiments and set at a maximum level that could be performed without distress.

Your article has been reviewed by 4 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Balram Bhargava as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Varun Malik (Reviewer #2); Devendra K Agrawal (Reviewer #3); Wei-Hsin Chung (Reviewer #4).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>– I am concerned about the message that elite exercise is associated with ventricular arrhythmogenesis and enhanced risk for fibrillation.</p><p>– Elite athletes often train for years to reach peak performance. I am wondering what the translational value of 4 months of training in dogs is relative to elite human athletes.</p><p>– The enhanced expression of HCN4 in light of reduced heart rate in trained animals is counterintuitive. How do the authors explain this?</p><p>– Did the authors collect serum or plasma samples to examine neurohormonal markers? This would aid the autonomic hypothesis postulated in the study which are currently unsupported.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Thank you for the opportunity to review this manuscript. In general, I feel that this original contribution is one that makes a great start, and the authors are to be congratulated for the study. Much of the recommendations could be revised and further details are as below. There are some methodological issues detailed – I think these should be listed in the limitations. Given that there is very limited data here- I do not feel that these limitations should preclude publication.</p><p>I do feel that the scientific data comprising the evidence for ventricular arrhythmogenesis in exercise training would benefit a review -and it may be worthwhile (once revisions have taken place to a satisfactory level) to consider an editorial commentary (which I would be happy to assist with).</p><p>1. I would suggest paying attention to the abstract and its format -I cannot see any information to guide authors on the <italic>eLife</italic> submission guide; but typically, it would be best formatted into a clear background, methods, results, and conclusion section.</p><p>2. I agree that smaller animal models less helpful – than in canines, however, given this study also has limitations in extrapolation to humans- I would suggest the removal of the statement: Page 2 lines 39-41 (abstract). The limitation of using animal models has been well-discussed in a very good limitations section.</p><p>3. Present the values in the abstract in order of mention (lengthened depol = higher value then lower) etc throughout.</p><p>4. I feel that the whole manuscript requires careful editing to ensure that each section is explained clearly, and in order, to avoid any confusing sections. Another reader who is less familiar with the experiments would greatly help. I do not believe that this is a major issue- the paper is generally written reasonably, and the subheadings work well.</p><p>a. For instance- methods. The section on animals being euthanised can appear last after the in-vivo methods described first. The morphology should be second-last.</p><p>b. The discussion also needs careful revision to avoid repetition and to make sure that the discussion appropriately places the work in the current scientific context.</p><p>c. The conclusion also requires shortening to contain a crux summary statement (or two).</p><p>d. The limitations section is well written.</p><p>e. The conclusion needs to be shorter – much of this should be in the discussion. I do like the authors statement on the clearly beneficial effects of exercise -and these apply only to a subset. This should, however, be in the discussion. The conclusion should really be 2 sentences at most.</p><p>f. The discussion should ideally begin with a summary of the principal findings and then move to the discussion points.</p><p>5. Introduction: the evidence behind AF and VA is well-understood. It may be better to introduce the &quot;U-shaped&quot; curve of the benefits of exercise with lower levels clearly bad and higher levels -associated with AF.</p><p>a. Then as you have done, proceed with the population and mechanism data linking exercise training with VA/SCD.</p><p>6. Introduction line 82- please summarise the cardiac dysfunction associated with high intensity exercise</p><p>7. Is there a consensus as to the definition of high-intensity exercise?</p><p>8. What was the conditioning protocol? This should be detailed in the methods.</p><p>9. Why were echo parameters such as EF, atrial and ventricular volumes not assessed? Both left and right ventricular volumes would be helpful.</p><p>10. Why was fibrosis not quantitatively measured?</p><p>a. This is a methodological limitation.</p><p>11. Open chest procedures- the protocol needs to be detailed further.</p><p>a. How was access specifically obtained?</p><p>b. What was used to produce burst pacing and where in the ventricle was the catheter? Or electrode placed? Was pacing performed at a single site or two sites on the ventricle? Why was the timing 1-3 to 6-9 seconds? Were there between animal differences? Did this produce differences between the groups in terms of pacing protocol?</p><p>i. A transvenous catheter would have been better for VF induction.</p><p>ii. A more refined protocol for VT stimulation with different sites, burst and programmed extrastimuli ((PES) for set durations, at varying CL) and PES at varying coupling intervals down to VERP would have been much better.</p><p>12. Statistical analysis – was the data checked for normal distribution? Normality of the data should be assessed, and the appropriate comparison chosen for statistical analysis. Please clarify.</p><p>13. Discussion line 560- I am finding it extremely difficult to draw corollaries between the work of Volders (assessing hypertrophy and fibrosis) in atrioventricular block vs exercise-related fibrosis. This animal model is a model of Tdp (acquired) but I do not feel that this work is an extension of, or related to the work by Volders et al. The discussion will require some revision.</p><p>14. What are the possible remodelling mechanisms for the electrophysiologic changes and VA vulnerability – simply fibrosis? Or related to bradycardia (whatever the mechanism)? Or is there any other possible mechanism?</p><p>a. Autonomic remodelling and other potentials should be discussed.</p><p>15. Given the risk of right ventricular dilatation and dysfunction in athletes (a genotype elusive variant of &quot;ARVC&quot; has been seen in athletes)- RV volume, function and mass would be useful.</p><p>a. Do animals with VF susceptibility/PVC have RV features? See work by Heidbuchel, La gerche etc.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Well done job! No comments</p><p><italic>Reviewer #4 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. Did the dog undergo a gradually increased training load or constant strength of training? Since there are several kinds of athletes with different training strengths. The author should be specified what kind of athlete should be the subject of this animal model.</p><p>2. The ECG presented in this manuscript is referred to VENTRICULAR EXTRASYSTOLE beats, but it should be considered as escape beat after the pause period. It would be problematic if the calculation is based on the escape beats rather than the so-called premature ventricular complex. Is there any references supporting this ventricular beat to be called as extrasystole beats? How does the escape beats increase ventricular arrhythmia inducibility? It is also unclear for the reviewer to understand whether the escape beat is measure at week 12 or 16?</p><p>3. The ECG was measure after 10 mins after recording. What are the dogs doing at that time. Since the activity will influence the HR activity and ECG.</p><p>4. Are these all dogs having the same ventricular extrasystole burden? It would be possible to show the readers the difference between dogs with VF induction and dogs without VF induction.</p><p>5. Since the baseline heart rate is different, is it fair to use the pacing rate to compare the VF inducibility? Or should consider use different pacing rate base on the baseline heart rate? please comment.</p><p>6. It is unclear for the reviewer to understand how dose HCN4 over expression and decreased Ito impact the VF inducibility, PR,PQ and QT in the Discussion section, please clarify. And it is also unclear whether these change of PR, PQ, QG prolongation found in human athlete.</p><p>7. In table one only the ECG pattern shows &quot;*&quot; indicating significant difference. But in the manuscript the author mentioned about the difference in echocardiography findings and autopsy. But there is no &quot;*&quot;. Please clarify.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.80710.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>– I am concerned about the message that elite exercise is associated with ventricular arrhythmogenesis and enhanced risk for fibrillation.</p></disp-quote><p>As clearly stated and discussed in the manuscript on several occasions, regular physical activity has a definite beneficial effect on cardiovascular health, including lower risks of heart disease, diabetes, and stroke. In canine models, for example, both acute and chronic exercise prevented acute-ischemia-induced ventricular fibrillation (Bonilla et al., 2012; Holycross et al., 2007) (Babai L et al., 2022). However, considering the U-shaped relationship between exercise intensity and the risk of adverse cardiovascular events (Merghani et al., 2016), an increasing body of evidence demonstrates that beyond an optimal level of exercise, athletes are more prone to develop ventricular arrhythmias than their age-matched control population. This aspect was added into the revised manuscript.</p><p>Although in many cases the difference in the incidence of the arrhythmias is relatively modest and statistically hard to reveal or even undetectable, the overall data still consistently suggest a higher incidence of ventricular arrhythmias in elite athletes. For example, Palatini <italic>et al.</italic> observed that the prevalence of ventricular ectopic activity was higher among runners and cyclists than in the control population, even though the difference was not significant (Palatini et al., 1985). Their results were in agreement with those of Talan <italic>et al.,</italic> who also found ventricular ectopic beats in 70 % of the long-distance runners they studied (Talan et al., 1982).</p><p>In the 2000s, studies in Italian sports cardiology showed that frequent and complex ventricular ectopic activity documented by 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring (Holter) is not uncommon among elite athletes. Later, Biffi <italic>et al.</italic> examined the relationship between training-induced left ventricular hypertrophy and risk for ventricular tachyarrhythmias among a large population of young elite athletes without any cardiovascular abnormalities (Biffi et al., 2002). They demonstrated that the prevalence of ventricular ectopic beats and tachyarrhythmias were increased in elite athletes. They suspected it was caused by the intense training-induced shift in the autonomic nervous system.</p><p>Additionally, there is an increasing body of evidence that athletes develop non-ischemic left ventricular scars. This myocardial lesion has been recently recognized as an arrhythmic substrate in athletes (Biffi et al., 2008).</p><p>These earlier outcomes and our findings may provide evidence that the mild repolarization remodeling and the mild non-ischemic left ventricular scar can be associated with an increase in the number of ventricular arrhythmias, which may contribute to the very low incidence of life-threatening arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death events. We are suggesting that exercise at a competitive level may be an additional potential risk factor that should be taken into account to prevent possible complications, where for example, the repolarization reserve is impaired. These may be otherwise harmless underlying conditions, such as anti-inflammatory drugs or electrolyte imbalance due to excessive sweating.</p><p>References:</p><p>Babai L, Szigeti Z, Parratt JR, and Végh A.

I am wondering what the translational value of 4 months of training in dogs is relative to elite human athletes.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is right that elite athletes train longer than 4 months, even years, and this is a limitation of our study. Nevertheless, almost all published data in this field report regular, daily training for 6–12 weeks (Benito et al., 2011). Dog-to-human comparisons are difficult to make accurately, both in terms of exercise tolerance, age, growth, and development, and this is a potential limitation of the model. Yet, the literature suggests that dogs have a similar but accelerated developmental trajectory than humans, including infancy, puberty, adulthood, and ageing, but all of this is only about 20 % of the human lifespan (Wang et al., 2020). This suggests that a training protocol of a few months duration in this dog model would be equivalent to a longer form of training in human studies.</p><p>Furthermore, one year of prolonged and intensive endurance training leads to cardiac morphological adaptations in previously sedentary young individuals, similar to those observed in elite endurance athletes (Arbab-Zadeh et al., 2014). Several other studies suggest that even a few months of exercise can have significant cardiovascular effects (Geenen et al., 1982; Schmidt et al., 2014).</p><p>In our present study, we used a 16-week high-intensity training protocol that resulted in remarkable cardiac hypertrophy and electrophysiological remodeling. Therefore, it may be assumed that the length of the training protocol applied could provide relevant data on the alteration of the athlete's heart. And, in addition to the undoubted advantages of a more extended dog training protocol, there are also several disadvantages, financial and technical barriers. Following your concern, however, a comment has been included that refers to the potential limitation of our study: “An additional possible limitation is that elite athletes train for several years to reach peak performance, however, in this study only 4 months of intense training could be applied, the exact interspecies translational value of which is difficult to estimate.”</p><p>References:</p><p>Arbab-Zadeh, A., Perhonen, M., Howden, E., Peshock, R.

How do the authors explain this?</p></disp-quote><p>The pivotal role of the HCN4 protein in the development of the funny current (I<sub>f</sub>) in the sino-atrial node is well established (D'Souza et al., 2021; Verkerk and Wilders, 2014). However, recent studies have shown that the HCN4 protein, and thus I<sub>f</sub>, is also present in the working myocardium (Lin et al., 2009). Although the role of this transmembrane ionic current in the left ventricle is still controversial, it may contribute to the maintenance of the resting membrane potential of left ventricular myocytes (Stieber et al., 2003). Interestingly, in certain conditions, such as heart failure or hypertrophic cardiac myopathy, a potentially adverse overexpression of HCN4 protein may contribute to the increased arrhythmogenicity observed in these hearts (Cerbai et al., 1997; Cerbai et al., 2001).</p><p>In elite athletes, similarly to our observations in this model, left ventricular hypertrophy develops as part of the adaptation to the increased physical demands (Prior and La Gerche, 2012). Even though this type of adaptation is considered physiological, it may share similar features with the hypertrophied heart mentioned above with regard to increased expression of HCN4 protein (Lin et al., 2009).</p><p>Based on our immunocytochemical measurements, long-term vigorous endurance training resulted in a significant increase in left ventricular HCN4 protein density in trained animals compared to sedentary subjects. This may have a role in the development of ventricular arrhythmias in the athlete’s heart.</p><p>Furthermore, the trained animals exhibited significant resting bradycardia compared to the sedentary dogs. Although it has not been directly investigated, we do not exclude that sino-atrial remodeling following long-term endurance exercise may also play a role in the development of exercise-induced bradycardia. The potentially opposing changes in HCN4 protein expression levels in the pacemaking region and the left ventricle may represent tissue-specific differences in remodeling, however, this requires further investigation.</p><p>References:</p><p>D'Souza, A., Wang, Y., Anderson, C., Bucchi, A., Baruscotti, M., Olieslagers, S., Mesirca, P., Johnsen, A.

Is there a consensus as to the definition of high-intensity exercise?</p></disp-quote><p>Exercise intensity is the amount of energy used during exercise. Most physical activities can be performed at varying intensities, from light to heavy. Training experts assess energy cost in metabolic equivalents, or METs, where MET indicates energy expenditure expressed as a multiple of resting metabolic rate and is explained by functional capacity.</p><p>McArdle <italic>et al.</italic> presented a classification system for rating the difficulty of sustained physical activity according to intensity: Light work is considered as that eliciting an energy expenditure of 4 METs or less, when the activity results in only minimal perspiration and only a slight increase in breathing. Activities in the range of 5–8 METs are considered moderate intensity when the activity results in definite perspiration and above normal breathing. Heavy work is defined as that requiring 6–8 METS. Excessively heavy work is defined as any effort requiring an increase in metabolism greater than tenfold above resting value (i.e., 10 METS). Based on the literature, the approximate metabolic costs of running at 15 km/h represented as 14.6 METs. For example, this is a running speed that we have often used in our training protocol. (Jette et al., 1990)</p><p>As work intensity is the most important factor in the establishment of a conditioning training program, preliminary research was carried out to adapt the level of training to the conditioning level of the animal during the training period. Although MET is a non-invasive and tool-free method for determining exercise intensity in humans, it is difficult to apply to dogs. Observations of heart rate, ECG parameters, and signs and symptoms of fatigue showed that our training protocol was in the &quot;heavy&quot; range, as our dogs were exhausted and their breathing were above normal. Since there is no literature data available in this field, we could only use our estimations, and this is a potential limitation of this work. Unfortunately, we were not able to take ECG or heart rate measurements during the running sessions, however, the changes observed suggest an effective training level for the model.</p><p>Reference:</p><p>Jette, M., Sidney, K., and Blumchen, G.

During the arrhythmia provocation, we used 4 different durations of pacing with consecutively increasing durations at 800/min frequency. The stimuli of different durations were necessary because the shorter the duration of the stimulation, the more sensitive and arrhythmogenic the myocardium is, because the longer the vulnerable period, the more likely it is that even a short stimulus falls into the vulnerable period and provokes an arrhythmia. The two groups can thus also be compared from the point of view of how long the stimulus caused arrhythmias. The durations were determined so that even the shortest duration covered at least 1 RR interval.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>i.

Even so, in agreement with the Reviewer, the normality of our data were assessed using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and in case of data sets that do not follow normal distribution, Mann-Whitney U Test was applied instead of Student's t-test.

What are the possible remodelling mechanisms for the electrophysiologic changes and VA vulnerability – simply fibrosis? Or related to bradycardia (whatever the mechanism)? Or is there any other possible mechanism?</p><p>a. Autonomic remodelling and other potentials should be discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank you for the reviewer’s suggestion, since this is an important issue on this topic, we have added it to the discussion. The following subtitle and content are added to the discussion: “Possible mechanisms of arrhythmias in the canine athlete’s heart model“.</p><p>In brief, we are suggesting that several mechanisms may be responsible for VA vulnerability, which may be harmful from both the trigger and the substrate sides of arrhythmogenesis. (1) A slower heart rate would in itself result in a longer APD and enhanced dispersion of cardiac repolarization. (2) Furthermore, bradycardia resulting in longer diastolic intervals would increase the chance of spontaneous diastolic depolarization reaching the firing threshold. (3) Data suggest that vigorous exercise induces significant changes in the cardiac conduction system that may support arrhythmogenesis, however, the underlying mechanisms are not yet completely understood. (4) Increase in HCN4 protein expression – which is considered as a potential arrhythmia promoter in the left ventricle – was observed in the left ventricular myocytes, similar to changes observed in the hypertrophic heart and heart failure. The higher incidence of VF in trained hearts also promotes this hypothesis. (5) Increased dispersion of repolarization, resulting in prolonged QTc interval and increased QT interval variability on ECG and prolonged APD duration in vitro<italic>,</italic> which may be partly or entirely attributable to downregulation of the Ito current found in trained canine hearts, may contribute to increased arrhythmia vulnerability. (6) A significantly higher level of fibrosis in the left ventricular muscle of trained dogs is an important, but not the only factor that may increase susceptibility to arrhythmias.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>15.

It is also unclear for the reviewer to understand whether the escape beat is measure at week 12 or 16?</p></disp-quote><p>For clarification regarding arrhythmias, a significantly high incidence of ventricular beats was observed in the trained animals, the majority of which were ventricular escape beats. Ventricular premature beats were less frequent in both experimental groups, however, but were still more common in the trained animals.</p><p>Well-trained athletes often have a slow heart rates, with occasional sinus pauses and, frequently multiple escape beats. Escape arrhythmia is considered to be a compensatory mechanism caused by increased vagal tone and/or disturbance in the SAN or other parts of the cardiac conduction system. It can also be interpreted as a form of ectopic pacemaker activity that is unveiled by lack of other pacemakers to stimulate the ventricles. In athletes, however, it is generally considered to be a benign ECG pattern that disappears during exercise as the vagal tone decreases.</p><p>Thank you for the reviewer’s precious comment.

Or should consider use different pacing rate base on the baseline heart rate? please comment.</p></disp-quote><p>During the experiments, we did not modify the basic heart rate by using pacemakers, although it is a fact that the heart rate affects the inducibility of arrhythmias (e.g., bradycardia dependent tachyarrhythmias). However, resting bradycardia is part of cardiovascular adaptation to regular exercise, which may play a role in an increased arrhythmia susceptibility. Since we were interested in whether the athlete's heart is more arrhythmogenic than the untrained healthy heart, we did not consider it desirable to artificially influence the heart rate.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. It is unclear for the reviewer to understand how dose HCN4 over expression and decreased Ito impact the VF inducibility, PR,PQ and QT in the Discussion section, please clarify. And it is also unclear whether these change of PR, PQ, QG prolongation found in human athlete.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your questions. For better understanding, we clarified these points in the adequate Discussion sections.</p><p>We observed altered ECG parameters in conscious trained animals in our canine model of athlete’s heart due to long-term vigorous training: prolonged PQ, QT, and widened QRS intervals. These changes are not rare among elite athletes. Similar to our results, several authors reported altered ECG parameters as a result of long-term training. They also observed prolonged PQ and QT intervals and, also widened QRS among human athletes compared to non-athletes group (Bjornstad et al., 1991; Sharma et al., 2017).</p><p>Presumably, there is an association between altered intrinsic automaticity of the pacemaker region and atrioventricular node and PQ interval prolongation, the slowed conductance and widened QRS interval, and the altered repolarization and prolonged QT interval due to long-term sustained training.</p><p>As we answered previously and described in detail in the manuscript, the overexpression of HCN4 protein in the left ventricle in trained dogs may contribute to the higher incidence of ventricular extra beats in conscious animals at the end of the 16-week-long training protocol. We hypothesized that our outcomes share some similarities with other researcher’s studies who observed increased HCN4-related current magnitude in single left ventricular cells in hypertrophied human and animal hearts due to different conditions (Cerbai et al., 1997; Cerbai et al., 2001). Although these conditions are different, similarities cannot be excluded at cellular level.</p><p>The decreased I<sub>to</sub> magnitude may contribute to the prolonged action potential duration in enzymatically isolated left ventricular myocytes and therefore the prolonged QT interval and enhanced QT dispersion in conscious trained animals.</p><p>Presumably, the weakened repolarization reserve due to decreased I<sub>to</sub> magnitude as potential arrhythmia substrate and the overexpression of HCN4 protein as a potential arrhythmia trigger in left ventricular tissue may contribute to the observed increased incidence of arrhythmogenesis and altered ECG in trained animals.</p><p>References:</p><p>Bjornstad, H., Storstein, L., Meen, H.
