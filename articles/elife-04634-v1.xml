shaping the microbial communities that interact most with modern human activities. Microbial transmission in food-processing facilities has an enormous impact on the qualities and healthfulness of foods, beneficially or detrimentally interacting with food products. To explore modes of microbial transmission and spoilage-gene frequency in a commercial food-production scenario, we profiled hop-resistance gene frequencies and bacterial and fungal communities in a brewery. We employed a Bayesian approach for predicting routes of contamination, revealing critical control points for microbial management. Physically mapping microbial populations over time illustrates patterns of dispersal and identifies potential contaminant reservoirs within this environment. Habitual exposure to beer is associated with increased abundance of spoilage genes, predicting greater contamination risk. Elucidating the genetic landscapes of indoor environments poses important practical implications for food-production systems and these concepts are translatable to other built environments.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.04634.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04634.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04634.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Many microbes—including bacteria and fungi—can affect the food and drink we consume, for better and for worse. Some spoil food, making it less tasty or even harmful to health. However, microbes can also be important ingredients: for example, yeast ferments malted barley sugars to make the alcohol and flavor of beer.</p><p>Nowadays, many beers are made under carefully controlled conditions, where the only microbes in the beer should be the strain of yeast added to the barley sugars. A more traditional ‘coolship’ method can be used to make sour beers; the barley sugars cool in an open-topped vessel and are fermented by the yeast and bacteria found naturally on the raw ingredients and in the surrounding environment.</p><p>Relatively little was known about how microbes spread around and adapt to living inside buildings. Now, Bokulich et al. have used a range of molecular and statistical techniques to examine how bacteria and fungi are dispersed throughout a North American brewery that produces beer using both conventional and coolship brewing techniques. Most of the microbes found in the building originated from the raw ingredients used to make the beer, with different parts of the brewery containing different species. Over the course of a year, some species spread to new parts of the building; a statistical method predicted the sources of these microbes, and revealed some key areas and features of the brewery that affect microbial transfer.</p><p>Bokulich et al. also looked at the spread of genes that enable their bacterial hosts to spoil beer, including those that protect bacteria from the antimicrobial action of the hops that flavor many beers. Lactic acid bacteria are the main cause of beer spoilage and so are usually to be avoided in breweries, but are also a normal ingredient in sour beer. In the brewery Bokulich et al. investigated, beer-spoilage and hop-resistance genes were found throughout the brewery, even in areas not used to produce sour beer. However, little beer spoilage occurred.</p><p>The techniques used by Bokulich et al. to track the spread of microbes and their detrimental genes could be used in the future to understand how microbes adapt to other indoor environments. Indeed, Bokulich et al. suggest that breweries could be used as models to safely understand the factors that influence microbial movement in any food-production facility as well as other building environments.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.04634.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04634.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>built environment</kwd><kwd>next-generation sequencing</kwd><kwd>droplet digital PCR</kwd><kwd>food fermentation</kwd><kwd>beer</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bokulich</surname><given-names>Nicholas A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000038</institution-id><institution>Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ziola</surname><given-names>Barry</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Mapping microbial landscapes in indoor environments can predict how contaminants and spoilage resistance genes propagate within food-production environments, yielding novel insight for controlling spoilage.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Microbial activity is an inherent feature of food-processing systems, influencing the quality and healthfulness of foods for human consumption. Like other indoor environments, the building materials, substrates, and physiochemical conditions encountered by microbes in food-processing facilities differ dramatically from the outdoor conditions to which microbial life evolved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kelley and Gilbert, 2013</xref>). How this has impacted the adaptation and ecological assemblages of microbes in food systems is largely unexplored. While the microbial communities of other indoor environments, such as homes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lax et al., 2014</xref>), office buildings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kembel et al., 2014</xref>), and hospitals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Bokulich et al., 2013a</xref>), can influence the health of their inhabitants, food-production facilities represent a unique type of built environment wherein microbial activities are intimately tied to product-quality outcomes. Thus, the sensory and safety effects of microbial growth in food-production streams have a much broader impact, such that consumer enjoyment and health can be linked to the hygiene and processing decisions at the food facility. Furthermore, both beneficial and detrimental microbial activities are well defined in foods, making these systems a useful model for exploring microbial ecosystem dynamics beyond the scope of contaminant mitigation.</p><p>Fermented foods, including beer, have the additional distinction that microbial activity is central to their production, responsible for necessary transformations as well as product spoilage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bokulich et al., 2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bokulich and Bamforth, 2013</xref>). Most modern food-fermentation practices occur under relatively aseptic conditions, employing pure starter cultures in their production, and environmental contamination represents a prevalent threat to product integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bokulich and Bamforth, 2013</xref>). Beer is typically produced through fermentation of malted barley sugars (wort) to alcohol by pure strains of <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> or <italic>Saccharomyces pastorianus</italic>, and any additional organisms—including cross-contamination from different <italic>Saccharomyces</italic> strains used in the same facility—are considered contaminants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bokulich and Bamforth, 2013</xref>). In traditional fermentation production practices, conversely, microbial communities introduced from raw materials and processing environments are central to the fermentation process. For example, in the production of coolship (lambic-style) beers, a type of sour beer, no starter cultures are added to the wort; instead, boiled wort is allowed to cool overnight in a shallow, open-top vessel known as a coolship where indigenous microbiota are presumably introduced to the product, initiating fermentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Van Oevelen et al., 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bokulich et al., 2012b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Spitaels et al., 2014</xref>). The unique succession of indigenous microbiota in coolship ale fermentations sets them apart chemically and sensorially from other beers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Van Oevelen et al., 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Spaepen et al., 1978</xref>), making coolship breweries a particularly interesting system for tracking microbial populations in food-processing environments.</p><p>Microbial spoilage genes are also well defined in brewing environments and can be studied in situ without representing a direct threat to public health. Beer is protected from wholesale microbial contamination through its alcoholic, low-pH, and antimicrobial properties, and modern sanitary technologies and practices minimize the threat of spoilage organisms that have evolved specifically to grow in beer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bokulich and Bamforth, 2013</xref>). Nevertheless, biofilms and other environmental reservoirs remain potential sources of microbial contamination in breweries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Timke et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Storgards et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Timke et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mamvura et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Matoulkova et al., 2012</xref>). As wort is boiled prior to fermentation, the primary reservoir for spoilage microorganisms in beer production is the brewery environment. Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are of particular concern, as some members of this clade resist hop antimicrobial compounds, enabling growth and spoilage of beer through acidification, hazes, and off-flavors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Suzuki et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bokulich and Bamforth, 2013</xref>). Hop iso-alpha-acids, the primary antimicrobial compounds in beer, kill most Gram-positive bacteria by acting as ionophores, dissipating proton-motive force across cell walls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Simpson and Fernandez, 1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Simpson, 1993a</xref>), and via oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Behr and Vogel, 2010</xref>). Very few resistance mechanisms have been proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Suzuki et al., 2006</xref>), primarily being the multi-drug transporters <italic>horA</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sami et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sakamoto et al., 2001</xref>) and <italic>horC</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Suzuki et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Iijima et al., 2006</xref>), the transcriptional regulator of <italic>horC, horB</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Suzuki et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Iijima et al., 2006</xref>), and <italic>hitA</italic>, a divalent cation transporter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hayashi et al., 2001</xref>) that imports manganese into the cell. These genes are all located on plasmids and transmit via horizontal gene transfer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Suzuki et al., 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">2006</xref>). The frequency and transmission of these and other beer-spoilage genes within processing environments—or any other reservoir for spoilage microbes—have yet to be tested.</p><p>Here, we employ mixed molecular approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bokulich and Mills, 2012b</xref>) and a Bayesian modeling method to interrogate the seasonal sources, reservoirs, and transmission of bacteria, fungi, and beer-spoilage genes within a North American brewery over the course of one year. Given the inherent role of environmental microbiota in conducting coolship ale fermentations, this serves as a model system for studying mechanisms for microbial transfer within food-processing systems. Information on population and gene flow extends to other food-processing systems where environmental microbiota are involved positively or negatively in the production, stability, and safety of human nutrition.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><p>The microbial ecosystems of breweries are inherently linked to successful product outcomes, impacting the qualities and healthfulness of beer. In conventional brewing, any microbe not intentionally inoculated is a contaminant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bokulich and Bamforth, 2013</xref>). Conversely, in coolship ale and other sour beer brewing, adventitious microbiota are integral to the process. Thus, we studied microbial ecosystem dynamics in a brewery that produces conventional, sour, and coolship beers, in order to observe food–ecosystem interactions from a dual perspective. First, how do microbial community assemblages and spoilage-gene frequencies change over time with respect to contamination issues in a conventional brewery? Second, how do these same elements interact with the production of sour beers?</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>Production environment microbiota are driven by substrate contact</title><p>Short-amplicon marker-gene sequencing was employed to survey the bacterial and fungal consortia inhabiting the entire brewery environment. A total of 501 samples were collected during three seasons, representing the main processing surfaces and equipment used throughout the brewing process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Beta-diversity (between sample) comparisons provide useful assessments of the taxonomic similarity between different sites. Bray–Curtis dissimilarity of complete microbial profiles reveals that many samples cluster by processing room and substrate type regardless of season (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2 fig3">Figures 2–3</xref>). Thus, fermenter samples cluster, associated with <italic>Bacillaceae</italic>; cellar production areas, associated with <italic>Micrococcaceae (including the beer-spoiling genera Kocuria and Micrococcus)</italic>; wort, malt, and hotside (wort-preparation) surfaces, associated with <italic>Enterobacteriaceae, Leuconostocaceae, Candida santamariae, Pichia, and Rhodotorula</italic>; barrel-room floor samples, associated with <italic>Staphylococcaceae</italic> and <italic>Carnobacteriaceae</italic>; and beer samples, associated with <italic>Lactobacillaceae</italic> and <italic>Enterobacteriaceae</italic>.

Grain is milled and taken to the brewhouse (hotside) area where it is mashed (steeped in hot water) to form wort, which is lautered (extracted from the grain by filtering and spraying with hot water) and then boiled with hops. Boiled wort is cooled and pumped to the fermentation cellar where it is inoculated with Saccharomyces and fermented. Optionally, barrel-aged beers are transferred to barrels after fermentation. Finished beers are transferred to conditioning tanks in a separate section of the brewery where they are cooled, carbonated, and then packaged. (<bold>C</bold>) Process diagram for coolship beer brewing. Same as conventional, but following boiling wort is pumped to the coolship room where it is left to cool overnight, exposed to the atmosphere. The following morning, the wort is pumped to barrels in which it is fermented and aged for 1–3 years. In the Autumn samples, this occurred in the barrel room in the main brewery, but in Spring and Summer this moved to a newly built facility dedicated to sour beers. All coolship and sour beers were packaged on separate equipment in this second facility. The distinction between coolship beers and sour beers is the use of this coolship; other sour beers are produced using conventional brewing methods (panel <bold>B</bold>), but are fermented with organisms other than Saccharomyces yeasts.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.04634.003">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04634.003</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-04634-fig1-v1"/></fig><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04634.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Taxon abundance heatmaps depict genus-level relative abundance of fungi across sampling sites detected by marker-gene sequencing.</title><p>The relative abundances (RA) of each genus (columns) within each sample (rows) are indicated by the color of the intersecting tile.

This tool predicts the relative proportion of contamination in sink samples (in this case brewery surfaces) from microbial sources (raw ingredients and extraneous sources). Raw substrates (grain, hops, yeast, beer) and extraneous sources (human skin, outdoor air, soil, saliva, feces, freshwater, ocean water) from previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Caporaso et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Bowers et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Caporaso et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Bowers et al., 2013</xref>) were tested as microbial sources. Results reveal distinct patterns of contamination across seasons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Grains were predicted as the largest microbial contributor to hotside areas, almost all surfaces in the coolship room, and areas of the cellar away from the main fermentation area. Hops were predicted as the major contributor to cellar fermentation areas and fermentation equipment. Yeast was predicted as the highest contributor to fermenters, conditioning tanks, and packaging equipment. Beer was predicted to be a common contaminant around fermenters and barrels within the cellar. Skin was a minor contributor to some surfaces in the cellar. Other surfaces, including most barrels and barrel-room surfaces, were most influenced by unknown sources. Outdoor air, soil, saliva, feces, freshwater, and ocean water were predicted to provide only a very low level of contamination (&lt;0.001 relative abundance). These results suggest that raw substrates are the main contaminant sources within the brewery, compared to extraneous sources. However, it is important to note that these predictions do not indicate a causative role for contamination. These predicted source/sink relationships could alternatively suggest that both are actually contaminated by another, untested source (e.g, fruit flies or other vectors could transfer microbes between these and other surfaces within the brewery). Nevertheless, these predictions highlight potential sources of contamination, or at least shared microbial transmission patterns, between substrates and equipment/surfaces within the brewery.<fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04634.006</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Mapping microbial contamination sources inside the brewery.</title><p>Floorplans of brewery indicate the predicted relative contamination of brewery surfaces by microbial sources (grains, hops, yeast, beer, human skin, unknown) at each season, estimated by SourceTracker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Knights et al., 2010</xref>).

However, the brewery surface niches clustered throughout time with only subtle changes across seasons, unlike wineries, which were significantly impacted by seasonal factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Bokulich et al., 2013b</xref>). This reflects the divergent production schemes of these two foods: whereas most beers are produced year-round, wine is an inherently seasonal product. The raw materials for beer are stored and processed throughout the year in a continual production schedule, creating a stable environment on equipment surfaces that interact with these same raw substrates on a daily basis. Instead, brewery environments may function more like cheese-making environments, where facility-specific ‘house’ microbial communities form on equipment surfaces in response to idiosyncrasies in the indoor environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bokulich and Mills, 2013a</xref>). Such a possibility would have interesting implications for sour beer breweries, and comparative studies of lambic and coolship breweries could offer insight into the brewery-specific flavor profiles displayed in these beers.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Physical mapping illustrates microbial dispersal in processing facility</title><p>By mapping surface samples to their physical location within the brewery, a spatial model emerges of microbial dispersion across brewery surfaces over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5 fig6 fig7">Figures 5–7</xref>).

Here, regular contact with beer runoff diluted with rinse water may support growth of these populations, which are associated with spoilage in low-alcohol beers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Back, 1981</xref>). High populations of <italic>Acetobacter</italic> and <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> were found more disparately, and specifically in areas where high volumes of wort and beer may be encountered: on conveyor belts and floors below packaging areas, hotside and cellar area sinks, and on sample ports for isolated fermenters and kegs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). On these sites microbial communities can contact undiluted beer, for example, drips in the basin below the packaging-line belt, wort and beer collected for specific gravity (sugar concentration) measurements then dumped in sinks, and sampling ports on fermenters. This follows the known behavior of these bacteria, which can spoil undiluted, higher-alcohol beers under appropriate conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bokulich and Bamforth, 2013</xref>).<fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04634.007</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Spatial distribution heatmaps of fungi in brewery environments across seasons.</title><p>Plots indicate relative abundance of fungal taxa detected by ITS sequence reads across brewery surfaces at different times: Autumn (left), Spring (center), and Summer (right).

Microbes not only associate with specific substrates, they exhibit patterns of dispersion within confined regions of the brewery. This yields useful insight into the transmission behavior of these organisms, and especially taxa associated with beer spoilage, through physical space. Microbial confinement within discrete zones suggests that physical barriers (e.g., walls) and physiochemical conditions (e.g., humidity and temperature control) can staunch the spread of some microbes. Non-production surfaces that encounter beer and/or waste streams, such as floors, sinks, and grain-handling equipment, are typically only cleaned by hose and may accumulate substrates for supporting microbial growth and survival. Aerosols and splashing occur regularly in a production brewery (indeed, hosing down floors is one obvious cause), increasing the likelihood for microbial spread and colonization from these surfaces onto other surfaces, including equipment. Human and insect traffic can also increase the rate of dispersal between these surfaces (e.g., from one room to another). Physical partitions appear to inhibit this passage as observed in this brewery and, where possible, may reduce the probability for contamination. This is particularly important in packaging areas, where microbial dispersal can directly contaminate sanitary surfaces and open packages, increasing the likelihood of spoilage in finished product. Separating packaging rooms from cellar and hotside operations and using local partitions, such as blast shields, may help protect packaging surfaces and beer from such routes of contamination. Further investigations into the relationship between building materials, spatial area, indoor conditions (e.g., airflow, humidity, and personnel traffic), and the rate and extent of microbial dispersion could yield important findings for optimal brewery design from the perspective of microbial control. These findings are instructive but indeed should not be interpreted with alarm: they illustrate microbial dispersal in a functioning brewery that rarely suffers from any cases of product contamination.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Lactic acid bacteria profiles are also driven by substrate exposure</title><p>Different species of LAB are the principal spoilage bacteria in beer fermentations as well as important members of sour beer fermentations.

However, the presence of these genes within brewery environments and on brewing equipment has not been described previously. Thus, we sought to quantify the abundance of these beer-spoilage genes on brewing equipment and in beer during different times in conjunction with microbial community profiles.</p><p>Results demonstrate high gene frequencies on several surfaces within the brewery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). Sour beer samples contained the highest counts, between 2.0 × 10<sup>4</sup>–4.8 × 10<sup>4</sup> copies/µl of <italic>horC</italic>, but fermenter and packaging area surfaces (filler heads, below bottling line belt, and packaging sink) also registered between 2.8–7.8 × 10<sup>2</sup> copies/cm<sup>2</sup>.

This likely reflects the strains detected in this brewery only, and <italic>L. brevis</italic> was only a minor constituent of sour beers and processing surfaces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).</p><p>These results are the first indication of hop-resistance-gene abundance within a brewery environment. As the primary reservoir for spoilage microbes in beer production, tracking spoilage genes on brewing surfaces and materials is important for understanding contamination risks arising from the environment. Sour beer contained the highest gene abundance, which is predictable given that the LAB growing in these (coolship) beers must be adapted to resist hop antimicrobials. Likewise, detection on barrel surfaces is also expected, given their regular and direct contact with these sour beers. Fermenters and packaging-line surfaces also exhibited fairly high levels of hop-resistance genes, with the highest detection on surfaces that contact sour beers and unsanitary surfaces (below packaging belt, packaging-line sink). The only sanitary, conventional beer-making surface among these is the second filler head, which only exhibited 4 cumulative copies/cm<sup>2</sup> of the resistance genes, compared to 2.1 × 10<sup>2</sup> in the first filler head, which is used for packaging sour and barrel-aged beers. Nevertheless, this second filler head is also a sanitary surface ready for packaging, and should be free of contaminants. DNA was used for ddPCR and thus these counts may represent dead cells present on the equipment surfaces; the relative proportion of viable cells is unknown. If the resistance genes detected by ddPCR do in fact represent any viable cells, this demonstrates the resilience of these bacterial populations on equipment surfaces that regularly contact ‘contaminated’ (in this case, intentionally contaminated) beers. These findings argue for careful separation of equipment used in conventional beer-making from that used for sour beers: equipment that contacts fermenting and finished sour beer or barrels, including pumps, hoses, and especially packaging equipment, is best dedicated to sour beer production and should not be used to handle conventional beers.</p><p>No hop-resistance genes were detected on hop pellets, though LAB were present, indicating that hops are probably not a significant source of beer-spoilage bacteria. Iso-alpha-acids, the antimicrobial compounds released from hops and against which hop-resistance genes confer protection, are generated by the breakdown of humulones during boiling, and are not present in raw hops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Steenackers et al., 2015</xref>). Undissociated humulones are significantly less inhibitory to LAB, and the antimicrobial effects of hops are dependent upon acidic conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Simpson and Smith, 1992</xref>). Thus, the selective pressure to acquire and maintain hop-resistance genes only exists in the presence of hopped beer, not in raw hops. Only two hop pellets were tested for hop-resistance genes, but this finding suggests that the brewery environment itself is the site of hop-resistance-gene propagation. Larger studies of hop-resistance genes on brewery surfaces and brewing materials will illuminate the role of environmental vs raw material contamination in hop-resistance-gene transfer, and sites, conditions, and mechanisms of transfer within the brewery environment.</p><p>Tracking spoilage-gene flow across brewery surfaces presents a unique opportunity for understanding spoilage dynamics within food-processing systems and other built environments in general. This approach will facilitate understanding how spoilage resistance propagates within production environments and the reservoirs and vectors encouraging its spread, yielding novel insight for controlling spoilage—focused on gene transmission rather than taxonomic populations. Moving forward, this facility-surveillance model opens many questions and possibilities for mapping microbial spoilage dynamics within food-production systems. What relationship do indoor environmental factors, building design, and surface materials have with microbial transmission? What roles do cleaning and other processes play in controlling contamination on a facility-wide scale? What other biomarkers are associated with contamination and how does the spoilage-allele landscape behave over time and in response to these conditions? The potential advantages of studying microbiology of breweries are not confined to food systems alone, and lessons learned here may aid our understanding of microbial communities in other built environments. For example, the hop-resistance genes include ABC multi-drug transporters similar to other antimicrobial-resistance genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sakamoto et al., 2001</xref>). Studying and manipulating their transmission within breweries may aid understanding of similar gene-transfer events involved in pathogenesis in hospitals, homes, water systems, or public environments where in situ modeling of such genes is unfeasible or a potential health hazard. Breweries are a useful model for testing general theories of microbial transmission and spoilage-gene dispersal in situ for functional indoor environments and food systems, as beer spoilage is not actually detrimental to human health—merely human pleasure.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Facility description</title><p>Samples were collected from a single brewery located in North America.

Sequences failing alignment or identified as chimera were removed prior to downstream analysis. OTU tables were evenly subsampled to 400 sequences per sample for all statistical tests. MANOVA with 999 permutations was used to test significant difference between sample categories based on Bray–Curtis distance using Adonis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Anderson, 2001</xref>). Kruskal–Wallis tests were used to identify significantly discriminant taxa (with Bonferroni error correction) between sample groups. Pearson product-moment correlation analyses were performed using R software. Environmental surveillance heatmaps were generated based on taxonomic abundance tables generated in QIIME and visualized using SitePainter 1.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gonzalez et al., 2012</xref>). Bacterial OTU source-sink relationships were tested using SourceTracker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Knights et al., 2010</xref>) with 1000 burn-ins, 25 restarts, and rarefaction to 100 OTUs. Source-tracking predictions used bacterial profiles of samples collected in this study, coolship beers from this brewery analyzed in a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bokulich et al., 2012b</xref>), and outdoor air (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Bowers et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">2013</xref>), soil, saliva, feces, human skin, freshwater, and ocean water samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Caporaso et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">2012</xref>) from previously published studies as source samples. All studies were performed using bacterial V4 16S rRNA with the same F515/R806 primer pair.</p><sec id="s3-4-1"><title>Terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (TRFLP)</title><p>Lactic acid bacteria-specific TRFLP was performed as described previously using the primers NLAB2F (5′-(5HEX)-GGCGGCGTGCCTAATACATGCAAGT-3′) and WLAB1R (5′-TCGCTTTACGCCCAATAAATCCGGA-3′) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bokulich and Mills, 2012a</xref>). Purified amplicons were digested using enzymes MseI and Hpy188I and submitted to the UC Davis College of Biological Sciences Sequencing Facility for capillary electrophoresis fragment separation. Electropherogram traces were visualized using the program Peak Scanner v1.0 (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA) using a baseline detection value of 10 fluorescence units. Peak filtration and clustering were performed with R software using IBEST TRFLP tools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Abdo et al., 2006</xref>).

Primer and probe sequences, melting temperatures, 5′ fluorophore probe labels, and amplicon lengths for each gene target are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>. All probes contained a 3′ IowaBlack FQ quencher paired with different 5′ fluorescent labels (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). Each 20 μl reaction was then pipetted into separate wells of a disposable eight channel droplet generation cartridge (Bio-Rad) and 70 µl of droplet generation oil (Bio-Rad) loaded into the cartridge oil wells. The cartridge was then inserted into the QX100 droplet generator (Bio-Rad) and each sample was portioned into droplet-sized water-in-oil emulsions. Following droplet generation, emulsion samples were transferred to a 96-well PCR plate (Eppendorf). The plate was then hot-sealed with foil cover and subjected to conventional PCR in the CFX96 Touch Real-Time PCR (Bio-Rad). Thermal cycling conditions consisted of an activation period for 10 min at 95°C, followed by 40 cycles of a denaturation step for 30 s at 94°C, and an annealing-extension step for 60 s at the optimal annealing temperature (59–59.6°C), using a ramp rate of 2.5°C/s for each step and a final inactivation step of 98°C for 10 min. After PCR amplification, the plate was loaded into the QX100 Droplet Digitial PCR (Bio-Rad) and analyzed for absolute signal quantification of each fluorescence channel in each well. Signal detection and data processing were performed using Quantasoft Software v.1.3.2 (Bio-Rad).<table-wrap id="tbl1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04634.012</object-id><label>Table 1.</label><caption><p>Hop-Resistance Gene Primers and Probes for ddPCR</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.04634.012">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04634.012</ext-link></p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Target</th><th>Tm<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="tblfn1">*</xref></th><th>5′ Label</th><th>Probe</th><th>Forward primer</th><th>Reverse primer</th><th>bp<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="tblfn2">†</xref></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><italic>horB</italic></td><td>59</td><td>FAM</td><td>TCGCGGCCAAGTGATACTTATCCTGA</td><td>AGTCGACACAAAATCCTGAATCA</td><td>AGCCTTGATCAATCGTCAGAC</td><td>88</td></tr><tr><td><italic>hitA</italic></td><td>59</td><td>HEX</td><td>ACAGAATAACGGCAACCAGTGTCGCAA</td><td>TCCTGTTGCTTCTGATGAAATTGG</td><td>CCGCTAAGAATACTTCGTAGGTGA</td><td>105</td></tr><tr><td><italic>horA</italic></td><td>59.6</td><td>FAM</td><td>CGCCGTTCCGCTCGTCTTGATCTGCC</td><td>TGGACTGGCGGATGACTATC</td><td>CTGTCTCGCTCTGGCAAC</td><td>104</td></tr><tr><td><italic>horC</italic></td><td>59.6</td><td>HEX</td><td>ACCACGCCAATGCCACTAGAAGCATGG</td><td>ACACGGTTAATGGCACAGC</td><td>GTTCGCGCCATAAAATAAGAGAGG</td><td>87</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn id="tblfn1"><label>*</label><p>Tm = melt temperature (°C).</p></fn><fn id="tblfn2"><label>†</label><p>Nucleotide length (bp).</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>Data availability</title><p>All raw marker-gene sequencing data are publicly deposited in QIITA (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://qiita.colorado.edu/">http://qiita.colorado.edu/</ext-link>) under the accession number 10105 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://qiita.colorado.edu/study/description/10105">http://qiita.colorado.edu/study/description/10105</ext-link>).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors thank the brewers involved in this study for generously donating their time, beer, and support with sampling efforts.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Ian Baldwin (Senior editor), Roberto Kolter (Reviewing editor), and two outside reviewers, one of whom was Greg Caporaso.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The authors present a nice study of tracking the source of microbes and antimicrobial resistance genes through breweries. The analysis is well done. While overall we deemed the manuscript presented a very nice story that could be of broad interest, there were several concerns that should be addressed in revising the submission.</p><p>First, we were concerned with the data and interpretations of causative sources of contamination based on the Sourcetracker software. Given that the results are a prediction of possible contamination, it will be helpful to know what the confidence in these predictions is. In addition, how do the authors distinguish between alternate possibilities such as 1) microbes coming instead from untested sources, 2) source and sample just happening to have similar communities, or 3) both source and sample being “contaminated” by another untested source. In other words, how likely is it that the listed source is actually causative of the “contamination”? This seems particularly difficult to determine in the coolship analysis. One dominant source is the beer-packaging surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Isn't it equally likely that the beer itself was the source of contamination of the packaging surface? Also, is the barrel “source” the fermenting beer inside the barrel, the interior surface of an empty barrel (have the barrels been used for brewing before or are they new?), or the exterior of the barrel? Again, how can the “source” here really be interpreted? Some additional clarification would be very helpful. In short, the authors should elaborate on what other likely sources there are, and test these as possible sources, which might provide more information for the sites “influenced by unknown sources” (third paragraph of the Results and Discussion section). Such sources could include human skin and saliva, as well as rinse water, soil and outdoor air, and could easily be included analysis. Given that the authors used the 515F/806R primers for bacterial sequencing, it should be straight-forward to include samples from other studies for comparisons.</p><p>Second, the QIIME Database is currently offline, so the authors should deposit to an additional repository, and/or ensure that their samples are in the new version of the database (QiiTA) when it comes online. As far as we understand, this should happen soon or might already have happened. In the meantime, if QiiTA is not up and running, the sequences should be deposited in a repository such as EBI. That way, when QiiTA eventually comes online, a transfer should be easy.</p><p>Finally, in the Abstract the authors mention that the concepts learned from breweries are readily translatable to other built environments. We think the authors should come back to this point in the Discussion section, as right now it's not clear how these concepts translate to other, non-food-production environments. For example, can their findings provide insight into contamination sources in hospitals, or are the building systems too different? This would greatly add to the general interest of the manuscript.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04634.014</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>First, we were concerned with the data and interpretations of causative sources of contamination based on the Sourcetracker software.

We have revised the manuscript to clarify that sourcetracker analysis is not determining causality of contamination sources. The sourcetracker analysis has been re-done incorporating other source samples from published studies, as suggested. These include human skin, outdoor air, human saliva, feces, soil, freshwater, and ocean water from a number of other studies. We have also included beer samples as possible sources. This analysis revealed that human skin and beer were sources of contamination on some surfaces, but other additional sources were negligible (&lt; 0.1% relative contribution). Otherwise, results for other contaminant sources are similar to the original analysis. These results are shown in a new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>.</p><p>As for the coolship analysis, we have removed this, as we agree with the reviewers’ point that it is difficult to determine the exact nature of the source/sink relationship with these samples.</p><p><italic>Second, the QIIME Database is currently offline, so the authors should deposit to an additional repository, and/or ensure that their samples are in the new version of the database (QiiTA) when it comes online.

However, our preferred database, QIITA (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://qiita.colorado.edu/">http://qiita.colorado.edu/</ext-link>), is still in alpha release. We are working with the database curators to finalize the data upload and ensure compliance with data standards, as this system is new. However we believe this database is the best suited for the type of data, as it will support streamlined meta-analyses for other built environment projects deposited in that database, facilitating future analyses. Data accessibility information is provided in the manuscript, but we are working on finalizing the publication of these data in QIITA.</p><p><italic>Finally, in the Abstract the authors mention that the concepts learned from breweries are readily translatable to other built environments.

We believe that lessons learned in breweries could translate to other non-food built environments, including hospitals. We have discussed some ideas in the thirteenth paragraph of the Results and Discussion section.</p></body></sub-article></article>
