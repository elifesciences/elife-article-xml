This is largely due to the difficulty in obtaining environmental datasets with a high spatiotemporal precision. The problem is particularly pertinent in assessing the influence of environmental factors in rapid, high energy-consuming behavior such as seabird take-off. To fill the gaps in the existing environmental datasets, we employed novel techniques using animal-borne sensors with motion records to estimate wind and ocean wave parameters and evaluated their influence on wandering albatross take-off patterns. Measurements revealed that wind speed and wave heights experienced by wandering albatrosses during take-off ranged from 0.7 to 15.4 m/s and 1.6 to 6.4 m, respectively. The four indices measured (flapping number, frequency, sea surface running speed, and duration) also varied with the environmental conditions (e.g., flapping number varied from 0 to over 20). Importantly, take-off was easier under higher wave conditions than under lower wave conditions at a constant wind speed, and take-off effort increased only when both wind and waves were gentle. Our data suggest that both ocean waves and winds play important roles for albatross take-off and advances our current understanding of albatross flight mechanisms.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Wandering albatrosses are large seabirds with one of the most impressive wingspans found in the animal kingdom. While they spend most of their time efficiently gliding above the waves, they do have to regularly land on sea to snatch their prey. To resume flight, the birds turn into the wind and flap their wings as they run on the surface of the ocean; this causes their heart to beat three to four times faster than normal. In contrast, flying barely leads to a change in pulse rate compared to rest. As for many other marine birds, sea take-offs therefore represent one of the major energy costs that albatrosses face when out foraging.</p><p>Scientists have long assumed that the amount of effort required for this manoeuvre depends on factors such as wind speed and, potentially, the height of the waves. However, this is difficult to establish for sure because direct information about the environment that a bird faces as it takes off is rarely available. Often, the best that researchers can do is to reconstruct this data based on global weather patterns, ocean climatic models or evidence collected from nearby locations.</p><p>To address this problem, Uesaka et al. devised innovative ways to use data from animal-borne sensors. They equipped 44 albatrosses with these instruments and recorded over 1,500 hours of foraging sea trips. Wind parameters such as speed and direction were estimated based on the animals’ flying paths, and wave height calculated from their floating motion. Sensor data also gave an insight into the energy cost of each take-off, which was estimated based on four parameters (running duration, running speed, number of wing flaps, and flapping frequency).</p><p>The analyses confirmed that albatrosses take off into a headwind, with stronger winds reducing the amount of effort required. However, wave height also had a profound impact, suggesting that this parameter should be included in future studies. Overall, the birds flapped their wings less and ran on the surface of the water for shorter amounts of time when the wind was strong, or the waves were high. Even with weak winds, take offs were easier when waves were taller, and they were most costly when both the sea and wind were calm.</p><p>The work by Uesaka et al. helps to capture how environmental factors influence the energy balance of albatrosses and other marine birds. As ocean weather patterns become more volatile and extreme climate events more frequent, such knowledge is acutely needed to understand how these creatures may respond to their changing world.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>seabird</kwd><kwd>biologging</kwd><kwd>ocean environment</kwd><kwd>take-off</kwd><kwd>wandering albatross</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002241</institution-id><institution>Japan Science and Technology Agency</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CREST program (JPMJCR1685)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sato</surname><given-names>Katsufumi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (17H00776)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sato</surname><given-names>Katsufumi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (22K21355)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sakamoto</surname><given-names>Kentaro Q</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001700</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Tohoku Ecosystem-Associated Marine Science</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sato</surname><given-names>Katsufumi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100007807</institution-id><institution>Japan Science Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Sasakawa Scientific Research Grant (2020-4034)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Uesaka</surname><given-names>Leo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>European Community's Seventh Framework Program FP7/2007-2013 (ERC-2012-ADG_20120314)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Weimerskirch</surname><given-names>Henri</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>European Community's H2020 Program (ERC-2017-PoC_780058)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Weimerskirch</surname><given-names>Henri</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Polar Institute Paul-Emile Victor</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>IPEV program n°109</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Weimerskirch</surname><given-names>Henri</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Wind and ocean wave conditions experienced by albatrosses were estimated using an animal-borne recorder and revealed that take-off was easier under higher wave conditions.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Various oceanic environmental factors affect the ecology of marine animals. Predicted climate changes suggest increases in extreme climatic events (such as cyclones). Thus, evaluating individual relationships between each environmental factor and marine animal behaviors is urgent for marine ecological conservation, especially for top predators that significantly impact the entire ecosystem. However, there are potential limitations: direct measures of marine animals empirical environmental data are nearly impossible due to the spatiotemporal gaps in the observation network of the open ocean (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ardhuin et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Villas Bôas et al., 2019</xref>). Various environmental parameters (such as ocean wind, waves, and sea surface temperature) are assumed to be important factors affecting the movement and foraging of flying seabirds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dunn, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Haney et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams and Navarro, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Nevitt et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Suryan et al., 2008</xref>). Previous research has revealed that many interesting seabird behaviors correlate with the ocean environment. However, the environmental data largely rely on ocean climatic models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Padget et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Weimerskirch and Prudor, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Clay et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Clairbaux et al., 2021</xref>), as in situ observation data are limited and often collected a long distance from the bird. For example, records are collected at the colony island or using the nearest government observation point (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kogure et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Yamamoto et al., 2017</xref>). Therefore, interpreting the data is difficult when doubts exist on whether birds actually experienced the same environmental conditions, making any conclusions conservative estimates only (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Clay et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Clairbaux et al., 2021</xref>). For instance, although winter cyclones in the North Atlantic can induce mass seabird mortality, revealing the small-scale behavioral responses which lead to mortality is almost impossible with the spatiotemporal limits of thermodynamic modeling data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Clairbaux et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Seabird take-off may be affected by the surrounding environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Clay et al., 2020</xref>) but has never been effectively investigated. Notably, behaviors with short timeframes (such as take-offs) require localized environmental data on spatiotemporally small scales, which is difficult to obtain, even using mathematical weather models. Many procellariiformes have special flight techniques that use vertical wind shear, called dynamic soaring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Rayleigh, 1883</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Richardson, 2011</xref>), while take-off requires a large amount of energy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sakamoto et al., 2013</xref>) owing to vigorous flapping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sato et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sakamoto et al., 2013</xref>) and sea surface running to reach the velocity to initiate take-off (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sato et al., 2009</xref>). Previous research revealed the heart rate of the largest seabird, wandering albatross (<italic>Diomedea exulans</italic>), drastically increases at the moment of take-off reaching three to four times the basal heart rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Weimerskirch et al., 2000</xref>). After take-off, the tachycardia progressively decreases during flight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Weimerskirch et al., 2000</xref>), the flying heart rate is close to the basal rate of a resting bird on the nest. Therefore, the high energy expenditure associated with take-off strongly influences the total energy expenditure of wandering albatross during the foraging trip, unlike flight duration or distance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Shaffer et al., 2001a</xref>). Thus, take-off is one of the most important behaviors in the daily energy budget of flying seabirds in the open ocean. Understanding the relationship between take-off and the ocean environment is critical for estimating the future climate change effects on the life history of seabirds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Weimerskirch et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Previous research has partially identified the role of wind conditions on take-off when investigating general flight tactics of seabirds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kogure et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Clay et al., 2020</xref>). For example, the flapping effort of the European shag (<italic>Gulosus aristotelis</italic>) at take-off decreases as wind speed increases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kogure et al., 2016</xref>). However, a comprehensive understanding of take-off has not been achieved as other environmental parameters, such as waves, have not been investigated. Ocean waves potentially affect take-off efforts because seabirds usually run on the ocean surface as they take-off (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Norberg and Norberg, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sato et al., 2009</xref>). Additionally, the ocean surface slope is a key factor in creating complicated wind patterns immediately above the surface, which may affect the flight tactics of procellariiformes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bousquet et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we devised a new approach to estimate the empirical local environmental conditions using seabird dynamic motion records without the aid of either mathematical weather models or observational data. The recent development of animal-borne recorders has been remarkable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wilmers et al., 2015</xref>). It is now possible to deploy various sensors on animal-borne recorders, to generate a new field of oceanography: ocean observations using animal-borne sensors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Harcourt et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">McMahon et al., 2021</xref>). Many studies have reported that marine environmental data can be collected using highly mobile marine animals such as pinnipeds, sea turtles, and seabirds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Charrassin et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Charrassin et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Roquet et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Doi et al., 2019</xref>). Furthermore, unlike direct measurement by deploying sensors (e.g., thermometers), indirect techniques to observe the physical environment via the dynamic animal motion records (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yoda et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yonehara et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Goto et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sánchez-Román et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Uesaka et al., 2022</xref>) generated using the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) have been developed recently. GNSS is now able to record animal position and movement every second (or even in sub-second scales) using very small animal-borne recorders. These newly developed techniques using animal-borne recorders should compensate for previous observational gaps in oceanic data, especially in the open ocean and polar regions where our access and deployment of observation equipment is complicated. The environmental variables obtained directly from free ranging animals provide the localized environmental conditions they experience. Seabirds are one of the most enthusiastically studied oceanic species because of their high mobility and adaptability to both air and water. Methods involving wind and wave observation, using GNSS data regarding the flight paths and floating motions of seabirds on the sea surface, are well developed and have potential applicability in future studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yonehara et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Goto et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Uesaka et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>Wandering albatrosses were investigated because their habitat includes the Subantarctic (30°S–60°S), where the ocean is annually rough (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Suryan et al., 2008</xref>) causing their flight behaviors to be largely influenced by the ocean conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Richardson, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Weimerskirch et al., 2012</xref>). Furthermore, previous studies have revealed the foraging area has shifted southward annually with the polar shift of the westerly wind pattern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Weimerskirch et al., 2012</xref>). Considering the enormous cost of take-off (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Weimerskirch et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Shaffer et al., 2001a</xref>), studying their response to various environmental conditions is essential for us to estimate the impacts of climate change on the life history of seabirds. We aim to estimate the physical environmental conditions (ocean winds and wave heights) experienced by wandering albatrosses as they take-off by utilizing the dynamic motion records to evaluate the effects of wind and wave conditions on take-off dynamics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Procellariiformes, like many seabird species, require extensive limb motion for take-off which is not limited to flapping behavior. Therefore, the evaluation of take-off effort involves both surface running and flapping behaviors. The wandering albatross individuals were tagged using recorders that include both global navigation satellite system (GNSS), specifically the global positioning system (GPS), and acceleration sensors with high time resolutions.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Conceptual framework of the study estimating environmental conditions experienced by studied individual.</title></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-87016-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Trip data</title><p>We obtained 1477 hr from 44 wandering albatrosses in 2019 (<italic>N</italic> = 21, 623 hr) and 2020 (<italic>N</italic> = 23, 854 hr).

However, we suggest that the running behavior should also entail a large cost in take-off because albatrosses have to reach a fast initial speed to lift off the sea surface by rapidly moving their hindlimbs for up to ~10 s in unfavorable conditions (as demonstrated in this study).</p><p>We provide a first attempt at detecting the running signal of seabird take-offs and construct a relatively simple algorithm (which can be easily applied to other species) using lateral acceleration. The running duration may increase or decrease by approximately 0.5 s depending on the algorithm configuration, such as smoothing parameters and threshold values. However, we focused on the relative changes in the running behavior in association with wind speed and wave height, and absolute value error is not a serious problem.</p><p>The flapping characteristics of wandering albatross during the running phase were also researched. However, the dorsoventral acceleration signal fluctuates during the running phase making it difficult to identify each flapping signal, even after applying the band-pass filter. Therefore, counting the number of flaps immediately after the running phase was the only reliable parameter for evaluating flapping effort. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sato et al., 2009</xref> reported that the flapping frequency of wandering albatrosses at the moment of take-off is higher (2.9–3.4 Hz) than that of cruising flight (2.5–2.7 Hz). In our study, the flapping frequency after the running phase was not as high as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sato et al., 2009</xref> reported. Therefore, it is likely that wandering albatrosses undertake high-frequency flapping only during the running phase, as they lift off the sea surface. After lift-off (i.e., the running phase is completed), wandering albatrosses continue with a moderate flapping frequency until they reach a certain degree of flight stability. Simultaneous video records of flapping and running motions with acceleration records are required to separate the parameter estimates.</p><p>In-depth studies on seabird take-offs are just beginning with the aid of miniaturized animal-borne recorders with the main aim of understanding how seabirds flap their wings. However, in land birds (e.g., finches and doves) take-off requires a large contribution by hindlimbs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Provini et al., 2012</xref>) and the role of the hindlimb in take-off kinematics is as important as that of the wing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Provini and Abourachid, 2018</xref>). Therefore, it is highly likely that seabird take-offs also require a substantial contribution by the hindlimbs, and thus, further seabird hindlimb research is required. Our study provides the basic characteristics of wandering albatross running behavior, including running duration and speed.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Take-off effort with environmental conditions</title><p>Our results demonstrate that wandering albatrosses can take-off in a variety of environmental conditions (wind speed: 0.7–15.4 m/s, wave height: 1.6–6.4 m). A previous study on wandering albatrosses identified the transition state from resting to flying tended to increase as the wind speed increased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Clay et al., 2020</xref>). Our results found some take-offs were performed under weak wind (2–4 m/s) conditions, suggesting wind speed is not the only parameter influencing flight decisions of wandering albatross, and that wave height should be included in future studies.</p><p>The results showed that the running and flapping behavior tended to decrease as the wind or wave conditions increased. Running duration decreased as either the wind speed or the wave height increased and peaked when both the wind and wave conditions were weak. The same trends existed in running speed and flapping number. Although optimum statistical models for each take-off parameter were determined using the AIC value, some models provided similar results to this model. For instance, the AIC difference in running speed between the best model and the second lowest AIC model was only 0.27. However, both models included wind speed and wave height as the explanatory variables, similar to the other take-off parameters, except flapping frequency. The purpose of constructing a linear model was to clarify whether the effects of wind and waves are independent. As long as both wind speed and wave height were included as explanatory variables in the model, they reduced the running and flapping behavior requirement. Therefore, we can conclude that both strong winds and high waves aid wandering albatross take-offs. The flapping frequency after the running phase was the only parameter that did not correlate with wave height (as identified using the LMM). However, we assume the flapping frequency during the running phase is more important. Future research needs to investigate the effects of wave height as wandering albatrosses need to climb up or run down the wave slope. Therefore, the flapping frequency during the running phase should be highly influenced by wave height.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Contribution of strong wind and high waves to seabird take-off</title><p>The reduced running behavior and flapping times under strong wind conditions are simply described by the lift force mechanism which has been predicted by previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kogure et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Clay et al., 2020</xref>). Seabirds need to gain lift force before take-off, and the magnitude of force is proportional to the square of the relative speed of the wings to the surrounding air (air speed) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Vogel, 1983</xref>). It has been anecdotally suggested that seabirds take-off into the wind (i.e., headwind), because stronger winds can produce a sufficiently large lift even before the ground speed of the seabird reaches the value required for flight. As a partial demonstration of this theory, a study on the European shag (<italic>G. aristotelis</italic>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kogure et al., 2016</xref> found the take-off direction was significantly biased toward headwinds. Regarding soaring seabirds, only one study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Clay et al., 2020</xref>) on wandering albatrosses has confirmed a bias in take-off direction with wind direction. However, the authors acknowledge the limits in the mathematical weather model and GPS sampling resolutions and recognize the unreliability of small-scale responses to in situ variation in the atmosphere. Our study reveals wandering albatrosses significantly tend to take-off into the wind, using robust fine scale data estimated from the flight records of wandering albatross. Moreover, there was no correlation between cruising and headwind direction, indicating that wandering albatrosses face the wind on take-off regardless of their destination. Our data are reliable as the empirical value provided is actually experienced by the albatross. Furthermore, by quantitatively evaluating the flapping and running effort, we demonstrate the theory of effortless take-offs by soaring seabirds in stronger wind conditions.</p><p>The mean air speed of wandering albatrosses at the end of the running phase was close to the average flight speed (approximately 15 m/s) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Weimerskirch et al., 2002</xref>), and similar to predicted best glide speeds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Shaffer et al., 2001b</xref>), indicating that wandering albatrosses gain sufficient lift at the end of the running phase and efficiently utilize ocean wind. Wind speed varies with altitude, therefore the wind blowing on the ocean surface must be smaller than the values estimated from the flight records of wandering albatross as they usually fly 3–12 m above the ocean surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Pennycuick, 1982</xref>). Therefore, the calculated air speed is probably an overestimate when compared with the ocean surface. To compensate for the insufficient lift force gained during the running phase, wandering albatrosses flap their wings several times after the running phase. Therefore, the flapping number in weak wind conditions can exceed dozens before reaching stable flight.</p><p>The most important finding of our study is that the take-off effort estimated by the running behavior and number of flaps decreased not only with stronger winds but also with higher waves. While the role of ocean wind on flying seabirds has been well described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Pennycuick, 2008</xref>), how ocean waves influence the flight of seabirds remains largely unknown. However, many studies have reported the characteristic flight of soaring seabirds by tracking the ocean wave surface over long distances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Pennycuick, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Pennycuick, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Richardson, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Stokes and Lucas, 2021</xref>), which even occurs in weak or no wind conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Pennycuick, 1982</xref>). Seabirds seem to be aided by atmospheric forces above the slope-like wave topography; the flight method using the shape of wave is called wave-slope soaring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Richardson, 2011</xref>). It is well recognized that air flows occur above ocean waves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Buckley and Veron, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bousquet et al., 2017</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Richardson, 2011</xref> described the theoretical model of wave-slope soaring, where the flight mechanism of albatross is a combination of both dynamic soaring, which uses vertical wind shear above the ocean surface (~15 m), and wave-slope soaring, which uses the updraft caused by the wave topography. Thus, seabirds can continue to soar in weak wind conditions. Furthermore, mathematical analysis has revealed that the wave-induced updraft (even in windless conditions) can provide 60% of the transportation cost of a brown pelican (<italic>Pelecanus occidentalis</italic>, 2–3 kg), which is a wave-slope soarer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Stokes and Lucas, 2021</xref>). Thus, it is possible that the take-off effort by wandering albatross is also reduced by high waves. While qualitative field observations and mathematical demonstrations provide the only previous research on the role of waves on soaring seabirds, we experimentally demonstrated that ocean waves aid the most energy-consuming behavior, take-off. This finding helps future discussions on ocean topographical mechanisms affecting seabird flight.</p><p>The mechanism by which high waves aid wandering albatross take-off is not entirely clear. It is difficult to conclude a certain updraft is producing additional lift for wandering albatrosses, and it is also possible that there are other unresolved mechanisms. For example, a rough topographic surface can provide a favorable bump, like a slope or cliff to jump off into the air. Our results were restricted to wave height as the parameter of the ocean surface. Future research involving ocean surface steepness or wave frequency components will reveal the detailed mechanism of how waves facilitate seabird take-off behavior. In particular, ocean surface topography relies heavily on whether the dominant wave component is due to a swell (low-frequency waves propagated from a distance) or wind waves (high-frequency waves generated by local wind); moreover, this topography affects the wind pattern on the sea surface.</p><p>In conclusion, we revealed how the take-off effort of wandering albatross changes in various oceanic conditions. As take-off is one of the most energy-consuming behaviors that can dominate the total energy expenditure of a wandering albatross journey, these data will be of great value for considering how climate changes can alter the life of albatrosses. Future research, especially on albatrosses, should quantitatively evaluate the energy consumption of take-off with the wind and wave conditions. Currently, there is no major barrier to accomplishing this goal, it would require utilizing motion records to estimate the surrounding environment with additional methods to estimate energy consumption, such as cardiograms. Recognizing the negative effect of the changing oceanic environment on seabirds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sydeman et al., 2015</xref>), revealing the direct small-scale mechanisms of environmental factors (such as wind, wave, tide, current, and sea surface temperature) effects on animal behavior, especially in take-off is urgently required. The concept of estimating the surrounding environment using motion records is a novel solution with great potential to unravel the small spatiotemporal uncertainties in seabird research.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Field experiment</title><p>The recorders, Ninja-scan (Little Leonardo, Tokyo, Japan), record triaxial acceleration at a very high time resolution (100 Hz).

Large Ninja-scans weighed 91 g, which corresponds to 0.8–1.3% of wandering albatross body mass, and are expected to record for 65 h.</p><p>Ninja-scans were attached to breeding wandering albatrosses at Possession Island, Crozet archipelago (46°25 S, 51°44 E) in the South Indian Ocean in 2019 and 2020. In 2019, 12 small Ninja-scans were attached (in tandem) to 6 individuals. On each bird, one recorder had a delay timer so that the two recording periods did not overlap. Additionally, 15 birds had individual Ninja-scans attached, of which 8 were small Ninja-scans and 7 were large Ninja-scans. In 2020, 10 small Ninja-scans were attached in tandem to 5 individuals. Additionally, 19 birds had individual Ninja-scans attached, of which 7 were small Ninja-scans and 12 were large Ninja-scans. In summary, 21 and 24 wandering albatrosses were tagged in 2019 and 2020, respectively. All experiments were performed from late January to early March of each year, which corresponds to the incubation period of wandering albatrosses. Recorders were attached to the back of each bird with waterproof tape (Tesa, Hamburg, Germany) and glue (Loctite; Henkel, Dusseldorf, Germany). All recorders were retrieved within 35 days. One small Ninja-scan which had been attached in isolation in 2020 did not work correctly.

Then, take-off was determined using the absolute value of the GPS horizontal velocity. When wandering albatrosses float on the sea surface (i.e., before take-off), a relatively low speed which is generally below 2.5 m/s, is recorded, while the flying speed exceeds 5 m/s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Weimerskirch et al., 2002</xref>). Take-off was defined as the moment when the horizontal speed exceeds 4 m/s and rises to a higher speed. The soaring (flying) speed occasionally meets this criteria. Therefore, the horizontal speed was smoothed using the moving average (20 points: 0.4 s). If the horizontal speed crossed the 4 m/s line several times within a short period, they were classed as take-offs for very short flights and were not used in our investigation. Therefore, we selected only take-offs that included over 30 s of floating followed by over 30 s of flying.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Wind estimation</title><p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yonehara et al., 2016</xref> proposed estimating the wind speed and direction of seabird flight paths using the sinusoidal curve relationship between flight speed and flight direction. When seabirds fly in the air, their flight speed against the ground (ground speed) is mainly affected by the wind speed, which is maximized in tail winds and minimized in headwinds. The maximum speed is the sum of the flight speed against air (air speed) and wind speed, whereas the minimum speed is the difference between the air speed and wind speed.

However, studies using accelerometers have not focused on the acceleration signal of this behavior. Surface running involves asymmetrical leg movements. Therefore, the lateral acceleration obtained from the recorder (attached to the back of the seabirds) provided signals derived from the running motion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). We confirmed that running signals appear in the lateral acceleration records at the moment of take-off by streaked shearwaters (<italic>Calonectris leucomelas</italic>), which are phylogenetically similar to wandering albatrosses (see Supplementary Information Text and Figure S1).</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Time series data of horizontal speed (top), lateral acceleration (middle), and dorsoventral acceleration (bottom) signals of the wandering albatross at the moment of take-off.</title><p>Horizontal speed starts increasing from the beginning of the take-off.

The lateral acceleration signal is composed of a dominant component (0.25–0.4 s) and a high-frequency fluctuation component (&lt;0.2 s period). Although the dominant component is the lateral movement derived from surface running, the flapping period of wandering albatross appears around this period (0.3–0.4 s). The flapping behavior is laterally symmetrical and does not appear in the lateral acceleration records. However, this is not always the case, when (occasionally) recorders are attached to the back of the seabird in a slightly tilted position. To avoid confusion between running and flapping behavior, a high-frequency fluctuation component in the lateral acceleration signal was used to detect the running phase. A band-pass filter was designed to extract the high-frequency fluctuation component from the acceleration records, and then the variance per unit time (0.6 s) was calculated at each point. Running phase was defined as when the acceleration variance exceeded the threshold value (2% of the peak value). This algorithm reasonably detects the running phase regardless of the running duration. If there is a signal gap in the middle of the running phase, the algorithm regards the gap as the end of the running phase, underestimating the running duration. However, these cases are rare, and we assume it does not affect our evaluation of the running characteristics of wandering albatross. The horizontal speed at the end of the running phase and take-off direction were calculated using the GPS velocity. The take-off direction was defined as the vectoral average direction during the running phase. We also calculated the cruising direction which was defined as the moving direction 5 min after take-off.

using streaked shearwater</title><p>Among ecological studies using animal-borne recorders, accelerometers are often used to detect specific animal behaviors. The running behavior of seabirds (which is required when they take off from the sea surface) should be a specific feature of the acceleration signal. Therefore, we confirm the existence of a running signal in the acceleration record using streaked shearwaters (<italic>Calonectris leucomelas</italic>).</p><p>Streaked shearwaters belong to the same phylogenetic group as wandering albatross, Procellariiformes, and have a similar body silhouette, although the body mass is 20 times lighter than wandering albatross. We attached a combined video and acceleration recorder (DVL400–3DGT, Little Leonardo, Japan) to the chest of streaked shearwaters breeding at Funakoshi Ohshima Island (39°24′N,141°59′E), Japan, during the chick-rearing period from August to September 2021. Recorders were attached to the chest of each bird using waterproof tape (Tesa, Hamburg, Germany) and glue (Loctite; Henkel, Dusseldorf, Germany) with the camera facing backward to film leg movement. The running duration was filmed by the video, and the sway acceleration signals were compared. The time resolution of the acceleration records was 100 Hz. All procedures were approved by the Animal Experimental Committee of Atmosphere and Ocean Research Institute, University of Tokyo (A21-10), and were conducted with permission from the Ministry of the Environment and Agency for Cultural Affairs, Japan.</p><p>At the take-off moment, streaked shearwaters move their legs, as demonstrated by the video record (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1—figure 1</xref>). The simultaneous record of sway acceleration showed specific signals during the running phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1—figure 1</xref>). The dominant period of the signal was approximately 0.16–0.20 s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1—figure 1</xref>). The running leg cycle was analyzed using a captured bird, the cycle was approximately 0.19 s which corresponds to the dominant period of the sway acceleration signal. We conclude the signal of the sway acceleration record is derived from the running motion of seabirds.</p><fig id="app1fig1" position="float"><label>Appendix 1—figure 1.</label><caption><title>Leg motion and acceleration signal during seabird take-off.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The video recorder mounted on the chest of the bird captured their legs moving in turns to run on the sea surface.

To accomplish this in the complex and challenging environment in which albatross live, the authors sought to use accelerometry and geographic positioning to infer patterns of locomotion, flight orientation relative to the prevailing wind, and wave height during takeoff.</p><p>The major strength of the methods and results is that the use of accelerometry and novel interpretations of data from a geographic positioning system provides new insight into the use of waves by albatross and how the effects of wave magnitude interact with the wind to modulate energy demands during takeoff. Weaknesses of the approach are due to the challenging environmental conditions in which albatross live. The interpretation of accelerometry data was not validated using a subset of the sample synchronized with video (prior validation was cited for shearwaters). The interpretation of wind direction relative to flight path is based on the behavior of the bird without concurrent measures of local wind velocity.</p><p>The authors achieved their aims, and their results support their conclusions.</p><p>Although it is generally understood that albatross and many other birds choose to takeoff into the wind to reduce energetic costs, the authors provide novel quantitative data on this behavior. Their results on the effects of wave height and the interactions between wave height and wind provide novel insight into how albatross harvest energy from their complicated and dynamic environment to reduce the energy they must output to get into the air. In particular, the new insight into the effects of wave height should revise understanding among ornithologists, ocean ecologists and those who study the mechanics of animal locomotion. The use of accelerometry and geographic positioning systems to measure flight behavior and ocean ecology should inspire other researchers to adopt similar methods.</p><p>Albatross live in a complex and poorly understood environment that is likely to be threatened by climate change. This research provides worthwhile new insight into how wind and wave action affect takeoff in albatross, and can therefore improve insight into how changes in these variables with climate change may affect the distribution of albatross populations.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.87016.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The authors used cutting-edge bio-telemetry technology to decipher the roles of wind speed and wave height on the take-off of albatrosses from the water surface.

Specifically, the authors showed how localized winds and wave heights influence their ability to take off from the sea surface, which is the most expensive behavior they engage in while foraging. There is no better platform for this initial work because these birds are so large, the equipment they can carry without creating significant impact is tremendous.</p><p>The results were impressive, presented well, and the paper was generally written in an accessible way to readers with less knowledge. The authors provide a convincing set of results that support the aims and conclusions. The theory and application could be used to inform our understanding of flight behavior in other seabirds.</p><p>Although the idea of taking off from the sea surface may sound trivial, it is essential to understand that albatrosses and other soaring seabirds have wings that are adapted for soaring (i.e. long and narrow). The trade off, however, is that powered flight through wing flapping is energetically expensive because the wings have a shallow amplitude and generate less power compared to a shorter, wider wing. Thus, wind is everything and this study shows how wind facilitates the ability of the birds to gain flight using wind and waves.

We also moved detailed information about the curve fitting function from the Result section to Materials and Methods section.</p><p>“Threshold values were decided based on the peak in the curve of the fitted probability density distribution (wind speed: 6.0 m/s, wave height 2.8 m). Weibull distribution and log normal distribution were used as the fitting function for wind speed and wave height, respectively (Ferreira and Guedes Soares, 2000; Carta et al., 2009).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2</bold></p><p>Line 51 - Climatic models - climatic model cannot, by definition, provide prediction of specific weather conditions as they focus on large and long-term values and trends.

Most of the phrases “climatic models” in the manuscript were replaced by “mathematical weather models”, for example, line 51, 226, 230, 312.
