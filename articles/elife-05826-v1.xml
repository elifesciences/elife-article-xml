Hardy, non-pathogenic, and versatile strains that grow quickly on many different nutrients can be isolated from virtually any human.

However, the gut is primarily an anoxic environment, and the extremely large, highly diverse (500+ taxa) gut microbial community is dominated by obligate anaerobes, such as members of Bacteroides and Firmicutes, which alone comprise ∼90% or more of the total gut microbial population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bäckhed et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Eckburg et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Claesson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Tenaillon et al., 2010</xref>). By contrast, <italic>E. coli</italic> typically constitutes only 0.1–5% of the community, which partly reflects the fact that its niche is to be found in the relatively thin layer of mucus that lines the gut. In the mucus layer, <italic>E. coli</italic> grows in a complex, multi-species biofilm (see ‘Glossary’) in which it competes for an array of nutrients—one of the origins of its broad diet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Chang et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Beloin et al., 2008</xref>). This rich food supply enables <italic>E. coli</italic> to maintain population densities of 10<sup>6</sup>–10<sup>9</sup> cells per gram of fecal matter despite unavoidable and regular bulk losses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Savageau, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Chang et al., 2004</xref>). In the human gut, the <italic>E. coli</italic> population typically includes a set of long-term residential strains, and also short-term transients that vary with diet, health, and with exposure to antibiotics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Sears et al., 1950</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Savageau, 1983</xref>). The human gut <italic>E.coli</italic> population also varies due to its constant, largely unknown interactions with the broader microbiome, and with the host and the host's vast virome (see ‘Glossary’), against which it defends itself with restriction enzymes, which have become a key tool in molecular biology (see ‘Glossary’) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Kasarjian et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Roberts, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Minot et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">He et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Shoaie et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib131">Virgin, 2014</xref>).</p><p>A host organism carefully regulates its microbiome in poorly understood ways that have an impact on its health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Schluter and Foster, 2012</xref>). For instance, the human gut secretes immunoglobulin A, which appears to facilitate the formation of <italic>E. coli</italic> biofilms on the intestinal mucosa, suggesting that their presence is welcome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Bollinger et al., 2003</xref>). While long considered to have a commensal relationship with its host, in which <italic>E. coli</italic> secures food and a nice warm home while contributing little in return, it is increasingly clear that the host-<italic>E. coli</italic> relationship is really a mutualism. Indeed, <italic>E. coli</italic> benefits its host in a number of ways. It produces vitamin K and vitamin B12, both of which are required by mammalian hosts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bentley and Meganathan, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Lawrence and Roth, 1996</xref>). <italic>E. coli</italic> also maintains a friendly environment for its anaerobic neighbors by consuming oxygen that enters the gut. Perhaps most importantly, <italic>E. coli</italic> competitively excludes pathogens from its niche in the gut, rather like how friendly barbarian tribes, settled by the Roman Empire on its frontiers, helped to keep out the more dangerous tribes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Chang et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p><italic>E. coli</italic>'s relationship with a host literally begins at birth. Newborns are typically inoculated with maternal <italic>E. coli</italic> through exposure to her fecal matter during birth and from subsequent handling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Nowrouzian et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Leimbach et al., 2013</xref>). Although perhaps disconcerting to ponder, this inoculation seems to be quite important. Indeed, <italic>E. coli</italic> becomes more abundant in the mother's microbiome during pregnancy, increasing the chances of her newborn's inoculation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Koren et al., 2012</xref>). The colonizing strains typically have secretion systems and pili that allow them to attach to and interact with the infant's gut epithelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Feeney et al., 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">de Muinck et al., 2013</xref>). This newly established and rapidly growing <italic>E. coli</italic> population then changes the structure and function of the epithelial cells in ways that appear crucial for healthy microbiome development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib126">Tomas et al., 2015</xref>). It is therefore concerning that early human infant colonization by <italic>E. coli</italic> has been declining in the US and in other Western nations as rates of caesarean delivery have increased and hospital hygiene has continued to improve (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Grönlund et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Nowrouzian et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adlerberth, 2006</xref>). Indeed, this decrease has been accompanied by broader microbiome changes, including increased infant gut colonization by <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, which is linked to an increased risk of developing a variety of disorders, including asthma, obesity, and diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Lindberg et al., 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Neu and Rushing, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Sannasiddappa et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Rudi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Azad et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Moeller et al., 2014</xref>). The long-term consequences of disrupting humanity's long association with <italic>E. coli</italic> are under intensive investigation.</p></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Life on the outside: <italic>E. coli</italic> in the external environment</title><p>An inevitable consequence of being a gut microbe is to be regularly excreted into the external world. The mucus lining of the gut is constantly sloughed off and excreted in fecal matter, so cells of a resident <italic>E. coli</italic> population are shed almost as soon as that population is established. <italic>E. coli</italic>'s long-term life cycle is hence biphasic, and despite being exquisitely adapted to the good life inside of a host, <italic>E.coli</italic> must also be adapted to successfully acclimate to a harsher life outside the host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Savageau, 1983</xref>). This is a remarkable feat. Whereas life on the inside is easy and stable, every aspect of the external environment, be it nutrition, temperature, oxygen, moisture, pH, and/or the surrounding microbial community, can fluctuate wildly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Savageau, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib137">Winfield and Groisman, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib130">van Elsas et al., 2011</xref>). It is likely that the hardiness, metabolic flexibility, and substrate breadth that have made <italic>E. coli</italic> such a valuable model organism evolved in part to permit it to survive this hostility and variability long enough to make it back to a host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib130">van Elsas et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Another interesting trait that is almost certainly relevant to <italic>E. coli</italic>'s survival of its environmental phase is the production of persister variants. First observed in <italic>Staphylococcus</italic> during experiments with penicillin, persisters are rare, highly antibiotic-tolerant phenotypic variants that arise at random in bacterial populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Hobby et al., 1942</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bigger, 1944</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Balaban et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Lewis, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib142">Zhang, 2014</xref>). Persisters are not an adaptation specifically to antibiotics; their hallmark antibiotic tolerance is attributable to their metabolic inactivity, which is triggered by several redundant pathways, including those that govern stress response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Shah et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Lewis, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Amato et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amato and Brynildsen, 2014</xref>). Persistence therefore appears to be a general adaptation that permits small numbers of dormant cells to survive a variety of environmental fluctuations. <italic>E. coli</italic> has been, as with so many other phenomena, a model in which to study bacterial persistence, and it seems likely that this capacity to enter a dormant state plays a significant role in surviving the considerable fluctuations it encounters in its external environment.</p><p>The external world was long thought to be so harsh as to preclude <italic>E. coli</italic>'s growth outside of its host. While a tiny minority might eventually reach a new host, most cells were expected to eventually die. This is the basal assumption behind using the presence of <italic>E. coli</italic> as an indicator of fecal contamination. However, recent studies have shown that <italic>E. coli</italic> can, in fact, establish itself as a member of microbial soil, water, and plant-associated communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Lopez-Torres et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Ishii and Sadowsky, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib125">Texier et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Brennan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Berthe et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Dublan et al., 2014</xref>). Moreover, genomic and phylogenetic analyses of collections of <italic>E. coli</italic> strains have identified divergent lineages that appear to be adapted to a primarily non-host lifestyle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib133">Walk et al., 2009</xref>). What adaptations are required for <italic>E. coli</italic> to make such radical ecological shifts, what niches it fills in its new communities, how stable its presence in those communities might be, and what impact its adaptation to these new niches might have on its capacity to return to a host remain outstanding questions that must be addressed (see <xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="box3">Box 3</xref>).</p><boxed-text id="box3"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05826.005</object-id><label>Box 3.</label><caption><title>Outstanding questions about the natural history of <italic>E. coli</italic></title><p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>How do <italic>E. coli</italic> populations become established in soil and water communities outside of their host?

It has long been observed that groups of <italic>E. coli</italic> cells on water-restricted surfaces will congregate and engage in social, coordinated movement over the surface, a behavior also seen in other bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Harshey and Matsuyama, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Harshey, 2003</xref>; Partridge and Harshey, 2013a,b). However, swarming has principally been observed and studied on agar plates in the lab (Partridge and Harshey, 2013a). What function it might serve for <italic>E. coli</italic> in nature has been unclear. The gut generally lacks the sorts of surfaces on which swarming works. Given that ∼216 <italic>E. coli</italic> genes are specifically involved in swarming motility, it is a costly trait that would not be maintained if it did not confer some selective benefit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Inoue et al., 2007</xref>). It is as yet unclear if swarming plays any role in the initial colonization of the gut, but it is associated with pathogenesis, likely due to its improved colonization of tissue surfaces that facilitate opportunistic infection (see the next section) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib141">Zhang et al., 2010</xref>; Partridge and Harshey, 2013a). Given that surfaces, and interfaces between surfaces, are regularly encountered by environmental bacteria, swarming may well prove to be an adaptation that enables the exploration and colonization of viable habitats by <italic>E. coli</italic> upon their excretion into the external environment.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Pathogenic <italic>E. coli</italic>: A friendly microbe's dark side</title><p><italic>E. coli</italic>'s presence in the environment is a cause for concern because its relationship with humans is not entirely benign. Indeed, <italic>E. coli</italic> is a major cause of diarrheal diseases, peritonitis, colitis, bacteremia, infant mortality, and urinary tract infections that world-wide cost billions of dollars to treat and kill roughly 2 million humans each year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Russo and Johnson, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Kaper et al., 2004</xref>). Some strains may even cause cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arthur et al., 2012</xref>). Some opportunistic <italic>E.coli</italic> infections are caused by normally harmless or beneficial strains when introduced to sick hosts or to parts of a host's body outside of the gut (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Kaper et al., 2004</xref>). However, there are also pathogenic strains that produce virulence factors and can cause illness in even the healthiest host. These strains are classified by where and how they cause disease into groups called pathotypes (see ‘Glossary’), which include enteroaggregative, enterohemorrhagic, enteropathogenic, enterotoxigenic, uropathogenic, meningitis-associated, and septicemic-associated <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Kaper et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Leimbach et al., 2013</xref>) (see ‘Glossary’).</p><p>The most notorious of these is <italic>E. coli</italic> O157:H7, an enterohemorrhagic strain that produces a shiga<bold>-</bold>like toxin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Griffin and Tauxe, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Robinson et al., 2006</xref>). This toxin (see ‘Glossary’) attacks small blood vessels, killing intestinal cells, and causing bloody diarrhea and severe abdominal pain, as well as hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), a potentially deadly condition that can involve widespread clots in capillaries and hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and renal failure (see ‘Glossary’; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Griffin et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Kaper et al., 2004</xref>). Treatment can be difficult because antibiotics increase the risk of HUS. As a result, treatment is generally limited to the provision of fluids, adequate nutrition, medication for pain and fever, and blood transfusions when necessary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bitzan, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Smith et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>O157:H7 is particularly dangerous because it can easily contaminate human food supplies. It resides asymptomatically in cattle and in other livestock, and can be transferred to humans via the fecal contamination of meat during its butchering and packaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ferens and Hovde, 2011</xref>). It can also contaminate vegetables via fertilizers and water, and through contact with live-stock-associated birds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Callaway et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">2014</xref>). Through these points of entry into the human food chain, O157 has caused numerous outbreaks of illness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Frenzen et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Rangel et al., 2005</xref>). In the US alone, such outbreaks have annually affected ∼63,000 individuals, killing 20, and costing around $405 million in healthcare and in lost productivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Mead et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Scallan et al., 2011</xref>). When <italic>E. coli</italic> gets bad press, O157:H7 is almost always the culprit, and rightfully so.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Diversity and plasticity of the <italic>E. coli</italic> genome</title><p>The many pathogenic strains of <italic>E. coli</italic> testify to the diversity of this single microbial ‘species’, the full extent of which was only revealed by the advent of whole-genome sequencing. For example, genome sequences have firmly placed all <italic>Shigella</italic> strains within the broader <italic>E. coli</italic> clade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Pupo et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Lukjancenko et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Kaas et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>More importantly, sequencing has uncovered the remarkable plasticity and dynamism of the <italic>E. coli</italic> genome that contribute to its genetic and phenotypic diversity. In 2002, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib135">Welch et al. (2002)</xref> reported that three strains of <italic>E. coli</italic>, the popular lab strain K-12, O157:H7, and the uropathogenic strain CFT073, share only 39.2% of their genes. Subsequent sequencing of more strains has reduced this core genome to less than 20% of the more than 16,000 genes in the <italic>E. coli</italic> pan-genome (see ‘Glossary’; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Lukjancenko et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Kaas et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>The remaining genes constitute the flexible genome (see ‘Glossary’), a vast pool of ‘plug and play’ genetic variation that can be acquired via horizontal gene transfer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Lukjancenko et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Mira et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Leimbach et al., 2013</xref>). This variation includes prophages, transposable elements, and accessory genes (see ‘Glossary’). These genes encode functions that can: improve fitness in particular niches; increase metabolic flexibility; and affect pathogenicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Schmidt and Hensel, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib127">Touchon et al., 2009</xref>). Flexible genomic elements are often large and integrate into the genome at select insertion hotspots (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib127">Touchon et al., 2009</xref>). This capacity to mix and match accessory genetic elements means that new <italic>E.coli</italic> strains with novel combinations of traits can arise very quickly. Another consequence is that the size of the <italic>E. coli</italic> genome can vary greatly between strains. While standard lab strains have genomes of ∼4.5 million base pairs and 4000 genes, pathogenic strains can have genomes of over 5.9 million base pairs and 5500 genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Blattner et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Lukjancenko et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">de Muinck et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>This extensive genetic plasticity poses major questions for understanding how <italic>E. coli</italic> evolves in the wild over the long-term. For instance, how does the rate of genomic evolution in a given <italic>E. coli</italic> lineage by mutation compare to that by horizontal gene transfer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Guttman and Dykhuizen, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Dolbrindt et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Paul et al., 2013</xref>)? Moreover, how much of the <italic>E. coli</italic> flexible genome ultimately derives from other organisms?</p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Conclusion</title><p><italic>E. coli</italic> has been tremendously valuable as a de-contextualized, abstracted model organism, but it could be of even greater value were we to gain a better understanding of its ecology and natural history. As I have discussed, it is a highly diverse and broadly distributed species that occupies an expansive, generalized niche in which it experiences a vast range of environmental and ecological conditions. This breadth presents two unique and synergistic opportunities. First, the tools and techniques developed for, and the knowledge derived from, the study of <italic>E. coli</italic>'s lab strains can be applied to studying its wild relatives in far greater detail than is possible for any other microbe. This capacity promises to yield new and profound insights into the biology of other microbes that experience similar conditions, as well as the discovery and identification of new microbiological phenomena. Second, any increase in our knowledge of <italic>E. coli</italic>'s natural history expands the range of biological phenomena for which its strains can be used as models to study. In other words, the study of <italic>E. coli</italic>'s natural history can reveal more than is possible with most organisms, and an increased understanding of its natural history in turn expands its potential as a model organism.</p><p>An example of this dynamic can be seen in studies of <italic>E. coli</italic> biofilms, which have revealed much about how harmless and pathogenic strains colonize the gut and persist in the environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib134">Wang et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Beloin et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Nesse et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib132">Vogeleer et al., 2014</xref>). These studies have, in turn, led to the development of <italic>E. coli</italic> as a model for studying the formation, genetics, physiology, and consequences of biofilms, generating important findings on this most common of microbial lifestyles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Beloin et al., 2008</xref>). Experimental evolutionary studies of <italic>E. coli</italic> biofilms have also led to findings of far-reaching consequence, such as how biofilms impact microbial evolution and how they facilitate the evolution of antibiotic resistance even when antibiotics are not present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Ponciano et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib129">Tyerman et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>There are many unanswered questions about <italic>E. coli</italic>'s natural history (see <xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="box3">Box 3</xref>). How does <italic>E. coli</italic> adapt to non-host environments? What role does it play in non-host communities? How does it adapt to life in the soil? Just how fluid is the <italic>E. coli</italic> genome? How do environmental and ecological conditions affect this fluidity? How does the pan-genome evolve? How much interaction is there between <italic>E. coli</italic>'s pan-genome and that of other microbes? How tightly adapted are hosts to their <italic>E. coli</italic> populations? How is <italic>E. coli</italic> adapting to changes in the human diet and lifestyle? Each unanswered question presents opportunities for novel research into unexplored corners of <italic>E. coli</italic>'s natural history, and the subsequent expansion of its potential as a model. Improved appreciation and interest in <italic>E. coli</italic>'s natural history can only uncover more questions, and increase its potential even more. If kept in mind by researchers, this dynamic will guarantee that the most important model organism of the 20<sup>th</sup> century will continue to be one of the most important model organisms of the 21<sup>st</sup> century and beyond.</p></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>I would like to thank Richard Lenski and Caroline Turner for their kind suggestions during the writing of this manuscript.
