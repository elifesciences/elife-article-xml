the left and right ventricles arise from early populations of cardiac progenitors known as the first and second heart fields, respectively. While these populations have been extensively studied in non-human model systems, their identification and study in vivo human tissues have been limited due to the ethical and technical limitations of accessing gastrulation-stage human embryos. Human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) present an exciting alternative for modeling early human embryogenesis due to their well-established ability to differentiate into all embryonic germ layers. Here, we describe the development of a TBX5/MYL2 lineage tracing reporter system that allows for the identification of FHF- progenitors and their descendants including left ventricular cardiomyocytes. Furthermore, using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) with oligonucleotide-based sample multiplexing, we extensively profiled differentiating hiPSCs across 12 timepoints in two independent iPSC lines. Surprisingly, our reporter system and scRNA-seq analysis revealed a predominance of FHF differentiation using the small molecule Wnt-based 2D differentiation protocol. We compared this data with existing murine and 3D cardiac organoid scRNA-seq data and confirmed the dominance of left ventricular cardiomyocytes (&gt;90%) in our hiPSC-derived progeny. Together, our work provides the scientific community with a powerful new genetic lineage tracing approach as well as a single-cell transcriptomic atlas of hiPSCs undergoing cardiac differentiation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cardiac development</kwd><kwd>pluripotent stem cells</kwd><kwd>cardiomyocyte</kwd><kwd>lineage tracing</kwd><kwd>genetic engineering</kwd><kwd>transcription factors</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100017540</institution-id><institution>NHLBI Division of Intramural Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F30Hl149152</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Galdos</surname><given-names>Francisco X</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100017540</institution-id><institution>NHLBI Division of Intramural Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01HL13483004</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wu</surname><given-names>Sean M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000052</institution-id><institution>NIH Office of the Director</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1RM1 GM131981-02</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wu</surname><given-names>Sean M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000052</institution-id><institution>NIH Office of the Director</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NIH T32 GM007365</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Galdos</surname><given-names>Francisco X</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>NIH K08 Mentored Clinical Scientist Research Career Development Award (NHLBI)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1K08HL15378501</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Goodyer</surname><given-names>William</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>NIH/NHLBI</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F30Hl149152</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Galdos</surname><given-names>Francisco X</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>The Dorothy Dee and Marjorie Boring Trust Award</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Galdos</surname><given-names>Francisco X</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Stanford Medical Scientist Training Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Galdos</surname><given-names>Francisco X</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>TBX5 lineage tracing and high resolution single cell transcriptomics uncover the predominance of first heart field development during human-induced pluripotent stem cell cardiac differentiation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The human heart is one of the first organs to develop during embryogenesis with critical events in progenitor specification and differentiation occurring during the first 3 weeks of human gestation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Buckingham et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cui et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hikspoors et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Meilhac and Buckingham, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Tan and Lewandowski, 2020</xref>). Due to ethical and technical limitations in the study of human embryogenesis prior to 5 weeks gestation, developmental biologists have largely relied upon animal models to study cardiac development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hyun et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Meilhac and Buckingham, 2018</xref>). Early studies in mammalian cardiac progenitor biology identified the presence of two definitive multipotent progenitor populations known as the first (FHF) and second (SHF) heart fields which give rise to the left and right ventricles, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cai et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dyer and Kirby, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Meilhac et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mjaatvedt et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Moretti et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Waldo et al., 2001</xref>). Furthermore, early lineage tracing studies using the mesodermal progenitor marker, <italic>Mesp1</italic>, has revealed that the early specification of these lineages likely occurs during the earliest stages of gastrulation, with the FHF emerging as the first wave of cardiac progenitors, followed by the SHF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lescroart et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Saga et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Scialdone et al., 2016</xref>). With the advent of scRNA-seq, these progenitor populations have been extensively characterized and shown to exhibit unique transcriptional expression profiles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">de Soysa et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hill et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Xiong et al., 2019</xref>). Moreover, scRNA-seq profiling of murine left and right ventricles during early cardiac development has shown that transcriptional differences can be detected up to E10.5 of murine development, suggesting that early left and right ventricular development is characterized by unique transcriptional regulatory networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">DeLaughter et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Li et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Li et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>While the distinct identities of the first and second heart field progenitors have been well established in the murine system, the identification of these progenitor populations within a human model has been severely limited by a lack of access to human embryonic tissues. Over the past decade, the advent of hiPSCs has allowed for the developmental modeling of multiple different embryonic lineages in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Holloway et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kanton et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Karagiannis et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lian et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Takahashi and Yamanaka, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Yamanaka, 2008</xref>). In the cardiac field, small molecule-based protocols modulating WNT signaling have become standard due to their remarkable efficiency in generating large numbers of beating cardiomyocytes that can be utilized for disease modeling, drug discovery, and the study of cellular functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Burridge et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Feyen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lian et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sacchetto et al., 2020</xref>). Several questions remain as to whether hiPSC cardiac differentiations are capable of modeling early cardiac progenitor biology as seen during in vivo mouse development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Protze et al., 2019</xref>). Moreover, evidence is lacking as to whether current hiPSC differentiation protocols give rise to FHF- and SHF-derived LV and RV cardiomyocytes, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Protze et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>A major bottleneck in the identification of these cell types during hiPSC differentiation is the lack of lineage tracing tools that have been extensively used in murine models to understand the developmental lineage contributions of progenitor populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barnes et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cai et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Meilhac et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Moretti et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Tyser et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Vincentz et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>). Early studies profiling the expression of the T-box transcription factor, <italic>TBX5,</italic> identified its specific expression at the cardiac crescent and its role as a marker of early FHF progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bruneau et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bruneau et al., 1999</xref>). More recently, studies using inducible CreER/LoxP lineage tracing have shown the exquisite specificity of <italic>TBX5</italic> to label ventricular cardiomyocytes on the left but not the right, demonstrating a clear boundary between cell origins of left and right ventricular cardiomyocytes during embryogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Devine et al., 2014</xref>). While lineage tracing tools have provided insight into the cellular contributions of the FHF in mice, no lineage tracing tool is currently available for tracing LV and RV cardiomyocytes in a human model system.</p><p>To identify FHF-progenitors and their derived cell types during hiPSC differentiation, we used a CRISPR-Cas9 targeting platform to engineer a TBX5 expression-driven, highly-sensitive, Cre/LoxP lineage tracing system in hiPSCs that contain a ventricular cardiomyocyte-specific myosin light chain-2 (<italic>MYL2</italic>)-tdTomato fluorescent protein. By conducting a time course analysis of cardiomyocyte differentiation, we identified a left ventricular cardiomyocyte predominant differentiation across two distinct cell lines based on the high percentage of TBX5-lineage positive ventricular cardiomyocytes (&gt;90%). Using chemically modified lipid-oligonucleotides (CMOs), we conducted multiplexed scRNA-seq assays on 12 different timepoints across two independent hiPSC lines. Using differentiation trajectory analysis, we compared our scRNA-seq data with murine heart field development scRNA-seq data and validate the FHF origin and LV identity of cardiomyocytes generated. Finally, we conduct a comparison of our scRNA-seq data with a recently published 3D cardiac organoid differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Drakhlis et al., 2021</xref>) and identify the greater potential of a 3D system to generate SHF-derived cell types. Together, our findings provide a powerful new tool for human in vitro cardiac development studies and a validated single-cell expression atlas for identifying the human FHF lineage during in vitro hiPSC differentiation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Generation of a TBX5-lineage tracing and ventricular reporter line by CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing</title><p>Given the well-established role of the T-box transcription factor, <italic>Tbx5,</italic> as a specific marker of the early FHF and left ventricular lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bruneau et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bruneau et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">DeLaughter et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Devine et al., 2014</xref>), we engineered a fluorescent lineage tracing system that would allow for the determination of whether <italic>TBX5</italic> lineage tracing could correctly identify left ventricular cardiomyocytes using a human iPSC model of cardiac differentiation. Previously, our laboratory developed an <italic>MYL2</italic>-tdTomato construct targeting a P2A-TdTomato to the stop codon of the <italic>MYL2</italic> gene that was validated to specifically isolate ventricular cardiomyocytes during hiPSC differentiations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chirikian et al., 2021</xref>).To construct a reporter system that could isolate left ventricular cardiomyocytes, we employed a triple construct system that would allow for the identification of <italic>MYL2-</italic>positive ventricular cardiomyocytes and the identification of <italic>TBX5-</italic>lineage-positive left ventricular cardiomyocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). To lineage trace <italic>TBX5</italic> expressing cells during hiPSC differentiation, we developed two new genetic constructs based on a P2A self-cleaving peptide system that allows the tethering of genetic construct expression with a gene of interest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Liu et al., 2017</xref>). The first construct consists of tandem P2A-Cre Recombinase genes that are targeted to replace the stop codon of <italic>TBX5</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The second construct consists of a constitutively active CMV promoter followed by a floxed stop cassette and a downstream TurboGFP with the goal to only allow for TurboGFP expression after the excision of the stop cassette by Cre (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Using CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing, we first targeted the MYL2-tdTomato construct into two hiPSC lines derived from healthy donor patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Using an inside-out PCR strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Galdos et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ran et al., 2013</xref>), we confirmed the successful integration of the MYL2 construct based on the integration of the 5â and 3â ends of the construct and selected a heterozygous integrated clone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). We subsequently integrated the CMV-Lox-STOP-Lox-TurboGFP construct into the CCR5 safe harbor site and confirmed successful integration via inside-out PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Next, we integrated the P2A-Cre-P2A-Cre construct into the <italic>TBX5</italic> locus by replacing the stop codon of the gene. To ensure maximal sensitivity of our lineage tracing system, we integrated the <italic>P2A-Cre</italic> construct in a homozygous manner to ensure high expression of Cre recombinase upon expression of TBX5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).

Using sanger sequencing, we validated the in-frame integration of the P2A sequences of both the <italic>MYL2</italic> and <italic>TBX5</italic> constructs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).

We used a Python-based bioinformatic pipeline known as STREAM to automatically identify and visualize differentiation trajectories within our scRNA-seq data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2019</xref>). STREAM uses a low-dimensional manifold such as a UMAP plot and calculates a principal graph that identifies differentiation paths throughout the dataset. Intriguingly, the STREAM algorithm fits a principal graph that identified two major bifurcations during hiPSC differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">Figure 4âfigure supplement 5</xref>). Along with the fitting of a principal graph, we calculated STREAM pseudotime by setting the pluripotent stem cell cluster as the root of the differentiation. We then reordered and projected cells along the principal graph according to increasing pseudotime to visualize our annotated cell types as they progressed during differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4DâF</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">Figure 4âfigure supplement 5</xref>). To further characterize the distinct trajectories identified by STREAM, we correlated the expression of gene expression with the cell pseudotime along each unique branch (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata3">Figure 4âsource data 3</xref>). This analysis recovered multiple gene markers known to be expressed during the course of gastrulation and cardiac development. The first bifurcation identified occurred at the late primitive streak stage and represents the bifurcation into mesodermal and endodermal cell lineages. Gene markers identified for the endodermal lineage include markers such as <italic>EPCAM and FOXA2,</italic> as well as hepatic-like endodermal markers such as <italic>APOA1</italic> and <italic>AFP</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hurrell et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Pijuan-Sala et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sarrach et al., 2018</xref>). Along the mesodermal differentiation path, we observed the upregulation of <italic>MESP1</italic> followed by ISL1 expression as cells became specified along the cardiac progenitor lineage. ISL1 expression preceded the expression of <italic>NKX2-5</italic> and encompasses both endodermal precursors as well as cardiac progenitors, supporting the earlier but less cardiac-specific expression of <italic>ISL1</italic>. At the second bifurcation, we identified an <italic>NKX2-5</italic> population that bifurcated into myocardial and epicardial lineages. Top ranking markers for the epicardial lineage included known epicardial markers <italic>TBX18, WT1, TCF21,</italic> and <italic>IGF2</italic>, while the myocardial lineage was characterized by the elevated expression of sarcomeric genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">Figure 4âfigure supplement 5D</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Christoffels et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Li et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Rudat and Kispert, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Tandon et al., 2013</xref>).

Intriguingly, we observed the epicardial lineage branched off from FHF progenitor cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>).

Consistent with the literature, <italic>TBX5</italic> and <italic>HCN4</italic> were upregulated in FHF cells during mouse development in vivo and are completely absent in the aSHF lineage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andersen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bruneau et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Devine et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">SpÃ¤ter et al., 2013</xref>). Of note, <italic>Tbx5</italic> appeared to gradually increase in expression during the transition from FHF progenitors to LV CMs with a gradual downregulation as development progresses, indicating a dynamic expression pattern through the course of development. In contrast to the FHF markers, we observed a clear upregulation of aSHF markers <italic>TBX1</italic> and <italic>FGF8</italic> during early aSHF progenitor development in mice with <italic>Fgf8</italic> exhibiting its highest expression pattern at prior to the bifurcation between OFT CM and RV CM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Nevis et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Park et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Vitelli et al., 2002</xref>). As expected, the expression of <italic>TBX1</italic> and <italic>FGF8</italic> was absent in FHF progenitors, albeit a low <italic>Fgf8</italic> expression was found in early LV CM, which is expected given the role of Fgf signaling during early cardiomyocyte differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Khosravi et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Reifers et al., 2000</xref>). We next plotted the expression of these markers during our hiPSC cardiac differentiations and observed a striking consistency in marker expression with the FHF lineage in the mouse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Importantly, we observed the upregulation of TBX5 starting at the late progenitor stage and increasing during the myocardial branch of the differentiation, like the kinetics observed in the FHF trajectory of the mouse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Similarly, <italic>HCN4</italic> expression remained high during cardiomyocyte differentiation further supporting the left ventricular identity of the myocardial branch given the reported role of HCN4 as an early FHF and LV marker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">SpÃ¤ter et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Having observed the similarities between murine FHF development and our hiPSC differentiations, we asked whether our hiPSC differentiations exhibited a ventricular-specific differentiation trajectory.

Given the predominance of FHF progenitors and LV cardiomyocytes made from our 2D hiPSC differentiation platform, we assessed whether a greater repertoire of cardiac cells can be generated from a 3D hiPSC differentiation platform by analyzing scRNA-seq data from a recently published cardiac organoid study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Drakhlis et al., 2021</xref>).

While non-human model systems have provided significant insight into the developmental lineages that contribute to cardiac development, the inaccessibility of early human embryonic tissue has significantly limited the creation of an in vivo reference atlas of human heart field development. Importantly, questions remain as to whether the human iPSC system can be used to efficiently generate cell types representing distinct chambers of the heart such as left/right ventricular cardiomyocytes, outflow tract cardiomyocytes, or atrioventricular canal cells. Currently, a major gap exists in the ability to model the development of specific structures of the human heart in part due to the lack of genetic tools to mark distinct cell lineage in vitro. Importantly, the ability to identify chamber-specific cardiomyocyte is vitally important to modeling the early developmental mechanisms that give rise to structural congenital heart defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Doyle et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Reller et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">van der Linde et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>In this paper, we sought to build a novel genetic lineage tracing tool to elucidate the identities of cardiomyocytes generated using a well-cited and standard differentiation protocol. We successfully implemented a <italic>TBX5</italic> lineage tracing scheme into the hiPSC system by targeting a highly sensitive Cre recombinase to the 3â end of the endogenous <italic>TBX5</italic> locus. Moreover, by including an <italic>MYL2-</italic>TdTomato direct reporter in our hiPSC lines, we evaluated the percentage of ventricular cardiomyocytes that were descended from <italic>TBX5-</italic>expressing precursors. By implementing a lineage tracing method, our reporter system provides several advantages for studying the descendants of FHF progenitor cell types compared with previous approaches. While previous studies have shown the isolation of TBX5-positive cell types using direct reporter schemes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>), a major advantage of a lineage tracing approach is the permanent and robust labeling of descendants from progenitor populations or cardiomyocyte populations that express <italic>TBX5,</italic> thus allowing for the evaluation of cell type identity at later stages of differentiation when TBX5 expression is downregulated. Moreover, the combination of our lineage tracing and a ventricular reporter system allowed us to evaluate the proportion of definitive ventricular cardiomyocytes from the TBX5-lineage during iPSC differentiation that generates atrial cardiomyocytes as well.</p><p>Surprisingly, our data indicate that in two distinct hiPSC lines, TBX5-lineage-positive cardiomyocytes represent more than 95% of all cardiomyocytes generated. Furthermore, our scRNA-seq time course data further revealed the emergence of a core cardiac progenitor differentiation trajectory that displayed a gradual upregulation of FHF markers and no expression of known SHF genes. The unexpected finding of FHF predominance raises important questions on whether the widely used small molecule WNT modulation protocol used for the generation of hiPSC cardiomyocytes is biased towards the generation of FHF lineage cardiomyocytes. An additional finding from our scRNA-seq analysis that was quite intriguing was the bifurcation of cardiac progenitors into epicardial and myocardial cells. Importantly, the epicardial lineage arose from a cell cluster that exhibited high expression of <italic>HAND1</italic> representing early FHF progenitor cells. Recently, two groups have published lineage tracing results in mice that suggest a subset of FHF progenitor cells exhibit contributions to both the proepicardial and myocardial lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Tyser et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>). Consistent with these studies, our data provides evidence of this bifurcation in vitro and demonstrates the high expression of left ventricular markers <italic>HAND1, TBX5</italic>, and <italic>HCN4</italic> along the myocardial lineage. The high expression of <italic>HAND1</italic> during the earliest stages of mesoderm differentiation further suggests that even at the earliest stages of mesoderm specification the progenitors in our hiPSC differentiations were already bound for an FHF fate given the known restriction of <italic>HAND1</italic> to give rise to FHF-derived cell types during early embryonic development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barnes et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Vincentz et al., 2017</xref>). This observation is consistent with a growing body of literature suggesting that the bifurcation of the first and second heart fields occurs during the earliest patterning of mesoderm during its emergence from the primitive streak (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lescroart et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Having established the FHF identity of our cardiac differentiation conducted in 2D, we used our dataset as a reference point for determining whether a recently published cardiac organoid protocol could give rise to a greater diversity of cardiac progenitor cell types. While multiple 3D protocols have recently been published, the study by Drakhlis et al., is the only protocol to date to demonstrate the co-emergence of anterior endoderm cell types that are closely related to the emergence of an anterior cell types such as the anterior second heart field during embryonic development. Interestingly, our comparison revealed the presence of <italic>bona fide</italic> second heart field progenitors within the organoids generated in the Drakhlis et al., protocol. Importantly, we were able to combine cardiomyocytes generated from our study with those from the Drakhlis et al., 3D protocol and reveal the identity of a true OFT cell type present in the Drakhlis et al., dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). This analysis thus reveals the promising application of 3D differentiation protocols for generating a greater diversity of cardiac cell types.</p><p>Overall, here we provide a novel reporter system that allows for the identification of left ventricular cardiomyocytes during the course of hiPSC differentiation. By allowing for the permanent labeling of <italic>TBX5</italic> descended cell types, we envision our system being used to conduct more complex studies to study chamber-specific cardiomyocytes in the context of congenital heart diseases as well as for the development of novel hiPSC differentiation protocols for generating both left and right ventricular cardiomyocytes. Moreover, by generating a scRNA-seq dataset profiling multiple consecutive days of hiPSC cardiac differentiation we provide here a reference atlas of the differentiation events that occur during human in vitro cardiac development. Together, our study provides extensive evidence of the identification of the FHF lineage in a human system and reveals the early bifurcation of this lineage into an epicardial and myocardial lineage.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell lines</title><p>hiPSC lines used in this study were obtained from the Stanford Cardiovascular Institute Biobank (SCVI-111, Sendai virus reprogrammed peripheral blood mononuclear cells, healthy male with normal karyotype, 46, XY).

Passaging was conducted with gentile dissociation of cell clusters and plated in E8 media supplemented 10 ÂµM ROCK inhibitor (Selleckchem Cat. S1049). Passaging was performed using a 1:12 splitting ratio to achieve approximately 10,000 cells per cm<sup>2</sup>. 24 hr after passaging media was changed to E8 media.

We subsequently conducted nucleofection of the dissociated cells using the Lonza P3 Primary Cell 4D-Nucleofector X Kit L. A transfection mix was prepared to contain the Lonza P3 Solution, Supplement, single guide RNA/Cas9 expressing plasmid (1 Âµg), and the donor template plasmid (3 Âµg). Single Guide RNA sequences are found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata2">Figure 1âsource data 2</xref>.

Cells were allowed to rest for 10 min after which they were plated onto two wells of a six-well plate. 24 hr after plating, the media was changed to regular E8 media, and regular maintenance until cells reach 50% confluency. At the 50% confluency mark, cells were dissociated into single-cell suspensions and passaged onto six-well plates at 1000 cells per well of six-well. We subsequently maintained the transfected hiPSCs in E8 media supplemented with appropriate antibiotics for the selection of successfully targeted cells.

Cells were subsequently, washed three times for 5 min in 1 X PBS. The PBS was gently aspirated from cells and cells were incubated in a blocking solution composed of 1% Bovine Serum Albumin (Sigma Cat. A7906), 0.1% Triton-X100 (Sigma Cat. T8787) in PBS, and 1% Goat serum (Sigma Cat. 9023), for 1 hr at room temperature. After blocking, mouse anti-OCT4 (2 Âµg/mL), mouse anti-Nanog (1:100 dilution), or mouse anti-Tra-1-8-1 (5 Âµg/mL) antibodies were diluted in the blocking solution. Cells were incubated in primary antibody solution overnight at 4Â°C. The next day, the primary antibody was aspirated, and cells were washed three times in wash buffer (0.1% Tween-20 in PBS) for 5 min each.

On the day of timepoint collection, cells were dissociated into single-cell suspensions by incubating in 10 X TrypLE Select (Thermo Fisher Cat. A1217701) for 5 min at 37Â°C. For later-stage cardiomyocytes (day 15 and onwards) incubation time was extended to 10 min to achieve single-cell dissociation. Cells were subsequently pelleted by centrifugation at 200 g for 5 min. Cell pellets were resuspended in 4% PFA for 10 min and were rinsed with a 5% KnockOut Serum Replacement (Thermo Fisher Cat. 10828028) solution in 1 x PBS. Cells were permeabilized in a 0.5% Saponin (Sigma Cat. S7900) solution containing 5% FBS in 1 X PBS (hereafter referred to as Saponin Solution). After permeabilization cells were incubated for 45 min in a monoclonal mouse anti-Troponin primary antibody (Thermo Fisher Cat. MA5-12960) at a 1:200 dilution in 0.5% saponin solution. Cells were rinsed twice in saponin solution and then incubated in secondary antibody AlexaFluor 647 goat anti-mouse (Thermo Fisher Cat. A32728) at a 1:1000 dilution in 0.5% saponin solution. Cells were subsequently rinsed in 1 x PBS twice and analyzed using CytoFLEX flow cytometer.</p><p>For sorting of TurboGFP+ and TurboGFP- day 15 cardiomyocytes, independent biological replicates consisting of independent differentiations were sorted using a FACSAria Fusion. Cells were dissociated using TRYPLE Select (Thermo Fisher Cat. A1217701) incubation for 5 min to ensure cells were fully dissociated. After single-cell suspensions were obtained, TRYPLE Select was neutralized with an equal volume of replating media consisting of 10% Knockout Serum Replacement, 2% B27 Plus Insulin Supplement, and RPMI-1640 with glucose. Cells were centrifuged at 200 g for 5 min and pellets were resuspended in 1 mL of replating media. Sorting was done into 10 mL falcon tubes containing replating media. After sorting, cells were centrifuged at 200 g for 5 min and lysed for RNA collection using Trizol Reagent (Thermo Fisher Cat. 15596026). RNA extraction was done using the Zymo DIRECT-Zol extraction kit (Zymo Research Cat. R2052) per manufacturerâs protocol. Quantitative RT-PCR was done as described below.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>RNA extraction and quantitative RT-PCR</title><p>Cells were collected for RNA extraction by dissociation with 10 X TrypLE Select and pelleted as described in the flow cytometry section.

Cells were gently dissociated by repeated pipetting. For later timepoints (Days 15 and 30), we extended the TRYPLE Select (Thermo Fisher Cat. A1217701) incubation by 5 min to ensure cells were fully dissociated. After single-cell suspensions were obtained, TRYPLE Select was neutralized with an equal volume of replating media consisting of 10% Knockout Serum Replacement, 2% B27 Plus Insulin Supplement, and RPMI-1640 with glucose. Cells were centrifuged at 200 g for 5 min to obtain cell pellets. For days 0â6, we resuspended cells in BamBanker freezing medium (GC LTEC Cat. 302â14681) and control rate freezed vials of cells at each timepoint collected to obtain 2 million cells per freezing vial. For days 7 onwards, we froze down cells in a cardiomyocyte freezing medium consisting of 90% Knockout Serum Replacement and 10% cell culture grade DMSO (Sigma Cat. D2650).</p><p>For running the scRNA-seq experiment, we thawed the desired timepoints for each experimental run by thawing vials of cells at 37 Â°C and adding replating media dropwise to each vial. Cells were then centrifuged at 200 g for 5 min to obtain cell pellets. We conducted two washes in sterile 1 X DPBS for each sample to wash away any remaining Knockout Serum that could interfere with the chemically modified-oligonucleotide (CMO) staining. Using the 10 X Genomics CellPlex kit, we added 100 ÂµL of CMO to each cell pellet and resuspended the cells to allow the lipid-conjugated oligonucleotides to bind to each of our samples. Each CellPlex CMO consists of a unique barcode that is used for identifying individual samples that are run within a single channel of a 10 X Genomics ship. After incubating for 5 min, 1000 ÂµL of sterile 1 X DPBS was added to each sample, and all samples were centrifuged for 5 min at 200 g. Cells were transferred to 5 mL Eppendorf which allowed for two more 1 x DPBS washes with a total of 5 mL DPBS for each sample. Washing of unbound CMO was critical to ensuring minimal cross-contamination of CMOs when combining samples. After washing, we proceeded to follow the 10 X Genomics 3â 3.1 with CellPlex protocol for cell capture and combined samples as listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata4">Figure 4âsource data 4</xref>. We aimed to capture a total of 30,000 cells per well of a 10 X Genomics GEM Chip. After cell capture, we proceeded with preparing gene expression libraries and CellPlex libraries by following the 10 X Genomic manufacturerâs protocol. Libraries were sequenced using an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 with S4 v1.5 flowcell reagents. We sequenced the gene expression libraries at a depth of 25,000 paired-end reads per cell and the CellPlex libraries at 5000 paired-end reads per cell. Base calling during sequencing was performed using Real-Time Analysis Version 3 software.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Bioinformatic analysis of hiPSC scRNA-seq time course</title><p>Raw FASTQ files were obtained for gene expression and CellPlex libraries and were aligned using CellRanger-6.0.0 using the count function. We aligned the gene expression libraries to the prebuilt GRCh38 Human genome reference provided by 10 X Genomics at: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-gene-expression/software/downloads/latest">https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-gene-expression/software/downloads/latest</ext-link>. We aligned the CellPlex libraries using a list of CMO barcodes as a reference as found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata4">Figure 4âsource data 4</xref>. After alignment, we obtained gene-by-cell expression matrices containing individual counts for each gene detected for each individual cell captured. We also obtained matrices containing the counts for each CMO detected per cell.</p><p>Gene expression matrices for each single-cell run were corrected for ambient RNA contamination using the SoupX package v1.5.2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Young and Behjati, 2020</xref>), which detects levels of ambient RNA contamination using empty droplets processed during the single-cell capture. Following ambient RNA correction, we then imported the CMO expression matrix into the Seurat R package version 4.1.0 and conducted log-ratio normalization using the NormalizeData function. To demultiplex each sample according to the CMO used for labeling, we ran the HTODemux function using default parameters. This function assigns cell labels according to the amount of CMO counts detected per cell. It also identifies cells that can be classified as singlets, doublets, or negative (did not stain for any of the CMO labels).</p><p>After sample demultiplexing, we removed doublet and negative cells from the dataset as part of our quality control pipeline. We then calculated the percent of all RNA counts belonging to ribosomal and mitochondrial genes. To further remove low-quality, dead, or doublet cells, we calculated the median percentage of mitochondrial and ribosomal RNA counts detected as well as the total RNA counts per cell and genes detected per cell. We calculated an upper and lower cutoff for the elimination of low-quality cells by calculating the threshold at three times the median absolute deviation above and below the median value of each of these quality control metrics. Cells above and below these cutoffs were eliminated and the cells passing quality control were used for subsequent analyses.</p><p>After quality control analyses, we proceeded to merge data from all three single-cell runs conducted. We normalized RNA counts per cell using the NormalizeData function in Seurat and using default parameters. We then proceeded to integrate the three single-cell runs by using the mutual nearest neighbor batch correction algorithm and using the individual as the batch correction variable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Haghverdi et al., 2018</xref>). This was done in order to correct for the technical variation that occurs from running single-cell samples in individual capture runs. To conduct the batch correction, we first identified a common set of integration features across the three runs integrated by running the SelectIntegrationFeatures function in Seurat. After identifying highly variable features commonly found between the datasets, we further filtered these features by removing features associated with the cell cycle in order to remove the effect of the cell cycle from downstream analyses and clustering. We then ran the RunFastMNN function from the SeuratWrappers version 0.3.0 package. After integration, we then proceeded with constructing the nearest neighbors graph by using the FindNeighbors function and used 15 principal components that were identified using the ElbowPlot method in Seurat. We then proceeded to conduct non-linear dimensionality reduction by running the RunUMAP function using 15 principal components. Lastly, we conducted unsupervised clustering using the FindClusters function. We then conducted differential gene expression analysis to annotate clusters based on literature-reported cell markers.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Lineage trajectory analysis using STREAM</title><p>To conduct lineage trajectory analysis of hiPSC cardiac differentiations, we imported our integrated Seurat object into an AnnData object using ScanPy v1.8.2 package in Python (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Wolf et al., 2018</xref>). After obtaining an AnnData object, we then fit a principal graph to the UMAP plot calculated using Seurat using the seed_elastic_principal_graph and elastic_principal_graph functions in STREAM version 1.1. In addition to fitting the principal graphs, we also calculated STREAM pseudotime and ordered cells along this pseudotime using the principal graph calculation functions. After calculating pseudotime, we projected cells across distinct differentiation trajectories using the plot_flat_tree function and also plotted cells in a subway plot using plot_stream_sc. These functions allow for the visualization of cellular differentiation along distinct differentiation paths identified by the STREAM algorithm and for downstream identification of gene markers that are expressed during each trajectory identified. After obtaining distinct differentiation trajectory branches across pseudotime, we calculated the top differentially expressed genes across each major branch identified by STREAM by using the detect_transition_markers function.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Comparison of hiPSC and murine cardiac development scRNA-seq</title><p>To compare our hiPSC differentiation scRNA-seq data with murine data, we downloaded data from the GEO database from three previously published datasets. We extracted cells of interest from these datasets representing nascent mesoderm, heart field progenitors, left and right ventricular cardiomyocytes, outflow tract cardiomyocytes, and epicardial cells. In order to jointly plot these cells across multiple different datasets, we used the Fast Mutual Nearest Neighbor algorithm and integrated the cells for each dataset together. We then proceeded to construct the shared nearest neighbor graph and conduct dimensionality reduction using the RunUMAP function by using the corrected principal components derived using the FastMNN algorithm.</p><p>To analyze the development of FHF and aSHF differentiation lineages, respectively, we subsetted cells that are known from the literature to fall along each lineage. For example, for the FHF differentiation trajectory, we reclustered cells identified as FHF Progenitors, epicardial cells, and left ventricular cardiomyocytes. For the anterior second heart field, we clustered SHF progenitors along with right ventricular and outflow tract cardiomyocytes. After subsetting the cells, we reran the FastMNN algorithm to recalculate the corrected PCA space for the subsetted cells and continued with deriving UMAP plots. These plots were then used to calculate principal graphs using STREAM and to identify the differentiation lineages that arise during the progenitorâs differentiation trajectories. STREAM then allowed for the plotting of STREAM plots along the differentiation trajectories identified, where we probed for the expression of well-established FHF and aSHF genes. These genes were also evaluated using the human iPSC cardiac differentiations using STREAM plots.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>scRNA-seq Comparison of 2D and previously published 3D hiPSC Cardiac Differentiation</title><p>To compare our 2D hiPSC cardiac differentiations to a previously published cardiac organoid protocol, we downloaded data from Drakhlis et al., from GSE150202 and subsetted the dataset for putative cardiomyocytes and cardiac progenitors. The Drakhlis et al., dataset was generated from two individual heart-forming organoids, therefore, to correct for the batch effect from these two independent organoids, we ran the FastMNN algorithm to conduct dimensionality reduction using the FindNeighbors and RunUMAP functions of Seurat. Moreover, we conducted unsupervised clustering of the Drakhlis et al., dataset where we identified major clusters of cardiac progenitors and cardiomyocytes. To compare between our hiPSC 2D data and the Drakhlis et al., data, we plotted the expression of multiple FHF and SHF markers using features plots. Moreover, we focused on the myocardial lineage on our hiPSC 2D differentiations to conduct a direct comparison of the cardiomyocyte differentiation lineages in the datasets.</p><p>To conduct unsupervised clustering of both the Drakhlis et al., cardiomyocytes and those from our 2D differentiations, we merged only the cardiomyocytes from the datasets and batch corrected using FastMNN. We subsequently conducted dimensionality reduction using FindNeighbors and RunUMAP in Seurat and conducted unsupervised clustering of the cardiomyocyte populations. We then conducted differential gene expression analysis by using the FindMarkers function in Seurat and compared the expression of the putative outflow tract cluster with the rest of the cardiomyocyte clusters. We then plotted a volcano plot using the EnhancedVolcano package which allowed for the visualization of statistically significant upregulated and downregulated markers in the OFT cluster relative to the other cardiomyocyte populations. Adjusted p-values for the differential expression analysis were calculated using Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Statistics</title><p>For studies conducted in this manuscript, biological replicates were defined as independently conducted differentiations where hiPSCs were independently plated and carried through our standard differentiation protocol. Samples were collected at distinct timepoints for the respective experiment. For quantitative PCR data, for each biological replicate, we ran each gene for each timepoint in technical duplicates, and the average cycle threshold value for each technical replicate was taken for downstream analysis using the delta-delta-Ct method.</p><p>Data presented in bar graphs for flow cytometry and RT-qPCR are presented as a mean Â± standard error of the mean. Two-way ANOVA was conducted for statistical analysis of flow cytometry data with the first independent variable analyzed being time and the second variable being cell line. One-way ANOVA with Dunnetâs multiple comparisons correction was conducted for statistical analysis of RT-qPCR data. For flow cytometry data, outliers were removed based on the percentage of cardiac troponin-expressing cells using the ROUT method for outlier detection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Motulsky and Brown, 2006</xref>).</p><p>For differential gene expression analysis of single-cell data, we ran FindMarkers or FindAllMarkers function in Seurat which allows for the evaluation of differentially expressed genes between cell populations of interest. For each gene evaluated, the log base 2 of the fold change between the population of interest and the comparator population was calculated along with the adjusted p-values based on Bonferroni correction using all the genes in the dataset.</p><p>To identify the differential expression of genes along distinct differentiation branches during the STREAM analysis, we conducted the leaf gene detection which involves calculating the average gene expression of genes along the leaves of the developmental trajectory. Detailed explanations for the statistical calculations conducted by the STREAM package to find differentially expressed genes along differentiation branches can be found in the original STREAM publication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2019</xref>).</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Writing â original draft, Project administration, Writing â review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Conceptualization, Methodology, Writing â review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Conceptualization, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Conceptualization</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Writing â review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con11"><p>Conceptualization, Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con12"><p>Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con13"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Data curation, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Writing â original draft, Project administration, Writing â review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media xlink:href="elife-80075-mdarchecklist1-v2.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>All raw data for single cell RNA-sequencing has been deposited in the GEO repository under accession number GSE202398.

If there is, an explanation of the data of this manuscript would be different.

How are Tbx5 and Hand1 labeling FHF different in the differentiation axis (in vitro and in vivo)?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this question regarding the in vivo differences in the expression of Tbx5 and Hand1. Previous studies have shown that HAND1 and TBX5 are expressed in the cardiac crescent in the FHF progenitor domain during murine development. Moreover, HAND1 has been shown to be expressed in early mesodermal precursors that consist of the first wave of cardiac progenitors to exit the primitive streak. In studies conducted by Lescroart et al. (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25150979/), single cell RNA sequencing analysis of Mesp1+ mesodermal progenitors reveal that even prior to the formation of the cardiac crescent, early late Mesp1+ mesodermal progenitors already express FHF markers such as HAND1. Lineage tracing studies have also shown that HAND1 progeny labels both the left ventricle and some cells in the outflow tract (due to late expression of HAND1 in outflow tract precursors) (Barnes et al. <italic>Dev Dyn</italic> 2010: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20882677/). More recently, studies have shown that a subpopulation of the FHF is HAND1+ and TBX5- and contributes to the expression of the epicardium and left ventricle which we similarly observe in our hiPSC scRNA-seq data where a HAND1+ early cardiac progenitor contributes to both the epicardial and myocardial cells (Tyser et al. <italic>Science</italic> 2020: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33414188/; Zhang et al. <italic>Circulation Research</italic> 2021: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34162224/).</p><p>On the other hand, TBX5 has been noted to be expressed in the FHF and is expressed specifically in the LV and atria during the looping and chamber morphogenesis stages between E8.25-E11.5 of murine development (Bruneau et al. <italic>Development</italic> 1999: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10373308/). In addition lineage tracing of TBX5 by tamoxifen injection at e6.5 and e7.5 of TBX5-CreERT2;R26-LacZ and TBX5-CreERT2;R26-mTmG mouse development, respectively, show no labeling in the RV or outflow tract (Devine et al., <italic>eLife</italic> 2014)(https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25296024/), unlike HAND1 expression in outflow tract during late development (Barnes et al. <italic>Dev Dyn</italic> 2010: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20882677/). In our in vitro scRNA-seq data, we observe that the earliest cardiac progenitors that arise from the mesoderm express HAND1, consistent with in vivo reports of early patterning of the mesoderm to the FHF fate (Lescroart et al. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25150979/). Our scRNA-seq data further shows that an early HAND1+ cardiac progenitor population that differentiates into WT1+ epicardial-like cells and TBX5+ LV-cardiomyocytes.</p><p>With respect to our qPCR data in Figure 2B showing a slightly different pattern of HAND1 expression, we would like to clarify that while the SCVI line shows a downregulation of HAND1 at Day 15, 20, and 30, the fold change expression is 31432-fold, 82784-fold, and 41964-fold greater than Day 0, indicating that HAND1 continues to be highly expressed in the SCVI line at later timepoints during differentiation. We have added an additional marker on the Y axis of the graph to better demonstrate this on the plotting of the data. While we do not know exactly why the expression trend of HAND1 differs between the two hiPSC lines, we are encouraged by the fact that the qPCR data and the scRNA-seq data on HAND1 expression correlates nicely with one another and precedes the onset of TBX5 expression at Day 7. Thus, the dynamics of HAND1 expression and TBX5 expression appear consistent with those observed in mice in vivo.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

How is the morphology of differentiated cells at different time points, beating/contractility, etc. in comparison to Tbx5- population. It would be a strongly supportive evidence to show Tbx5+ and Tbx5- lineage cells beating at clearly different ventricular vs. atrial contractility.</p></disp-quote><p>Using our scRNA-seq data of hiPSC cardiac differentiation we assessed the expression of well-known atrial (KCNA5, NR2F1, and VSNL1) and ventricular markers (IRX4, MYH7, and MYL2) showing that essentially no atrial gene expression is present in our hiPSC-CM population (Figure 4âfigure supplement 7). This is consistent with our prior finding that our small molecule WNT modulation protocol generate entirely ventricular cardiomyocytes (Galdos et al., Nature Comm 2022) (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36071107/). Our ventricular MYL2-tdTomato reporter also demonstrates a gradual upregulation of tdTomato expression from Day 15 onwards with hiPSC-CM maturation (Figure 2) leading to &gt;95% of the tdTomato+ ventricular cardiomyoytes also being TurboGFP+. Given this observation, the rare GFP- cells are likely immature FHF progenitors that have yet reach the stage of TBX5 expression rather than being atrial or RV cardiomyocytes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. In addition to TNNT2, have the authors detected any myocyte maturation markers such as MYH6/MYH7, and Actinin to show myocyte fully differentiated into maturity?</p></disp-quote><p>We have added an additional time course analysis of MYH7 in addition to the ventricular-specific marker MYL2 (Figure 3). Previous literature has shown that MYL2 and MYH7 are both upregulated during the course of cardiomyocyte maturation. We show that both MYL2 and MYH7 progressively increase in their expression in our hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>A key concern of this study is the specificity of Tbx5 expression during early embryonic development.

By combining four large publicly available scRNAseq datasets of mouse development from epiblast and primitive streak to four-chambered heart at embryonic day 16.5 our recent study showed that TBX5 is expressed only in FHF and posterior SHF (i.e. atrial cardiomyocyte) progenitor cells at embryonic days 6.5 to 7.5 and LV and septal cardiomyocytes at embryonic days 9.25 to 10.5 (Galdos et al., Nature Comm 2022) (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36071107/). Importantly, no transient TBX5 expression in mesodermal or anterior SHF (i.e. RV cardiomyocyte) progenitor cells was found. Consistent with this, lineage tracing studies using TBX5-CreERT2 pulsed with tamoxifen at e6.5 and at e7.5 also showed no expression in RV or outflow tract (Devine et al., <italic>eLife</italic> 2014)( https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25296024/). In this study we also observed no TBX5 expression prior to FHF progenitor cell in during hiPSC differentiation (Figure 5D) thus the only other TBX5-lineaged cardiomyocytes besides LV cardiomyocytes are atrial cardiomyocytes (i.e. FHF and posterior SHF descendants) which we did not observe in any of our scRNAseq data (Figure 4âfigure supplement 6).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors detected a significant number of ISL1/TBX1/FGF8 cells at Days 3-7 (FIGURE 3). What is the exact ratio of these cells?? Why don't these cells become cardiomyocytes? Or can only a small portion of these cells eventually become cardiomyocytes?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this excellent question. It is important to note that while ISL1, TBX1, and FGF8 expression are present at Days 3-7 of hiPSC differentiation by bulk RT-qPCR, this should not be interpreted as the presence of a single cell that is simultaneously expressing all three markers as would be expected for a SHF progenitor cell. To address the potential presence of a ISL1/TBX1/FGF8 triple positive cell using our scRNAseq data from hiPSC differentiations we plotted the expression of ISL1, TBX1, and FGF8 on an individual cell basis to determine whether any cell at any point during the entire developmental time-course demonstrate expression of all three genes (see Figure 4âfigure supplement 6). Our scRNAseq data shows that during Days 3 to 7 of differentiation ISL1 is expressed in late mesoderm to early cardiac progenitor cells which is consistent with previous studies (Ma et al. <italic>Dev Bio</italic> 2008: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18775691/). In addition, ISL1 is also expressed in endodermal cells on Day 3-7 which is consistent with the ISL1 expression noted in our qPCR data (Figure 3). Consistent with our qPCR data, the TBX1 expression in scRNA-seq data is generally quite low with only scattered expression among pluripotent cells, endodermal cells, few mesodermal cells, and cardiac and epicardial progenitors Figure 4âfigure supplement 6 The expression of FGF8 in our scRNA-seq data overlaps with ISL1 in mesoderm and in cardiac progenitor cells but minimally overlaps with TBX1 expression. These double ISL1/FGF8 positive cells are likely FHF cardiac progenitors expressing low level of ISL1 and FGF8 rather than SHF cardiac progenitors since these cells also express TBX5 but not TBX1 (Figure 4âfigure supplement 6). It is important to note that the expression level of ISL/TBX1/FGF8 are generally very low (less than 10 to 1000-fold) compare with the expression of HAND1 and TBX5 that range from 1000 to 100,000-fold greater than pluripotent stem cells at Day 0. We have added additional text to the manuscript clarifying this point in lines 227-230. Take all together, we believe the there are few if any triple positive ISL1/TBX1/FGF8 cells and the ISL1/FGF8 double positive cells are predominantly FHF progenitor cells that eventually become LV cardiomyocytes.</p><p>We also note that unlike what was observed in the 3D organoid platform (Figure 6E) where we could see a clear differentiation trajectory from TBX1+ SHF progenitor cells to OFT-like cells we do not observe this in our 2D monolayer differentiation (see Figure 6F).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1.
