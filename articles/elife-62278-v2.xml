a controlled before-and-after trial to evaluate the impact of an onsite urban sanitation intervention on the prevalence of enteric infection, soil transmitted helminth re-infection, and diarrhea among children in Maputo, Mozambique. A non-governmental organization replaced existing poor-quality latrines with pour-flush toilets with septic tanks serving household clusters. We enrolled children aged 1-48 months at baseline and measured outcomes before and 12 and 24 months after the intervention, with concurrent measurement among children in a comparable control arm. Despite nearly exclusive use, we found no evidence that intervention affected the prevalence of any measured outcome after 12 or 24 months of exposure. Among children born into study sites after intervention, we observed a reduced prevalence of <italic>Trichuris</italic> and <italic>Shigella</italic> infection relative to the same age group at baseline (&lt;2 years old). Protection from birth may be important to reduce exposure to and infection with enteric pathogens in this setting.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research
