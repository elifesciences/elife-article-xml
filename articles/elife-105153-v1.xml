issue, results from complex bacterial interactions. In response to harmful stimuli, a desirable outcome for the tooth is the formation of tertiary dentin, a protective reparative process that generates new hard tissue. This reparative dentinogenesis is associated with significant inflammation, which triggers the recruitment and differentiation of dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs). Previously, we have demonstrated that brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and its receptor tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB), key mediators of neural functions, are activated during the DPSC-mediated dentin regeneration process. In this study, we further define the role of inflammation in this process and apply stem cell engineering to enhance dentin regeneration in injured teeth. Our data show that TrkB expression and activation in DPSCs rapidly increase during odontogenic differentiation, further amplified by inflammatory inducers and mediators such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα), lymphotoxin-alpha, and lipopolysaccharide. An in vivo dentin formation assessment was conducted using a mouse pulp-capping/caries model, where Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats-engineered DPSCs overexpressing BDNF were transplanted into inflamed pulp tissue. This transplantation significantly enhanced dentin regeneration in injured teeth. To further explore potential downstream pathways, we conducted transcriptomic profiling of TNFα-treated DPSCs, both with and without TrkB antagonist cyclotraxin-B. The results revealed significant changes in gene expression related to immune response, cytokine signaling, and extracellular matrix interactions. Taken together, our study advances our understanding of the role of BDNF in dental tissue engineering using DPSCs and identifies potential therapeutic avenues for improving dental tissue repair and regeneration strategies.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>human stem cell</kwd><kwd>mouse transplantation</kwd><kwd>stem cell engineering</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000072</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 DE029816</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chung</surname><given-names>Seung</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Brain-derived neurotrophic factor/tropomyosin receptor kinase B signaling in promoting the differentiation and dentin-repair capacity of dental stem cells under inflammatory conditions offers a potential clinical strategy for repairing damaged teeth.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Dental caries, commonly known as tooth decay, remains one of the most prevalent chronic diseases, affecting a significant portion of the global population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Peres et al., 2019</xref>). This condition results from the complex interplay between bacterial biofilms, dietary sugars, and host factors, leading to the demineralization of tooth enamel and dentin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bowen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mosaddad et al., 2019</xref>). In recent years, there has been growing interest in the role of dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs) in regenerative dentistry due to their ability to differentiate into dentin-forming odontoblast-like cells and their potential in tooth repair and regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Potdar and Jethmalani, 2015</xref>). It is widely recognized that the regeneration of the dental-pulp complex is closely associated with inflammation, especially since dental caries and the subsequent regenerative processes take place within an inflammatory environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Galler et al., 2021</xref>). Inflammation serves as a vital biological response for ensuring host survival in the face of infection and tissue injury, playing a crucial role in maintaining normal tissue homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Peiseler and Kubes, 2018</xref>). It is generally accepted that the regeneration of the injured tooth is closely tied to inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lin and Rosenberg, 2011</xref>). Specifically, it plays a pivotal role in the regeneration of injured dental tissues by stimulating the recruitment, proliferation, and differentiation of pulp progenitor cells and odontoblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Nakashima et al., 2013</xref>). However, an imbalance between inflammation and repair can lead to irreversible tissue damage. While inflammation is recognized as necessary for proficient tissue regeneration, only a few studies have explored its role in dentin regeneration.</p><p>The brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and its receptor, tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB), constitute a critical signaling pathway involved in the survival, development, and function of neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ferrer et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Huang and Reichardt, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>). Emerging evidence suggests that the BDNF-TrkB pathway also plays a significant role in the inflammatory response and tissue repair processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cappoli et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hang et al., 2021</xref>). The overexpression of BDNF in DPSCs has been shown to enhance their regenerative capabilities, which may be particularly beneficial in the context of dental caries where inflammation and tissue damage are prominent. Indeed, our previous study demonstrated the critical role of BDNF/TrkB in the DPSC odontoblastic differentiation under inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kim et al., 2025</xref>). Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα)-stimulated BDNF/TrkB showed an enhanced odontoblast differentiation of DPSCs.</p><p>Although the general principles for successful BDNF-induced regeneration have been proposed, achieving clinical success remains challenging. One significant obstacle is the clinical application of BDNF itself as the recombinant protein has an extremely short half-life, which greatly diminishes its effectiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Miranda-Lourenço et al., 2020</xref>). Therefore, establishing a stable and continuous BDNF production platform is essential, and stem cell engineering could potentially address this critical need in the future. Considering the essential role of BDNF/TrkB signaling activation in the inflammatory dentinogenesis observed in cell culture conditions, there is a strong case for validating BDNF/TrkB data in vivo. In this study, we further explore the role of various inflammatory agents in modulating BDNF receptor, TrkB, as well as the potential therapeutic applications of BDNF overexpression in DPSCs using Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) technology for treating dental caries. By uncovering the mechanisms through which the BDNF-TrkB pathway affects DPSC function and inflammation, we aim to offer insights into innovative regenerative strategies that could enhance dental health outcomes.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Chemicals and reagents</title><p>Human DPSCs were purchased from Lonza, Pharma &amp; Biotech (Cat# PT-5025).

For the preparation of transfection solutions, 2 µg of plasmid DNA was diluted in Plasmid Transfection Medium (sc-108062) to a final volume of 150 µL (Solution A) and mixed and incubated for 5 min at RT. In parallel, 10 µL of UltraCruz Transfection Reagent (sc-395739) was diluted in Plasmid Transfection Medium (sc-108062) to a final volume of 150 µL (Solution B) and incubated for 5 min at RT. Solutions A and B were then combined by vortexing immediately and incubated for 20 min at RT. For the transfection procedure, the cell culture medium was replaced with a fresh antibiotic-free growth medium, and 300 µL of the Plasmid DNA/UltraCruz Transfection Reagent Complex was added to each well. Details regarding BDNF CRISPR Activation Plasmid (h) protocol are as follows: BDNF CRISPR Activation Plasmid (h) is a synergistic activation mediator (SAM) transcription activation system designed to upregulate gene expression specifically. BDNF CRISPR Activation Plasmid (h) consists of three plasmids at a 1:1:1 mass ratio: a plasmid encoding the deactivated Cas9 (dCas9) nuclease (D10A and N863A) fused to the transactivation domain VP64, and a blasticidin resistance gene; a plasmid encoding the MS2-p65-HSF1 fusion protein, and a hygromycin resistance gene; a plasmid encoding a target-specific 20 nt guide RNA fused to two MS2 RNA aptamers, and a puromycin resistance gene. The resulting SAM complex binds to a site-specific region approximately 200–250 nt upstream of the transcriptional start site and provides robust recruitment of transcription factors for highly efficient gene activation. The cells were incubated for 48 h under standard culture conditions. Protein analysis was conducted to confirm overexpression. Following transfection, WB assayed gene activation efficiency by using pro-BDNF antibody (5H8): sc-65514.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Western blot</title><p>To verify BDNF activation using CRISPR plasmid, cell lysates were prepared using RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris pH 7.6, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X100, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) containing protease inhibitor (Roche, Indianapolis, IN, USA) and protein was measured using BCA method (Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Lenexa, KS, USA). Equal amounts of protein (35 μg) were loaded and separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred onto nitrocellulose (Bio-Rad, CA, USA).

This method capitalizes on the polyadenylated (poly-A) tails present at the 3' ends of eukaryotic mRNA molecules. DPSCs underwent a 10-day differentiation protocol with or without specific treatments. Post-differentiation, total RNA was extracted from the odontogenic differentiated DPSCs for sample preparation. LC Biosciences conducted rigorous assessments to evaluate the extracted RNA’s quantity and quality, followed by poly-A selection to enrich for mRNA transcripts. Subsequent cDNA synthesis facilitated library preparation, paving the way for high-throughput sequencing to explore the transcriptomic landscape in depth.

Therefore, comparing TrkA and TrkB is essential to elucidate neurotrophin-specific effects in a given experimental model.

Our findings demonstrate the activation of TrkB during the caries process. Consistent with this, our in vitro data confirmed that various inflammatory mediators increase TrkB expression and activation in DPSCs. These findings suggest that BDNF/TrkB directly affects the pulpal response to caries. In vivo, TrkB is more highly expressed in inflamed pulp compared to normal tissue. The transplantation of CRISPR-engineered BDNF-overexpressing DPSCs in a pulp-capping mouse model significantly enhances dentin regeneration and repair, as demonstrated by increased dentin volume and improved tissue morphology. Furthermore, RNA sequencing reveals significant transcriptomic changes in TNFα-treated DPSCs, affecting cellular signaling and extracellular matrix pathways.

These results suggest that pro-inflammatory stimuli such as LPS, LTA, and TNFα can significantly enhance TrkB and p-TrkB expression in DPSCs.</p><p>Furthermore, our data demonstrate significant upregulation of TrkA and TrkB expressions in dentinogenic media in response to inflammatory components. TrkB expression was notably increased by LPS, LTA, TNFα, and C5a, suggesting widespread receptor activation. This upregulation may play a critical role in mediating the cellular responses to inflammation, potentially influencing the behavior of DPSCs in the context of dental pulp inflammation and regeneration. Particularly, TNFα induced the highest TrkB upregulation in both media types, emphasizing the role of TrkB in mediating responses to neurotrophic factors and involvement in inflammatory pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Irfan et al., 2022a</xref>). The differential expression in dentinogenic media indicates enhanced receptor sensitivity and signaling in an inflammatory environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>). A dose-dependent increase in TrkB expression was observed with escalating TNFα concentrations, with significant upregulation at 10 ng/mL, beyond which further increases in TNFα did not enhance expression. This suggests that higher doses are unnecessary to avoid inflammation related to degeneration or infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kim et al., 2023b</xref>). The time-dependent response to a fixed TNFα concentration showed a peak at day 7, indicating that a minimum of 7 days of differentiation is necessary for culturing DPSCs in inflammatory responses related to TrkB expression. In vivo, TrkB expression was significantly higher in the inflamed pulp tissue of carious teeth, indicating that TrkB may play a critical role in the response to dental caries and pulp inflammation. This suggests that BDNF-TrkB signaling could be crucial in the neurogenic and angiogenic processes involved in pulp tissue repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bar et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">de Moraes et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>The transplantation of CRISPR-engineered BDNF-overexpressing DPSCs has demonstrated promising results in enhancing dentin regeneration in a pulp-capping mouse model. Micro-CT images and H&amp;E staining analyses indicate that the overexpression of BDNF via CRISPR engineering significantly promotes dentin repair at the injury site. BDNF is known for its role in molecular and physiological involvement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lu et al., 2014</xref>). Its application in dental tissue engineering suggests it may also play a crucial role in odontogenesis and dentinogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kim et al., 2023b</xref>). The significant increase in dentin volume in the micro-CT experiment observed in this study supports the hypothesis that BDNF can enhance the regenerative capabilities of DPSCs, leading to improved outcomes in dentin repair. Enhanced dentinogenesis was evidenced by the well-organized and structurally similar new dentin formation in the transplantation group compared to the native dentin structure. The histological analysis with H&amp;E staining further verified these findings, showing a marked improvement in dentin formation and reduced inflammation in the BDNF-DPSC transplantation group compared to the control group. This suggests that BDNF enhances dentin regeneration, creating a conducive environment for tissue repair. Several potential mechanisms could explain that BDNF may enhance the proliferation and differentiation of DPSCs into odontoblast-like cells, promoting reparative dentin formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Tsutsui, 2020</xref>). Moreover, the neurotrophic properties of BDNF could support the survival and function of sensory nerve fibers within the pulp, which may play a role in regulating the repair process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bathina and Das, 2015</xref>).</p><p>In vitro experiments with DPSCs further supported these findings, demonstrating that TrkB expression is significantly upregulated in response to TNFα treatment. This suggests that inflammation enhances the neurogenic potential of DPSCs through TrkB signaling. The co-expression of TrkB in both carious teeth and DPSCs highlights the potential of targeting the BDNF-TrkB pathway in dental regenerative therapies. Modulating the inflammatory environment to enhance TrkB signaling could improve the regenerative properties of DPSCs, offering promising strategies for managing dental caries and pulpitis. The combined treatment of TNFα and CTX-B elucidates the significant transcriptional reprogramming compared with the control. The volcano plots highlight a substantial number of DEGs, indicating upregulation and downregulation of gene expression compared to control. The GO enrichment analysis reveals that these DEGs are predominantly associated with biological processes such as extracellular matrix organization, inflammatory response, and cytokine-mediated signaling pathways. This is further supported by the GO term statistics, where notable terms like extracellular space and cartilage homeostasis are enriched, suggesting alterations in the cellular microenvironment and immune response.</p><p>Additionally, the pathway enrichment analysis identifies critical pathways such as TNF signaling, <italic>NF-κB</italic> signaling, and cytokine–cytokine receptor interaction, underscoring the crucial role of inflammatory signaling in the observed transcriptional changes. Finally, the gene expression analysis under TNFα+CTX-B treatment provides specific examples of genes with altered expression patterns, confirming the extensive impact of the treatment at the molecular level. These findings suggest that TNFα treatment mediated by the BDNF/TrkB pathway induces a complex network of transcriptional changes that modulate the extracellular matrix and inflammatory signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). We believe that several transcriptional factors are involved in BDNF/TrkB downstream signaling, especially the <italic>TCF</italic> family. Further studies are required to validate this interaction, leading to a smooth line between the stem cell therapy and engineering era. Also, it is necessary to investigate the long-term effects of BDNF overexpression on dentin regeneration and to explore the underlying mechanisms driving this enhanced repair process. Additionally, assessing the potential for clinical translation of this approach will be crucial in determining its viability as a therapeutic option for dental pulp injuries and related conditions.</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Proposed interaction of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)/tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB) downstream signaling to modulate odontoblastic differentiation in dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs).</title></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-105153-fig9-v1.tif"/></fig><p>The use of CRISPR-engineered BDNF-overexpressing DPSCs could offer a novel and effective approach for enhancing dentin repair and regeneration in cases of dental pulp injury and significant clinical implications for dental regenerative therapies.

We have addressed the concerns and comments point by point in detail and substantially revised the manuscript and Figures. We hope that the manuscript is acceptable in the current improvised version.</p><p>Detailed response to your comments/concerns is as follows:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(1) It remains unclear exactly how the cytokines tested affect BDNF/TrkB signaling. For example, in Figure 1C, TNF-alpha increases TrkB and phospho-TrkB immunoreactivity to the same degree, suggesting that the cytokine promotes TrkB abundance without stimulating pathways that activate TrkB, whereas in Figure 2D, TNF-alpha has little effect on the abundance of TrkB, while increasing phospho-TrkB, suggesting that it affects TrkB activation and not TrkB abundance.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your kind concern. Recently, we have demonstrated the effect and interaction of TNF-alpha and Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II on the regulation of the inflammatory hDPSCs dentino-differentiation via BDNF/TrkB receptor signaling using TrkB inhibitor (Ref. below, and Figure 9). Moreover, we agree with your concern, and we have re-analyzed our replicates and found a better trend and significant abundance of TrkB as well (please refer to revised Figure 2D).</p><p>Ref.: Kim, Ji Hyun, et al. (2025) &quot;Ca 2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II regulates the inflammatory hDPSCs dentino-differentiation via BDNF/TrkB receptor signaling.&quot; Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology 13: 1558736.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) I find the histological images in Figure 3 to be difficult to interpret. I would have imagined that DAPI nuclear stains would reveal the odontoblast layer, but this is not apparent. An adjacent section labeled with conventional histological stains would be helpful here. Others have described Stro-1 as a stem cell marker that is expressed on a minority of cells associated with vasculature in the dental pulp, but in the images in Figure 3, Stro-l label is essentially co-distributed with DAPI, in both control and injured teeth, indicating that it is expressed in nearly all cells. Although the authors state that the Stro-1-positive cells are associated with vasculature, but I see no evidence that is true.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your concern. STRO-1 is a mesenchymal stem cell marker also expressed in dental pulp stem cells; both populations are distributed in the pulp. DPSCs can contribute to tissue repair and regeneration in inflamed pulp by differentiating into odontoblasts and forming reparative dentin. Moreover, in the case of carious and inflamed pulp, they are disorganized depending on the extent of infection/injury. Our purpose here was to point out DPSCs presence, not vasculature, which will differentiate into odontoblasts in such a scenario. We have revised Figure 3 by adding magnified images and dotted lines to indicate the boundary between the pulp and dentin.</p><p>Ref. Volponi A. A., Pang Y., Sharpe P. T.

Firstly, nowhere in the paper do they describe the nature of the CRISPR plasmid they are transiently transfecting. Some published methods delete segments of the BDNF 3'-UTR while others use an inactivated Cas9 to position an active transactivator to sequences in the BDNF promoter. If it is the latter approach, transient transfection will yield transient increases in BDNF expression. Also, as BDNF employs multiple promoters, it would be helpful to know which promoter sequence is targeted, and finally, knowing the identity of the guide RNAs would allow assessment for the potential of off-target effects I am guessing that the investigators employ a commercially obtained system from Santa Cruz, but nowhere is this mentioned. Please provide this information.</p></disp-quote><p>Dear Reviewer, yes, you are right. We have used a commercially obtained system from Santa Cruz, i.e., BDNF CRISPR Activation Plasmid (h): sc-400029-ACT and UltraCruz Transfection Reagent (sc-395739), and they have been mentioned in Chemicals and Reagents section of Materials and Methods as follows.</p><p>“BDNF CRISPR Activation Plasmid (h) is a synergistic activation mediator (SAM) transcription activation system designed to upregulate gene expression specifically BDNF CRISPR Activation Plasmid (h) consists of three plasmids at a 1:1:1 mass ratio: a plasmid encoding the deactivated Cas9 (dCas9) nuclease (D10A and N863A) fused to the transactivation domain VP64, and a blasticidin resistance gene; a plasmid encoding the MS2-p65-HSF1 fusion protein, and a hygromycin resistance gene; a plasmid encoding a target-specific 20 nt guide RNA fused to two MS2 RNA aptamers, and a puromycin resistance gene.”</p><p>The resulting SAM complex binds to a site-specific region approximately 200-250 nt upstream of the transcriptional start site and provides robust recruitment of transcription factors for highly efficient gene activation</p><p>Following transfection, gene activation efficiency could be assayed by WB, IF, or IHC using antibody: pro-BDNF Antibody (5H8): sc-65514</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-105153-sa2-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Another question left unresolved is whether their approach elevated BDNF, proBDNF, or both. Their 28 kDa western blot band apparently represents proBDNF exclusively, with no mature BDNF apparent, yet only mature BDNF effectively activates TrkB receptors.

Cyclotraxin-B (CTX-B) is a TrkB antagonist (mentioned in the revised manuscript).

To date, I am unaware of any evidence that BDNF binds to TrkA to activate it. It is true that two receptors have been described in the literature, TrkB and p75 or NGFR, but the latter is not TrkA despite its name and capacity to bind NGF along with other neurotrophins. It is crucial for the authors to provide a reference stating that TrkA is a receptor for BDNF or, alternatively, to correct this paragraph.</p></disp-quote><p>Dear reviewer, we apologize for the inconvenience; it was an error. BDNF binds to TrkB, and the sentence has been corrected.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The authors discuss BDNF/TrkB in inflammation. Is there any possibility of p75 involvement in this process?</p></disp-quote><p>Mature BDNF binds to the high-affinity receptor tyrosine kinase B (TrkB), activating signaling cascades, while pro-BDNF binds to the p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR). So, we don’t think there’s a possibility, as our data shows mature BDNF production. Here, we initially screened the TrkA and TrkB involvement in dentinogenesis and chose to work with BDNF and its receptor TrkB. Future studies can be directed to elucidate its mechanism of action in the context of dentinogenesis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) The authors present immunofluorescence (IF) images against TrkB and pTrkB in the first figure. While they mention in the materials and methods section that these antibodies were generated for this study, there is no proof of their specificity. It should be noted that most commercial antibodies labeled as anti-TrkB recognize the extracellular domain of all TrkB isoforms. There are indications in the literature that pathological and excitotoxic conditions change the expression levels of TrkB-Fl and TrkB-T1. Therefore, it is necessary to demonstrate which isoform of TrkB the authors are showing as increased under their conditions. Similarly, it is essential to prove that the new anti-p-TrkB antibody is specific to this Trk receptor and, unlike other commercial antibodies, does not act as an anti-phospho-pan-Trk antibody.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your kind concern.</p><p>Human TrkB has 7 isoforms and predicted Mw ranges from 35 to 93kDa. It has 11 potential N-glycosylation sites.

We procured all the antibodies from the market using proven products, and didn’t check any specific isoform. We have mentioned the details of antibodies and reagents in the chemicals section of the methodology.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) I believe this initial conclusion could be significantly strengthened, without opening up other interpretations of the results, by demonstrating the specificity of the antibodies via Western blot (WB), both in the presence and absence of BDNF and other neurotrophins, NGF, and NT-3. Additionally, using WB could help reinforce the quantification of fluorescence intensity presented by the authors in Figure 1. It's worth noting that the authors fixed the cells with 4% PFA for 2 hours, which can significantly increase cellular autofluorescence due to the extended fixation time, favoring PFA autofluorescence. They have not performed negative controls without primary antibodies to determine the level of autofluorescence and nonspecific background. Nor have they indicated optimizing the concentration of primary antibodies to find the optimal point where the signal is strong without a significant increase in background. The authors also do not mention using reference markers to normalize specific fluorescence or indicating that they normalized fluorescence intensity against a standard control, which can indeed be done using specific signal quantification techniques in immunocytochemistry with a slide graded in black-and-white intensity controls. From my experience, I recommend caution with interpretations from fluorescence quantification assays without considering the aforementioned controls.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your insightful comments. We have now included a negative control image in the revised Figures. This control confirms that the observed fluorescence signal is specific and not due to autofluorescence or nonspecific background. In our lab, we have been using these antibodies and already optimized the concentration to use in certain cell types. Additionally, we followed the manufacturer’s recommended antibody concentration and protocol throughout our experiments to ensure an optimal signal-to-noise ratio.</p><p>We agree that extended fixation with 4% PFA may increase autofluorescence; however, including negative controls helps account for this effect. We also ensured consistent imaging parameters and applied the same exposure settings across all samples to allow for a valid comparison of fluorescence intensity. We appreciate your emphasis on careful quantification and have clarified these methodological details in the revised Methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) In Figure 2, the authors determine the expression levels of TrkA and TrkB using qPCR. Although they specify the primers used for GAPDH as a control in materials and methods, they do not indicate which primers they used to detect TrkA and TrkB transcripts, which is essential for determining which isoform of these receptors they are detecting under different stimulations. Similarly, I recommend following the MIQE guidelines (Minimum Information for Publication of Quantitative Real-Time PCR experiments), so they should indicate the amplification efficiency of their primers, the use of negative and positive controls to validate both the primer concentration used, and the reaction, the use of several stable reference genes, not just one.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s suggestion regarding the specificity of primers and the amplification efficiency. In response, we have now included the primer sequences used for detecting TrkA and TrkB transcripts in the revised Materials and Methods section (Quantitative real-time PCR analysis of odontogenic differentiation marker gene expression in dental pulp stem cells). This ensures clarity on which isoforms of these receptors were assessed under different conditions. We also acknowledge the importance of following MIQE guidelines, and we got the primer provided by Integrated DNA Technologies with standard desalting purification and guaranteed yield.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) Moreover, the authors claim they are using the same amounts of cDNA for qPCRs since they have quantified the amounts using a Nanodrop. Given that dNTPs are used during cDNA synthesis, and high levels remain after cDNA synthesis from mRNA, it is not possible to accurately measure cDNA levels without first cleaning it from the residual dNTPs. Therefore, I recommend that the authors clarify this point to determine how they actually performed the qPCRs. I also recommend using two other reference genes like 18S and TATA Binding Protein alongside GAPDH, calculating the geometric mean of the three to correctly apply the 2^-ΔΔCt formula.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your kind concern. We agree that residual dNTPs from cDNA synthesis could impact the accuracy of cDNA quantification. To address this, we have used the commercially available and guaranteed kit. The kit used is mentioned in Materials and Methods. We will definitely consider using 18S and TATA Binding Protein alongside GAPDH in our future studies. For now, we request you consider the results generated against GAPDH control.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) Similarly, given that the newly generated antibodies have not been validated, I recommend introducing appropriate controls for the validation of in-cell Western assays.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the text mistake. Antibodies were procured commercially and not generated. We have corrected the sentence.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(8) The authors' conclusion that TrkB levels are minimal (Figure 2E) raises questions about what they are actually detecting in the previous experiments might not be the TrkB-Fl form. Therefore, it is essential to demonstrate beyond any doubt that both the antibodies used to detect TrkB and the primers used for qPCR are correct, and in the latter case, specify at which cycle (Ct) the basal detection of TrkB transcripts occurs. Treatment with TNF-alpha for 14 days could lead to increased cell proliferation or differentiation, potentially increasing overall TrkB transcript levels due to the number of cells in culture, not necessarily an increase in TrkB transcripts per cell.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your comments. We appreciate your kind concerns. Here, we are trying to demonstrate that TrkB gets activated in inflammatory conditions. We have also provided the details on primers and antibodies. We have used commercial antibodies and qPCR primers, and they have been extensively validated with previous publications. The efficiency and validation of qPCR primers were provided by a company.</p><p>Moreover, we used the minimal concentration of TNF-alpha twice a week, and before using it, we did preliminary experiments to determine whether it affected any experimental condition.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(9) Overall, there are reasonable doubts about whether the authors are actually detecting TrkB in the first three images, as well as the phosphorylation levels and localization of this receptor in the cells. For example, in Figure 3 A to J, it is not clear where TrkB is expressed, necessitating better resolution images and a magnified image to show in which cellular structure TrkB is expressed.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your comment. Here, we aimed to show the expression of TrkB receptors in inflamed/infected pulp, especially in minority-distributed DPSCs. TrkB is present on the cell membrane and perinuclear region. We have provided a single-cell (magnified) image in the figure for better clarification.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(10) In Figure 4, the authors indicate they have generated cells overexpressing BDNF after recombination using CRISPR technology. However, the WB they show in Figure 4B, performed under denaturing conditions, displays a band at approximately 28kDa. This WB is absolutely incorrect with all published data on BDNF detection via this technique. I believe the authors should demonstrate BDNF presence by showing a WB with appropriate controls and BDNF appearing at 14kDa to assume they are indeed detecting BDNF and that the cells are producing and secreting it. What antibodies have been used by the authors to detect BDNF? Have the authors validated it? There are some studies reporting the lack of specificity of certain commercial BDNF antibodies, therefore it is necessary to show that the authors are convincingly detecting BDNF.</p></disp-quote><p>Dear reviewer, thank you for your kind concern.
