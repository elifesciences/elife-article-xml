truncated isoforms of Connexin43 with the predominant isoform being only 20 kDa in size (GJA1-20k). Endogenous GJA1-20k protein is not membrane bound and has been found to increase in response to ischemic stress, localize to mitochondria, and mimic ischemic preconditioning protection in the heart. However, it is not known how GJA1-20k benefits mitochondria to provide this protection. Here, using human cells and mice, we identify that GJA1-20k polymerizes actin around mitochondria which induces focal constriction sites. Mitochondrial fission events occur within about 45 s of GJA1-20k recruitment of actin. Interestingly, GJA1-20k mediated fission is independent of canonical Dynamin-Related Protein 1 (DRP1). We find that GJA1-20k-induced smaller mitochondria have decreased reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and, in hearts, provide potent protection against ischemia-reperfusion injury. The results indicate that stress responsive internally translated GJA1-20k stabilizes polymerized actin filaments to stimulate non-canonical mitochondrial fission which limits ischemic-reperfusion induced myocardial infarction.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>GJA1-20k</kwd><kwd>mitochondria</kwd><kwd>actin dynamics</kwd><kwd>mitochondria dynamics</kwd><kwd>ischemia/reperfusion</kwd><kwd>organ protection</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01HL094414</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shaw</surname><given-names>Robin Mark</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01HL138577</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shaw</surname><given-names>Robin Mark</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM131845</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rutter</surname><given-names>Jared</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01HL133286</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hong</surname><given-names>Tingting</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Stress-induced alternative translation of an otherwise common gap junction protein generates an isoform that orchestrates protective mitochondrial fission and organ protection during anticipated ischemia.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Ischemia-Reperfusion (I/R) injury is known to induce excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) in mitochondria, which results in cellular dysfunction and organ damage. Interestingly, the phenomenon of ischemic preconditioning, first described 35 years ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Murry et al., 1986</xref>), is a potent yet ironic protection of organs from ischemia-induced damage achieved by preceding the full ischemic insult with shorter bouts of ischemia. Despite the large therapeutic potential of preconditioning for any organ such as heart, kidney, skeletal muscle, or brain subjected to anticipated ischemia, the mechanisms of preconditioning are not well understood, nor has an intervention been identified to successfully translate the phenomenon into clinical utility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Heusch and Gersh, 2020</xref>).</p><p>Related to preconditioning is the perplexing dynamic regulation of mitochondria itself. Mitochondria undergo both fission and fusion in an adaptive equilibrium which directly affects cellular activity and response to stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Youle and van der Bliek, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Friedman and Nunnari, 2014</xref>). It is not clear if an overall shift to fission or fusion is sufficient to define mitochondrial fidelity, or whether a change in the fission-fusion equilibrium occurs secondary to multiple distinct pathways which could be either beneficial or harmful, depending on the pathway taken. For instance, is mitochondrial fission a causative element of ROS generation, apoptosis, cellular senescence, and cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Suen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nishimura et al., 2018</xref>), or is fission actually protective, such as by promoting mitophagy which can promote survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Shirakabe et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Burman et al., 2017</xref>)? The nuance in understanding the context of mitochondrial fission helps explain the complex relationship between mitochondrial morphology and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nunnari and Suomalainen, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Picard et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Song et al., 2015</xref>). If we have a better understanding of conditions in which mitochondrial fission results from a protective mechanism, we will be closer to learning how to preserve mitochondrial fidelity in the setting of ischemic and reperfusion stress.</p><p>Both the gap junction protein Connexin43 (Cx43) and mitochondria are associated with preconditioning protection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Garcia-Dorado et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Basheer et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rodriguez-Sinovas et al., 2018</xref>). Little is known how the gap junction channel and organelle convey protection during preconditioning. <italic>GJA1</italic>, which encodes Cx43, has a single coding exon and thus is not subject to splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Smyth and Shaw, 2013</xref>). However, <italic>GJA1</italic> mRNA is subject to endogenous internal translation generating several N-terminal truncated isoforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Smyth and Shaw, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Salat-Canela, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ul-Hussain et al., 2014</xref>). GJA1-20k, which contains the full Cx43 C-terminus but lacks transmembrane domains, is the most abundant and most common smaller isoform and is essential to full-length Cx43 trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Smyth and Shaw, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Xiao et al., 2020</xref>) by recruiting cytoplasmic actin to organize trafficking pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Basheer et al., 2017</xref>). In addition, GJA1-20k is highly enriched at the outer mitochondrial membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Basheer et al., 2018</xref>). GJA1-20k abundance increases with hypoxic and ischemic stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Basheer et al., 2018</xref>), resulting in a phenotypically profound cardiac protection that mimics ischemic preconditioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Basheer et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wang et al., 2019</xref>). It is not known how GJA1-20k protects mitochondria during stress.</p><p>In the present study, we found an inverse relationship between the presence of GJA1-20k and mitochondria size in cultured cells and mice. This relationship is not affected by typical mediators of mitochondrial dynamics by Dynamin Related Protein 1 (DRP1), but rather is strongly dependent on actin dynamics. With the generation of smaller actin-associated mitochondria, we observed decreased oxygen consumption, decreased ROS generation, and profound protection against ischemia-reperfusion damage. Our data demonstrate a novel non-canonical mechanism of protective mitochondrial fission which is dependent on GJA1-20k and cytoskeletal dynamics. The findings also identify GJA1-20k as a pharmaceutical candidate for protection of organs undergoing anticipated ischemia.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>GJA1-20k induces mitochondrial fission in vitro and in vivo</title><p>To understand the interplay between GJA1-20k and mitochondria, we expressed GJA1-20k in HEK293 cells and analyzed mitochondrial morphology by fluorescence imaging. GJA1-20k co-localizes with mitochondria and its presence results in a more rounded and punctate appearance of the mitochondria. GJA1-20k also induces a 54% decrease in average mitochondrial area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and F</xref>). siRNA-mediated knock-down of <italic>GJA1</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A</xref>) conversely increases mitochondrial area by 20% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and F</xref>). Furthermore, mitochondrial size after <italic>GJA1</italic> knock-down can be rescued by siRNA-resistant GJA1-20k overexpression, but not with overexpression of siRNA resistant Cx43-M6L, which expresses full-length Cx43 without the truncated isoforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Smyth and Shaw, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1B, C</xref>). Together, these data suggest that the short GJA1-20k isoform, but not full-length Cx43, reduces mitochondrial size.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>GJA1-20k decreases in mitochondrial size.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>â<bold>C</bold>) Representative live cell images of mitochondria in HEK293 (<bold>A</bold>, GST- or GJA1-20k-transfected; <bold>B</bold>, Control and siGja1) and mouse neonatal cardiomyocytes (<bold>C</bold>, WT, GJA1-20k-transducted, and Gja1<sup>M213L/M213L</sup>).

This M213L mutation removes the internal translation start site, resulting in expression of full length Cx43 protein but not the internally translated GJA1-20k isoform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Xiao et al., 2020</xref>). Neonatal CMs from <italic>Gja1<sup>M213L/M213L</sup></italic> mice have an increase in their average area of mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and F</xref>), in contrast to the decrease in mitochondrial area of neonatal CMs with GJA1-20k overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and F</xref>). Thus, both cultured cells and neonatal mouse cardiomyocytes exhibit an inverse relationship between the presence of GJA1-20k and mitochondrial size.</p><p>The homozygous <italic>Gja1<sup>M213L/M213L</sup></italic> mice, which lack the expression of GJA1-20k but not full-length Cx43, die from poor gap junction trafficking and arrhythmogenic sudden cardiac death two to four weeks after birth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Xiao et al., 2020</xref>). We therefore pre-emptively sacrificed and examined two-week old homozygous <italic>Gja1<sup>M213L/M213L</sup></italic> mice, and explored mitochondrial size by electron microscopy (EM). The mitochondria of 2-week-old cardiomyocytes deficient of GJA1-20k are enlarged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D and F</xref>). We then delivered exogenous GJA1-20k using adeno-associated virus type 9 (AAV9) to 8 week old adult WT mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Basheer et al., 2018</xref>) and found a decrease in the average mitochondrial area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E and F</xref>). Taken together, in cell lines, neonatal CM, young mouse hearts, and mature mouse hearts, an increase in GJA1-20k results in smaller mitochondria, whereas a decrease in GJA1-20k results in larger mitochondria. Previously, we reported that GJA1-20k is involved in mitochondrial biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Basheer et al., 2018</xref>). Consistent with our previous study, AAV9-transduced adult cardiomyocytes showed increased mitochondrial DNA copy number and GJA1-20k deficient mice (Gja1<sup>M213L/M213L</sup>) had decreased copy number. However, exogenous GJA1-20k did not alter the mitochondrial biogenesis in HEK293 cells. Nor did exogenous GJA1-20k affect membrane potential or baseline ATP production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2A-C</xref>). In addition to mitochondrial DNA copy number, neither biogenesis nor mitophagy protein markers were altered in either GJA1-20k transfected HEK293 cells or Gja1<sup>M213L/M213L</sup> mouse hearts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2D-G</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Canonical mitochondrial dynamics are not involved</title><p>Mitochondrial dynamics are regulated by well-known mediators including DRP1 for fission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Friedman and Nunnari, 2014</xref>), and MFN1 and MFN2 for fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Schrepfer and Scorrano, 2016</xref>).

With either method of DRP1 inhibition, the average area of individual mitochondria increased, consistent with inhibiting canonical fission (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and D</xref>).

We asked how GJA1-20k alone, which localizes to the mitochondrial outer membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Basheer et al., 2018</xref>), can recruit and polymerize actin around mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Using a reductionist cell-free assay of actin polymerization, we found that GJA1-20k does not directly promote actin polymerization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), and the polymerization kinetics is even slightly slowed down in the presence of GJA1-20K. However, GJA1-20k causes a leftward shift in the polymerization-depolymerization equilibrium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blanchoin et al., 2014</xref>) by directly inhibiting actin depolymerization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). The effect of substantial GJA1-20k, by inhibiting depolymerization, is to cause a net increase in polymerization. Because GJA1-20k enriches at outer mitochondrial membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Basheer et al., 2018</xref>), the GJA1-20k-induced polymerization will occur at and around the mitochondrial membrane. Interestingly, GJA1-20k results in net actin polymerization even in the presence of Latrunculin A (LatA), a known potent inhibitor of actin polymerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fujiwara et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>).

Following accumulation of GJA1-20k and actin (red lines) at these points, a drop in mitochondrial signal (blue lines) is apparent when fission occurs. Fission (low point of blue lines) occurs approximately 45 seconds after co-accumulation of GJA1-20k and actin (high point of red lines, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Time to fission was computed from the time of peak GJA1-20k and actin intensity product, to the time of mitochondrial signal being reduced to background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4DâF</xref>). Statistically, this time to fission occurred at a median of 45 seconds, with a standard deviation of 11 seconds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>).

However, remarkably, reduced GJA1-20k expression results in an almost complete cardiac infarction after I/R injury (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E and F</xref>). Moreover, ROS production after I/R injury was increased in <italic>Gja1<sup>M213L/WT</sup></italic> mice compared to WT post-I/R (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G and H</xref>).

In unstressed cells, the presence of GJA1-20k does not affect mitochondrial ROS generation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1D,E</xref>) whereas in the presence of exogenous H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, GJA1-20k prevents an increase in mitochondrial ROS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1D,E</xref>). Thus, GJA1-20k, which depresses mitochondrial respiration in unstressed cells, does not affect homeostatic ROS generation, yet has the beneficial effect of decreasing toxic ROS generation during stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A and B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1D,E</xref>). To clarify whether the protective effects come from GJA1-20k expression or mitochondrial size, we measured ROS from HEK293 cells with DRP1 overexpression instead of GJA1-20k overexpression. DRP1 overexpression decreased in mitochondrial size similar to GJA1-20k (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1F,G</xref>).

Taken together, GJA1-20k itself is necessary for the protective mitochondrial fission.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In conclusion, we find that the stress-responsive protein GJA1-20k organizes actin around mitochondria, promoting an actin-dependent mitochondrial fission process that also protects against oxidative and ischemic stress (cartoon in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). This protective fission pathway is distinct from canonical DRP1-mediated fission. In heart muscle, GJA1-20k appears to be critical to limit ischemic damage. Adult mice heterozygous for the internal GJA1-20k start have normal baseline cardiac phenotypes, yet suffer almost complete myocardial infarctions once subjected to I/R injury (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E and F</xref>).</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Schematic summary.</title><p>GJA1-20k, internally translated from Gja1 mRNA, localizes mitochondria membrane, stabilizes actin cytoskeleton, and recruits actin around mitochondria to both induce mitochondrial fission and achieve oxidative stress resistance.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-69207-fig6-v1.tif"/></fig><p>Mitochondrial fusion and fission dynamics are understood to involve several key molecules. MFN1 and MFN2 have important roles in fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Schrepfer and Scorrano, 2016</xref>), while DRP1 mediates canonical fission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Friedman and Nunnari, 2014</xref>). A dynamic equilibrium between fusion and fission is important during development as well as in response to a changing cellular environment. Alteration of the equilibrium point between fusion and fission occurs with disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chan, 2006</xref>). Additionally, in mouse heart, hypertrophy or dilated cardiomyopathy result from either MFN1 or MFN2 deletion (which causes mitochondrial fragmentation) or DRP1 deletion (which causes hyperfused mitochondria)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Song et al., 2015</xref>). The implication is that either a leftward or rightward shift in the fusion-fission equilibrium can negatively affect cardiac function. However, it is becoming increasingly clear that mitochondrial size alone, the easiest readout of mitochondrial dynamics, is insufficient to interpret whether destructive or pro-survival pathways are dominant. The presence of GJA1-20k, which increases with ischemic and oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ul-Hussain et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Basheer et al., 2018</xref>), is clearly beneficial in the setting of I/R injury (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G and H</xref>). Yet the presence of GJA1-20k, while inducing mitochondrial fission and smaller mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>), does not either reduce MFN1 or MFN2, activate DRP1, change membrane potential, ATP production, mitochondrial biogenesis, or mitophagy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2</xref>). The ability of GJA1-20k to recruit actin to induce fission independently of DRP1 is novel. GJA1-20k use of actin to cause fission occurs rapidly, within 45 s of peak GJA1-20k and actin coincidence at mitochondrial membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). We have also investigated the involvement of DNM2 as another GTPase for the mitochondrial fission, but DNM2 knock-down failed to induce sufficient mitochondrial fusion or alter the effects of GJA1-20k (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1G-I</xref>). Therefore, it does not appear that DNM2 is essential for GJA1-20k activity on mitochondrial fission. In addition to actin, the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane can be involved in mitochondrial scission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Friedman et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tandler et al., 2018</xref>). Future studies should be considered whether GJA1-20k induced actin cytoskeleton arrangements involves ER membrane as well.</p><p>Given the rapidity (less than one minute) of GJA1-20k induced fission, it is of interest how fission activity can be limited in stable cells, especially terminally differentiated cells such as adult cardiomyocytes. We have not yet evaluated whether secondary regulators or post-translational modification of either primary actin or GJA1-20k affects GJA1-20k mediated mitochondrial dynamics. One simple form of regulation is in the abundance of GJA1-20k. The paucity of GJA1-20k at baseline, and its large and rapid increase during the onset of ischemic stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Basheer et al., 2018</xref>), support the role of GJA1-20k as a stress responsive process which affords acute protection during ischemic injury.</p><p>While smaller mitochondrial size has been traditionally associated with mitochondrial fragmentation and poor cellular health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wai and Langer, 2016</xref>), it is now understood that there is a more complex relationship between mitochondrial size and mitochondrial function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sprenger and Langer, 2019</xref>). Smaller mitochondria can signal not only disease but also tissue protection and adaptation. DRP1-induced fission and smaller mitochondria are associated with excess ROS production, apoptosis, and organ injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wang et al., 2017</xref>), which is also seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1F-I</xref>, whereas DRP1-independent mitochondrial fission has been observed in cells undergoing protective mitophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Stavru et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Yamashita et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Coronado et al., 2018</xref>). It appears that GJA1-20k-mediated fission is highly beneficial, and part of a pro-survival cellular response to stress. Our results suggest that mitochondrial morphology (i.e. the overall balance of fusion and fission) in stressed cells should be considered in the context of the presence of specific proteins. For instance, pathological fission in the presence of activation of DRP1 might indicate mitophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ikeda et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Burman et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wang et al., 2017</xref>), whereas an increase in GJA1-20k implies a stress-induced reduction of ROS generation and beneficial depression of metabolism. Both DRP1 activation and GJA1-20k generation result in mitochondrial fission, but have different implications for cellular health.</p><p>Since its first report 35 years ago, investigators have both tried to understand the mechanisms of preconditioning as well as use putative mediators of precondition to benefit organs undergoing anticipated ischemia. These efforts have included dozens of preclinical and proof-of-concept studies, yet without success (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Heusch and Gersh, 2020</xref>). Mediators such as cyclophilin D (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cung et al., 2015</xref>), cardiolipin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gibson et al., 2016</xref>), mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Schaller et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Atar et al., 2015</xref>), Cx43 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Schulz et al., 2015</xref>), ATP-dependent K<sup>+</sup> channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Heinzel et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Garlid et al., 2009</xref>), STAT3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Heusch et al., 2011</xref>), GSK3-beta (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Juhaszova et al., 2004</xref>), and opioid receptors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dragasis et al., 2013</xref> have been implicated in preconditioning protection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Heusch and Gersh, 2017</xref>), but replicating their involvement in clinical studies has, to present, failed to be successful. More recently, the phenomenon of remote preconditioning has been explored as a therapeutic solution, but clinical application of this approach has also yet to be successful (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Heusch and Gersh, 2020</xref>). It is possible that the reason a central mediator of preconditioning has not been determined is that it has not been available for study. GJA1-20k was only first reported to occur endogenously in 2013 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Smyth and Shaw, 2013</xref>) and its association with mitochondria and potential beneficial effects for survival of I/R was reported in the last 3 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Basheer et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ren et al., 2020</xref>). As a smaller isoform of Cx43 that contains the epitope of most anti-Cx43 antibodies, and is localized to mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fu et al., 2017</xref>), GJA1-20k could be central to the studies that implicated Cx43 as a mediator of preconditioning. As a stress-responsive protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ul-Hussain et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Basheer et al., 2018</xref>), endogenous GJA1-20k is induced by short bouts of ischemia prior to a longer ischemic period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Basheer et al., 2018</xref>). Because GJA1-20k-induced fission is associated with less ROS production with oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1D</xref>, E), the endogenous generation of GJA1-20k and subsequent decreased ROS production could explain a major benefit of pre-conditioning. Of note, genetic GJA1-20k reduction increases infarct size and ROS production post-I/R injury (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5EâH</xref>). In addition, the population of damaged mitochondria is significantly increased in heterozygous <italic>Gja1<sup>M213L/WT</sup></italic> mouse heart post-I/R (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5IâL</xref>). Therefore, GJA1-20k induced decreases in ROS production could limit the amount of I/R injury induced by myocardial infarction.</p><p>Major cardiovascular procedures are associated with low flow and ischemia related damage to end-organs such as the heart, kidneys, and brain. A priori gene therapy mediated delivery of GJA1-20k to these organs could be beneficial. For instance, percutaneous coronary interventions are associated with both cardiac and renal damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brown et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tricoci et al., 2018</xref>) and could benefit from GJA1-20k-induced protection. Similarly, coronary bypass surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass is associated with low flow damage to the brain and kidneys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Roach et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">McKhann et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">OâNeal and Shaw, 2016</xref>), and abdominal aorta surgery is associated with renal damage, all of which may benefit from viral-mediated GJA1-20k pretreatment.</p><p>It is also possible, as suggested by unpublished preliminary studies by our group, that GJA1-20k peptide administration intravenously can gain access to the intracellular environments of the heart and other organs. In this scenario, GJA1-20k administration could occur minutes to hours ahead of an ischemic insult rather than the presumably days to weeks which would be needed for viral-mediated introduction. Future studies will focus on acute intravenous administration of GJA1-20k peptide in subjects about to undergo anticipated ischemia.</p><p>The phenomenon of stunned myocardium is common in patients with I/R injury such as experiencing an occluded coronary artery that is revascularized, but the mechanism of stunning is not well elucidated. It is possible that stunned myocardium has elevations of GJA1-20k after the ischemic injury. Of note, stunned myocardium is metabolically quiescent and also exhibits smaller mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Borgers et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Borgers, 2002</xref>), further supporting the possibility that GJA1-20k is involved in the stunned response to ischemia as a mechanism of preventing myocardial death. Endogenous induction of GJA1-20k may also explain other instances when smaller mitochondrial size correlates with a beneficial effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Coronado et al., 2018</xref>). Recent studies have identified that exogenous GJA1-20k can protect neurons subjected to traumatic brain injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ren et al., 2020</xref>), hearts from ischemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Basheer et al., 2018</xref>) and angiotensin induced hypertrophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fu et al., 2020</xref>). Furthermore, by mimicking the protection afforded by ischemic preconditioning, exogenous GJA1-20k is a promising therapeutic to protect hearts, brains and other organs against expected ischemic damage.</p><p>We have found that neither exogenous GJA1-20k overexpression in mouse hearts nor GJA1-20k<sup>M213L/WT</sup> adult mice have altered unstressed cardiac function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Basheer et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Xiao et al., 2020</xref>). However acute administration of GJA1-20k or using GJA1-20k in the context of stressed myocardium could conceivably result in diminished cardiac function. As GJA1-20k is stress responsive, an increase in GJA1-20k may be a mediator of post-ischemic protection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Basheer et al., 2018</xref>), and even responsible for the phenomenon of myocardial stunning which happens to be associated with small mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Borgers et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Borgers, 2002</xref>). On the other hand, GJA1-20k induced functional hibernation of stressed myocardium, while increasing survival, could conceivably result in diminished cardiac function. If indeed GJA1-20k induces an acute cardiac depressant response, appropriate steps would be needed to compensate for lower cardiac output during the myocardial protection period.</p><p>In summary, we identify that upregulation of the stress-responsive internally translated peptide, GJA1-20k, may be a critical mediator of ischemic-preconditioning protection. GJA1-20k induces fission by recruiting actin to mitochondria, inducing a fission that decreases ROS generation and protects organs such as the heart. Use of exogenous GJA1-20k as a therapeutic can potentially realize the long sought yet still elusive clinical need of preventing organs from undergoing damage during anticipated ischemia.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>All mice were maintained under sterile barrier conditions.

This finding is particularly interesting given that hyperfission is generally thought of as an index of toxicity in I/R or hypoxic injury. I/R lesion size in a GJA1 heterozygous mutant mouse is strikingly exacerbated compared to control animals, providing strong in vivo evidence supporting a role for this factor in protection from I/R.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Protective mitochondrial fission induced by stress responsive protein GJA1-20k&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Matt Kaeberlein as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Jason A Mears (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential Revisions</p><p>Mdivi-1 is has been shown to inhibit ETC CI as well as Drp1 (see &quot;The Putative Drp1 Inhibitor mdivi-1 Is a Reversible Mitochondrial Complex I Inhibitor that Modulates Reactive Oxygen Species&quot;). Changes to mitochondrial dynamics/structure may result from effects on ETC CI. Given the importance of Drp1 independence in the conclusions, the authors need to validate their findings using another method, such as overexpression of the dominant negative Drp1 mutant K38A.</p><p>K38A (or a similar approach) should also be used for the kinetic experiments.</p><p>The relative change in GJA1-20k expression in heterozygous (M213L/WT) animals should be shown, and the relative changes to ETC function (Seahorse) and mitochondrial size should be shown for the heterozygous animals. Some of this is already in supplemental, it should be presented in the main figures. This is important for interpreting the data in figure 5. The specificity of the phenotype to the stressed condition is striking, but because the phenotype is only shown in the heterozygotes (as homozygosity is lethal) the descriptive data in prior figures needs to show this setting.</p><p>The authors should show mitochondrial size post-I/R in control and heterozygous animals.</p><p>The H2O2 induced oxidative stress assay is not particularly informative or easy to interpret. I recommend moving this data to the supplement and focusing on additional endpoints from the mouse model in figure 5. The robustness of the phenotype in the I/R assay is much more compelling.</p><p>Mechanism of Drp1 independent fission is unclear â due to other GTPases such as dynamin-2?</p><p>The role of increased fission in protecting against ROS production thought to be a particularly interesting finding, but reviewers believe that mitochondria fragmented by Drp1 overexpression and suppression of Mfn1/2 or Opa1 is needed as an additional control.</p><p>To begin to address whether the fission/ROS findings from HEK293 cells are relevant to the in vivo results, the authors should be repeated in a more relevant cell type, such as in neonatal cardiomyocyte cells.</p><p>The authors should address the impact of GJA1-20k on mitochondrial membrane potential, ATP generating capacity, and rates of mitophagy.</p><p>GJA1-20k induces a clear difference in mitochondrial size, while total mitochondrial content appears unaltered (by Tom20). Previously it was suggested that mitochondrial biogenesis occurs with increased levels of GJA1-20k. Is this a difference in the cellular model, and do the changes in cell culture accurately recapitulate the changes seen in animals?</p><p>Please comment on the role of GJA1-20k in pathologic mitochondrial division during hypoxia/reoxygenation.</p><p>Please discuss the any perceived therapeutic implications of the findings.</p><p>Please discuss how altered mitochondrial size may alter cardiomyocyte and cardiac function. Is it possible that the benefits of GJA1-20K to infarct size come at a cost of cardiac function and reserve? Additional data to address this possibility would be helpful, but at minimum a discussion is needed.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This group originally found that cardiomyocyte-specific overexpression of the Cx43 truncated isoform (GJA1-20k) protects the heart against ischemia/reperfusion injury in mice, and this study support their previous study by demonstrating the cardioprotective effect of GJA1-20k peptide administration. The authors suggest that Drp1-independent mitochondrial fission and ROS production precondition the heart against severe ischemic stress. This concept is very interesting and novel, but there are several concerns that should be revised.</p><p>1. The mechanism of how GJA1-20k induces Drp1-independent fission via actin accumulation to mitochondria is unclear. Please identify what drives the mitochondrial fission. Is it due to other GTPases such as dynamin-2 Nature 540, 139-143 (2016). https://doi.org/10.1038/nature20555?</p><p>2. The most important point is that GJA1-20k causes mitochondrial fission with few ROS production, and attenuates mitochondrial ROS production caused by hydrogen peroxide. To avoid the possibility of an artifact imaging, they need to carry out comparative experiments with cells that have fragmented mitochondria due to overexpression of Drp1 and suppression of Mfn1/2 or Opa1.</p><p>3. Most cell-level experiments use HEK293 cells, and it remains questionable whether they reflect in vivo cardiac results. Since the adenoviral gene transfer system into neonatal cardiomyocytes is performed in Figure 1, it is better to see the production of mitochondrial ROS in the same system (Figure 5E).</p><p>4. Does the GJA1-20k overexpression have impact on mitochondrial membrane potential and ATP-producing ability? Is mitochondria that are divided by GJA1-20k removed through mitophagy?</p><p>5. I would like you to clarify how much this GJA1-20k-dependent mitochondrial division contributes to pathological mitochondrial division under hypoxia /reoxygenation, which can be separated from Drp1-dependent mitochondrial fission. Figure 5âfigure supplement 1 compares the mitochondria of WT and Gja1M213L / WT in the physiological state.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The following manuscript from Shimura et al., seeks to investigate the role of a 20kD protein isoform of Cx43 (GJA1-20k) in ischemic preconditioning. The authors discovered that GJA1-20K may provide protection in ischemic hearts through polymerizing actin around mitochondria and inducing mitochondrial fission. Through a series of elegant genetic, chemical, biochemical and cell biology studies including the use of the Gja1 M213L mouse line which was generated by this group, the authors determined that the salutatory effects of GJA1-20K was due to decreased reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation from smaller mitochondria. In general, the studies are a nice extension of published work from this group who initially discovered that a wide range of Cx43 protein isoforms can be generated from internal translation initiation sites within this protein. In particular, this study now further explores the specific role of GJA1-20K in the heart and discovered that it plays a critical role in ischemic preconditioning through affecting mitochondrial size and ROS production. Although the work is well done, there are some outstanding issues that the authors should address. It would be helpful if the authors discuss more the implication of the GJA1-20K isoform as therapy as the AAV9 work suggests the possibility of gene therapy in the future. It remains unclear as to how the authors envision such a scenario. Additional discussion would be helpful as to how smaller mitochondria from GJA1-20K over expression might impact cardiomyocyte and overall cardiac function, especially after ischemia or infarction. Although GJA1-20K may reduce infarct size, could this be at the expense of overall cardiac function or reserve?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. What are the levels of GJA1-20k over-expression in expts? Is it comparable to what has been described for endogenous increase observed with cardiomyocytes under stress?</p><p>2. Is there any difference when comparing mitochondria in the SSM and IFM? Are both populations affected?</p><p>3. The 20 kDa peptide contains some TM sequence, so why is it not targeted to the PM? Is there a MTS? A schematic earlier in the text would help orient the reader â similar to what has been shown in previous articles.</p><p>4. No change in S616 phosphorylation, but why not check S637? This site is thought to be the major driver of Drp1 activation/inactivation. So changes in the phosphorylation status at 637 is critical to provide a complete evaluation of Drp1 PTM regulation.</p><p>5. Is Drp1 localization altered when GJA1-20k is overexpressed? Hard to tell from Supplemental Figures No quantification.</p><p>6. In Figure 5, the Seahorse data show a higher level of non-mitochondrial respiration in the animal samples. This difference also mutes the differences in Basal Respiration, Leak and Maximal Respiration. There is definitely a trend in the data, but the differences are not as convincing if the non-mitochondrial respiration is taken into account (unless I am missing something in the way that the data is presented).</p><p>7. IMO, the discussion is a little long and winding. Some of it is necessary, but I think it can be more efficiently organized to better highlight the impact of your findings.</p><p>8.

To address the Reviewerâs question and explore whether dynamin-2 (DNM2) is involved in the mitochondrial fission with GJA1-20k, for the revised manuscript we knocked-down DNM2 and assessed mitochondrial morphology with or without GJA1-20k. As seen in revised Figure 2âfigure supplement 1 panels GâI, DNM2 knock-down does not significantly affect overall average area of mitochondria, with or without the presence of GJA1-20k. The failure of DNM2 knockdown to affect GJA1-20k mediated fission in the HEK cells we used, suggests that GJA1-20k activity on mitochondria can be independent of DNM2. Clearly there is still much to learn about GJA1-20k mediated fission. GJA1-20k is associated with the mitochondrial outer membrane (Basheer <italic>et al.</italic>, <italic>JCI Insight</italic>, 2018). While we should not rule out other mediators, we expect GJA1-20k is a direct binding partner and regulator of actin dynamics, as suggested by Figures 3D and 3E, and is therefore responsible for actin organization around mitochondrial bodies, inducing an actin mediated scission event (Figure 4).</p><p>The revised manuscript has been modified to include the above new data (Figure 2âfigure supplement 1GâI) and discussion:</p><p>â Results section</p><p>âIn addition to DRP1, Dynamin-2 (DNM2) is also a GTPase which can potentially regulate mitochondrial fission (Lee, Westrate et al., 2016). To explore possible DNM2 involvement, we knocked-down DNM2 by siRNA and analyzed mitochondrial morphology. In contrast to siDRP1, siDNM2 alone did not affect mitochondrial morphology (Figure 2âfigure supplement 1G â I), with or without GJA1-20k, suggesting no involvement of DNM2 in mitochondrial dynamics of HEK293 cell lines. It has been reported that DNM2 is not necessary to be responsible for mitochondrial fission in other cell lines as well (Fonseca, Sanchez-Guerrero et al., 2019). The fact that DNM2 is not needed for GJA1-20k activity to occur, indicates it is not an essential co-factor in GJA1-20k mediated mitochondrial fission.â</p><p>âDiscussion sections</p><p>âWe have also investigated the involvement of DNM2 as another GTPase for the mitochondrial fission, but DNM2 knock-down failed to induce sufficient mitochondrial fusion or alter the effects of GJA1-20k (Figure 2 âfigure supplement 1GâI). Therefore, it does not appear that DNM2 is essential for GJA1-20k activity on mitochondrial fission. In addition to actin, the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane can be involved in mitochondrial scission (Friedman, Lackner et al., 2011, Tandler, Hoppel et al., 2018). Future studies should be considered whether GJA1-20k induced actin cytoskeleton arrangements involves ER membrane as well. Given the rapidity (less than one minute) of GJA1-20k induced fission, it is of interest how fission activity can be limited in stable cells, especially terminally differentiated cells such as adult cardiomyocytes.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The most important point is that GJA1-20k causes mitochondrial fission with few ROS production, and attenuates mitochondrial ROS production caused by hydrogen peroxide.

To address this concern, we overexpressed DRP1 and measured ROS production under H2O2 stress. As expected (and predicted by the Reviewer), DRP1 overexpression caused fragmented mitochondria (new Figure 5âfigure supplement 1F, G). In addition, while H2O2 did not induce an increase in ROS production in the presence of GJA1-20k (new Figure 5âfigure supplement 1D, E), H2O2 did induce an increase in ROS in the presence of DRP1 overexpression (new Figure 5âfigure supplement 1 H, I). Therefore, mitochondrial fragmentation caused by DRP1 overexpression is more sensitive to oxidative stress and produces higher amount of ROS than in the presence of GJA1-20k. These data are supportive to our conclusion that GJA1-20k induces protective (rather than harmful) mitochondrial fission.</p><p>In addition, to add to the rigor of the study and address concerns about cardiac specificity, we performed new intact heart experiments revealing that there are larger mitochondria, more ROS, and larger areas of infarction in GJA1-20k insufficient mice subjected to I/R injury (Figure 5 EâL in the revised manuscript).</p><p>The revised manuscript has been modified to include the above new data (Figure 5EâL, and Figure 5âfigure supplement 1) and discussion:</p><p>âResults section</p><p>âGiven that GJA1-20k is a stress-responsive protein which can mediate ischemic preconditioning (Basheer, Fu et al., 2018) and to explore the protective effects of GJA1-20k against oxidative stress, we measured mitochondrial generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in HEK293 cells under oxidative stress induced by exogenous H2O2 treatment. In unstressed cells, the presence of GJA1-20k does not affect mitochondrial ROS generation (Figure 5âfigure supplement 1D, E) whereas in the presence of exogenous H2O2, GJA1-20k prevents an increase in mitochondrial ROS (Figure 5âfigure supplement 1D, E). Thus, GJA1-20k, which depresses mitochondrial respiration in unstressed cells, does not affect homeostatic ROS generation, yet has the beneficial effect of decreasing toxic ROS generation during stress (Figure 5A, B; Figure 5âfigure supplement 1D, E). To clarify whether the protective effects come from GJA1-20k expression or mitochondrial size, we measured ROS from HEK293 cells with DRP1 overexpression instead of GJA1-20k overexpression. DRP1 overexpression decreased in mitochondrial size similar to GJA1-20k (Figure 5âfigure supplement 1F, G). However, ROS generation induced by H2O2 was significantly increased and higher than GST control under H2O2 (Figure 5âfigure supplement 1H, I).

Most cell-level experiments use HEK293 cells, and it remains questionable whether they reflect in vivo cardiac results. Since the adenoviral gene transfer system into neonatal cardiomyocytes is performed in Figure 1, it is better to see the production of mitochondrial ROS in the same system (Figure 5E).</p></disp-quote><p>This is an excellent comment from the Reviewer although we should emphasize, in the original Figure 1, we identified a consistent phenomenon of GJA1-20k induced mitochondrial reduction or GJA1-20k removal induced mitochondrial size increase in not just HEK293 cells, but neonatal cardiomyocytes, cardiomyocytes from the hearts of young adult mice as well as from the hearts of adult mice. With regard to mitochondrial ROS generation, isolated neonatal cardiomyocytes are notoriously difficult to induce mitochondrial ROS (Kang <italic>et al.</italic>, <italic>Circ Res.</italic>, 2000). Therefore, to address the Reviewerâs concern about physiological relevance, we used adult mouse heart tissue post-I/R injury and measured ROS production. As seen in new Figure 5 Panels G and H, adult heterozygous (Gja1<sup>M213L/WT</sup>) mouse hearts experience an increase in ROS production post-I/R injury compared to hearts from WT animals. Moreover, our previous study (Basheer <italic>et al.</italic>, <italic>JCI insight</italic>, 2018, Figure 7E, F) AAV9-transduced GJA1-20k overexpressed adult cardiomyocytes decreased ROS production.

The authors discovered that GJA1-20K may provide protection in ischemic hearts through polymerizing actin around mitochondria and inducing mitochondrial fission. Through a series of elegant genetic, chemical, biochemical and cell biology studies including the use of the Gja1 M213L mouse line which was generated by this group, the authors determined that the salutatory effects of GJA1-20K was due to decreased reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation from smaller mitochondria. In general, the studies are a nice extension of published work from this group who initially discovered that a wide range of Cx43 protein isoforms can be generated from internal translation initiation sites within this protein. In particular, this study now further explores the specific role of GJA1-20K in the heart and discovered that it plays a critical role in ischemic preconditioning through affecting mitochondrial size and ROS production. Although the work is well done, there are some outstanding issues that the authors should address. It would be helpful if the authors discuss more the implication of the GJA1-20K isoform as therapy as the AAV9 work suggests the possibility of gene therapy in the future. It remains unclear as to how the authors envision such a scenario.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the Reviewer that AAV9 mediated cardioprotection of anticipated ischemia would be the natural extension of our work. In addition, gene delivery to other ischemia sensitive organs such as the kidneys and brain should be considered. There is also the possibility of delivery of GJA1-20k peptide acutely. In unpublished preliminary studies, we have found that GJA1-20k peptide in culture is able to cross the cell membrane, enter cells and increase the cellsâ resistance to oxidative and fluorescent damage. Furthermore, in a large animal (porcine) model of hypovolemic shock, we have found that intravenous injection of GJA1-20k protects against experimentally induced cardiac ischemia. The revised manuscript has been modified to include this discussion:</p><p>âDiscussion section</p><p>âMajor cardiovascular procedures are associated with low flow and ischemia related damage to end-organs such as the heart, kidneys, and brain. A priori gene therapy mediated delivery of GJA1-20k to these organs could be beneficial. For instance, percutaneous coronary interventions are associated with both cardiac and renal damage (Brown, Malenka et al., 2008, Tricoci, Newby et al., 2018) and could benefit from GJA1-20k induced protection. Similarly, coronary bypass surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass is associated with low flow damage to the brain and kidneys (Roach, Kanchuger et al., 1996, McKhann, Grega et al., 2006, O'Neal, Shaw et al., 2016), and abdominal aorta surgery is associated with renal damage, all of which may benefit from viral mediated GJA1-20k pretreatment.</p><p>It is also possible, as suggested by unpublished preliminary studies by our group, that GJA1-20k peptide administration intravenously can gain access to the intracellular environments of the heart and other organs. In this scenario, GJA1-20k administration could occur minutes to hours ahead of an ischemic insult rather than the presumably days to weeks which would be needed for viral mediated introduction. Future studies will focus on acute intravenous administration of GJA1-20k peptide in subjects about to undergo anticipated ischemia.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Additional discussion would be helpful as to how smaller mitochondria from GJA1-20K over expression might impact cardiomyocyte and overall cardiac function, especially after ischemia or infarction. Although GJA1-20K may reduce infarct size, could this be at the expense of overall cardiac function or reserve?</p></disp-quote><p>Neither viral mediated overexpression of GJA1-20k or development of a mouse line that reduces internal translation initiation of GJA1-20k results in a significant change in cardiac function (Basheer <italic>et al.</italic>, <italic>JCI insight</italic>, 2018; Xiao <italic>et al.</italic>, <italic>J Clin Invest</italic>, 2020). However, as the Reviewer suggests, acute administration of higher dose of GJA1-20k could still possibly result in decreased function. In fact, as we have found earlier (Basheer <italic>et al.</italic>, <italic>JCI insight</italic>, 2018), GJA1-20k is stress responsive and may mediate post-ischemic cardiac stunning which is typified by viable but poorly functioning myocardium post-ischemic insult. The revised manuscript has been modified to include this discussion:</p><p>âDiscussion section</p><p>âWe have found that neither exogenous GJA1-20k overexpression in mouse hearts nor GJA1-20kM213L/WT adult mice have altered unstressed cardiac function (Basheer, Fu et al., 2018, Xiao, Shimura et al., 2020). However acute administration of GJA1-20k or using GJA1-20k in the context of stressed myocardium could conceivably result in diminished cardiac function. As GJA1-20k is stress responsive, an increase in GJA1-20k may be a mediator of post-ischemic protection (Basheer, Fu et al., 2018), and even responsible for the phenomenon of myocardial stunning which happens to be associated with small mitochondria (Borgers, Thone et al., 1993, Borgers 2002). On the other hand, GJA1-20k induced functional hibernation of stressed myocardium, while increasing survival, could conceivably result in diminished cardiac function. If indeed GJA1-20k induces an acute cardiac depressant response, appropriate steps would be needed to compensate for lower cardiac output during the myocardial protection period.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1.

As we have emphasized earlier, prior reports of Cx43 localization by immunocytochemistry may actually have identified GJA1-20k rather than full length Cx43 since the epitope of most anti-Cx43 antibodies is on the C-terminus and will identify GJA1-20k as well.
