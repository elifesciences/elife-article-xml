To address this, we tested compounds for neuroprotective effects in multiple zebrafish and mouse RP models, reasoning drugs effective across species and/or independent of disease mutation may translate better clinically. We first performed a large-scale phenotypic drug screen for compounds promoting rod cell survival in a larval zebrafish model of inducible RP. We tested 2934 compounds, mostly human-approved drugs, across six concentrations, resulting in 113 compounds being identified as hits. Secondary tests of 42 high-priority hits confirmed eleven lead candidates. Leads were then evaluated in a series of mouse RP models in an effort to identify compounds effective across species and RP models, that is, potential pan-disease therapeutics. Nine of 11 leads exhibited neuroprotective effects in mouse primary photoreceptor cultures, and three promoted photoreceptor survival in mouse <italic>rd1</italic> retinal explants. Both shared and complementary mechanisms of action were implicated across leads. Shared target tests implicated <italic>parp1</italic>-dependent cell death in our zebrafish RP model. Complementation tests revealed enhanced and additive/synergistic neuroprotective effects of paired drug combinations in mouse photoreceptor cultures and zebrafish, respectively. These results highlight the value of cross-species/multi-model phenotypic drug discovery and suggest combinatorial drug therapies may provide enhanced therapeutic benefits for RP patients.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Photoreceptors are the cells responsible for vision. They are part of the retina: the light-sensing tissue at the back of the eye. They come in two types: rods and cones. Rods specialise in night vision, while cones specialise in daytime colour vision. The death of these cells can cause a disease, called retinitis pigmentosa, that leads to vision loss. Symptoms often start in childhood with a gradual loss of night vision. Later on, loss of cone photoreceptors can lead to total blindness. Unfortunately, there are no treatments available that protect photoreceptor cells from dying.</p><p>Research has identified drugs that can protect photoreceptors in animal models, but these drugs have failed in humans. The classic way to look for new treatments is to find drugs that target molecules implicated in a disease, and then test them to see if they are effective. Unfortunately, many drugs identified in this way fail in later stages of testing, either because they are ineffective, or because they have unacceptable side effects. One way to reverse this trend is to first test whether a drug is effective at curing a disease in animals, and later determining what it does at a molecular level. This could reveal whether drugs can protect photoreceptors before research to discover their molecular targets begins. Tests like this across different species could maximise the chances of finding a drug that works in humans, because if a drug works in several species, it is more likely to have shared target molecules across species.</p><p>Applying this reasoning, Zhang et al. tested around 3,000 drug candidates for treating retinitis pigmentosa in a strain of zebrafish that undergoes photoreceptor degeneration similar to the human disease. Most of these drug candidates already have approval for use in humans, meaning that if they were found to be effective for treating retinitis pigmentosa, they could be fast-tracked for use in people.</p><p>Zhang et al. found three compounds that helped photoreceptors survive both in zebrafish and in retinas grown in the laboratory derived from a mouse strain with degeneration similar to retinitis pigmentosa. Tests to find out how these three compounds worked at the molecular level revealed that they interfered with a protein that can trigger cell death. The tests also found other promising compounds, many of which offered increased protection when combined in pairs.</p><p>Worldwide there are between 1.5 and 2.5 million people with retinitis pigmentosa. With this disease, loss of vision happens slowly, so identifying drugs that could slow or stop the process could help many people. These results suggest that placing animal testing earlier in the drug discovery process could complement traditional target-based methods. The compounds identified here, and the information about how they work, could expand potential treatment research. The next step in this research is to test whether the drugs identified by Zhang et al. protect mammals other than mice from the degeneration seen in retinitis pigmentosa.</p></abstract><kwd-group

Retinitis pigmentosa (RP), the most common IRD with approximately 1.5–2.5 million RP patients a worldwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Dias et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Hartong et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib135">Verbakel et al., 2018</xref>), is characterized by early onset night blindness, gradual loss of visual field, and eventual loss of central vision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ferrari et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Hamel, 2006</xref>). The initial pathological feature of RP is selective rod photoreceptor cell death causing night blindness, which is then followed by loss of cone photoreceptors and eventual full blindness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Léveillard et al., 2014</xref>). Mutations in more than 70 genes have been linked to RP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Dias et al., 2018</xref>; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sph.uth.edu/retnet/">https://sph.uth.edu/retnet/</ext-link>). How these mutations affect gene function or initiate aberrant photoreceptor cell loss is largely unknown. Given the genetic diversity, pan-disease therapeutics are highly desirable. Accordingly, the purpose of our study was to identify compounds capable of promoting rod cell survival in multiple RP models and across species.</p><p>As RP progression is relatively protracted, and even small numbers of surviving rod photoreceptors can preserve cone photoreceptor function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Guadagni et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Hartong et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Punzo et al., 2012</xref>), pharmacological interventions aimed at slowing rod photoreceptor death are sought (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Duncan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib148">Wubben et al., 2019</xref>). However, currently there are no effective therapies for promoting rod photoreceptor survival. As a means of discovering new pharmacological treatments, target-directed high-throughput screening (HTS) approaches have been highly successful in identifying compounds that bind to and/or modulate disease-implicated molecules. However, many promising leads fail during late-stage animal model testing or clinical trials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Munos, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Sams-Dodd, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Scannell et al., 2012</xref>). This trend has renewed interest in phenotypic drug discovery (PDD), a complementary approach where drug effects are evaluated in cells or living disease models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bickle, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Lee et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Swinney, 2013</xref>). A number of first-in-class drugs were recently discovered using PDD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Eder et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib125">Swinney and Anthony, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Swinney, 2013</xref>). To expand opportunity on this front, we developed a PDD platform enabling quantitative HTS (qHTS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Inglese et al., 2006</xref>) in zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib137">Walker et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib140">Wang et al., 2015a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib144">White et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Zebrafish offer several distinct advantages as a retinal disease modeling system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Angueyra and Kindt, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Richardson et al., 2017</xref>). First, the structure of the zebrafish retina is similar to the other vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Angueyra and Kindt, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Richardson et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Schmitt and Dowling, 1999</xref>). In particular, the zebrafish retina is ‘cone rich’ like the human retina. Second, about 70% of human genes have at least one ortholog in zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Howe et al., 2013</xref>). Moreover, all RP-associated genes listed in RetNet (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sph.uth.edu/retnet/">https://sph.uth.edu/retnet/</ext-link>) have conserved zebrafish orthologs. Third, the zebrafish retinal system develops quickly being fairly mature by day five of development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Brockerhoff et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Moyano et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Schmitt and Dowling, 1999</xref>). Fourth, zebrafish are amendable to large-scale chemical screening due to their high fecundity rate, small size, and ease of visualizing and quantifying a variety of phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Mathias et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib156">Zon and Peterson, 2005</xref>). To streamline such screens, we developed a high-throughput plate reader-based method for quantifying reporter gene expression in vivo (‘ARQiv’; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib137">Walker et al., 2012</xref>). Recently, we adapted the ARQiv system to human stem-cell-derived retinal organoids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib136">Vergara et al., 2017</xref>) to enable cross-species PDD. To realize full throughput potential, ARQiv was combined with robotics-based automation to create ‘ARQiv-HTS’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib141">Wang et al., 2015b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib144">White et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Here, to identify neuroprotective compounds promoting rod photoreceptor survival, ARQiv-HTS was used to perform a large-scale chemical screen in a transgenic zebrafish model enabling inducible rod photoreceptor cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib137">Walker et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib145">White et al., 2017</xref>). In these fish, YFP-NTR (a yellow fluorescent protein-nitroreductase bacterial enzyme fusion protein) is selectively expressed in rod photoreceptors. NTR expression enables inducible ablation of rod cells upon exposure to prodrug substrates, such as metronidazole (Mtz), which are thought to cause apoptosis through activated metabolites that cause DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Curado et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib146">White and Mumm, 2013</xref>). Close to 3000 largely human-approved drugs were tested across six concentrations (i.e. using qHTS principles, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Inglese et al., 2006</xref>) in more than 350,000 zebrafish larvae. Statistically, 113 hits were identified as hits and 42 of the top performing compounds advanced through confirmation and orthogonal assays. Eleven compounds passed all secondary tests and moved forward as lead drug candidates. Validation tests in an orthogonal series of mouse RP models followed, reasoning that drugs effective across species and/or independent of disease mutation may translate better clinically. All leads were screened in primary mouse photoreceptor cell cultures and a subset of leads was evaluated in retinal explants from the retinal degeneration 1 (<italic>Pde6b<sup>rd1</sup></italic>, hereafter <italic>rd1</italic>) mutant mouse model of RP. Finally, one of three top-performing leads was tested in retinal degeneration 10 mutant retinas in vivo (<italic>Pde6b<sup>rd10</sup></italic>, hereafter <italic>rd10</italic>).</p><p>An analysis of potential mechanisms of action (MOA) suggested both shared and complementary targets/pathways. The role of Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), the most common shared target, was evaluated using chemical inhibition, genetic targeting, and western blot analysis. The results implicated PARP as a key mediator of NTR/Mtz-mediated rod cell ablation, and PARP1 inhibition as a shared MOA for a subset of leads. As PARP-dependent cell death pathways are implicated in the etiology of Parkinson’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Kam et al., 2018</xref>), RP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Power et al., 2020</xref>), and other neurodegenerative disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Fan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Fatokun et al., 2014</xref>), NTR/Mtz-mediated cell ablation may serve as an inducible and titratable methodology for modeling neurodegenerative disease. To interrogate complementary MOA, lead compounds were tested in pairs in mouse photoreceptor cell culture assays and in zebrafish. Intriguingly, enhanced survival effects were common in mouse photoreceptor cell cultures, while additive and even synergistic effects were evident in zebrafish for the majority of pairs tested. Taken together, our results suggest drugs providing neuroprotective effects across diverse RP models, between species, and/or through complementary MOA, will provide promising new therapeutic opportunities for IRD/RP patients.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Establishing a large-scale reporter-assisted neuroprotectant screen in zebrafish larvae</title><p>We initiated our study using a robotics-automated large-scale in vivo screening system to identify compounds that promoted rod photoreceptor survival in a transgenic zebrafish line enabling targeted ablation of rod photoreceptors, <italic>Tg(rho:YFP-Eco.NfsB)gmc500</italic>, hereafter, <italic>rho:YFP-NTR</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib137">Walker et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib145">White et al., 2017</xref>).

Thus, we reasoned <italic>rho:YFP-NTR</italic> fish could be used to identify compounds that protected rods from apoptosis. To identify neuroprotective compounds with this model (i.e. drugs that sustain YFP expression after Mtz exposure), we used our established plate reader-based ARQiv-HTS assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib137">Walker et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib144">White et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>We first determined optimal conditions for inducing rod cell loss while maintaining larval health in a 96-well plate format. Major aspects of retinal cytogenesis are largely complete by five dpf in zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Schmitt and Dowling, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib123">Stenkamp, 2011</xref>).

We therefore chose 5 dpf to initiate Mtz-induced rod cell ablation. We previously determined that rod cell loss reached a nadir at 7 dpf following a 24 hr pulse of 10 mM Mtz at 5 dpf (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib137">Walker et al., 2012</xref>). We reasoned that a 48 hr Mtz exposure initiating at 5 dpf would maximize the signal window to test for neuroprotective effects. Concluding the experiment by 7 dpf also avoids challenges associated with feeding, as zebrafish can subsist on their yolk sac up to that time point (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Hernandez et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Jardine and Litvak, 2003</xref>). However, 10 mM Mtz treatments extending beyond 24 hr become increasingly toxic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Mathias et al., 2014</xref>) and removing Mtz from microtiter plates after a 24 hr pulse could not be easily automated. We therefore sought a 48 hr Mtz treatment regimen sufficient for inducing maximal rod cell loss by 7 dpf that showed no evidence of general toxicity.</p><p>Five concentrations of Mtz were tested across a twofold dilution series from 10 mM to 625 μM. YFP reporter signals were quantified daily from 5 to 8 dpf using ARQiv. Changes in YFP levels were calculated as percentages normalized to non-ablated YFP controls. The data showed concentration-dependent reductions in YFP with maximal loss observed at 7 dpf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Mtz exposures at 0.625, 1.25, 2.5, 5, and 10 mM led to a 55, 79, 87, 87, and 83% decrease in YFP detection, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1a</xref>). Although no lethality was observed for any condition, signs of distress were evident for 10 mM Mtz exposures (i.e. reduced motility). At ≤5 mM Mtz, however, no signs of stress were observed. As 2.5 mM Mtz was the lowest concentration producing maximal loss of YFP detection, and confocal imaging verified YFP loss following a 2-day (5–7 dpf) 2.5 mM Mtz treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), this condition was selected as the treatment regimen for the large-scale screen.</p><p>Previously established power analysis methods using ablated and non-ablated controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib144">White et al., 2016</xref>) determined that a sample size of nine larvae was sufficient to detect a 50% neuroprotective effect. For ease of dispensing, microtiter plate formatting, and to account for larval dispensing errors, we increased the sample size to 16 larvae per condition for the primary screen. We also reasoned that this would also allow us to detect subtler neuroprotective effects. The strictly standardized mean difference quality control (SSMD QC) score was 1.67, indicating the assay was of sufficient quality to justify a large-scale screening effort (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib154">Zhang, 2011</xref>).</p><p>To establish a positive control, we tested 17 compounds and one compound ‘cocktail’ previously implicated as neuroprotectants in mammalian RP models (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2a</xref>). Unfortunately, none sustained YFP expression at the concentrations tested (4 μM to 125 nM). However, none have proven effective in RP patients either, suggesting a lack of conservation of neuroprotective effects across species. Our screen was designed to address this issue by testing for neuroprotective effects of these compounds across species and between different RP models. Fortunately, a compound identified as a retinal cell neuroprotectant by the Zack lab (manuscript in preparation) did show-dose-dependent effects on YFP levels. This compound was therefore used as a positive control (POS) for assay performance throughout the large-scale screen.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Primary screen</title><p>The Johns Hopkins Drug Library (JHDL) was chosen for the large-scale screen. The JHDL is comprised of nearly 3000 compounds, most being human-approved drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">Shim and Liu, 2014</xref>). To minimize false discovery rates, all compounds were tested using qHTS principles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Inglese et al., 2006</xref>) – that is, across six concentrations (4 μM - 125 nM) using a twofold dilution series. The screen largely followed published ARQiv-HTS methodologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib141">Wang et al., 2015b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib144">White et al., 2016</xref>), with additional assay-specific details (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, steps 1–8). In all, 2934 compounds were screened and more than 350,000 transgenic zebrafish larvae evaluated. Real-time data analysis was performed as previously detailed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib144">White et al., 2016</xref>) to generate: (1) a plot of YFP signal levels, (2) a plot of SSMD scores across all tested concentrations, (3) a signal intensity heat map of each plate, and (4) an SSMD score table (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, step 7). Compounds producing SSMD scores of ≥one were considered potential hits and flagged for visual inspection to assess fluorescence and general morphology using a stereo fluorescence microscope. This step facilitated elimination of false-positive compounds producing aberrant fluorescence due to larval toxicity (six drugs) or compound autofluorescence (27 drugs; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, step 8; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2b</xref>). Additionally, this allowed visual confirmation of sustained YFP expression within the retina. At the conclusion of the primary screen, 113 compounds were identified as hits (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2c</xref>). Hit compounds were classified according to the highest SSMD score achieved across all concentrations tested, and whether concentration-dependent effects were observed. SSMD scores suggested one drug produced a strong effect (SSMD of 2–3); three had semi-strong effects (1.645–2), 21 showed moderate effects (1.28–1.645), and 88 had fairly moderate effects (1–1.28) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2c</xref>). Forty-two drugs showed concentration-dependent effects, while 71 exhibited discontinuous or singular concentration effects. ‘On label’ mechanism of action (MOA) information available for the 113 hits implicated more than 50 targets/pathways in rod cell neuroprotection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2d</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Confirmation test</title><p>We next performed a series of confirmatory and orthogonal assays to evaluate a subset of 42 hit compounds prioritized by SSMD score, dose-response profile, and/or implicated MOA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2c</xref>, highlighted compounds). Having extensive MOA data is a key advantage of testing human-approved compounds which we leveraged in a previous large-scale zebrafish PDD screen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib141">Wang et al., 2015b</xref>).

In addition, several compounds that did not produce concentration-dependent effects were selected to test whether this criterion was useful in predicting reproducibility. All compounds were obtained from new sources to ensure reagent authenticity. To confirm survival promoting effects, three repeats of the primary screening assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) were conducted, but using a wider concentration range to account for differences in reagent quality (from 100 μM to 1.28 nM, fivefold dilution series). If toxicity was observed at higher concentrations, dilution series were initiated at 10 µM or 1 µM. Using this strategy, 11 of the 42 prioritized hit compounds were confirmed as lead candidates (26%). Estimated effects on rod cell survival – that is, YFP signal levels relative to +Mtz/0.1% DMSO controls – ranged from 38 to 9% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>; lead drug candidate names, abbreviations, PubChem CID, and chemical structures are provided in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Confirmation of neuroprotective effects of lead compounds in <italic>rho:YFP-NTR</italic> zebrafish larvae.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Diagram of confirmation assay protocol (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> for further details).

To ensure any potential for NTR inhibition was accounted for, all compounds were tested at 300 μM (except MIC and CHL which precipitated at higher concentrations and were tested at 50 µM) that is, ~100-fold greater than neuroprotective concentrations. Compounds were deemed potential inhibitors if NTR activity was less than 75% of the NTR alone control. Seven compounds showed no evidence of NTR inhibition by this criterion, but four did: warfarin (WAR), ciclopirox olamine (CPO), calcimycin (CAL), and sulindac (SUL; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>).

The differences in concentrations between neuroprotective and NTR inhibitory activities diminish the likelihood that these leads act directly on NTR.

Here, retinal explants from P10 <italic>rd1</italic> mice were isolated and cultured ex vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bandyopadhyay and Rohrer, 2010</xref>). Eight lead compounds, all but CAL, SUL, and Zinc pyrithione (ZPT), were tested for survival effects at three concentrations across a fivefold dilution series centered on the concentration most effective in fish RP models. After 11 days in culture, explants were fixed, stained and the number of photoreceptor rows counted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Neuroprotective effects were defined as a concentration-dependent increase in the number of photoreceptor rows remaining in the ONL relative to untreated controls (p≤0.05). An average of 1.2 ±0.19 rows of photoreceptors remained in the ONL of control explants. Three lead drugs, CPO, DHA, and ART, increased the number of surviving photoreceptor layers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>).

CPO, DHA, and ART thus promoted rod cell survival in the fish RP model and two mouse cell culture RP models. However, high concentration CPO treatments (15 µM) led to disruption of retinal histology due to induction of proliferation in the inner nuclear layer (INL) and ONL.

Thus, inhibition of a DNA repair enzyme would be expected to enhance, not inhibit, NTR/Mtz-mediated cell death. However, an alternative means of disrupting TDP1 activity is by inhibiting Poly (ADP-ribose) Polymerases (PARPs). Indeed, in a comprehensive 400,000 compound qHTS assay designed to identify TDP1 inhibitors, all five hits turned out to be PARP inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Murai et al., 2014</xref>). PARPs also mediate DNA repair but, interestingly, hyperactivation of PARP1 leads to a specific form of DNA damage-induced cell death, termed parthanatos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Fatokun et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib142">Wang et al., 2016</xref>).

Surprisingly, NEC promoted rod cell survival, while the apoptosis inhibitors did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>).

To investigate this, combinatorial lead drug treatments were tested in primary mouse photoreceptor cell cultures. As above, photoreceptors were isolated from QRX mouse retinas and used in stressor-treated primary cell culture assays. All 11 lead compounds were tested at a selected concentration individually and in pairs and the survival of GFP-labeled photoreceptors analyzed by high-content imaging and automated cell counting. The results showed no wholly additive effects, that is, survival percentages equaling or excelling the summed effect of individual compound assays. However, enhanced effects – i.e., better median survival than for either compound alone – were observed for 30 of 55 pairs in thapsigargin-treated cultures and for 20 of 55 pairs in tunicamycin-treated cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>).

Therefore, as cone cells provide high-acuity daytime vision, protecting small numbers of rod cell has significant therapeutic potential for RP patients. To test this further, lead compounds will need to be tested for the ability to prolong cone survival and function in rod-cone degeneration models.</p><p>Visualization by in vivo confocal imaging showed variations in surviving cell morphologies across lead compounds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>), suggesting.</p><p>variations in the extent of rod cell protection that could impact function. In particular, maintenance of the outer segment, a specialized primary cilium in which phototransduction occurs, is necessary for photoreceptor function. Volumetric quantification of surviving rod cells further suggested lead compounds differ in their capacity to maintain outer segments. Visual function tests will need to be performed to test this possibility and thus to prioritize lead compounds for in vivo testing in mammalian RP models.</p><p>To test conservation of neuroprotective effects across species, lead compounds were evaluated in three mouse IRD/RP models. Nine of 11 leads were confirmed as neuroprotectants in primary photoreceptor cell cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Three of eight leads assayed using <italic>rd1</italic> retinal explant cultures were also validated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>); two being active in both paradigms, DHA and ART. We chose the <italic>rd10</italic> RP model for in vivo testing because it undergoes a slower rate of rod cell loss than <italic>rd1</italic>; spanning from approximately P16 to P35 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Chang et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Gargini et al., 2007</xref>). DHA was the most promising compound for these tests as it had shown strong effects across assays and was amenable to a long-term release formulation designed to sustain drug action over weeks to months (PLGA-DHA, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). In addition, DHA is the active metabolite of artemisinin, another of our cross-species confirmed leads that was shown to have neuroprotective activity in rat models of stress-induced neuronal damage and light-induced photoreceptor degeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib149">Yan et al., 2017</xref>). Unfortunately, we did not observe increased photoreceptor survival in <italic>rd10</italic> retinas injected with PLGA encapsulated DHA. A potential issue that needs to be resolved is the release kinetics of encapsulated DHA in vivo. DHA has poor water solubility, therefore in vitro release kinetics were obtained in the presence of 0.1% DMSO. However, because intravitreal injection of DMSO can have deleterious effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib132">Tsai et al., 2009</xref>) we avoided this potential complication. To assess DHA release in vivo, pharmacokinetic assays such as high-performance liquid chromatography (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Ayalasomayajula and Kompella, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Shen et al., 2014</xref>) will be used to quantify lead compound concentrations in the retina for future tests. Another possible explanation is that <italic>rd1</italic> and <italic>rd10</italic> models have differential responses to DHA. This has been reported for the histone-deacetylase inhibitor valproic acid, which shows opposing effects in <italic>rd1</italic> (neuroprotective) and <italic>rd10</italic> (deleterious) mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Mitton et al., 2014</xref>) and across four different frog models of RP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib134">Vent-Schmidt et al., 2017</xref>).

However, these reports relied on terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL), which does not distinguish apoptosis from other types of cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ansari et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Charriaut-Marlangue and Ben-Ari, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Grasl-Kraupp et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Dmitrieva and Burg, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Kanoh et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Nishiyama et al., 1996</xref>).

Moreover, inhibition of apoptosis does not block cell death in many mouse photoreceptor degeneration models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Hamann et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib152">Yoshizawa et al., 2002</xref>), suggesting other pathways may mediate rod and/or cone cell death in retinal degenerative disease.</p><p>Recently, non-apoptotic cell death mechanisms have been implicated in IRD/RP. In a comprehensive biochemical analysis of 10 mammalian RP models—involving mutations in <italic>cnga3</italic>, <italic>cngb1</italic>, <italic>pde6a</italic>, <italic>pde6b</italic>, <italic>pde6c</italic>, <italic>prph2</italic>, <italic>rho</italic>, and rpe65—non-apoptotic cell death signatures were found to be common across all models tested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arango-Gonzalez et al., 2014</xref>). Conversely, definitive apoptotic markers were found only for the S334ter (<italic>rho</italic>) rat model. Shared features included activation of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), histone deacetylase (HDAC), and calpain, as well as accumulation of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) and poly (ADP-ribose) (PAR). For PARP, chemical inhibitors and a knock out line provided further confirmation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Jiao et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Paquet-Durand et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Sahaboglu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Sahaboglu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Sahaboglu et al., 2010</xref>). Prior reports had suggested the NTR/Mtz system elicits caspase-3 activation and apoptotic cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Chen et al., 2011</xref>). Initially, we had used this as a rationale for pursuing a neuroprotective screen with the <italic>rho:YFP-NTR</italic> line- however, the recent reports outlined above suggested apoptosis may have limited relevance to IRD/RP. Interestingly, when we tested cell death processes implicated in photoreceptor degeneration directly, an inhibitor of apoptosis (BEL) did not promote rod cell survival, whereas inhibition of necroptosis (NEC) and PARP were neuroprotective in our fish RP model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>). Serendipitously, an exploration of shared lead compound MOA helped to clarify cell death mechanism(s) mediating NTR/Mtz-induced rod cell ablation.</p><p>To explore molecular MOA of our lead compounds, we searched bioactivity data from prior HTS and ultra HTS assays (PubChem). The results suggested both shared and independent MOA. The most common shared target was TDP1 (eight of 11 lead compounds; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). An initial test confirmed two of three TDP1 inhibitors tested, though neuroprotective activity was relatively weak (~10% survival; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). TDP1 is a DNA repair enzyme that repairs topoisomerase I-induced DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Dexheimer et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">El-Khamisy, 2011</xref>). Interestingly, a qHTS cell-based screen of 400,000 compounds for inhibitors of human TDP1 found that all five confirmed compounds actually inhibited PARP activity not TDP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Murai et al., 2014</xref>). This is consistent with findings showing that TDP1 acts in conjunction with PARP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Das et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Lebedeva et al., 2015</xref>), thus PARP inhibition can indirectly affect TDP1 activity. Combined with the results discussed above, we were motivated to test whether PARP inhibition was protective against NTR/Mtz-induced rod cell death.</p><p>All eight PARP inhibitors tested promoted rod cell survival in our fish RP model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>). CRISPR/Cas9-based knockdown of <italic>parp1</italic> resulted in a statistically significant reduction of Mtz-induced rod cell death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). Moreover, PAR polymer, an indicator of PARP activation, accumulated in Mtz-treated fish (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1C–D</xref>). Collectively, these results suggest PARP activation plays an important role in NTR/Mtz-induced rod cell death. PARP1 overactivation initiates a caspase-independent form of DNA damage-induced cell death, termed parthanatos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Fan et al., 2017</xref>). Parthanatos has been strongly implicated in the etiology of Parkinson’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Kam et al., 2018</xref>) and in a variety of neurodegenerative conditions as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Fan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Fatokun et al., 2014</xref>), including RP/IRDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Power et al., 2020</xref>). Importantly, PARP is also a key component of the cGMP-dependent cell death pathway which has been linked to photoreceptor degeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Iribarne and Masai, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib130">Tolone et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Power et al., 2020</xref>). Thus, the NTR/Mtz-mediated cell ablation system may provide a novel approach for modeling neurodegenerative diseases associated with PARP-dependent cell death that is both inducible and titratable.</p><p>To investigate cell death more broadly, we also explored the roles of necroptosis, apoptosis and <italic>tdp1</italic> signaling in the zebrafish-inducible RP model. Interestingly, inhibiting necroptosis but not apoptosis promoted rod cell survival in <italic>rho:YFP-NTR</italic> fish (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>). Consistent with this, CRISPR/Cas9-based knockdown of <italic>ripk1l</italic> protected rods, but casp3a<italic>/3b</italic> knockdown did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Necroptosis is primarily associated with secondary cone cell death in RP models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Murakami et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Murakami et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib150">Yang et al., 2017</xref>) but has also been implicated in rod cell death in <italic>IRBP</italic> mutant RP models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Sato et al., 2013</xref>) and/or may damage photoreceptors indirectly via necroptotic microglia signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Huang et al., 2018</xref>). Combined, these results suggest that necroptosis, PARP1-dependent parthanatos, and/or c-GMP-dependent cell death mediate NTR/Mtz-induced rod cell ablation. The potential relevance of these alternative cell death pathways to heritable photoreceptor degeneration may explain the relatively high rate of validation we observed in cross-species tests of lead compounds.</p><p>To evaluate whether lead compound effects were mediated by inhibition of PARP signaling, a subset of lead compounds and a PARP inhibitor control (BMN) were analyzed for survival effects in <italic>parp1</italic> knockdown fish. Among four leads tested that were implicated as <italic>parp1</italic> inhibitors, two (MIC and DHA) were no longer protective when <italic>parp1</italic> expression was suppressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>), suggesting <italic>parp1</italic> inhibition mediated their neuroprotective effects. PARP1 has also been shown to have a role in stem cell reprogramming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Chiou et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Doege et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib143">Weber et al., 2013</xref>). PARP inhibition might therefore block Müller glia dedifferentiation, diverting injury-induced activity from a regenerative to neuroprotective program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Bringmann et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Finally, MOA analyses also implicated additional, potentially complementary, lead targets (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). Compounds acting through independent targets/pathways have the potential to produce additive or even synergistic effects. This possibility was confirmed for 10 of 19 paired lead compounds tested in <italic>rho:YFP-NTR</italic> fish (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1c</xref>). Analogous tests in mouse photoreceptor cell cultures showed a trend toward enhanced survival effects of paired leads but no fully additive effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). This discrepancy could be due to cell culture assays lacking in vivo complexity, such as signals requiring intact tissue or interactions between cell types or with other tissues. This result highlights a potential advantage of whole organism phenotypic drug screening: the ability to identify compounds/conditions that would be missed in more simplified assay systems. That combinatorial assays could be performed efficiently and rapidly also exemplifies key advantages the zebrafish system affords phenotypic drug discovery, for example, versatility and low cost.</p><p>In summary, we identified 11 lead compounds promoting rod cell survival in an inducible zebrafish RP model using a large-scale in vivo phenotypic drug discovery platform. Nine lead compounds were also effective as neuroprotectants in primary mouse photoreceptor cell cultures and three promoted photoreceptor survival in <italic>rd1</italic> mouse retinal explants. MOA studies indicated a subset of lead compounds may protect rod cells by inhibiting PARP-dependent cell death pathways and/or necroptosis. Combinatorial assays in fish showed additive and even synergistic effects, suggesting some lead compounds target independent neuroprotective pathways (summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>). We hypothesize that compounds producing beneficial outcomes across diverse animal disease models likely target highly conserved MOA and may therefore stand an increased likelihood of successfully translating to the clinic. Further, our data suggest polypharmacological targeting of complementary neuroprotective mechanisms has the potential to maximize therapeutic benefits for IRD/RP patients.</p></sec><sec id="s4"

At 16 hr post fertilization (hpf), N-phenylthiourea (PTU) was added to E3 media (E3/PTU) at a final concentration of 0.2 mM to promote ocular transparency by inhibiting melanosome maturation in the retinal pigment epithelium. At 4 dpf, visual screens were performed to remove larvae with abnormal morphology or low YFP expression levels. Stock drug and DMSO (negative control) solutions were automatically dispensed and diluted across a 96-well plate containing E3/PTU using a robotic liquid handling system (Hudson Robotics). At 5 dpf, a COPAS-XL (Complex Object Parametric Analyzer and Sorter, Union Biometrica) was used to dispense single larvae into individual wells containing either drug or DMSO; the final DMSO concentration was 0.1% across all conditions. After a 4 hr pre-exposure to test drugs or DMSO alone, larvae were treated with 2.5 mM Mtz to induce rod photoreceptor death. Larvae were maintained under these conditions for 2 days until 7n dpf and then anesthetized with clove oil (50 ppm final concentration); YFP signals were measured as described above. Larvae exposed to 2.5 mM Mtz/0.1% DMSO without any tested drug served as controls (‘+Mtz’) for maximal rod cell ablation.

All compounds were tested at the maximal effective concentration in 0.1% DMSO. Larvae from each group were anesthetized in 0.016% tricaine and embedded on their sides in 1% low melt agarose gel. An Olympus Fluoview FV1000 confocal microscope with a 20x water immersion objective (0.95 NA) was used to collect 30–40 z-stack images of YFP-expressing rod cells across the whole retina at 4 μm intervals. These image slices were stacked into a single maximal intensity projection image using Image J. To provide greater detail of rod photoreceptor morphology, a region in the dorsal-nasal quadrant was imaged using a 60× water immersion objective (1.10 NA) at 4.18 μm intervals. Three contiguous image slices were then stacked into a single maximal intensity projection image using Image J.

After rinsing in TBST for three times, the secondary antibody, anti-Human IgG-HRP (1:10,000, Abcam) was applied for 1 hr at room temperature. Anti-beta-actin-HRP antibody (1:20,000) was used as a loading control. Immunolabeled bands were visualized by ECL substrate and quantified in Fiji. 24 hr post-Mtz PAR accumulation assays were performed in triplicate. Mann-Whitney U test was performed and a p-value of ≤0.05 used to indicate statistical significance.</p></sec><sec id="s4-22"><title>Paired drug testing in zebrafish</title><p>To test for additive neuroprotective effects in zebrafish, seven lead compounds were tested at optimal concentrations either individually or in pairs using the primary screen protocol. All experimental results were normalized to controls and pooled per compound tested to calculate effect sizes, confidence intervals, and p-values using Student’s t-test. Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons resulted in an adjusted significance level of 0.002 (α=0.002). Sample sizes for each paired condition varied from 86 to 160 across at least four experimental replicates.</p></sec><sec id="s4-23"><title>Data analysis and statistics</title><p>For the primary screening, under the R environment, a customized ARQiv data analysis package was used to calculate sample size (n), quality control strictly standardized mean difference (SSMD) and SSMD scores as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib144">White et al., 2016</xref>). The following results of each drug were derived: (1) a plot of signal to background ratio at all tested concentrations, (2) a plot and a table of SSMD scores, and (3) a signal intensity heat map of each drug plate (96-well plate view). To combine and analyze the data from different experiments, data normalization was conducted by (S<sub>i</sub> -<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>X</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>-</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:math></inline-formula><sub>neg</sub>)/(<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf2"><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>X</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>-</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:math></inline-formula> <sub>Pos</sub> -<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf3"><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>X</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>-</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:math></inline-formula><sub>neg</sub>).

To compare between experimental conditions and controls, Student’s t-tests were performed followed by Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons (α/n). Relative effects, 95% confidence intervals and p-values were calculated. For mouse photoreceptor cell culture assays and volumetric confocal image analyses, adjusted p-values were calculated by performing Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic> tests followed by false discovery rate correction for multiple comparisons.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This project was supported by a Wynn-Gund TRAP award from the Foundation Fighting Blindness (JSM).

for retinitis pigmentosa, a leading cause of blindness. In this elegant study, a large scale drug screen anchored to a multi species validation platform identified several compounds that promote photoreceptor cell survival in RP models. Comprehensive follow up pharmaco-genetic studies show that PARP inhibition is one mechanism by which therapeutic amelioration is achieved. In total, this manuscript uncovers new potential treatments for RP suitable for future study, and also outlines a powerful approach for drug discovery that could be applied to other rare diseases with available pre-clinical models.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Large-scale phenotypic drug screen identifies neuroprotectants in zebrafish and mouse models of retinitis pigmentosa&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including James J Dowling as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Didier Stainier as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Elise Heon (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As the editors have judged that your manuscript is of interest, but as described below that substantial additional experiments are required before it is published, we would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Zhang et al. describe a novel multi organism drug discovery pipeline for rod photoreceptor cell survival. The goal of the study is to identify new potential therapeutics for RP and IRD. They identify several hits using a zebrafish model, and then test these hits in murine cell and organoid models. Finally, they test one drug in the eye of a mouse model.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>There was general enthusiasm among the reviewers for the overall concept and for the pipeline. However, the study was felt to be incomplete and lacking essential data, as well as to lack important validation of key assumptions. This was particularly viewed to be important because the general zebrafish screening methodology has already been published by the group. There are two overarching areas where the manuscript was felt to be preliminary.</p><p>The first relates to the drug development aspect of the story. No single hits proved effective across all models. Intriguingly, combinatorial treatments appeared to be more effective in the zebrafish model. However, these were not tested in the murine models. This was viewed by all reviewers as an essential experiment for the overall significance and impact of the study. In addition, the combinatorial impact as graded above single drug alone should be examined (as in, instead of yes/no).</p><p>The second relates to the proposed mechanisms of action. There is a lack of convincing evidence to support the proposed mechanisms of therapeutic benefit. For example, the hypothesis related to protection from non-apoptotic cell death could be strengthened by biochemical assessment of cell death pathways as a means of showing that these pathways are truly modified or not. In addition, and specifically related to TDP1, there is an opportunity to use genetic modification to confirm inhibition of this protein (usually potentially four guide approach for F0 KO).</p><p>Mechanistic studies would improve the validity and present the opportunity to advance disease understand and enhance translatability.</p><p>1. Line 116: States the transgenic fish used in this study model the onset of retinitis pigmentosa (RP). There is no data supporting this claim. Is metronidazole /nitroreductase system activating the same cell death pathways activated in animals with RP? The references given for the disease indicate multiple possibilities including cGMP, PARP-1, Calpain, etc. Does the Ntr/metronidazole system engage these cell death pathways? Furthermore, are young rods the same as more mature rods? Better justification of the model is needed or the model should be changed.</p><p>2. What is the effect of candidates on YFP stability and rhodopsin promoter activity?</p><p>3. Line 150-152: States that previously identified compounds (17) that showed retinal neuroprotection had no effect on the transgenic zebrafish assay used in this study. This is very concerning, perhaps invalidating the whole assay and some discussion is warranted.</p><p>4. The tenuous connection to parthanatos and necroptosis in their mechanisms of action (MOA) analysis appears to be the weakest part of this paper. Why not explore this further and actually do some parthanatos and necroptosis analysis with the already identified compounds?</p><p>5. Figure 4: It is surprising that inhibiting apoptosis did not result in increased YFP expression when the transgenic system used is known to stimulate apoptosis. What does this mean? It is important to show that the apoptosis inhibitor used actually inhibited apoptosis under the conditions used.</p><p>6. The mouse models used appear haphazardly put together. Wildtype, Rd1, and Rd10 of different backgrounds were all used individually in three different tests that were ultimately compiled to screen the same compounds. The genetic backgrounds of the mice, as the authors themselves have mentioned, becomes a significant confound. It would be better if they either stuck with one model or used both Rd1 and Rd10 in all of their experiments. They attempted to link it back to the mechanism of action results and to the different cell death pathways, but this is not very convincing without actual data.</p><p>7. There is mention of a mystery positive control for which no data is shown Some information would be useful to best interpret their results from the single candidates and the combinatorial experiments.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.57245.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>There was general enthusiasm among the reviewers for the overall concept and for the pipeline.

Unfortunately, due to budgetary constraints, we were only able to test a single compound in the <italic>rd10</italic> mouse model in vivo, a long-release formulation of DHA (PLGA-DHA). Unfortunately, this test was not successful. However, there a potential technical explanations for this result which we now discuss in more detail. Namely, we posit that the absence of DMSO in the injection may have limited bioavailability (based on in vitro release kinetics requiring DMSO; see lines 414-416 and 421-423). We plan to address this issue in follow up studies.</p><p>For the requested combinatorial drug tests, pairs of all eleven lead compounds were assayed for enhanced survival effects using mouse primary photoreceptor cell culture models using both stressor compounds, thapsigargin and tunicamycin – a total of 136 new assays. The results showed a trend toward enhanced survival effects for 30 of 55 pairs for the thapsigargin-induced cell death assay and for 20 of 55 pairs for the tunicamycin-induced cell death assay (new Figure 4—figure supplement 2). However, unlike zebrafish assays, no wholly additive effects were evident (i.e., survival effects ≥ to the sum of the individual effects of both test compound). In addition, the enhanced survival effects observed for paired compounds did not reach statistical significance relative to single compound controls after corrections for multiple comparisons. These new findings are presented at lines 535-544 and in Figure 4—figure supplement 2. We posit that additive effects may require in vivo context, such as interactions with other cell types or tissues, highlighting a potential advantage of whole organism screening. This is now discussed at lines 722-728.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In addition, the combinatorial impact as graded above single drug alone should be examined (as in, instead of yes/no).</p></disp-quote><p>In a new summary Figure 11, section C, we provide the quantified survival effects of each individual compound (blue boxes), each compound pair (grey boxed, no additive effect;, pink boxes, additive effects; red boxes, synergistic effects) and, for easy comparison, the summed value of the two individual compound controls (in parenthesis).

Western blots and quantification of PAR accumulation (as a measure of PARP activation) following Mtz treatment of NTR-expressing transgenic fish, presented at lines 504-514 (Figure 8—figure supplement 1C-D).</p><p>6. Assessment of neuroprotective effects of five lead drugs (and a PARP inhibitor control) following CRISPR/Cas9-based knockdown of <italic>parp1</italic> to test if enhanced survival requires parp1 inhibition.</p><p>These new findings are presented at lines 515-529 and shown in a newly added figure (Figure 9).</p><p>The results support the hypothesis that non-apoptotic pathways, namely PARP-dependent cell death, and to a lesser degree necroptosis, mediate NTR/Mtz-induced ablation of rod photoreceptors. We also confirmed that the neuroprotective effects of two of four lead compounds linked to PARP inhibition were PARP dependent – controls confirmed PARP dependence of a known inhibitor (BMN) and PARP independence of a lead not linked to PARP (WAR). The results are briefly summarized below:</p><p>1. Knockdown of <italic>parp1</italic> significantly improved rod cell survival while <italic>ripk1l</italic> knockdown had a marginal survival effect. Conversely, <italic>casp3a/3b</italic> and <italic>tdp1</italic> gene knockdown showed no neuroprotective effect. These results are consistent with chemical inhibitor assays (Figure 7) and support the hypothesis that PARP signaling plays a role NTR/Mtz-mediated rod cell death.</p><p>a. Note, the negative <italic>tdp1</italic> result could be due to less efficient knockdown (Figure 8— figure supplement 1B). However, it is also possible the marginal neuroprotective effects of two of three Tdp1 inhibitors (Figure 7) were mediated indirectly through PARP – consistent with the results of a comprehensive quantitative HTS screen of 400,000 compounds designed to identify Tdp1 inhibitors, resulted in the isolation of five hits that were actually PARP inhibitors rather than Tdp1 inhibitors (Murai et al., 2014).</p><p>2. Knockdown of <italic>casp3a/3b</italic>, but no other targets, resulted in increased rod neogenesis, consistent with inhibition of developmental apoptosis (and confirming efficacy of <italic>casp3a/3d</italic> knockdown).</p><p>3. PAR accumulated in Mtz-treated <italic>rho:YFP-NTR</italic> fish, i.e., our inducible rod cell ablation model. The accumulation of PAR polymer confirms PARP activation in NTR-expressing fish exposed to Mtz prodrug.</p><p>4. Upon <italic>parp1</italic> knockdown, the neuroprotective effects of a known PARP inhibitor (control) were lost, as expected. In addition, two of four lead compounds predicted to be PARP inhibitors also lost neuroprotective activity, while a compound not linked to PARP maintained neuroprotective activity (see new Figure 9). These results suggest the neuroprotective effects of a subset of lead compounds are PARP-dependent, as suggested by HTS studies curated at PubChem.</p><p>In summary, chemical inhibitor assays (Figure 7), gene knockdowns (Figure 8A, Figure 8—figure supplement 1A), PAR accumulation analysis (Figure 8—figure supplement 1C-D) and drug testing in <italic>parp1</italic> knockdown larvae (Figure 9) are all consistent, suggesting the NTR/Mtz-induced rod cell ablation is mediated in large part by PARP-dependent cell death. PARP is activated in response to DNA damage, with extensive DNA damage leading to PARP-dependent cell death. This is also consistent with the proposed mechanism of NTR-mediated cell death; NTR-based reduction of Mtz leading to the production of cytotoxic hydroxylamine derivatives, a process that either directly or indirectly leads to DNA damage, and subsequent DNA damage-induced cell death. That PARP-dependent cell death is now strongly implicated in Parkinson’s disease and retinitis pigmentosa is discussed regarding the potential for the NTR/Mtz system to function as an inducible neurodegenerative disease modeling system, lines 131-135 and 693-695.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Mechanistic studies would improve the validity and present the opportunity to advance disease understand and enhance translatability.</p><p>1.

At the cellular level, RP initiates with the loss and/or functional compromise of rod photoreceptors. The Mtz/NTR-induced rod cell ablation line is thus able to physiologically mimic this key feature of RP. In addition, as noted in the Discussion section, <italic>lines 448-451 of the original submission</italic>, “Prior reports had suggested the NTR/Mtz system elicits caspase-3 activation and apoptotic cell death (Chen et al., 2011). Initially, we had used this as a rational for pursuing a neuroprotective screen with the <italic>rho:YFP-NTR</italic> line.” In keeping with that, and assuming that rod cells die by apoptosis in RP and the NTR/Mtz system, we referred to the <italic>rho:YFP-NTR</italic> line as an inducible RP model. We now include that rationale in the Introduction (lines 166-170). In the results, we also initially refer to the <italic>rho:YFP-NTR</italic> line as “enabling targeted ablation of rod photoreceptors” (line 147) and “physiologically mimicking the onset of RP” (line 156) rather than as model of RP. Our intent was to delay discussion of the line as a model of RP (except the Abstract, simply to be succinct) until that possibility was clarified further during analysis of cell death mechanisms elicited by the NTR/Mtz system.</p><p>Truth be told, at the outset of our study we too had concerns about the disease relevance of the NTR/Mtz system, positing that a chemical screen may only serve to identify inhibitors of NTR. Thankfully, the results of our screen lent credence to the idea that NTR/Mtz system may prove useful as an inducible neurodegenerative disease modeling approach. However, the rationale is not what we initially assumed, i.e., that NTR/Mtz and RP both incur apoptotic cell death. Rather, our prior and newly generated data strongly suggest that apoptosis is not the primary mechanism by which the NTR/Mtz system mediated cell loss occurs, at least not in rod cells. Chemical inhibitor assays, gene knockdowns, Western blots and compound tests in <italic>parp1</italic> knockdown larvae all suggest NTR/Mtz-mediated rod cell ablation is mediated predominantly by a PARP-dependent cell death mechanism (see response to Essential revision 2, above). We were intrigued by recent findings from the Dawson lab that strongly implicate PARP dependent parthanatos in Parkinson’s disease (Kam et al., 2018) Accordingly, we worked with them to expand our analysis of PARP-dependent signaling in the <italic>rho:YFP-NTR</italic> line. This also motivated us to investigate the mechanisms of cell death implicated in RP more thoroughly.</p><p>The predominant study cited in support of apoptosis in RP models was published over 25 years ago (Portera-Cailliau et al., 1994). These investigators assessed apoptotic cell death in the Pde6b<sup>rd1</sup> (formerly rd/rd), Prph<sup>Rd2</sup> (formerly rds/rds) and Q344ter models of RP using the TUNEL assay and gel electrophoresis for internucleosomal DNA fragmentation. The data are consistent with increased apoptosis in the photoreceptor layer in all models, however, quantified data was not statistically evaluated. No other cell death pathways were investigated since this issue was largely viewed as a binary question at the time: apoptosis versus necrosis. The cell death pathway landscape has expanded considerably since then (Galluzzi et al., 2018). Using a comprehensive approach to evaluate multiple cell death mechanisms across ten mammalian models of photoreceptor degeneration, Arango-Gonzalez and colleagues found non-apoptotic mechanisms predominated in all models, whereas concordant evidence for apoptosis was limited to the S334ter model of autosomal dominant RP (Arango-Gonzalez et al., 2014). Interestingly, given our results, PARP activation was upregulated in all seven models of RP tested by Arango-Gonzalez and colleagues.</p><p>Combined with our expanded analysis of cell death mechanisms in the <italic>rho:YFP-NTR</italic> line, and in terms of the MOA of lead compounds, we speculate that the NTR/Mtz system may be useful as an inducible model of neurodegenerative diseases for which PARP-dependent cell death is implicated (e.g., Parkinson’s disease, RP). All disease models are imperfect to one degree or another, and caveats continue to attend the use of the NTR/Mtz system for this purpose. However, we feel the potential for expanded utility of the NTR/Mtz system as an inducible model for PARP-dependent cell death warrants discussion here. New results are presented and discussed as referenced in response to Essential revision 2, above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Furthermore, are young rods the same as more mature rods? Better justification of the model is needed or the model should be changed.</p></disp-quote><p>Young rod photoreceptors have developed key features of mature rods, e.g. rod outer segments, synapses and rhodopsin expression as early as 3 dpf (Schmitt and Dowling, 1999). Moreover, low levels of rod function can be detected by ERG at 5 dpf (Moyano et al., 2013) and rod-driven behavioral responses can be assessed by 6 dpf (Venkatraman et al., 2020). Larval stage zebrafish are amenable to the large-scale screening approach that anchors our study, whereas juvenile and adult fish cannot be used for screens at this scale. Therefore, we opted to conduct our screen in larvae at 5-7 dpf.</p><p>Clearly, it will be important to test whether our lead compounds are effective in adult fish as well. However, we ask that the reviewers allow us to investigate that question in follow on studies.</p><p>Our use of multiple RP models was used to identify potential “pan-RP” therapeutics as well as to circumvent the limitations of any specific model. As discussed above, we too had concerns about using <italic>rho:YFP-NTR</italic> fish for the primary screen, despite initial assumptions that apoptosis was commonality to RP and the NTR system. Serendipitously, the results of the screen proved insightful in terms of clarifying cell death mechanisms at play on both RP and the NTR system.</p><p>Finally, changing the model is simply not be tenable as it would require the entire project to be reinitiated. Given the links between PARP-dependent cell death in the NTR/Mtz system and genetic models of RP discussed above, we feel that the model choice has been adequately justified. That these insights were generated largely in hindsight, during pursuit of lead compound MOA, also highlights the value of agnostic screening approaches for revealing new insights.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. What is the effect of candidates on YFP stability and rhodopsin promoter activity?</p></disp-quote><p>We performed a test in which <italic>rho:YFP-NTR</italic> larvae were treated with lead compounds for two days (from 5-7 dpf) to assess effects on rod cell neogenesis and YFP fluorescence in the absence of Mtzinduced rod cell ablation. No leads showed significantly increased YFP signals compared to controls (former Supplementary Figure 4, now Figure 2—figure supplement 2). This result indicated that lead compounds did not enhance YFP stability or stimulate rhodopsin promoter activity (see lines 296-305).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Line 150-152: States that previously identified compounds (17) that showed retinal neuroprotection had no effect on the transgenic zebrafish assay used in this study. This is very concerning, perhaps invalidating the whole assay and some discussion is warranted.</p></disp-quote><p>In an effort to identify a positive control compound for our large-scale screen, we tested 17 compounds previously reported as being neuroprotective in mammalian RP models. Unfortunately, none promoted rod cell survival in <italic>rho:YFP-NTR</italic> fish. However, neither do these compounds promote rod cell survival in human RP patients. The cross-species validity of these compounds is therefore questionable. To our knowledge, no compound has been reported to be neuroprotective across fish and mammalian RP models, nor between mammalian models and human patients. The point of our screen was to fill this gap in the hopes of identifying neuroprotective therapeutics that work across species, thus potentially by highly conserved MOA. Serendipitously, an unpublished compound recently identified as a neuroprotectant in mouse retinal disease models by the Zack lab proved effective in promoting enhanced YFP signals in our system and was therefore used as the positive control. We have expanded the discussion of these points in the revised manuscript (see lines 206-214).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The tenuous connection to parthanatos and necroptosis in their mechanisms of action (MOA) analysis appears to be the weakest part of this paper. Why not explore this further and actually do some parthanatos and necroptosis analysis with the already identified compounds?</p></disp-quote><p>To strengthen the MOA analysis, we performed gene knockdown experiments, a PAR accumulation analysis, and combined gene knockdown with tests of lead compound efficacy (see response to Essential revision 2 and Major Point 1, above). The results implicate PARP-dependent cell death (parthanatos and/or cGMP-dependent cell death) and, to a lesser extent, necroptosis in mediating Mtzinduced cell death.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Figure 4: It is surprising that inhibiting apoptosis did not result in increased YFP expression when the transgenic system used is known to stimulate apoptosis. What does this mean? It is important to show that the apoptosis inhibitor used actually inhibited apoptosis under the conditions used.</p></disp-quote><p>Unfortunately, the apoptosis inhibitor we used initially (belnacasan, BEL) was selected in error. It is actually an inhibitor of caspases 1 and 4, thus a pyroptosis inhibitor. In the revised manuscript we have corrected this error by testing three inhibitors of caspases 3 and 9 (Ac-DEVD-CHO; CASI, caspase3/7 inhibitor I; CASVII, caspase 3 inhibitor VII). Relative activity of these reagents against caspase enzyme variants is shown in Table 2. In addition, we added gene knockdown experiments cotargeting <italic>casp3a/3b</italic>. The results summarized in response to Essential revision 2 and Major Point 1 (above) strongly suggest that NTR/Mtz-induced DNA damage leads to DNA damage-induced cell death – that is, PARPdependent parthanatos.</p><p>More broadly, and as our lab developed the NTR-based cell ablation system in zebrafish, we feel it is important that we further clarify this issue. The evidence for NTR/Mtz-induced apoptosis has relied largely on Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUPT nick-end labeling (TUNEL). This assay detects the presence of fragmented DNA. DNA fragmentation is associated with apoptosis, specifically caspaseactivated DNase activity, but TUNEL is not a definitive marker of apoptosis, requiring a secondary assay to confirm the mechanism of cell death (Baima and Sticherling, 2002; Kanoh et al., 1999; Lawrence et al., 2013; Loo, 2011). Moreover, the NTR/Mtz system incurs DNA damage directly. Thus, TUNEL can only be used to confirm NTR/Mtz-induced DNA damage, not to determine the nature of the cell death pathways involved. Complementary evidence of activated caspase-3 in Mtz-treated NTR-expressing cells has largely relied on images showing limited co-labeling (Godoy et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2004). Where qPCR data showing quantitative increases in caspase 3 and caspase 7 have been shown for the NTR/Mtz system, total RNA from larvae was used (Lei et al., 2017). Given that phagocytic macrophages undergo apoptosis (Murray and Wynn, 2011) and that macrophages clear NTR/Mtz-ablated cells (White et al., 2017), the qPCR assay cannot account for which cell types produce elevated caspase levels. Of note, our lab has struggled to demonstrate statistically validated increases in markers of apoptosis in Mtz-treated, NTR-expressing cells (e.g., activated caspase-3, secreted annexin-V). Finally, the use of Akt1, Stat3, and EPV E6 overexpression to protect cells from NTR/Mtz-induced “apoptosis” (Chen et al., 2011) is also in question. It is now known that Akt1 and Stat3 protect against anoikis, a specific form of “intrinsic apoptosis” triggered by loss of integrin-dependent anchorage to the extracellular matrix, thus relevant only to anchorage-dependent cells (e.g., epithelia). Relevance of anoikis to NTR/Mtz-induced ablation of non-epithelial cells is unclear. EPV E6 can inhibit cell death through the degradation of p53 (Scheffner et al., 1990). However, this is not necessarily indicative of inhibition of apoptosis as p53 is now known to be involved in autophagic cell death, ferroptosis, and necroptosis in addition to classical apoptosis, nonclassical apoptosis (Yamada and Yoshida, 2019). Moreover, E6 also targets the apoptosis inducing factor (AIF) for degradation. Despite the name, AIF is also required for PARP-dependent cell death (Wang et al., 2011). Given these caveats, levied largely by recent expansions in understanding of the intricacies of regulated cell death (Galluzzi et al., 2018), the mechanism by which the NTR/Mtz system elicits cell death can no longer be assumed to be via apoptosis and clearly warrants further investigation. We hope that the cell death pathway analysis we performed in pursuit of clarifying the MOA of lead compounds (Figures 7-9, Figure 7—figure supplement 1 and Figure 8—figure supplement 1; see also Response to ER2 and Major Point 1) will help to spur further investigations of NTR/Mtz-mediated cell death in other cellular targets.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. The mouse models used appear haphazardly put together. Wildtype, Rd1, and Rd10 of different backgrounds were all used individually in three different tests that were ultimately compiled to screen the same compounds. The genetic backgrounds of the mice, as the authors themselves have mentioned, becomes a significant confound. It would be better if they either stuck with one model or used both Rd1 and Rd10 in all of their experiments. They attempted to link it back to the mechanism of action results and to the different cell death pathways, but this is not very convincing without actual data.</p></disp-quote><p>The use of multiple RP models across species was by design. The intent of our screening cascade was to identify mutation-independent therapeutics directed toward conserved etiologies; this was in fact the directive of our funding agency, the Foundation Fighting Blindness.

There is mention of a mystery positive control for which no data is shown Some information would be useful to best interpret their results from the single candidates and the combinatorial experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>The positive control used for the large-scale drug screen is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor identified as a neuroprotectant by the Zack lab.

We ask that the Zack lab be allowed to present the structure and function of this discovery independently as the screening process underlying that discovery represents an extensive amount of work for the lead author of that study.
