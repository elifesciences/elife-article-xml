The alpha isoform is responsible for synaptic plasticity and participates in memory through its phosphorylation of synaptic proteins. Its elaborate subunit organization and propensity for autophosphorylation allow it to preserve neuronal plasticity across space and time. The prevailing hypothesis for the spread of CaMKII activity, involving shuffling of subunits between activated and naive holoenzymes, is broadly termed subunit exchange. In contrast to the expectations of previous work, we found little evidence for subunit exchange upon activation, and no effect of restraining subunits to their parent holoenzymes. Rather, mass photometry, crosslinking mass spectrometry, single molecule TIRF microscopy and biochemical assays identify inter-holoenzyme phosphorylation (IHP) as the mechanism for spreading phosphorylation. The transient, activity-dependent formation of groups of holoenzymes is well suited to the speed of neuronal activity. Our results place fundamental limits on the activation mechanism of this kinase.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>CaMKII</kwd><kwd>holoenzyme</kwd><kwd>inter-holoenzyme phosphorylation</kwd><kwd>IHP</kwd><kwd>unnatural amino acids</kwd><kwd>kinase signalling</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd><kwd>HEK cells</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100018694</institution-id><institution>HORIZON EUROPE Marie Sklodowska-Curie Actions</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>798696</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lučić</surname><given-names>Iva</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>TRR186/A07; project no. 278001972</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Plested</surname><given-names>Andrew JR</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>323514590 &amp; 446182550</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Plested</surname><given-names>Andrew JR</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001003</institution-id><institution>Boehringer Ingelheim</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PhD Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Franz</surname><given-names>Andreas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>TRR186/A15; project no. 278001972</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wahl</surname><given-names>Markus C</given-names></name><name><surname>Heyd</surname><given-names>Florian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ERC-STG no. 949184</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Fan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>CaMKII is capable of spreading activity between holoenzymes without exchanging subunits.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The Calcium-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase 2 (CaMKII) is encoded by 4 genes CaMKII <italic>A</italic>, <italic>B</italic>, <italic>G</italic>, and <italic>D</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tombes et al., 2003</xref>).

Lanes which are marked with ‘kinase-dead (1 hr)' show that no pT286 signal can be detected on CaMKII<sup>KD</sup> (4 µM) after 1 hr of incubation without CaMKII<sup>WT</sup>.

A canonical form of synaptic plasticity relates to the recruitment of active CaMKII to synapses following calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) influx via the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-type glutamate receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lisman et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lisman et al., 2012</xref>). Binding of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-bound calmodulin to the regulatory domain activates CaMKII by liberating its substrate binding site. Auto-phosphorylation at T286 (CaMKIIα numbering) in the regulatory domain prevents rebinding of the regulatory domain back to the kinase and allows substrate engagement. At this stage CaMKII no longer needs Ca<sup>2+</sup>:CaM in order to be active. This mode of operation, which allows CaMKII to remain active after the Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal (and the associated Calmodulin binding) has finished, is referred to as autonomous activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lou et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Miller and Kennedy, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lou and Schulman, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Waldmann et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chang et al., 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).

Autonomous activity, was first envisaged as a desirable general mechanism for memory storage by Crick before CaMKII was identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Crick, 1984</xref>). Indeed, it was recently concluded, based on the survival of autophosphorylation, that CaMKII activity can outlive its protein turnover time in mouse cultured brain slices, providing important evidence for spread of CaMKII activity to newly synthesized, naive CaMKII (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lee et al., 2022</xref>). The oligomeric structure of CaMKII might aid autonomous activity. In particular, the intra-holoenzyme autophosphorylation might provide a reservoir against phosphatase attack, because any dephosphorylated subunits can be ‘revitalized’ by their neighbors. CaMKIIα organizes a range of functions related to the plasticity of neuronal structure and function. CaMKII is concentrated in dendritic spines, where it bundles actin and phosphorylates its targets such as the α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptor auxiliary proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Coultrap and Bayer, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Herring and Nicoll, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bayer and Schulman, 2019</xref>).</p><p>A further key concept, that CaMKII phosphorylation is spread throughout a naïve population of holoenzymes by physical exchange of subunits (i.e. active subunits are swapped into naïve holoenzymes, which then auto-phosphorylate around the ring) is grounded on several observations. First, early reports suggested that naïve holoenzymes do not get phosphorylated when mixed with activated holoenzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Miller and Kennedy, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hanson et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rich and Schulman, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chao et al., 2011</xref>), and that the development of autonomous activity is independent of the concentration of holoenzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bradshaw et al., 2002</xref>). However, these experiments were mostly carried out at low temperature and with short mixing times and at low concentrations that do not mimic the physiological realm of neurons. Second, labeled subunits accumulate into clusters upon activation, as observed in total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy, but the limited resolution of optical microscopy means that clusters could contain multiple holoenzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Stratton et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bhattacharyya et al., 2016</xref>).

Subunit mixing experiments, using a panel of approaches and labels, confirm that restraining subunits through the hub domain has no effect on the accumulation of phosphorylation, that holoenzymes reversibly accumulate into clusters upon activation, and that whilst kinase domains interact promiscuously during autophosphorylation, the hub domains do not mix.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>CaMKII subunits from different holoenzymes can trans-autophosphorylate</title><p>Seeking to validate the subunit exchange as a mechanism for spread of kinase activity in CaMKII, we first tested the ability of wild-type CaMKII (CaMKII<sup>WT</sup>) to phosphorylate kinase-dead CaMKII (K42R and D135N double mutant; CaMKII<sup>KD</sup>) in vitro using purified proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">2</xref>). We used CaMKII<sup>KD</sup> double mutant, because in our hands, the single mutations did not completely abolish kinase activity.</p><p>We readily detected phosphorylation of CaMKII<sup>KD</sup> by either immunoblotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A, B</xref>) against phosphorylated T286, or incorporation of radioactive <sup>32</sup>P (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). In these experiments we used 10 nM CaMKII<sup>WT</sup> and 4 µM CaMKII<sup>KD</sup>, (400-fold excess of KD) in the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>:CaM and ATP:Mg<sup>2+</sup>. The WT and KD proteins are the same size (monomer Mw = 55 kDa), which forbids their separation on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). However, at 10 nM CaMKII<sup>WT</sup> phosphorylation was undetectable on a gel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplement 6</xref>), meaning that the phosphorylation signal we detected is overwhelmingly from the 400-fold more abundant kinase-dead protein. The half-times of maximal phosphorylation are different, being 1.1 min for the immunoblotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>) and 4 min for the P<sup>32</sup> incorporation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>), perhaps because T286 is phosphorylated early compared to the entire cohort of phosphosites incorporating <sup>32</sup>P.</p><p>The ability of CaMKII<sup>WT</sup> to phosphorylate CaMKII<sup>KD</sup> is in contrast to previous reports, which failed to detect any inter-holoenzyme phosphorylation of CaMKII<sup>WT</sup> or CaMKII<sup>KD</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Miller and Kennedy, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hanson et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rich and Schulman, 1998</xref>). Most previous work used either short incubation time (30–60 s) or low incubation temperature (4 °C) or both; these likely prevented full extent of CaMKII activity. Another difficulty could be the lower expression of CaMKII<sup>KD</sup> in cell lines, compared to dendritic spines where CaMKII concentration is estimated to be between 20 and 100 µM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Otmakhov and Lisman, 2012</xref>). This discrepancy means that in vitro experiments, which allowed us to use 4–8 µM CaMKII<sup>KD</sup> protein, are more representative of the crowded environment of neurons.</p><p>Next, we tested phosphorylation of CaMKII in HEK cells and in HEK cell lysates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). We expressed EGFP-tagged CaMKII<sup>WT</sup> alone, CaMKII<sup>KD</sup>-AviTag alone, or both proteins together, and sought to detect phosphorylation on T286 by western blotting. When expressed separately, we could observe phosphorylation on CaMKII<sup>WT</sup> but not on CaMKII<sup>KD</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, lanes 1 and 2). We could, however, detect phosphorylation on CaMKII<sup>KD</sup> when it was co-expressed with EGFP- CaMKII<sup>WT</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, lane 3). A confounding explanation for this is that WT and KD subunits might assemble into common holoenzymes during co-expression in cells, allowing KD subunits to be auto-phosphorylated in an intra-holoenzyme context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hanson et al., 1994</xref>). Next, we incubated HEK cell lysate expressing EGFP-tagged CaMKII<sup>WT</sup> alone with HEK cell lysate expressing CaMKII<sup>KD</sup>-AviTag alone, in the presence of 0.5 µM purified Calmodulin as well as 0.5 mM ATP: Mg<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, lanes 4–6), over different incubation temperatures and times. By incubating lysates with separately expressed WT and KD proteins, we wanted to exclude the possibility of the two proteins assembling into the same holoenzymes during translation, which is to be expected when they are co-expressed. Similar to previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hanson et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rich and Schulman, 1998</xref>) we failed to detect phosphorylation on CaMKII<sup>KD</sup>-AviTag after 1 min incubation at 4 °C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, lane 4). In contrast, the phospho-signal was readily detected on CaMKII<sup>KD</sup>-AviTag at 37 °C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, lanes 5 and 6), indicating that temperature and incubation time play an important role in enzymatic activity of CaMKII. Finally, when we incubated HEK cell lysate expressing EGFP-tagged CaMKII<sup>WT</sup> with 4 µM CaMKII<sup>KD</sup>-AviTag purified from <italic>E. coli</italic>, we could detect robust phosphorylation on CaMKII<sup>KD</sup> protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, lane 7), indicating the importance of CaMKII concentration in this process. Having in mind high dendritic CaMKII concentrations, this experiment indicates that crowding of CaMKII holoenzymes, rather than subunit exchange per se, might be important for spreading phosphorylation.</p><p>Another reason why inter-holoenzyme phosphorylation was previously neglected is due to the evidence for concentration-independent autophosphorylation of CaMKII<sup>WT</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bradshaw et al., 2002</xref>). The premise of Bradshaw and colleagues was that inter-holoenzyme phosphorylation should be concentration-dependent due to limited resource of the substrate/enzyme kinase holoenzymes, and should therefore depend on the initial CaMKII<sup>WT</sup> concentration. On the other hand, intra-holoenzyme phosphorylation should not be limited by protein concentration, because both substrate and enzyme kinase would belong to the same holoenzyme and therefore their supply would be ‘limitless’. They found that autonomous activity of CaMKII<sup>WT</sup> against a peptide-substrate autocamtide-2 was indistinguishable between CaMKII<sup>WT</sup> samples of different concentrations. There are two caveats in this experiment. First, they did not measure directly the trans-autophosphorylation between holoenzymes, but rather the autonomous activity towards the peptide substrate, used as a proxy for directionality of the trans-autophosphorylation (intra- vs. inter-holoenzyme). Second, in the autonomous activity experiments, after activating kinases (by trans-autophosphorylation) at different CaMKII<sup>WT</sup> concentrations, they reduced CaMKII<sup>WT</sup> concentration (from all reactions) to 10 nM and assayed activity with the peptide-substrate, in the end comparing the autonomous activity of the same amount of CaMKII<sup>WT</sup>. To look more directly into the concentration-dependence of CaMKII trans-autophosphorylation, we performed a set of redesigned experiments to directly measure only inter-holoenzyme phosphorylation. We measured phosphorylation of inactive substrate kinase (CaMKII<sup>KD</sup> at 4 µM), by different concentrations of the enzyme kinase (CaMKII<sup>WT</sup>; 0.5 nM, 2 nM, 10 nM, and 100 nM). We found that phosphorylation on T286 of CaMKII<sup>KD</sup> is highly-dependent on CaMKII<sup>WT</sup> concentration: more enzyme kinase (CaMKII<sup>WT</sup>) speeds up phosphorylation on substrate kinase (CaMKII<sup>KD</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplements 3</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s7">7</xref>). Intriguingly, fitting the data globally revealed a two-step mechanism, with both concentration-dependent and -independent components. The results of these experiments clearly fulfil the criterion of concentration-dependent (and therefore inter-holoenzyme) phosphorylation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Holoenzyme constituents do not rearrange into other holoenzymes during activation</title><p>Having established that active CaMKII readily phosphorylates subunits from naïve holoenzymes, we next used a genetically encoded photocrosslinker to test whether the phosphorylation of CaMKII<sup>KD</sup> could still be detected if active CaMKII is restricted to its respective holoenzymes. If phosphorylation spreads by subunit exchange between holoenzymes, then restraining subunits is expected to abolish, or at least slow down, the phosphorylation of CaMKII<sup>KD</sup>. We designed several CaMKII mutants in which we placed a BzF residue on different positions in the hub domain, using genetic code expansion technology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chin et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ye et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Klippenstein et al., 2014</xref>).

First, we monitored the phosphorylation kinetics of CaMKII<sup>KD</sup> when incubated with CaMKII<sup>F394BzF</sup>, which was either previously treated with UV light or not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). We assume that UV treatment crosslinks monomers, imprisoning them within their original holoenzymes and forcing them to phosphorylate CaMKII<sup>KD</sup> in separate holoenzymes in trans, in order to spread activity. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> shows that the UV treatment of CaMKII<sup>F394BzF</sup> before the incubation with CaMKII<sup>KD</sup> and activation stimuli did not slow down the phosphorylation kinetics of CaMKII<sup>KD</sup>. Regardless of whether CaMKII<sup>F394BzF</sup> was crosslinked or not, phosphorylation of CaMKII<sup>KD</sup> proceeded with a half time of 2 min. We performed crosslinking of CaMKII<sup>F394BzF</sup> at concentration of 8 µM, and then diluted it to 10 nM for the phosphorylation assay, whereas we kept the CaMKII<sup>KD</sup> concentration at 4 µM in the phosphorylation assay, again assuring that the overwhelming majority of the signal from the autoradiography gel is from the kinase-dead protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). The same lack of effect of UV induced crosslinking was also observed for another BzF hub domain mutant, CaMKII<sup>H418BzF</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Finally, restricting the ability of CaMKII<sup>F394BzF</sup> to dissociate from holoenzymes also failed to alter phosphorylation of the well-known Syntide-2 substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hashimoto and Soderling, 1987</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>Since active forms of CaMKII can efficiently phosphorylate CaMKII<sup>KD</sup> in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>), we used the F394BzF mutant to investigate whether we could capture CaMKII<sup>KD</sup> subunits with BzF crosslinks during phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). For this purpose, we incubated 4 µM CaMKII<sup>F394BzF</sup> with 4 µM CaMKII<sup>KD</sup>-AviTag under activating conditions at 37 °C for 1 h. After this substantial mixing period, and at which point the phosphorylation reaction had already plateaued, we treated the samples with UV light to promote BzF crosslinking. We reasoned that if the subunit exchange were to have occurred during phosphorylation of CaMKII<sup>KD</sup> by CaMKII<sup>F394BzF</sup>, some fraction of CaMKII<sup>KD</sup> protein should be captured by UV-induced crosslinking, due to mixing of CaMKII<sup>F394BzF</sup> and CaMKII<sup>KD</sup> subunits. The kinase-dead protein had an AviTag on the C-terminus, right after the hub domain. We could detect a faint band of the AviTag signal corresponding to a CaMKII dimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, lane 8) where we had CaMKII<sup>KD</sup> incubated with CaMKII<sup>F394BzF</sup> under activation conditions. But critically, this dimeric band upon UV exposure could also be detected in the absence of BzF (lane 10, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). The faint dimeric band is also present when we treat CaMKII<sup>WT</sup>-AviTag protein alone with UV light (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>, lanes 4 and 8). This UV-induced dimerization of non-BzF containing CaMKII is probably mediated via oxidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Klippenstein et al., 2014</xref>), since it can be blocked by addition of a high concentration of reducing agent TCEP (50 mM, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Notably, signal for the AviTagged CaMKII<sup>KD</sup> protein was absent in a ladder of high molecular weight oligomers generated by covalent crosslinking specific to BzF-containing CaMKII (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, lane 8, merged blot). This result indicated that although CaMKII<sup>KD</sup> can be robustly phosphorylated by CaMKII<sup>F394BzF</sup>, these proteins do not mix within the same holoenzymes to an extent that can be detected by western blot. To further ensure that this failure to detect subunit exchange was not an artifact of the KD mutant, we repeated the same experiment using CaMKII<sup>WT</sup>-AviTag and CaMKII<sup>F394BzF</sup>. Again, no AviTag-labeled protein was enriched in higher order oligomeric bands (other than the background low level of non-specific dimers) on the blot after incubation with CaMKII<sup>F394BzF</sup> and subsequent UV-treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>CaMKII holoenzymes do not mix during activation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of the experiment performed in panel (<bold>B</bold>) and possible outcomes.

After incubation of <sup>14</sup>N-and <sup>15</sup>N-incorporated CaMKII<sup>WT</sup> with activation stimuli, we added Disuccinimidyl suberate (DSS) in order to crosslink the proteins in activated states.

While some crosslinks were only detected between homo-isotypes, others were found (generally with a lower frequency) between both hetero-isotypes and homo-isotypes.

In activating conditions, we detected fewer homotypic crosslinks involving the regulatory domain than in basal conditions, either because CaM binding shields residues or because heterogeneous phosphorylation hindered peptide identification.

We envisaged that if the subunit exchange is indeed taking place during activation, at least partial colocalization of differently labeled CaMKII<sup>WT</sup> molecules would be observed even after stopping the kinase reaction, thanks to subunit exchange before the reaction has been stopped. To test this possibility, we incubated differentially-labeled CaMKII<sup>WT</sup> with activating stimuli (both Ca<sup>2+</sup>:CaM and ATP:Mg<sup>2+</sup>), allowed autophosphorylation to occur, and then added EDTA to chelate Mg<sup>2+</sup> and prevent further phospho-transfer during trans-autophosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rudolf et al., 2014</xref>). In this condition, we surprisingly found a total absence of subunit colocalization between differentially labeled CaMKII<sup>WT</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1D</xref>). This critical result indicates that colocalization is activity dependent but reversible. It is likely not a consequence of the subunits being exchanged between holoenzymes. Rather, what we observe as a colocalization under TIRF comes from different holoenzymes coming into close proximity to trans-autophosphorylate each other in an inter-holoenzyme manner. When ATP was absent, the holoenzymes did not colocalize because they were not trans-autophosphorylating each other. Finally, when we incubated CaMKII<sup>WT</sup> with CaMKII<sup>KD</sup> we could still detect colocalization of CaMKII molecules under activating conditions, whereas colocalization of differentially labeled CaMKII<sup>KD</sup> was completely absent in both conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). The colocalization observed between CaMKII<sup>WT</sup> and CaMKII<sup>KD</sup> was less pronounced than for mixed WT subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2B</xref>), presumably because half of the sample in this case is inactive, and therefore the activity-driven colocalization occurs to a lesser extent.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Higher order clusters of holoenzymes detected during activation</title><p>If subunits do not exchange, then holoenzymes must come in close proximity in order to trans-autophosphorylate each other. In order to test this hypothesis, we used mass photometry to compare the molecular weight (Mw) of CaMKII<sup>WT</sup> and CaMKII<sup>KD</sup> particles under basal and activating conditions. Because mass photometry is a surface-based microscopy method, the micromolar concentrations of CaMKII we used in other assays gave too many particles in the field of view for a valid measurement. The highest CaMKII concentration which we could measure was 400 nM. The high sensitivity of mass photometry gave the substantial advantage that we could work at concentrations of CaMKII particles as low as 10 nM. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref> shows measured mass distribution of CaMKII<sup>WT</sup> particles under resting conditions. The only peak which could be fitted with a Gaussian distribution corresponds to particles with Mw corresponding to a dodecamer (592 kDa). This peak was asymmetric on the high molecular weight side, indicating we worked at the high concentration limit of the experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Upon activation of CaMKII<sup>WT</sup>, we detected two additional sets of particles with molecular weights corresponding to dimer-tetramers and 24–30-mers, in addition to the main dodecameric peak (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B</xref>). The measured molecular weights in each peak correspond to CaMKII with bound calmodulin. Peak 0 has a Mw of 157 kDa, which corresponds to CaMKII dimer with two bound calmodulin. Peak 1 corresponds to particles with Mw of 721 kDa, close to CaMKII dodecamer with bound calmodulins. Finally, Peak 2 corresponds to particles with Mw of 1442 kDa, which is roughly CaMKII 24-mer with bound calmodulin. We presume that the 24-mer peak corresponds to 2 interacting holoenzymes. The abundance of CaMKII monomer in each peak was 0.7% for CaMKII dimer, 81.5% for CaMKII dodecamer, and 17.8% for CaMKII 24-mer (see “Materials and methods” section for calculation of CaMKII monomer fractions in each peak). Under activating conditions, the majority of CaMKII forms dodecamers, implying that most of trans-autophosphorylation still occurs intra-holoenzyme. However, around 18% of CaMKII forms 24-mers, indicating that the spread of kinase activity might occur between two holoenzymes (inter-holoenzyme). Mass photometry detected less than 1% of CaMKII subunit dimers at 400 nM concentration upon activation, which could be interpreted as either subunit dimers leaving holoenzymes and exchanging with other holoenzymes, or as a general destabilization of a sub-set of holoenzymes brought about by activation. The distribution of Mw peaks of CaMKII at 100 nM concentration showed a monomer-dimer peak (Peak 0=81.5 kDa) already appears in resting conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1C</xref>), albeit at low intensity (representing around 1% of the sample), indicating that lowering CaMKII concentration destabilizes holoenzyme integrity. The main peak still corresponded to dodecameric CaMKII (Peak 1 Mw=591 kDa). Incubation with activating stimuli at 100 nM concentration generated a similar peak distribution as during activation at 400 nM CaMKII. The first peak corresponded to a monomer population (Peak 0 Mw=62 kDa) participating with around 0.5% of CaMKII monomers, the main peak is still dodecameric (Peak 1 Mw=693 kDa) with about 82% of CaMKII monomers participating in this peak, and finally the 24-mer peak was detected (Peak 2 Mw=1404 kDa) consisting of 17.5% of all CaMKII monomers. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Lowering CaMKII concentration to 10 nM further destabilized the holoenzyme, as can be seen in the appearance of higher percentage (3%) of particles corresponding to Mw of CaMKII dimer (Peak 0 Mw=95 kDa), but still the majority of particles formed dodecamers (97%, Peak 1 Mw=581 kDa; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). Remarkably, activation of CaMKII at 10 nM concentration still led to formation of 24-mers (Peak 2 Mw=1600 kDa with 13.4%), dodecameric fraction at 84% (Peak 1 Mw=784 kDa), and monomeric at 2.6% (Peak 0 Mw=33.2 kDa). The peak distribution of activated samples is similar over the range of concentrations, further emphasizing the stability of CaMKII holoenzyme and propensity to form higher order oligomers during activation. CaMKII<sup>KD</sup> particle distributions at 400 nM concentration were similar to the WT protein under basal condition, but the maximum Mw detected was corresponding to decameric holoenzymes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Activation of KD protein gave no higher-order peak but generated a small peak of tetrameric CaMKII (12%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2B</xref>). We assume that the KD protein is capable of binding Calmodulin, since it can only be phosphorylated by the WT protein in the presence of Calmodulin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2C</xref>). The absence of a higher order oligomeric peak from the CaMKII<sup>KD</sup> sample in activated conditions further emphasizes that reversible CaMKII clustering is driven by trans-autophosphorylation between holoenzymes.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Mass photometry detects clusters of holoenzymes forming upon activation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Mass distribution of 400 nM CaMKII<sup>WT</sup> under basal conditions (red curve).

Particularly beguiling is the idea that CaMKII can convert brief Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals corresponding to decisions, calculations and comparisons in neurons into sustained phosphorylation of targets in order to store information in neural circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lisman et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Coultrap and Bayer, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tao et al., 2021</xref>). The prevailing model for the requisite spatial and temporal spread of CaMKII autonomous activity argues that CaMKII must exchange subunits between activated and naïve (unactivated) holoenzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Stratton et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bhattacharyya et al., 2016</xref>), principally because previous work suggests autophosphorylation between holoenzymes does not occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Miller and Kennedy, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hanson et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rich and Schulman, 1998</xref>). The data we present here, collected over five separate, complementary techniques, convincingly demonstrate that subunit exchange, if it does occur, is a rare event. We also provide support for a new model of efficient spread of kinase activity, through inter-holoenzyme trans-autophosphorylation. In this model, CaMKII subunits remain in their respective stable holoenzymes, but phosphorylate neighboring holoenzymes, exploiting the long, flexible linkers which connect the kinase domains to the hub. Contacts between kinase domains are driven by activity, presumably corresponding to multivalent, synergistic autophosphorylation events. The high local concentration of CaMKII in dendrites would be expected to facilitate this interaction between holoenzymes.</p><p>Why did previous studies fail to detect inter-holoenzyme phosphorylation? First of all, some studies were not set up to detect it, because measurements were dominated by the fast intra-holoenzyme reaction, which proceeds with terrific speed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bradshaw et al., 2002</xref>). In previous experiments using kinase-dead CaMKII as substrate, short incubation times (30–60 s) and low temperature (4 °C) were used, which in turn also reduced inter-holoenzyme phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hanson et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rich and Schulman, 1998</xref>). Here, we split the enzyme and substrate kinases and could readily detect concentration-dependent inter-holoenzyme phosphorylation at 37 °C. We worked at minimal active kinase concentration and used 4 µM kinase-dead CaMKII, in order to approach the physiological CaMKII concentration, which is estimated to be 20–100 µM in dendritic spines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Otmakhov and Lisman, 2012</xref>). We showed that CaMKII<sup>WT</sup> can phosphorylate CaMKII<sup>KD</sup> subunits from distinct holoenzymes in a concentration-dependent manner in vitro. We also observed inter-holoenzyme phosphorylation in mammalian cell extracts and confirmed that CaMKII<sup>KD</sup> holoenzymes can associate with CaMKII<sup>WT</sup> holoenzymes under TIRF.</p><p>Evidence indicating that CaMKII spreads its kinase activity via subunit exchange between activated and unactivated holoenzymes came from single molecule fluorescence experiments, which monitored colocalization of differently labeled CaMKII under TIRF or by FRET (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Stratton et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bhattacharyya et al., 2016</xref>). These studies identified activation-dependent colocalization of CaMKII subunits. We observed the same, but critically, if we triggered activation normally but then quenched it, before TIRF observation, the colocalization was entirely lost. At least two possibilities exist for obtaining this result. However improbable, subunits that exchanged during the activation period might have re-equilibrated to a low level of colocalization within their respective holoenzymes upon inhibition of the kinase reaction. Such selective reassembly seems far-fetched because our CaMKII<sup>WT</sup> subunits differed only by the identity of the fluorophore at the N-terminus. More likely, subunits did not exchange at all during the kinase reaction, but instead what we and others, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Stratton et al., 2014</xref> have observed is the transient colocalization of holoenzymes during inter-holoenzyme phosphorylation.</p><p>The colocalization of kinase-dead and WT CaMKII subunits was weaker, which is expected if association requires kinase activity, because in this case only half of the sample was competent to perform phosphorylation. Importantly, this interpretation presents little conflict with existing data, which failed to detect colocalization of CaMKII<sup>WT</sup> and CaMKII<sup>WT</sup> incubated with the inhibitor bosutinib, used to mimic kinase-dead CaMKII (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Stratton et al., 2014</xref>). According to our model, the absence of colocalization in CaMKII<sup>WT</sup> inhibited by bosutinib is in the nature of the inhibitor binding, which blocks the ATP-binding site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pellicena and Schulman, 2014</xref>) and stabilizes compact inactive conformation of CaMKII (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chao et al., 2011</xref>). In such a conformation, CaMKII is not able to initiate trans-autophosphorylation, which manifests as a lack of colocalization, like in our TIRF experiments when ATP was omitted.</p><p>We directly probed subunit mixing with a photoactive crosslinker in the hub domain, but could not detect any mixing, nor did the restraint have any effect on kinase activity. The genetically encoded BzF crosslinker is monofunctional, and can capture unlabeled subunits at interfaces within ~5–10 Å (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wittelsberger et al., 2008</xref>). Even though crosslinking of the hub domain by BzF was not saturated, we observed bands of apparent high molecular weight above 0.3 MDa, yet the kinase activity (between untreated and crosslinked enzymes) was identical. In this context, we note that if subunit exchange were a prominent mechanism for spreading activity, then small molecules that stabilized the hub domain should reduce activity. However, binding of the putative CaMKII inhibitor GHB, which was shown to stabilize the hub domain, left substrate phosphorylation and trans-autophosphorylation untouched (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Leurs et al., 2021</xref>). We could detect phosphorylation of CaMKII<sup>KD</sup> by CaMKII<sup>F394BzF</sup>, but we could not detect kinase-dead protein in higher order oligomeric bands on western blot, which were exclusively from CaMKII<sup>F394BzF</sup>. This result matches well with the much more promiscuous crosslinking of lysines by the bifunctional DSS crosslinker, which showed less crosslinking between subunit isotypes from different preparations (N14 vs N15), but abundant crosslinking within isotypes (N14:N14 and N15:N15).</p><p>How do holoenzymes interact during IHP? Crosslinks between heterotypic peptides detected by mass spectrometry were much more prevalent in activating conditions, reporting activity-dependent holoenzyme contacts with a spacing of 10 Å or less. We detected direct capture of substrate-active site peptide interactions (including phosphorylation of T286, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1I &amp; J</xref>). Almost all peptide pairs were detected with an intensity ratio below one, meaning links between homo-isotypes (likely within holoenzymes) were more frequent than links between hetero-isotypes (between holoenzymes). This observation could in principle indicate that heterotypic holoenzymes (composed of mixed N14 and N15 subunits) were present, yet in the minority. However, the profile of crosslinks, being absent in all but the kinase domains for heterotypic links, speaks against the idea of subunit exchange. In particular, almost all crosslinks cover parts of the substrate binding cleft and the catalytic machinery. Heterotypic crosslinks were not detected in the hub domain. The mean ratio for kinase-kinase crosslinks was 25 ± 1% (32 crosslinks in activated conditions, 150 min incubation). If we assume that all heterotypic links come from inter-holoenzyme contacts, IHP might occur at about ¼ the rate of intra-holoenzyme autophosphorylation at 8 µM (in other words, with surprising speed; concentration-dependent phosphorylation was also estimated to be surprisingly fast by western blot see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). The flexible linkers might allow inter-holoenzyme contacts involving multiple kinase domains to act in a ‘cooperative manner’. We illustrate this possibility in our speculative ‘close mode’ involving interdigitated holoenzymes, which reduces crosslink distances substantially (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). These observations further cast doubt on the rule that inter-holoenzyme autophosphorylation cannot occur. If a CaMKII dodecamer with mobile kinase domains were to abundantly phosphorylate its targets and auto-phosphorylate its own domains, but never auto-phosphorylate a neighbor despite being one of the most abundant cytosolic proteins, it should require as yet unknown additional factors which have been absent in all in vitro experiments to date.</p><p>Attempts to analyze the number of CaMKII molecules colocalized under TIRF by photobleaching of well-labeled CaMKII (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Theile et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Elsner et al., 2019</xref>) proved to be unreliable. The large number of subunits present means that shot noise overwhelms the stepwise fluorescence loss during single subunit bleaching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Ulbrich and Isacoff, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2014</xref>). Instead, we used mass photometry to obtain the distribution of molecular weights of CaMKII particles in basal and activating conditions. We detected activation-dependent appearance of particles corresponding to pairs of holoenzymes, supporting the idea that phosphorylation can occur in an inter-holoenzyme fashion (as well as the established intra-holoenzyme reaction). Similarly, self-association of CaMKII has previously been described in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hudmon et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hudmon et al., 2001</xref>), as well as in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hudmon et al., 2005</xref>), where it was linked to ischemia-like conditions of lower pH. CaMKII clustering has also been detected on negative-stain EM grids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Buonarati et al., 2021</xref>), albeit no link to activation was asserted. Although peptides derived from the regulatory segment of CaMKII can break isolated hubs to lower molecular weight subunits in electrospray mass-spectrometry, the effect was absent in solution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Karandur et al., 2020</xref>). Consistent with this, we observed only a very minor fraction of monomer-dimer particles in activating conditions. Keeping in mind that the affinity for holoenzyme assembly is in low nM range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Torres-Ocampo et al., 2020</xref>), an observation that we could replicate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>), and that in the packed environment in dendritic spines, the concentration of CaMKII is in µM range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Otmakhov and Lisman, 2012</xref>), it is likely that CaMKII forms clusters of holoenzymes during activation, where more than two holoenzymes participate, but we did not detect a long tail in the mass distribution corresponding to larger supercomplexes.</p><p>What are the advantages or disadvantages of inter-holoenzyme phosphorylation? First of all, we should consider the dodecameric form of CaMKII. To avoid runaway phosphorylation, inter-holoenzyme phosphorylation requires concurrent phosphatase activity – but this is expected to be provided by PP2A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Colbran, 2004</xref>). Under persistent phosphatase attack, dodecamers can rescue their fully-phosphorylated state and autonomous activity, through intra-holoenzyme trans-autophosphorylation. In contrast, isolated CaMKII subunits in lower order forms (which should exist in the subunit exchange model) would be vulnerable to terminal dephosphorylation, destroying the signal. Gains in reliability may be offset against speed or scope. In principle, subunit exchange in tandem with rapid intra-holoenzyme autophosphorylation could grow CaMKII activity exponentially, albeit with a slower initial rate, because of the time to break and reform dodecamers. Inter-holoenzyme phosphorylation should proceed with a faster initial rate but be less prone to saturate local stocks of holoenzymes. Indeed, measurements in dendrites suggest a steady summation of CaMKII activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tao et al., 2021</xref>), not a runaway exponential wave. Capture of peptides including phosphorylated T286 were only about 8 x less abundant in heterotypes (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1I &amp; J</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). The crosslinks obtained from mass-spectrometry suggest that CaMKII kinase domains are highly dynamic. Therefore, the loss of reaction rate from a lack of proximity might be compensated by the larger degree of freedom for inter-holoenzyme kinase-kinase domain interactions. Cooperative phosphorylation, whereby contacts made during inter-holoenzyme phosphorylation may be augmented by additional interactions, is naturally facilitated by the dodecameric ring architecture. Fixed dodecameric holoenzymes should have a larger fraction of their time to perform downstream signaling, unlike holoenzymes that must first disassemble and reassemble to spread activity. In our model of inter-holoenzyme phosphorylation, active dodecamers are a finished product, whose activity depends only on the rate constants of phosphorylation and stochastic attack of phosphatases. On the basis of this model, we speculate that there should be some dependence of phosphorylation spread on linker length, although we have not measured this. Further work will inform, for example, whether isoforms with short linkers propagate activity more slowly due to steric restrictions.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Expression constructs</title><p>The DNA sequence encoding human <italic>wild-type</italic> CaMKII lacking the first 5 residues, and with a 30-residue linker (CaMKII<sup>WT</sup>), was codon optimized for expression in <italic>E. coli</italic>, and synthesized (GenScript) in the pET28b+plasmid, with flanking restriction sites NcoI and HindIII.

The sample was then added on the coverslip, incubated for 1 min and then rinsed three times with imaging buffer. Coverslips were kept in 1 mL of imaging buffer during imaging. In order to chelate Ca<sup>2+</sup> from CaM, we first incubated Ca<sup>2+</sup>:CaM (where Ca<sup>2+</sup> is at 5 mM) with 15 mM BAPTA for 5 min at room temperature, and then added this mixture to the rest of the reaction. Final concentration of BAPTA was 0.25 mM, prior to putting the sample on the coverslip and washing.</p><p>For chelation of Mg<sup>2+</sup> ions, we first incubated the kinase reaction as usual (see above), and after 5 min we added 10 mM EDTA (to chelate 2 mM Mg<sup>2+</sup>), incubated for 5 min at room temperature, and then added the sample to the coverslip, washed 3 times with imaging buffer and imaged.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>TIRF imaging</title><p>Imaging was performed using a Nikon Ti2 Eclipse microscope with a temperature-controlled stage (set to 37 °C). Excitation light was provided by alternating illumination with 488 nm (diode) and 561 nm (DPSS) lasers housed in an Omicron Lightbox. The laser light was filtered using a quad band notch filter (400-410, 488, 561, 631-640) and reflected through the 60x Apo TIRF 1.49 NA objective by a quad band dichroic filter (zt405/488/561/640 rpc; from set F73-400). Coverslips were illuminated in TIRF mode and the angle was adjusted in software (Nikon NIS elements) as was the motorised stage and autofocus system. Emission light was filtered with 525/40 (488 nm excitation) or 600/52 filters (561 nm excitation, both Semrock). Images were recorded with a Prime95B 22 mm sCMOS camera.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>TIRF image analysis</title><p>Colocalization analysis was done with ImageJ/ FIJI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>) and the colocalization Plug-In &quot;JaCoP&quot; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bolte and Cordelières, 2006</xref>). To remove background, we set the threshold to the top 1% of signal and used it to create an image mask for each channel. These masks were then applied to the original image, to generate thresholded images used for colocalization analysis. In order to quantify the colocalization, the thresholded images were then analysed using ‘JaCoP’ Plug-In in FIJI and the Pearson’s correlation coefficient was calculated. The Pearson’s correlation coefficient is a measure of linear correlation between two sets of data, the value ranging from –1 for negative correlation to 1 for positive correlation. For each condition, five to six data sets were analyzed, from recordings made on multiple days. The significance was calculated using a multi-comparison test (Dunnett’s test) with <italic>α</italic>=0.05 in IgorPro 9.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Mass photometry</title><p>Mass Photometry was performed on Refeyn One<sup>MP</sup> mass photometer. The unactivated samples of CaMKII were prepared by diluting 8 µM CaMKII<sup>WT</sup> in TIRF imaging buffer (25 mM Tris pH 8, 150 mM KCl, 1 mM TCEP) to obtain three different CaMKII stock concentrations – 1.6 µM, 0.4 µM, and 0.04 µM. The recordings were made by diluting 5 µL of each stock sample in 15 µL of imaging buffer, directly on the cover slide. The final concentration of CaMKII<sup>WT</sup> in the drop was 400 nM, 100 nM and 10 nM, respectively. Each dilution was measured three times. Activated sample was obtained by incubating 8 µM CaMKII<sup>WT</sup>, 1.5 µM Ca<sup>2+</sup>:CaM, 1 mM ATP, 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> in imaging buffer. The sample was left incubating for 5 min at room temperature before stock dilutions were made with 1.6 µM, 0.4 µM and 0.04 µM final CaMKII<sup>WT</sup> by diluting the original incubation reaction in imaging buffer. Each sample dilution was measured three times, by diluting 5 µL of stock sample in 15 µL imaging buffer. The same procedure was repeated for CaMKII<sup>K42R/D135N</sup>-AviTag.</p><p>Percentages of monomers participating in each peak were calculated in the following way: first peak area percentages were calculated for each peak. Then, the number of monomers for each peak was calculated with respect to the area percentage. Finally, the percentage of monomers in each peak was calculated based on total particles identified in each measurement. We used IgorPro9 multipeak fitting function to fit the peaks obtained by the instrument. Here is an example of the calculation used for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>: Peak area % (calculated by the fitting software) for each peak is 4.7% for the 2-mer, 85.9% for the 12-mer, and 9.4% for the 24-mer. These are percentages of particles detected, not monomers. To calculate in terms of monomers, we multiplied each peak area % with the number of subunits and got 4.7x2 = 9.4 for 2-mer, 85.9x12 = 1030.8 for 12-mer and 9.4x24 = 225.6 for 24-mer. We summed these to obtain the total monomer number (1265.8) detected in this measurement. We obtained the fraction of monomers in each of the three peaks with respect to total number of particles, corresponding in this case to 0.7%, 81.5% and 17.8% of the monomers in the sample, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Preparation of samples for mass spectrometry</title><p>First, proteins were exchanged into HEPES containing buffer (25 mM HEPES pH 8, 250 mM NaCl, 1% glycerol, 1 mM TCEP) using PD-10 Sephadex desalting column (GE Healthcare).

kinase, CaMKII, can be phosphorylated by another molecule of the holoenzyme in a manner that does not involve subunit exchange. The evidence for the main conclusion is compelling, and supported by several independent experiments. If independently confirmed in the future, the study will stand as having provided a novel regulatory mechanism for the autophosphorylation of this kinase.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Volker Dötsch as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in the review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Karl Ulrich Bayer (Reviewer #1); M Neal Waxham (Reviewer #2); Margaret Stratton (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Two reviewers acknowledge that the manuscript provides novel insight into the mechanism by which CaMKII activity is transferred to the naïve molecule and that the findings are of broad interest to the neuroscience community. However, the discussion among all reviewers raises the following issues:</p><p>1) All reviewers agree that the title should be toned down. This is because the title makes claims that go beyond the assessment that trans-phosphorylation can occur between holoenzymes. The title suggested by the reviewers is &quot;CaMKII autophosphorylation can occur between holoenzymes without subunit exchange&quot;. It is important to include &quot;without subunit exchange&quot; in the title because this will help all readers to find related papers through search engines. You may find an alternative from the reviewer's suggestions below.</p><p>2) Regarding subunit exchange, reviewers 1 and 2 believe that their conclusion is sufficiently supported by the current multi-pronged experimental evidence. Reviewer 3 would also concede that subunit exchange indeed does not occur under conditions in the manuscript but has some specific technical concerns that make some parts of the experimental evidence less compelling in her view.</p><p>3) All reviewers agree that it would be good to have the specific technical concerns and caveats listed in the public review. This should enable the reader to come up with a balanced evaluation of the strength of the evidence (and may help future investigations in the matter).</p><p>We would like you to respond to the reviewer's comments below.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This is Ulli Bayer, from the University of Colorado. I love the entire paper. Well, with the exception of the title. I would strongly suggest changing it. (Although this is of course entirely at the discretion of the authors). The reason why I love this paper is that it nicely and comprehensively debunks a myth about the propagation of pT286, i.e. the subunit exchange model. (I actually recently read the corresponding manuscript on bioRxiv and had meant to email to communicate as much, but then I was asked by <italic>eLife</italic> to provide a formal review). The reason why I don't like the current title is that it creates a new myth. Notably, to fix this sufficiently, not much else than the title would need to be changed.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>A few clarifications and interpretative issues are suggested below to improve the paper.</p><p>One global point the authors should address is the idea of runaway IHP. The subunit exchange model is inherently self-limiting, where only replaced subunits would be subject to intraholoenzyme phosphorylation. This is not the case with IHP. Presumably, this could lead, perhaps quickly, to a situation where all holoenzymes within a local environment would exist in a phosphorylated state. On Page 14, lines 484-486, the authors take a step in this direction, but it doesn't confront the problem of potentially feeding forward autophosphorylation. Perhaps the authors are counting on the idea of an activating stimulus being necessary to drive IHP. If so, should be clearer about this thinking.</p><p>As an aside, no comment was made for the absence of CaM-bound forms of the kinase-dead holoenzyme (Figure S13). Some comment should be made on why this might be. Mass photometry is clearly sensitive enough, and presumably, the mutations used to create the kinase-dead mutant do not influence ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM-binding. Are the CaM-binding properties of this double kinase-dead mutant known?</p><p>I could not identify in the legends how many times experiments were done, how many replicates within the experiment were completed, where are the error bars, etc. This should be made clearer in the legends for each figure. There is also shading in the line plots e.g., Figure 1D in blue, what is this meant to represent?</p><p>In Figure 1, Panel D the first time point already shows a 50% P/Pmax, why were reactions not terminated at shorter time points? It's hard to take the t<sub>1/2</sub> seriously from this plot when the first data point looks to be at half-saturation.</p><p>On page 2, lines 57 and 58 – a note is made to the Lee et al. study, 2022. The statement is incorrect. The cited study does not study protein turnover it studies the approximate lifetime of CaMKII autophosphorylation.</p><p>On page 8, lines 254-256, the authors describe types of interactions from their cross-linking data that differ when compared to the Chao et al., linkerless CaMKII crystal structure, and the Myers et al., EM with linker CaMKII structure. I do not fully follow what is meant by interactions differ. Chao et al. described relatively tight interactions of the catalytic domain with the hub, but Myers et al. did not. The authors should make a more direct link to the comparison of their drawings for the reader.</p><p>On page 9, lines 292-294 the authors are describing the results of CaMKII holoenzyme interactions as being activity-dependent (agreed) and transient. First, no kinetics are done, so it might be good to constrain this terminology to the time frame of the experiment. But further, the lifetime of the CaMKII-CaMKII interaction is clearly long-enough to be captured by the process of diluting and binding the sample to the coverslips for subsequent analysis. While no specific claims are being made as to the lifetime, it must not be as transient as this statement might imply or the pairs of holoenzymes would have dissociated during preparation for imaging.</p><p>On page 13, lines 446-449, the authors comment on the unreliability of step photobleaching and relate that to shot noise preventing an accurate measurement. This comment is important for interpreting the data in the present manuscript in comparison to earlier studies using similar approaches to address the subunit exchange hypothesis (Stratton et al., 1996). This argument would be more convincing if the authors supply some of their photobleaching attempts in the SI that highlight how the measurements are compromised.</p><p>On page 20, lines 697-698, please provide the extinction coefficients used to make these calculations of labeling efficiency.</p><p>The title for Figure 2 legend – &quot;Restricting CaMKII mobility…&quot; does not seem an accurate statement. Perhaps more direct? Cross-linking CaMKII subunits does not….?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>As stated in my public review, my major concerns are with UV crosslinking and TIRF microscopy. In my view, the results of these experiments are confounded by the way the experiments are set up and analyzed.</p><p>For the crosslinking – can the efficiency be increased? Or can the experimenters purify the 6mer crosslinked species and use this for their experiments? As it stands, Figure 2 and Figure 3 are not convincing due to low crosslinking.</p><p>The blue arrows indicating bands in Figure 3 are very unclear – these images need to be processed so that the reader can actually see these bands.</p><p>On a related note, since your crosslinking is incomplete, the argument for inter-holoenzyme phosphorylation is weakened. If the crosslinking is improved and you can show similar rates of transphosphorylation, this will be significantly stronger data.</p><p>For the single-molecule experiments, single particles (ROIs) should be selected based on threshold, shape, and size using the General Analysis module in Nikon software, since that's the type of microscope you're using. You should set minimum and maximum thresholds to ensure that you're analyzing a similar population of particles. If you're unable to select single particles for analysis, then this is not single molecule resolution and the experiment should be repeated at lower concentrations or on cleaner coverslides (whatever the issue may be). The images shown in the main paper appear not to be well-resolved, but some images in the supplement do look well-resolved, this just needs to be analyzed properly and ensure that the microscope is properly aligned. If you're able to analyze the intensities of single particles, this should be plotted as a histogram. According to your model, the histogram of particles under basal conditions should correspond to a single holoenzyme, under activation conditions, the intensities should correspond to a double holoenzyme (as you see a small population of these in MP), and after EGTA treatment the intensities should again correspond to a single holoenzyme. The authors claim 80-90% labeling efficiency but should explain how this is determined – because if this is true I would expect homogenous particles that are quite bright (12-14 fluorophores) under basal conditions.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.86090.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) All reviewers agree that the title should be toned down.

No phosphatase was added. We assume that in the cell, phosphatases are also acting on CaMKII to dephosphorylate it (constantly) and in this way keep the brake on runaway IHP. On the other hand, processes controlled by CaMKII, like long-term potentiation, require long-term spread of the initial signal (Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal). It is plausible to consider that spread of CaMKII phosphorylation, allowed by IHP, would be necessary for a more stable maintenance or amplification of the initial signal in the presence of phosphatases. We added some lines to this effect in the discussion line 505-507.</p><p>We will continue to explore the molecular details of this hypothesis in future work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>As an aside, no comment was made for the absence of CaM-bound forms of the kinase-dead holoenzyme (Figure S13).

When Calmodulin is omitted from the phosphorylation reaction, the phosphorylation on CaMKII<sup>KD</sup> does not occur (Figure 7—figure supplement 2C).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I could not identify in the legends how many times experiments were done, how many replicates within the experiment were completed, where are the error bars, etc. This should be made clearer in the legends for each figure.

The kinase assays were done in triplicate (technical replicates) in each experiments, but also as “biological” replicates (done with different protein preparations, on different days). The mixing experiments from Figure 3 were done twice (with kinase-dead and wild-type protein). The crosslinking mass spectrometry was done in duplicates (each condition was performed two times on different days, and analyzed two times). Mass photometry was done in triplicates (technical replicates) but also several times with different protein preparations on different days. We have now added the numbers of replicates in the legends of each Figure, as well as to the Materials and Methods part of the manuscript. The shading represents error bars. We are sorry for not being clear enough, and we now clarified this in the Figure legends.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Figure 1, Panel D the first time point already shows a 50% P/Pmax, why were reactions not terminated at shorter time points? It's hard to take the t<sub>1/2</sub> seriously from this plot when the first data point looks to be at half-saturation.</p></disp-quote><p>This is simply because of the technical nature of the experiment. Each time point was done in triplicate and conditions with high or low Calmodulin concentration were done at the same time for each time point (please see M and M section “Kinase assay with purified proteins”). The reaction was started in all tubes at the same time by adding ATP. The reactions were then stopped by adding STOP buffer at indicated time points (1, 2, 5, 10, 15, 30, 60 min). One minute is the shortest time point which could accommodate all these steps with reasonable accuracy. We could have tried 30 second, but shorter than that would be difficult to accommodate all the steps involved in starting and stopping the reaction, which include: putting the tips on the multichannel pipette, taking up ATP, dispensing ATP, shortly mixing by pipetting up and down a few times, discarding the tips, putting on new tips, taking up the STOP buffer, dispensing it and mixing it well for all 6 samples (triplicates of the same time point for 2 different Calmodulin concentrations) at the same time.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>On page 2, lines 57 and 58 – a note is made to the Lee et al. study, 2022. The statement is incorrect. The cited study does not study protein turnover it studies the approximate lifetime of CaMKII autophosphorylation.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct. The study indeed studies the approximate lifetime of CaMKII autophosphorylation, but one of the conclusions (indeed the title of the paper) is that the autophosphorylation outlives the known CaMKII protein turnover. The authors of this study measure CaMKII activity (using LTP as a read-out) to be present for 2 weeks in cultured brain slices, but the turnover of CaMKII molecules is 5-6 days. We modified the text around line 59 to acknowledge this distinction.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>On page 8, lines 254-256, the authors describe types of interactions from their cross-linking data that differ when compared to the Chao et al., linkerless CaMKII crystal structure, and the Myers et al., EM with linker CaMKII structure.

The same goes for the crystal structure in which the CaMKII holoenzyme is often described as a compact “rock”, while our crosslinking MS data show that the interactions within a holoenzyme are much more dynamic. The overall message of this passage should be that the holoenzyme is a highly dynamic structure, and we adjusted the text accordingly (please see the text around line 282).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>On page 9, lines 292-294 the authors are describing the results of CaMKII holoenzyme interactions as being activity-dependent (agreed) and transient.

We adjusted the text around line 330 to be clearer.

At the moment, we do see steps but cannot count them beyond a few. This is entirely predicted by previous work (subunit counting above about 5 is really difficult). The purpose of our comment is to make it clear that this is not a trivial measurement when 12 or 24 subunits are involved.

One of the criteria was that the BzF mutant elutes from the Size exclusion column as a dodecamer, assuring that the introduction of the BzF residue on its own did not compromise the interactions in the hub necessary to maintain the intact holoenzyme. We showed two of the best candidates in this paper (F394BzF and H418BzF), and neither of them showed slower phosphorylation kinetics upon crosslinking. We agree it would be great to purify the 6-mers, but this is not feasible in our hands, because these mutants form dodecamers in solution, and therefore always elute as 12-mers from the SEC column, regardless of UV exposure. If the subunits would mix during phosphorylation, as the prevailing mechanism for the spread of kinase activity (phosphorylation on T286 in kinase-dead protein) – we would expect to detect at least a portion of CaMKII<sup>KD</sup>-AviTag in our phosphorylation mixtures, as the kinase-dead protein is clearly getting abundantly phosphorylated by wild-type protein (Figure 2). But we could not detect an appreciable amount of CaMKII<sup>KD</sup> integrated in CaMKII<sup>F394BzF</sup> holoenzymes (Figure 3).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The blue arrows indicating bands in Figure 3 are very unclear – these images need to be processed so that the reader can actually see these bands.</p></disp-quote><p>We have processed these images now, in order to make the bands more visible.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>On a related note, since your crosslinking is incomplete, the argument for inter-holoenzyme phosphorylation is weakened.

Each of these methods failed to detect subunits mixing, which taken together with the UV-induced crosslinking experiments makes a compelling argument for inter-holoenzyme phosphorylation as the main mechanism for spread of CaMKII phosphorylation, and therefore activity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>For the single-molecule experiments, single particles (ROIs) should be selected based on threshold, shape, and size using the General Analysis module in Nikon software, since that's the type of microscope you're using.

We worked on this already quite a lot and continue to do so with new experiments.

We don’t think we have single molecules (and we now removed reference to single molecules). We have groups of molecules.</p><p>We did some experiments at lower concentrations, and saw no differences. But we are almost at the low concentration limit in any case (55 nM).</p><p>As for plotting a histogram of particle intensities, we have tried to do this in the past. Again the problem is that we probably don’t have 12-mers and 24-mers, but rather groups of holoenyzmes. The key point is that the overlap of distinct coloured spots that we see with activity is reversibly lost. This point is quite decisive in our view, because the experiment (and therefore its interpretation) is very simple.</p><p>We have now improved our explanation of the labelling efficiency, please see around the line 757 in the manuscript.</p></body></sub-article></article>
