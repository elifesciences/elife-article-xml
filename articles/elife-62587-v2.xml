genetic diversity and compatibility. The convergent evolution of self-fertilization in three <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> species provides a powerful lens to examine causes and consequences of mating system transitions. Among the selfers, <italic>Caenorhabditis tropicalis</italic> is the least genetically diverse and most afflicted by outbreeding depression. We generated a chromosomal-scale genome for <italic>C. tropicalis</italic> and surveyed global diversity. Population structure is very strong, and islands of extreme divergence punctuate a genomic background that is highly homogeneous around the globe. Outbreeding depression in the laboratory is caused largely by multiple Medea-like elements, genetically consistent with maternal toxin/zygotic antidote systems. Loci with Medea activity harbor novel and duplicated genes, and their activity is modified by mito-nuclear background. Segregating Medea elements dramatically reduce fitness, and simulations show that selfing limits their spread. Frequent selfing in <italic>C. tropicalis</italic> may therefore be a strategy to avoid Medea-mediated outbreeding depression.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>caenorhabditis tropicalis</kwd><kwd>selfing</kwd><kwd>mating systems</kwd><kwd>balancing selection</kwd><kwd>gene drive</kwd><kwd>population genetics</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000066</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ES029930</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Baugh</surname><given-names>L Ryan</given-names></name><name><surname>Andersen</surname><given-names>Erik C</given-names></name><name><surname>Rockman</surname><given-names>Matthew V</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM089972</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rockman</surname><given-names>Matthew V</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM121828</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rockman</surname><given-names>Matthew V</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>New York University College of Arts and Sciences Dean’s Undergraduate Research Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yuen</surname><given-names>John</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004794</institution-id><institution>Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Braendle</surname><given-names>Christian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000780</institution-id><institution>European Commission</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>H2020-MSCA-IF-2017–798083</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Noble</surname><given-names>Luke M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Out breeding depression in <italic>Caenorhabditis tropicalis</italic> is due to common maternal-offspring incompatibilities that interact with a highly heterogeneous genetic background and may provide a short-term advantage to inbreeding.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Sex and outcrossing are common, but costly, and taxa have repeatedly evolved mating systems to avoid them. Such transitions set the advantages of selfing, such as reproductive assurance, against long-term adaptability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Otto, 2009</xref>). Selfing has profound consequences for evolution due to changes in effective recombination, homozygosity, and migration, leading to a net reduction in effective population size. Mixed mating systems, combining some form of selfing with occasional outcrossing, are a frequent compromise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Chelo et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Cutter, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Escobar et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Goodwillie et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Igic and Kohn, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Jarne and Auld, 2006</xref>).</p><p>Variation in mating systems is especially familiar in plants, but has also been one of the longstanding attractions of nematode biology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Nigon and Félix, 2017</xref>). Just within Rhabditidae, this aspect of life history now spans systems with separate males and females (gonochorism), males and self-fertile hermaphrodites (androdioecy; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Kanzaki et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Mayer et al., 2007</xref>), males, females, and hermaphrodites (trioecy; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Chaudhuri et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Kanzaki et al., 2017</xref>), asexual reproduction where sperm does not contribute genetic material (parthenogenesis, gynogenesis; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Fradin et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Grosmaire et al., 2019</xref>), and alternating generations of hermaphroditism and dioecy (heterogony; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Kiontke, 2005</xref>). Within the <italic>Caenorhabditis genus</italic>, the androdioecious system of males and self-fertilizing hermaphrodites has evolved three times independently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ellis, 2017</xref>). Hermaphrodites are morphologically female, but during larval development they generate and store sperm for use as adults. Hermaphrodites cannot mate with one another, and in the absence of males all reproduction is by self-fertilization.</p><p><italic>Caenorhabditis tropicalis</italic> was identified by Marie-Anne Félix in 2008 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Kiontke et al., 2011</xref>), and investigations of its reproductive biology have shed light on the mechanistic basis of transitions to selfing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib138">Wei et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib148">Zhao et al., 2018</xref>). However, a comprehensive reference genome for the species is lacking and relatively little is known of its biology and ecology. Global sampling indicates a more restricted range than that of the other selfers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Félix, 2020</xref>), and the single study of <italic>C. tropicalis</italic> population genetics and reproductive compatibility found extremely low levels of genetic diversity at a handful of loci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Gimond et al., 2013</xref>). Crosses among, and sometimes within, locales revealed outbreeding depression, a result common to the selfers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baird and Stonesifer, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Dolgin et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Ross et al., 2011</xref>) but in stark contrast to gonochoristic species, where estimated diversity is often orders of magnitude higher and inbreeding depression can be severe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Barrière et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Dolgin et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Gimond et al., 2013</xref>). Outbreeding depression was particularly acute in <italic>C. tropicalis</italic>, with embryonic lethality and developmentally abnormal F<sub>2</sub> progeny common among certain hybrid crosses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Gimond et al., 2013</xref>). Male mating ability was also found to be generally poor, though highly variable, which together with low genetic diversity suggests an especially high rate of selfing.</p><p>Theoretical explanations for the evolution of selfing consider a balance between benefits and costs. Classical models start with the doubling of reproductive rate achieved by selfers (through the elimination of males in the case of <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic>) and note that selfing will evolve when the reduction in reproduction due to inbreeding depression is less than one half (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Cutter, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Goodwillie et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Lande and Schemske, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Lively and Lloyd, 1990</xref>). Subsequent work has added a variety of factors on both sides of the balance. Selfing has benefits for reproductive assurance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Baker, 1955</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib128">Theologidis et al., 2014</xref>), allowing a single individual to colonize a new environment, and it allows for rapid adaptation when traits are jointly determined by maternal and zygotic genotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Drown and Wade, 2014</xref>). On the other hand, selfing slows adaptation to new environments or pathogens by reducing recombination and genetic diversity, while increasing the load of weakly deleterious mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Cutter, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Kamran-Disfani and Agrawal, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Morran et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Morran et al., 2011</xref>). Many features of the selective environment (e.g., stabilizing vs. directional) and the genetic architecture of fitness (e.g., recessive deleterious variation vs. overdominance as the cause of inbreeding depression) shape the balance of factors, and vary among species and populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Goodwillie et al., 2005</xref>). The ledger of relevant factors runs long, but as we show, it may still be incomplete.</p><p>To study the causes and effects of mating system evolution in Caenorhabditis, we assembled a chromosome-scale genome for <italic>C. tropicalis</italic>, oriented by linkage data from recombinant inbred lines (RILs). We show with short-read mapping against this reference that the population structure of a global sample of isolates is very strong, which is an expected side-effect of selfing. We also find extreme heterogeneity in the distribution of genetic diversity across the genome. Finally, we investigate the causes of strong outbreeding depression, another expected side-effect of selfing, in a cross between divergent isolates. Widespread outbreeding depression observed in the three species of selfing Caenorhabditis has been interpreted as evidence for the well-understood process of Dobzhansky–Muller epistasis. Here, we show that it is due largely to a different process in <italic>C. tropicalis</italic>: maternal-effect haplotypes that kill offspring that do not inherit them. Haplotypes that behave in this way are known as Medea elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Beeman et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Beeman and Friesen, 1999</xref>), and they represent a form of post-zygotic gene drive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Price et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib136">Wade and Beeman, 1994</xref>). Medeas impose severe fitness costs on heterozygous mothers, and we hypothesize that these elements select for a high selfing rate in <italic>C. tropicalis</italic>, by adding another factor to the balance on the side of selfing. In other words, frequent selfing may be a consequence of outbreeding depression as much as its cause.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Heritable variation in outcrossing rates</title><p>To better understand variation in outcrossing in <italic>C. tropicalis</italic>, we tested a global sample of five isolates for their propensity or ability to outcross. For each of these strains, from Hawaii, Panama, French Guiana, Cape Verde, and Réunion Island, we assayed the probability that an individual would produce cross-progeny when paired with a single individual of the other sex. Mating success was scored as a binary trait, with crosses scored as successfully mated if multiple male offspring were observed on the plate. This scoring system allowed for the possibility of rare male offspring to be produced by X nondisjunction in hermaphrodites, which typically occurs at a low rate (~1% or lower, see below). All factorial crosses produced progeny, but strains varied significantly in their propensity to outcross, both as males and as hermaphrodites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We also observed interaction effects, where the average crossing probability of male and hermaphrodite strains was not predictive of the success of the strains in combination. At one extreme, the pairing of JU1373 hermaphrodites from Réunion with JU1630 males from Cape Verde yielded no cross-progeny from 22 trials, while at the other extreme, Hawaiian QG131 hermaphrodites and South American NIC58 males yielded cross-progeny in each of 34 trials. Male crossing probability was much more variable than that of hermaphrodites, consistent with relaxed selection (residual deviance of 179.2 vs. 85.2, null deviance 232.6, binomial linear model) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Cutter, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Jalinsky et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Noble et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Palopoli et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib133">van der Kooi and Schwander, 2014</xref>). Same-strain pairings were indistinguishable from inter-strain pairings (p=0.88, likelihood ratio test [LRT] of binomial linear models). This analysis shows that wild isolates of <italic>C. tropicalis</italic>, and males in particular, vary greatly in their propensity or ability to outcross.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Outcrossing dynamics.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Outcrossing probability in reciprocal crosses. Mating success was scored as a binary trait in 22–34 trials (biological replicates) per cross.

We founded single-strain populations with three hermaphrodites and five males, allowed them to expand, and then serially transferred their descendants for 10 generations under standard lab conditions. This experiment tests additional components of fitness, such as fecundity, in a continuously expanding population. At the end, two strains, JU1630 and JU1373, had lost males and were reproducing solely by selfing; these are the strains with the lowest cross success in our single-worm pairings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The other strains retained males at frequencies of 20–40%. This dichotomy resembles that seen among <italic>C. elegans</italic> strains, where some strains become exclusive selfers, while others can maintain high rates of outcrossing in simple environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Stewart and Phillips, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib126">Teotónio et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib127">Teotonio et al., 2012</xref>).

RILs were derived from a cross between a JU1373 hermaphrodite and a NIC58 male, by selfing F<sub>2</sub> hermaphrodites from a single F<sub>1</sub> for 10 generations. We genotyped lines by shotgun sequencing, called diallelic single nucleotide variants (SNVs), and inferred parental ancestry by Hidden Markov Model, using data for 119 RILs for genetic map estimation. During RIL construction, 12.2% of lines did not survive, consistent with outbreeding depression. The genotypes of the surviving RILs revealed strong transmission ratio distortion favoring JU1373 alleles at two loci on chromosomes III and V (Figure 5), which we return to later.</p><p>Using the RIL recombination data to evaluate assemblies, we selected one of five fully concordant with the genetic data. We then closed gaps of estimated 0 cM distance, using junction-spanning sequences in other assemblies, followed by local long-read mapping. Five gaps of greater than 0 cM remain, which will require longer reads to resolve. The resulting nuclear genome assembly comprised 81.3 Mb in 15 sequences. The X chromosome assembled as a single contig, and all other chromosomes were oriented genetically into pseudochromosomes. We assembled a 13,935 bp mitochondrial genome from short-reads, followed by circular extension with long-reads. To better assess genetic variation between the RIL founder strains, we also assembled draft nuclear (81 Mb span, 4.2 Mb NG50) and mitochondrial (13,911 bp) genomes for JU1373 from similar read data (see Materials and methods; we did not attempt to bring this assembly to pseudochromosomes here). We annotated nuclear genomes using mixed-stage short-read RNAseq data, calling 21,210 protein-coding genes for NIC58 and 20,829 for JU1373, and we annotated the mitochondrial genomes by homology. Thus, this pipeline provided a high-quality assembly for NIC58 and a highly contiguous draft genome for JU1373.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Surveying genetic diversity worldwide</title><p><italic>C. tropicalis</italic> is widely distributed within 25° of the Equator and absent outside this region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Félix, 2020</xref>).

Though not directly comparable, the genome-wide estimate of nucleotide diversity provided here is around three times higher (genotype set 1, median value across 20 kb windows = 0.00097), with mitochondrial diversity higher again as expected (0.0038). These values likely underestimate species-wide variation because of short-read mapping bias – we adjust for missing data, but missing data may not, in fact, be missing from genomes. Indeed, we found rampant missingness in our data; up to 1.3% of the NIC58-alignable fraction of the genome lacks aligned reads among any single isolate, and 7.8% of the alignable genome lacks reads in at least one (considering only those with &gt;25 × mapped and paired reads, for which missing data and sequencing depth are uncorrelated, <italic>r</italic> = 0.13, p=0.65).

Yet simple genetic incompatibility between two nuclear loci is not expected to favor one parental allele to the exclusion of the other. Exclusion of one parental allele can occur, however, if an allele from the male parent (NIC58) is incompatible with the mitochondrial genome of the hermaphrodite parent (JU1373). Under this scenario, RILs homozygous for the male parent allele at loci showing transmission ratio distortion should be sub-viable or sub-fertile. We examined RILs of such genotypes and found that their growth characteristics were superficially normal, with 93.1–98.3% (n = 151–679) of embryos developing into adults with parental developmental timing (Figure 7A). This finding indicated that the cause of transmission ratio distortion was more complex than a simple mitochondrial-nuclear incompatibility between these NIC58 alleles and JU1373 mitochondria.</p></sec><sec id="s2-9"><title>Transmission ratio distortion and excess heterozygosity are caused by Medea loci</title><p>An alternative explanation for transmission ratio distortion among RILs is that the distorted loci independently exhibit post-zygotic killing dynamics, similar to those seen in <italic>C. elegans</italic> at the <italic>zeel-1/peel-1</italic> and <italic>pha-1/sup-35</italic> loci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ben-David et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Seidel et al., 2008</xref>). At these loci, a maternal- or paternal-effect locus loads a toxin into eggs or sperm that poisons zygotic development; subsequent zygotic expression from the same locus provides an antidote (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ben-David et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Seidel et al., 2011</xref>). Independent of the precise mechanism, loci with this pattern of parental-by-zygotic genetics of lethality are classified as Medea-type elements, named (in part) for their maternal-effect dominant embryonic arrest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Beeman et al., 1992</xref>). We show below that the <italic>C. tropicalis</italic> distorted loci fit this mode of inheritance, and broaden the Medea classification here to encompass post-embryonic arrest. A Medea model predicts that the JU1373 genome is homozygous for two independent Medea haplotypes, on chromosomes III and V, each encoding a hypothetical toxin-antidote pair. (In our analysis of this model we describe it as a toxin-antidote system for convenience, though the underlying mechanism of maternal-effect dominant lethality and zygotic-effect dominant rescue may be different.) Under this model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>), all F<sub>2</sub> progeny from a NIC58 × JU1373 cross will be exposed to toxins, but only some will inherit antidotes; animals not inheriting both antidotes will suffer the effects, manifesting as embryonic or larval arrest, sterility, or some other phenotype that would have prevented them from contributing to the RILs. The proportion of F<sub>2</sub>s showing such phenotypes is expected to be around 44% (7/16), assuming that arrest by each toxin is fully penetrant and rescuable by a single copy of the corresponding antidote. Given the presence among RILs of rare NIC58 homozygotes at each of the two transmission ratio distortion loci, penetrance must be less than 100%, and so the proportion of affected F<sub>2</sub> progeny should be less than 44%.</p><p>To test whether F<sub>2</sub> populations from a NIC58 × JU1373 cross showed phenotypes consistent with two Medea-like loci, we made reciprocal crosses, allowed F<sub>1</sub> hermaphrodites to self-fertilize, and followed F<sub>2</sub> progeny from embryo to adulthood. We observed that far fewer F<sub>2</sub> embryos developed into adults within the normal developmental time than expected from the two-Medea model (41–45%, n = 329–1283, versus 98–99%, n = 1046–1093, for parental strains). Terminal phenotypes among abnormal F<sub>2</sub> animals included failure to hatch (9%), early larval arrest (39–41%), late larval arrest (5–9%), and abnormally small, thin adults (5%, n = 329–381); these phenotype frequencies did not differ according to the direction of the cross that generated the F<sub>1</sub> worm (Fisher’s exact test, p=0.39). These data show that F<sub>2</sub> populations experienced widespread developmental arrest, at proportions higher than expected under a model of two Medea loci. One interpretation is that the total arrest proportion among F<sub>2</sub> individuals reflects the effects of two Medea loci (&lt;44% of F<sub>2</sub> animals), plus additional background incompatibilities (&gt;12–15% of F<sub>2</sub> animals).</p><p>The two-Medea model predicts that developmental arrest among F<sub>2</sub> animals will preferentially affect those homozygous for non-Medea (NIC58) alleles. To test this prediction, we repeated reciprocal NIC58 × JU1373 crosses and genotyped F<sub>2</sub> progeny (including arrested or dead larvae) at markers tightly linked to the transmission ratio distortion peaks on chromosomes III and V. We observed that alleles at both loci were transmitted to progeny in Mendelian proportions, showing that meiosis and fertilization are not affected by the loci and that distortion is due to postzygotic lethality. Certain genotypes were associated with developmental arrest, but these differed depending on the direction of the cross (i.e., mitochondrial genotype). For the chromosome III locus, NIC58 homozygotes underwent complete developmental arrest in the mito-JU1373 cross but very little developmental arrest, compared to other genotypes, in the mito-NIC58 cross (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). For the chromosome V locus, NIC58 homozygotes experienced highly penetrant developmental arrest in both crosses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Chromosome V JU1373 homozygotes also experienced developmental arrest in both crosses, but with a lower penetrance, especially in the mito-JU1373 cross (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). This pattern supports a model of two Medea loci, but implies that the loci interact with mitochondrial genotype: for the locus on chromosome III, the Medea allele (JU1373) is active in its own mitochondrial background but inactive or very weakly active in the opposite mitochondrial background; for the locus on chromosome V, both alleles (JU1373 and NIC58) act as Medea elements and are effectively antagonistic – JU1373 acts strongly in both mitochondrial backgrounds, whereas NIC58 acts strongly in its own mitochondrial background and more weakly in the opposite mitochondrial background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Importantly, this finding of antagonistic haplotypes at the chromosome V locus provides a simple explanation for the retention of heterozygosity at this locus among the RILs, since both classes of homozygous segregants from a hermaphrodite heterozygous for the chromosome V locus arrest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Medea genetics.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Percentage of F<sub>2</sub> progeny from reciprocal NIC58 × JU1373 crosses showing wild-type development.

One model for this pattern is that any animal homozygous for the JU1373 chromosome V locus in the mito-NIC58 background suffers a fitness cost due to a mito-nuclear incompatibility, independent of Medea effects. Alternatively, there is no such intrinsic incompatibility, and instead the mitochondrial background modifies the penetrance of the NIC58 chromosome V Medea, with effects manifest in the offspring of chromosome V heterozygotes. The fitness of JU1373 V homozygotes in a mito-NIC58 background should be reduced under the mitochondrial-nuclear incompatibility model, independent of the genotypes of their parents. We therefore attempted to isolate this genotype by crossing males of RIL QG2514 to NIC58, producing an F<sub>2</sub> population segregating at the chromosome V locus but fixed for the NIC58 haplotype at the chromosome III locus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). We recovered 10 F<sub>2</sub> animals homozygous for the JU1373 V allele in a mito-NIC58 background. These animals produced progeny that were superficially wild type, with typical brood sizes and developmental rates. This finding excludes simple mitochondrial-nuclear incompatibility as a contributor to developmental arrest of chromosome V JU1373 homozygotes. We conclude that differences in arrest according to mitochondrial genotype reflect greater activity of the NIC58 Medea on chromosome V in a mito-NIC58 background than in a mito-JU1373 background. We also conclude that activity of the NIC58 Medea in the mito-JU1373 background is likely dependent on additional nuclear background factors, thus accounting for heterozygosity in the RILs being preferentially retained in certain genetic backgrounds (e.g., in animals with JU1373 alleles on the left arm of chromosome I). Finally, we note that similar conclusions (mitochondrial × parental × zygotic interactions, not simple mitochondrial × zygotic incompatibility) can be inferred for the chromosome III locus, given the wild-type development observed in the subset of RILs homozygous for the NIC58 chromosome III locus in the mito-JU1373 background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Thus, lethality in <italic>C. tropicalis</italic> is not caused by simple mitochondrial × zygotic incompatibilities, although two of the three Medea elements are more active in the mitochondrial background of their parental strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Medea loci act independently and by maternal effect.</title><p>(<bold>A and B</bold>) Percentages of F<sub>2</sub> or backcross progeny that reached adulthood within 72 hr of egg laying.

To test this prediction, we examined RILs with opposite parental genotypes at the two loci. Each RIL was crossed to an appropriate parental strain to generate F<sub>2</sub> animals segregating opposite alleles at one Medea locus but fixed at the other, which we scored for development. To provide a control for (non-Medea) background incompatibilities, we repeated this analysis for F<sub>2</sub> populations fixed for JU1373 alleles at both Medea loci. These controls were generated by crossing 10 RILs carrying JU1373 alleles at both Medea loci to a JU1373-derived strain carrying a Dumpy mutation, which allows us to distinguish cross-progeny from self-progeny, a constant issue for JU1373 with its low rate of crossing by hermaphrodites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). We observed that crosses segregating only the chromosome III Medea in a mito-JU1373 background showed median rates of normal development consistent with Medea activity at a single locus (68–75%, n = 218–240); crosses in a mito-NIC58 background showed no such activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). The arrested progeny in the mito-JU1373 background largely consisted of chromosome III NIC58 homozygotes, as evidenced by these animals being severely depleted among wild-type progeny (26:64:2 JJ:JN:NN genotypes), while the wild-type progeny of the reciprocal cross carried chromosome III genotypes at their expected Mendelian proportions (30:57:31). These data show that the chromosome III Medea is active in the absence of segregation at the chromosome V locus, and confirm that the chromosome III Medea requires a mito-JU1373 genetic background. The lethality associated with chromosome III therefore represents a three-way interaction between parental nuclear genotype, zygotic nuclear genotype, and a mitochondrial locus.</p><p>Crosses segregating only at the chromosome V locus showed median rates of normal development that were similar across mitochondrial backgrounds and consistent with antagonistic Medea activity at a single locus (54–61%, n = 203–321, in a mito-JU1373 background; 52–53%, n = 313–345, in a mito-NIC58 background; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Arrested progeny largely consisted of NIC58 homozygotes and, to a lesser extent, JU1373 homozygotes, as evidenced by these genotypes being depleted among wild-type progeny (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). This result shows that antagonistic Medea haplotypes at the chromosome V locus act in the absence of variation at the chromosome III locus. For comparison, crosses segregating no Medeas showed median rates of normal development that were usually higher than 75%, as expected for crosses lacking drive activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>); nonetheless, rates of normal development in these crosses were highly variable and sometimes low, with medians ranging from 65 to 100% (n = 163–213), suggesting a contribution from non-Medea background incompatibilities. We conclude that the chromosome III and V Medea loci act independently of one other, and that additional background incompatibilities are widespread and diffuse in the NIC58 × JU1373 cross.</p></sec><sec id="s2-12"><title>Medea loci act via maternal effect</title><p>The loci we identified in <italic>C. tropicalis</italic> produce transmission ratio distortion via an interaction between parent and offspring genotypes. To distinguish between maternal and paternal effects, we scored rates of normal development among progeny in which Medea alleles segregated from mothers or fathers. We used a combination of sperm depletion and visible markers to prevent self-progeny from contaminating counts of cross-progeny. For a maternal effect (and no paternal effect), 50% of cross-progeny lacking the Medea were expected to undergo developmental arrest when the Medea was present in the mother, assuming full penetrance, but develop normally when the Medea was present in the father. In the case of a paternal effect (and no maternal effect), the opposite pattern was expected. Crosses testing the JU1373 and NIC58 Medeas showed that all acted via maternal, and not paternal, effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>).

This analysis mapped Medeas to intervals of around 33 kb on chromosome III and 69 kb on chromosome V (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>) that overlapped the peaks of transmission ratio distortion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). The chromosome III interval encompasses a locus of locally elevated sequence divergence between NIC58 and JU1373, in an otherwise well-conserved region. A clear candidate is an insertion of sequence in JU1373 that includes seven predicted genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>): six are tandem duplications of neighboring genes in NIC58; the seventh is a duplication of a gene located 0.68 Mb to the right in both NIC58 and JU1373.

A major structural difference between JU1373 and NIC58 haplotypes is an expansion of divergent F-box-domain-encoding genes, expanded from three homologs in NIC58 to 13 in JU1373. Immediately flanking this expansion in JU1373 is a duplication of a gene located 0.6 Mb away (and present in both NIC58 and JU1373), which encodes a homolog of the checkpoint kinase <italic>chk-2</italic>. Adjacent to the <italic>chk-2</italic> homolog is a tandem duplication of a nuclear gene encoding a mitochondrial ubiquinol-cytochrome c oxidoreductase complex protein, perhaps accounting for the interaction of Medea activity with mitochondrial genotype. Additional differences between haplotypes include a gene encoding a small, novel protein in JU1373 and a novel gene in NIC58. Thus, the JU1373 Medea on chromosome V resides within a larger genomic window of elevated sequence divergence, containing an expansion of F-box genes, a novel gene, as well as a duplicated gene encoding a mitochondrial protein.

There are, however, several differences of unknown significance, including 12 missense variants in six of the core protein coding genes, the presence in NIC58 of a small non-coding region and a potentially novel (lowly expressed) gene encoding a 2-pass transmembrane protein, and differential expression at two additional loci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>).

A general resistance mechanism for suppressing this lethality is selfing, which reduces the prevalence of heterozygotes and hence of animals expressing Medea-associated lethality. To better understand how the mating system of <italic>C. tropicalis</italic> influences the spread of these elements, we simulated evolution under different levels of selfing and outcrossing. These simulations included incomplete penetrance as well as idiosyncratic features of <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> androdioecy: hermaphrodites cannot mate with one another and males can arise spontaneously by nondisjunction of the X chromosome (see Materials and methods). Selfing rate was a fixed parameter in this system, and we leave a fuller exploration of the coevolutionary dynamics of selfing and intergenerational incompatibilities to future work. We found that in a large population, high rates of selfing can dramatically slow the rate of spread of a Medea element, and indeed can reduce its efficacy such that it fails to increase in frequency during 100 generations of simulated evolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A</xref>). In small populations, elements introduced at 5% frequency are rapidly fixed under random mating but lost to drift under high rates of selfing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B</xref>). These simulations also reveal that once an element is at high frequency, selfing actually hastens fixation of the Medea element (compare partial selfing at <italic>S</italic> = 0.25 to obligate outcrossing at <italic>S</italic> = 0). This occurs because once an element is at high frequency, heterozygotes that self will always expose their progeny to the element’s killing effects, but heterozygotes that outcross will usually mate with an antidote-carrying male, slowing the fixation of the element. These results show that partial selfing slows or prevents the spread of Medea elements at low frequency but hastens their fixation at high frequency.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig10" position="float"><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><title>Selfing reduces the efficacy of Medea elements.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative allele frequency trajectories of a Medea haplotype under different rates of selfing (S) for 100 generations.

(<bold>A</bold>) At a locus with two haplotypes, each containing Medea elements, allele frequencies change over time as a function of selfing rate (<italic>S</italic>). At intermediate selfing rates, positive frequency-dependent selection acts to remove the rarer haplotype from the population. This effect is explained by the disproportionate impact of segregation in heterozygous selfers on the rarer haplotype. Heterozygous selfers kill each haplotype in equal proportions (¼ of progeny are homozygous for each haplotype), while outcrossers kill each as a function of their population frequency; the result is that the rare allele suffers more from heterozygote selfing. Intermediate levels of outcrossing result in the highest frequency of heterozygous selfer and so the most efficient selection against the rare allele. Under complete selfing (<italic>S</italic> = 1), there are no heterozygotes and Medeas have no effect. Under obligate outcrossing, the haplotypes are subject to drift and show similar dynamics to obligate selfers or outcrossers without Medeas. The pattern in obligate outcrossers reflects the maternal-zygotic interaction character of the Medeas. While the Medeas kill homozygotes, generating overdominance and heterozygote excess, this occurs only in heterozygous mothers. The fitness cost to these mothers represents underdominance, favoring homozygotes, and the over- and under-dominance balance each other. This figure shows the results of representative simulations with fixed population size of 20,000 breeding individuals, initial frequencies 0.2 and 0.8, and 95% penetrance of each of the two Medeas. (<bold>B</bold>). Heterozygote frequencies (from the simulations shown in A) vary over the simulations. Obligate outcrossers maintain substantially elevated heterozygote frequencies. (<bold>C</bold>) Surprisingly, despite the strong selection against homozygotes and the elevated frequency of heterozygotes in obligate outcrossers, allele frequencies evolve with drift-like dynamics. Results of 200 simulations are shown, each with a fixed population size of 1000 breeding individuals and initial minor allele frequency of 0.2. The left panel illustrates the spread of allele frequencies across simulations in the case of antagonistic Medeas, and the right shows the results with no Medeas. In both cases, frequencies drift and some populations lose the lower-frequency allele. After 200 generations, the allele frequency variances are not different between the two cases (Levene’s test, p=0.13). (<bold>D</bold>) When a strong Medea element (penetrance 0.95) invades a population carrying a weaker Medea (penetrance 0.6), its ability to displace the weak Medea depends on the selfing rate (S). At low selfing rates, genic selection favoring the strong Medea drives it to high frequency. At intermediate and high selfing rates, positive frequency-dependent selection favors the weaker resident Medea, and the strong haplotype is removed from the population. The figure shows the results of representative simulations with fixed population size of 20,000 breeding individuals, initial frequencies 0.2 and 0.8, and penetrances chosen to represent those of the <italic>C. tropicalis</italic> JU1373 haplotype (0.95) and NIC58 haplotype (0.6).

We found that intermediate levels of selfing cause frequency-dependent selection against the rarer haplotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10C</xref>, lower panel, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s2">Figure 10—figure supplement 2A–C</xref>). Surprisingly, allele frequencies of the antagonistic Medeas drift as though neutral under both obligate selfing and obligate outcrossing, albeit for different reasons. With obligate selfing, there are simply no heterozygotes and the alleles are literally neutral. Under obligate outcrossing, overdominance generated in the offspring generation by the killing of both homozygote classes is offset by underdominance in the parental generation, because the costs of these deaths are borne by heterozygote mothers. The net effect is that the alleles exhibit drift-like dynamics despite the enormous selective cost. Effective neutrality in this scenario depends on the equal penetrance of antagonistic haplotypes in the model. When we model unequal penetrances, similar to those we observe at the chromosome V locus (0.95 and 0.6), we find that a resident strong Medea will prevent the spread of a weaker invader, as expected. When a strong Medea invades a population with a weaker resident Medea, the strong haplotype spreads if outcrossing rates are high but is eliminated under moderate to high rates of selfing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s2">Figure 10—figure supplement 2D,E</xref>). Overall, selfing reduces Medea load both by decreasing heterozygote frequency and by inducing strong positive frequency-dependent selection that prevents antagonistic alleles from co-occurring.</p><p>Finally, we considered the metapopulation biology of <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> nematodes, which involves colonization of ephemeral habitat patches, rapid population expansion, and then generation of new dispersal morphs (dauers) when the population exhausts its patch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Cutter, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Félix and Braendle, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ferrari et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Richaud et al., 2018</xref>). If a patch exists for a limited time, patches whose populations expand most rapidly will contribute more descendents to the overall gene pool when the patches expire. Chance genetic differences among patches can strongly influence the rate of population expansion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">Figure 10—figure supplement 1</xref>). Within each patch, allele frequencies experience the same forces as in a population of fixed size, but among patches we expect that those founded solely by homozygotes (experiencing no selective deaths from Medeas) will have grown the largest after a few generations, increasing the representation of their alleles in the overall gene pool. As the rarer allele at a locus will be overrepresented in heterozygotes, and most homozygotes will carry only the common allele, this mode of population regulation should increase the frequency of the more common allele. This is a kind of ‘Haystack Model,’ well studied in the context of sex ratios, where patchy environments favor a female bias because of the more rapid population expansion it allows (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Bulmer and Taylor, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib145">Wilson and Colwell, 1981</xref>). These group-selection models are sensitive to parameters, including the number of individuals that found a patch, the number of offspring per parent, and the number of generations of growth within each patch. For each selfing rate, we modeled a situation in which each patch is colonized by four individuals, with sex ratio fixed to exclude its effects but genotypes drawn from the equilibrium frequencies given the allele frequency and selfing rate. The population then grows without any constraints on size until the patch reaches its expiration date, after three generations, at which time we calculate the global allele frequency, summing across the entire collection of patches. Under these conditions, we confirm a strong negative relationship between patch heterozygote frequency and patch growth rate. For a single Medea, the effects of growth in a patchy environment on allele frequency are very modest, and the genic selection within each patch allows Medeas to spread despite their costs. With antagonistic Medeas, modeled with equal penetrance, the reduction in heterozygote brood size is greater and the directional effects of single-Medea genic selection are absent. In these conditions, group selection is sufficient to generate a global change in allele frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10C</xref>). There are more all-homozygote patches for the more common haplotype, and the result is positive frequency-dependent selection, decreasing the frequency of the less common haplotype. Overall, the joint effects of selfing and group selection on antagonistic Medeas are therefore to eliminate the rarer allele. Selection achieves this result most efficiently at intermediate selfing rates. Although the Medeas stick around at higher selfing rates, they impose very little genetic load, and at very high selfing rates they are entirely neutral.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We have brought genetic and genomic resources to the most recently discovered androdioecious <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> species, <italic>C. tropicalis</italic>, facilitating studies of the varied effects of mating system transitions on genomes and metapopulation genetics, and their interactions with ecology, as well as comparative quantitative genetics. Aided by a chromosome-scale reference genome, our data confirm that <italic>C. tropicalis</italic> is indeed the most genetically homogeneous of the three selfers, on average, which implies a correspondingly high rate of selfing, low rate of effective recombination, and small effective population size. We also show that the average obscures extreme variance in the distribution of genomic diversity. This finding mirrors recent findings for <italic>C. elegans</italic> and <italic>C. briggsae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Lee et al., 2020</xref>). Within two highly divergent regions, we find some striking biology: three Medea gene-drive systems segregating in a single cross. Genetically similar Medea elements have also been found in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ben-David et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Seidel et al., 2008</xref>), but we and others have now shown that they are especially common in <italic>C. tropicalis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ben-David et al., 2020</xref>). They thus represent a potent and surprisingly widespread form of genetic incompatibility underlying outbreeding depression, and a potential cause of the species’ high effective selfing rate. Comparative analysis will be furthered by more extensive sampling, in time, and in geographic and genomic space, for all selfing species. This project will also benefit from inclusion of the closely related sister-species of <italic>C. tropicalis</italic>, <italic>C. wallacei</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Félix et al., 2014</xref>), as in the case of <italic>C. briggsae</italic> and its outcrossing sister <italic>C. nigoni</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib147">Yin et al., 2018</xref>).</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Selfing and population genetics</title><p>Our early view of selfing <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> species was of widespread, weedy lineages depauperate of genetic diversity relative to their outcrossing ancestors.

Better sampling has led to a more complete picture of strong population and genomic structure for all three species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Crombie et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib129">Thomas et al., 2015</xref>), though tropical areas remain particularly undersampled.</p><p>Most recently, a large survey of <italic>C. elegans</italic> genomes, including 15 assembled from long-reads, found regions of high-diversity spanning up to 20% of the reference genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Lee et al., 2020</xref>). Similar heterogeneity was found in a smaller sample of <italic>C. briggsae</italic> genomes. This finding was presaged by efforts to build a complete genome for the divergent Hawaiian isolate CB4856 using second generation sequencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib130">Thompson et al., 2015</xref>), but has been greatly enabled by more contiguous assemblies that circumvent the reference mapping bias plaguing study of all genetically diverse species. A promising hypothesis for the presence of hyperdivergent regions in genomes is the action of balancing selection across the species’ range, leading to preservation of some of the presumably abundant genetic diversity of outcrossing ancestral species. This hypothesis is supported in <italic>C. elegans</italic> by the enrichment of genes encoding environmentally responsive sensory factors, which are themselves enriched for differential expression and quantitative trait loci for response to microbes isolated from natural habitats. Alternative hypotheses include introgression, a common source of islands of divergence in other animal taxa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Hedrick, 2013</xref>), but the presence of multiple distinct divergent haplotypes in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Lee et al., 2020</xref>) argues strongly against it. Balancing selection can act at many levels, from local adaptation via directional selection, at the global scale, to various frequency-dependent phenomena at the local scale, and overdominance at the molecular scale. While some environmental associations clearly play a role in the biogeography of all three androdioecious species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Crombie et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Cutter et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Dolgin et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Félix and Duveau, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ferrari et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Kiontke et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Prasad et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib129">Thomas et al., 2015</xref>), they seem not to be a definitive factor in structuring divergent haplotypes. The high migration rate that comes with the microscopic nematode form, coupled with the reproductive assurance afforded by selfing, may effectively counter adaptation to global environmental variation.</p><p>Taxa with mixed selfing and outcrossing, very large population sizes, and broad, diverse ranges, may occupy a population genetic space particularly well suited to the detection and localization of balancing and local selection. The ability to detect targets of strong balancing selection scales with total population size (assuming symmetric migration) and recombination rate, and the homogenizing effect of partial selfing is to increase the signal of balanced peaks against a background continually swept of diversity by indirect selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Charlesworth et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Nordborg et al., 1996</xref>). The particularly high selfing rate of <italic>C. tropicalis</italic> may be especially favorable, and its preferred habitat may also allow for more rapid evolution than the temperate-dwelling <italic>C. elegans</italic>. Detection of the targets of local adaptation depends on population size, migration rate, and selection intensity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Charlesworth et al., 1997</xref>), which are all unknowns. Although Medea factors may have the potential to generate balancing selection, it is clear that most divergent regions between NIC58 and JU1373 do not carry Medea factors, or, at least, not ones that are active independent of environment and genetic background. These, and other highly divergent haplotypes in <italic>C. tropicalis</italic>, may harbor loci under positive selection in different conditions, a conjecture made more plausible by the analysis of divergent gene content in <italic>C. elegans</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Population dynamics of Medea elements</title><p>Medea elements like those we discovered in <italic>C. tropicalis</italic> will reliably spread in randomly mating populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib136">Wade and Beeman, 1994</xref>). Highly penetrant killing of homozygous larvae is an exceptionally potent selective mechanism to drive allele frequency change, and in our short RIL construction pedigree we saw two haplotypes sweep nearly to fixation. In nature, things are likely quite different, as both the mating system and natural history of <italic>C. tropicalis</italic> conspire to render Medea loci selectively inert. <italic>C. tropicalis</italic> shows strong geographic structure, presumably exacerbated by habitat fragmentation, such that encounters between Medea and sensitive haplotypes may be rare. Upon an encounter between a hermaphrodite and a male, outcrossing rates, measured under benign laboratory conditions, are relatively low on average. When divergent isolates do cross, Medeas may find themselves inactive due to dependence on genetic background, including mitochondrial genotype, and, potentially, environmental factors. Most importantly, <italic>C. tropicalis</italic> reproduces primarily by self-fertilization, and gene-drive elements are unable to gain traction when heterozygotes are infrequent. At the same time, the patchy, ephemeral microhabitat of <italic>C. tropicalis</italic> – rotting fruits and flowers on the forest floor – provides a perfect substrate for group selection. Small numbers of dispersing larvae colonize each patch and undergo exponential population growth for a small number of generations. Although Medeas will increase in frequency in patches with heterozygotes, population growth in patches without heterozygotes can be so much greater as to overwhelm the countervailing effects of Medeas on allele frequency.</p><p>The patterns we observe on chromosome V implicate tightly linked Medeas, one on each of the alternative haplotypes, a phenomenon also discovered by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ben-David et al., 2020</xref>. Surprisingly, we found by simulation that antagonistic Medeas do not generate balancing selection, at least under the scenarios modeled. They nevertheless impose a strong segregation load under outcrossing, which should select for suppressors. The antagonistic Medeas themselves evolve by drift at high selfing rates, and at intermediate selfing rates frequency-dependent selection eliminates the rarer haplotype. At the same time, the chromosome V Medeas occur on ancient haplotypes, evidenced by extreme divergence between NIC58 and JU1373 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). These haplotypes may encode unique toxin-antidote pairs that arose independently, or they may encode toxin-antidote pairs that co-evolved from a common ancestor but are no longer cross-compatible. Competition among driver haplotypes is known to occur for Segregation Distorter in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, but in that case, driver haplotypes compete for slots in a balanced equilibrium with non-drivers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Brand et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Presgraves et al., 2009</xref>). Our simulations raise questions about whether antagonistic Medeas play a role in the ancient balancing selection at the chromosome V locus, and we note that the two haplotypes are sufficiently different in gene content that effects on other phenotypes are likely.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Molecular mechanisms of Medea-mediated gene drive</title><p>The Medea factors we have discovered in <italic>C. tropicalis</italic> are analogous to the <italic>sup-35/pha-1</italic> maternal-effect driver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ben-David et al., 2017</xref>) and the <italic>zeel-1/peel-1</italic> paternal-effect driver in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Seidel et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Seidel et al., 2011</xref>), and four maternal-effect <italic>Medea</italic> drivers in Tribolium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Beeman et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Beeman and Friesen, 1999</xref>). Additionally, several other <italic>C. tropicalis</italic> Medea factors have been independently identified and characterized by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ben-David et al., 2020</xref>. Similar inheritance patterns have also been reported for two loci in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Peters and Barker, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib139">Weichenhan et al., 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib140">Weichenhan et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib146">Winking et al., 1991</xref>). The causal genes underlying the JU1373 and NIC58 Medeas remain to be identified, but likely include one or more of the multiple genes unique to these haplotypes, as seen for <italic>C. elegans</italic> where toxin and antidote functions are encoded by genes present on the killing haplotype and absent (or pseudogenized) on the non-killing haplotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ben-David et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Seidel et al., 2008</xref>). Similarly, the single <italic>Tribolium</italic> Medea element whose genetic basis is known maps to a transposable element insertion absent from non-Medea haplotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Lorenzen et al., 2008</xref>). A common pattern emerging from these systems is that maternal-effect drivers (and the single example of a paternal-effect driver) are encoded by dispensable genes with dedicated functions, rather than genes acquiring toxin or antidote activity while retaining an ancestral non-drive function.</p><p>Why are Medeas so prevalent in <italic>C. tropicalis</italic> (and to some extent in <italic>C. elegans</italic> and <italic>C. briggsae</italic>) but mostly absent elsewhere? One option is ascertainment bias – maybe similar elements are taxonomically more widespread, but we simply have not looked for them.</p><p>A second option is that mechanisms of translational control in the <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> germline may make it easy for Medeas to arise. Early embryogenesis in <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> is largely controlled by maternal regulators, and a common expression pattern for these regulators is ubiquitous expression of mRNA in the oocyte but no translation until embryogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Evans, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Robertson and Lin, 2015</xref>). A gene whose protein is generally cytotoxic could become a maternal-effect toxin by acquiring the (common) regulatory elements specifying this expression module. If such a mutation occurs in tight linkage to an incidental zygotically expressed antidote, it creates a Medea. Variation among species in maternal gene regulation may therefore be relevant to variation in the mutational flux of novel Medeas.</p><p>The antidote-first scenario, in which Medeas arise from sequential mutations on a single haplotype, may be facilitated by high rates of selfing. In populations with high selfing rates, alternate haplotypes rarely encounter one another in heterozygotes. Each can then evolve as though in allopatry with the other. If balancing selection preserves the alternate haplotypes for a long time, they may incidentally accumulate antidotes and toxins that are neutral in their own backgrounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Seidel et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Toxin-first evolution is also possible, aided by metapopulation structure and selfing. Partially penetrant toxins might arise in a background lacking an antidote but become locally fixed, despite their deleteriousness, due to the tiny effective population size and inefficient purifying selection of a local selfing population. If outcrossing is rare, toxin-free haplotypes will not be reintroduced or decoupled by recombination and instead, the population might restore its fitness via compensatory evolution of an antidote; if the antidote is linked to the toxin, a Medea is born.</p><p>Whether the toxin-antidote elements in <italic>C. tropicalis</italic> and <italic>C. elegans</italic> arose before the transition to selfing is unclear, although the level of divergence between opposite haplotypes at Medea loci is suggestive of sampling from outcrossing ancestors. A closer examination of gonochoristic species in the Elegans group is needed to determine whether toxin-antidote elements are specific to, or quantitatively different in, selfers. It will also be interesting to see the strong outbreeding depression in other taxa with mixed-mating, such as the ‘cryptic biological species’ complexes in arctic Draba (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Grundt et al., 2006</xref>), dissected genetically.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Strategies to combat Medea factors</title><p>Gene drive systems create a selective environment favoring the evolution of suppressors. Suppressors of meiotic and gametic drive have been well documented in many species, especially when obligate outcrossing continually exposes individuals to the costs of drive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Courret et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Lindholm et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Lyttle, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Price et al., 2019</xref>). Suppressors of drive in selfing species are more rare, which has been interpreted as evidence that many drivers in selfing species did not evolve as drivers per se but instead evolved through non-drive mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib125">Sweigart et al., 2019</xref>), such as balancing selection maintaining alternate homozygous genotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Seidel et al., 2008</xref>). Our data show that unlinked modifiers affect Medea activity in <italic>C. tropicalis</italic>, though whether these modifiers evolved as suppressors is equivocal. In the case of maternal-effect drivers, mitochondrial suppressors are special: selection for mitochondrial suppressors may be especially strong because mitochondria cannot segregate away from drivers via inheritance in sperm. This selective environment may explain why two of the Medeas we discovered in <italic>C. tropicalis</italic> (the chromosome III JU1373 Medea and the chromosome V NIC58 Medea) were differentially active according to mitochondrial genotype – the mitochondrial genotypes non-permissive for Medea drive may have evolved as suppressors. Alternatively, Medeas may have arisen in permissive mitochondrial backgrounds, with little selection for or against alternate mitochondrial genotypes. Ultimately, our data provide little conclusive evidence that the Medea loci experience selection in nature that is due to their drive activity.</p><p>The data suggest that crosses between geographically distant <italic>C. tropicalis</italic> isolates will typically reveal multiple Medea loci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). Segregation of multiple Medeas magnifies the cost of outcrossing and reduces the possibility of suppression by a common molecular mechanism, in a manner analogous to the role of multidrug therapy in preventing the evolution of drug resistance. The difficulty that organisms face in evolving suppressors to multiple drive elements at once has emerged as an important consideration for gene drive strategies for controlling disease vectors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Burt, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Champer et al., 2018</xref>). In such cases, organisms can adapt by altering their population biology, increasing their rates of inbreeding and selfing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Bull, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Bull et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Drury et al., 2017</xref>), and thus reducing the heterozygosity required for all gene drive activity.</p><p>The costs of selfing as a defense against gene drive are inbreeding depression; reduced ability to adapt to new conditions; and reduced genetic variation and hence niche breadth. Androdioecious <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> appear to have mechanisms for dealing with each of these costs. Selfing <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> are typically found in nature as totally inbred lines, consistent with having purged recessive deleterious variants in their history (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anderson et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Richaud et al., 2018</xref>).

Finally, the preservation of genetic diversity at large numbers of ancient haplotypes by balancing selection allows these species to occupy a wide range of habitats despite low levels of baseline genetic variation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Lee et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>We have shown that <italic>C. tropicalis</italic> harbors abundant heritable variation in outcrossing rate, with nondisjunction, male mating propensity, and hermaphrodite mating propensity all providing avenues for genetic fine-tuning of the outcrossing rate. Other data also show that <italic>C. tropicalis</italic> has mechanisms that promote selfing over outcrossing. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib131">Ting et al., 2014</xref> found that <italic>C. tropicalis</italic> hermaphrodites are uniquely resistant to the deleterious effects of interspecific matings, and they interpret their findings as evidence for reduced activity of sperm guidance cues in <italic>C. tropicalis</italic> hermaphrodites. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Shi et al., 2017</xref> showed that male longevity is reduced in <italic>C. tropicalis</italic> when male pheromone is present, creating a negative feedback that tamps down male frequencies, but not in obligately outcrossing <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> species. These findings are consistent with selection favoring high selfing rates in <italic>C. tropicalis</italic>.</p><p>Selfing is often considered a factor that favors the evolution of incompatibilities and outbreeding depression, just as the independent evolution of species or subspecies often leads to incompatibilities revealed by hybridization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Fishman and Sweigart, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Maheshwari and Barbash, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Presgraves, 2010</xref>). Selfing reduces the effective recombination rate, allowing unlinked loci to evolve together. When outcrossing reshuffles these co-evolved loci, it creates new combinations of alleles untested by selection. Incompatibilities between these alleles manifest as outbreeding depression (equivalently, rearrangements can fix within selfing lineages, rendering outbred progeny deficient). Our findings suggest causation running in the opposite direction should also be considered. Incompatibilities in <italic>C. tropicalis</italic> appear to mostly represent interactions between tightly linked loci acting in different individuals (mothers and offspring), rather than interactions between unlinked loci; thus, the resulting outbreeding depression is mostly not mediated by recombination. <italic>C. tropicalis</italic> can escape these incompatibilities and restore fitness by inbreeding. Thus, in contrast to the usual pattern of selfing leading to incompatibility, in this species incompatibility may also lead to increased selfing.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Strain maintenance</title><p>Strains were maintained using standard protocols for <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Brenner, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib123">Stiernagle, 2006</xref>), with the addition of 1.25% agarose to NGM-agar (NGMA) plates to discourage burrowing, and a 25°C incubation temperature.

All were initially run with default parameters. Flye produced a highly contiguous assembly with this data, and initial genetic evaluation showed few errors (interchromosomal chimeras were detected for all other assemblers), so we varied parameters (minimum overlap length 4–10 kb, initial assembly depth 40–180×) and selected the two most contiguous assemblies for closer evaluation (the genetically concordant assembly used -m 10 kb –<monospace>asm-coverage</monospace> 120×).

The genetic map based on this assembly incorporated 33 of these sequences and spanned 81.3 Mb.

The inferred orientations were consistent with strand bias from 1:1 orthologs in chromosome centers in all cases except chromosome I.

P<sub>0</sub> males and hermaphrodites were paired as L4s, and the following day each hermaphrodite that bore a copulatory plug was transferred to a fresh plate to lay embryos. Two days later, when these embryos had developed to L4 stage, we isolated F<sub>1</sub> hermaphrodites overnight. The following day, hermaphrodites were singled to new plates and left to lay embryos for 8 hr. The hermaphrodites were then removed and the embryos on each plate counted. Three days later, when wild-type animals have reliably reached adulthood, we counted the adults on each plate by picking. In some cases, slow-developing animals that had reached L3 or L4 were counted separately. The majority of Medea-affected animals arrest as L1s and are difficult to see, so we typically estimated the number of arrested larvae as the number of embryos initially observed minus the number of adults counted 3 days later. In a small number of broods (~3%), the count of progeny at adulthood exceeded the count of embryos laid (by at most two extra adults, from broods containing ~35–55 total embryos laid). We made the assumption that this discrepancy reflected undercounting of embryos rather than overcounting of adults, given that embryos are hard to see. Thus, for such broods, we adjusted the embryo count upward to match the count of adults. All conclusions are robust to this adjustment.</p><p>Because of the low mating efficiency of many <italic>C. tropicalis</italic> genotypes, matings did not always produce cross-progeny. To distinguish self- and cross-progeny, we employed several approaches. In some experiments, we depleted hermaphrodites of sperm by transferring them to fresh plates on each of the first 4 days of adulthood, until they ceased reproduction. These sperm-depleted hermaphrodites could then be crossed to males, and resulting progeny inferred reliably to be cross offspring. This method is not suitable for all experiments because the sperm-depleted hermaphrodites have small broods and generally show age-associated decrepitude. As an alternative, we developed visible marker strains that allow us to distinguish self- and cross-progeny. We isolated a spontaneous Dumpy mutant in the JU1373 background and established strain QG2413, <italic>Ctr-dpy</italic> (<italic>qg2)</italic>. Control experiments confirmed that this semidominant mutation allows for clean discrimination between Dpy and semi- or non-Dpy animals, and that the mutation is unlinked to the Medea loci on chromosomes III and V. Next, we generated a NIC58 derivative carrying a fluorescent reporter. Strain QG3501 (<italic>qgIs5</italic>) carries pCFJ104 [<italic>Pmyo-3::mCherry::unc-54utr</italic>] (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Frøkjaer-Jensen et al., 2008</xref>). The transgene was introduced by microinjection into NIC58, integrated by UV, and backcrossed to NIC58 seven times. These animals express bright red fluorescence in muscle, visible under the dissecting scope from mid embryogenesis. Control experiments show that this transgene is unlinked to the Medea loci. To test for maternal-effect killing by the NIC58 haplotype on chromosome V, we generated strain QG4249, which carries the <italic>qgIs5</italic> transgene and the NIC58 mitochondrial genome and is homozygous NN at the chromosome III locus and JJ at the chromosome V locus.

One of these selfish elements is characterized by antagonistic variants at a single genomic location. A simple simulation model explores the consequences of variations of the selfing rate on the establishment of these selfish elements, and focuses on the properties of the antagonistic variants. The paper also provides a wealth of genomic resources, including a well-assembled reference genome and a resequencing dataset revealing a poorly diverse genome punctuated by rare islands of higher divergence.</p><p>It has been reviewed by two reviewers and myself, and we all recognized a very important contribution to the field, both through the resources made available to establish <italic>C. tropicalis</italic> as a new model system, and through the precise genetic dissection of the incompatibilities that help think in a new way about the consequences of selfing.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>After discussion with the reviewers, we agreed that the manuscript would in principle become acceptable for publication in <italic>eLife</italic> after the three following revisions :</p><p>1) First, the word &quot;drive&quot; is misleading in this context. Drive originally refers to meiotic distorters at the gametic level, while the maternally inherited incompatibilities reported here are acting at the zygotic level. This goes beyond a semantic issue, as the population genetic properties of such incompatibilities differ from classical drive elements (e.g. Wade and Beeman, 1994). As such, we feel that the manuscript will be confusing to many readers in its present form, preventing them to appreciate the true originality of the results. Replacing the term “drive” throughout the paper with something like “Maternal effect selfish elements” as in the original Wade and Beeman, 1994 paper, or any other more appropriate formulation is required to avoid the confusion.</p><p>2) Second, there was also a consensus that the genomic analysis is currently reported in a way that will distract the readers from the more interesting findings and proves particularly hard to follow. It is also poorly connected to the rest of the study. To improve readability, we ask you to drastically reduce this part to a short paragraph focusing on the key aspects that matter for the present study, and moving the detailed description of the results and comparison with other species to supplementary material.</p><p>3) Finally, the limitations of the simulations performed should be better acknowledged. They are an important part of the study, but they remain preliminary in the sense that the effect of variations of several key parameters is not explored. Limits to the scope and generality of the conclusions from the simulations should be better highlighted.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This manuscript details a genetic and genomic analysis of the worm <italic>Caenorhabditis tropicalis</italic>, and proposes that its highly selfing mode of reproduction acts as an effective way to control the emergence of strong gene drive elements. The quality and amount of the work presented is impressive, regarding the power of the genomic analysis of structural variation, the level of details of the dissection of the genetic basis of the incompatibilities and the predictions derived from computer simulations of the fate of distorters along the outcrossing vs. selfing gradient. I have fairly substantial presentation issues I detail below to improve clarity.</p><p>1) The quantity of work in a single paper also means that the manuscript is currently very dense and quite hard to follow, with overly detailed descriptions of some results, a lack of precision in some others, and an overall lack of cohesion across the different parts of the work. For instance, how do the detailed analysis of correlates of genetic diversity along chromosomes across species precisely contribute to our understanding of the accumulation of distorters or mating system transitions? The genomic analysis is particularly lengthy and would be easier to follow if better focused on the aspects that are most relevant for the overall context of the study, or partly moved to supplementary material. In addition, several figures are poorly labeled, imprecisely called in the text (panels for supplementary figures are generally omitted), or even not called at all (see below for details comments and suggestions), making it extra hard to follow an already complicated flow of arguments.</p><p>2) The final claim of the paper is that segregation distorters have favoured the evolution of selfing, rather than being a consequence of it. Yet, the simulations do not actually address this issue. Instead, they focus exclusively on how well drivers can establish in populations with a fixed rate of selfing. The argument would be a lot more convincing if simulations actually followed the fate of mutants of the selfing rate once drivers have been introduced in the population, although this might easily be left for another study. At the very least the final suggestion should be toned down and formulated as a speculation. Also, it would be good to more clearly acknowledge the limits of these predictions. In particular, I suspect that many of them will depend on the strength of the incompatibilities, which were shown to vary in the genetic dissection but are considered fully lethal here. Also, the antagonistic drivers are assumed to have equal strength, and I suspect that their apparently neutral behaviour would not hold when they differ. Finally, a main result from the simulations is that selfers should be pretty good at eliminating simple drive systems, yet they seem to be quite common. How can this contradiction be solved ?</p><p>3) There is no experimental evidence for how the incompatibilities are determined at the mechanistic level, yet the paper varies in terminology and explicitly assumes a maternal toxin-zygotic antitoxin system at some places, especially in the simulation work. Sticking to a more generic formulation would be less confusing. It is also currently unclear whether the fact that the incompatibility loci are found within islets of genomic divergence is a significant observation, or just a fortuitous coincidence. Given the effort to define those divergent stretches, the authors seem to suggest that they played a disproportionate role, but this could be clarified.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This paper investigates the genomic diversity and causes of outbreeding depression in a hitherto understudied selfing / androdioecious species of Caenorhabditis (C tropicalis). The main originality of the paper is the discovery and genetic dissection of maternally inherited incompatibilities (an incompatibility between mother and offspring due to a maternal toxin-zygotic antidote systems) that result in embryo/juvenile lethality in the progeny of heterozygotes, whereby one of the two homozygous genotypes is largely eliminated. The authors use a wealth of techniques and clever crosses to make this case, and argue that a predominantly selfing reproduction is an efficient way to reduce the cost of such incompatibilities, as it reduces the frequency of heterozygotes.</p><p>Overall this is a very well conducted study, with lots of details, an impressive amount of work (including, in passing, a thoroughly described high quality genome assembly for this species) and an exquisite care taken to check every hypothesis as best possible using crosses. I am quite convinced of the genetic incompatibility model which seem to have been tested in every thinkable way, and thus I have very little important concerns, none of which requires additional data, rather some rewording</p><p>1) The most important point is the vocabulary. The authors repeatedly use the word &quot;drive&quot; for what has been called maternally-inherited incompatibility or selfish element by their predecessors. It may seem purely conventional but it considerably obscures the reading -and most readers, that will (unfortunately) take the time for only a superficial reading will misunderstand what the authors mean… The word &quot;drive&quot; (meiotic drive or gene drive) usually describes meiotic distortion, i.e. nonmendelian proportions at the gamete stage. Here what we have is an incompatibility which results from an interaction between maternal and zygotic genotypes, and kills some of the offspring well after fertilization has taken place. It may sound boring, but replacing &quot;drive&quot; or &quot;driver&quot; everywhere in the manuscript by something like mother-offspring incompatibility or any other adequate term is absolutely necessary – otherwise the impact of this beautiful paper might be to generate confusion</p><p>2) A second, less important, comment is that the very last element of conclusion (that this kind of incompatibilities actually select for selfing) is the only bit that is not properly demonstrated. What the models document is actually the reverse (the impact of fixed selfing rates on incompatibilities); but none of these models actually involves modifiers of selfing rate. Sure, selfing reduces the population cost of incompatibilities, BUT a long history of models has made clear that there is no equivalence between this reduced cost and the fact that a modifier of selfer will easily hitchhike incompatibilities to invade a population. For example, it is not clear that outcrossing actually generates enough heterozygosity at incompatibility loci for this to occur in natural populations. So I'm happy with the assertion in the title (selfing is &quot;safe&quot;) but not really with the idea that more selfing is selected when incompatibilities are present (while the reverse is proven, this kind of incompatibilities can reach higher frequency in the presence of selfing). This idea should be presented as a hypothesis… to be formally modelled and tested elsewhere.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>This article begins by describing the genome sequence of <italic>C. tropicalis</italic>, a self-fertile androdioecious species in the Caenorhabditis group. There have been at least 3 origins of self-fertility in Caenorhabditis and molecular and phylogenetic evidence indicate these reproductive mode transitions occurred independently. There are &gt;10x as many described outcrossing dioecious species in the group and studying the 3 selfers is essential to understanding molecular evolution and reproductive mode transitions in this group. The selfers <italic>C. elegans</italic> and <italic>C. briggsae</italic> have nearly complete genome sequences for &gt;20 and &gt;15 years but initial efforts to sequence and study <italic>C. tropicalis</italic> were hobbled by contamination in the strain. Developing the <italic>C. tropicalis</italic> system is a huge contribution to the scientific community and this is an important piece of work.</p><p>This article does not stop at the genome sequence and covers a huge breadth. The authors sequence a number of strains to study population genetics, perform crosses and study loci consistent with genetic drive, and develop simulations to study the population dynamics of drive loci. The article is long and could really be 3 separate papers as the work presented in each section is detailed and interesting. Overall I find the work important, exciting and high-quality. However, there are several aspects of the article that require revision prior to publication.</p><p>1) The Abstract references gene drive elements that are consistent with maternal toxin/zygotic antidote systems but there is no mechanistic evidence presented that these are in fact maternal toxin/antidotes. Toxin/antidote systems like zeel/peel have been described in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (and recently in a preprint in <italic>C. tropicalis</italic>) but invoke a very specific mechanism where toxins are present in gametes and rescued by antidotes expressed in development. The authors need to scale this back, in some parts of the manuscript (for example the sections describing the crosses) they are very careful to refer to this as gene drive and in other parts (the simulations) it is speculative.</p><p>2) The length, breadth and complexity of the manuscript make it a bit difficult to get through. The supplementary material is embedded in the.pdf and I would not have been able to understand the paper without it. Unfortunately that makes it a full 48 pages of text that is not double-spaced, figures and tables. Some display items that are currently listed as supplementary, like Supplementary file 2 and Figure 7—figure supplement 1, should be moved to the main text and the lengthy description of the crosses should be slimmed down and/or partially moved to the supplementary materials.</p><p>3) The notation for the simulations was difficult to understand. It begins as a one locus model with haplotypes D and d but the second portion models two antagonistic drivers with the same notation. Similarly, the equilibrium inbreeding coefficient <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:mover><mml:mi>F</mml:mi><mml:mo accent="true">̂</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:math></inline-formula> is defined as <italic>S</italic>/(2-<italic>S</italic>) but the Frequency is given as 1-<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf2"><mml:mover><mml:mi>F</mml:mi><mml:mo accent="true">̂</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:math></inline-formula> below and I couldn't tell if <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf3"><mml:mover><mml:mi>F</mml:mi><mml:mo accent="true">̂</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:math></inline-formula> could evolve or not. I looked at the code on github and it was coded as (1-<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf4"><mml:mover><mml:mi>F</mml:mi><mml:mo accent="true">̂</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:math></inline-formula>) but not clear if that was an initial condition.</p><p>4) Related to this, the simulations address a specific scenario of invasion by a gene drive element. The scope of the simulations is limited because of this scenario and some of the hard-coded parameters, for example a fixed cost to inbreeding and the brood proportions under selfing and outcrossing. One (highly speculative) explanation I've read for toxin/antidotes is that they originated as gamete competition proteins, possibly in multiple mating systems. Under this hypothesis the evolution of self-fertility could have been linked to an escape from toxin/antidotes as selfing makes them effectively neutral. In the Discussion the authors state that their simulations suggest antagonistic drive is unlikely to play a role in balancing selection but my intuition is that if certain parameters, for example viability and the inbreeding coefficient, were allowed to evolve the simulations would show different results. The authors do not need to develop extensive simulations but they do need to limit the scope of their discussion of their simulation results.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.62587.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>[…] I have fairly substantial presentation issues I detail below to improve clarity.</p><p>1) The quantity of work in a single paper also means that the manuscript is currently very dense and quite hard to follow, with overly detailed descriptions of some results, a lack of precision in some others, and an overall lack of cohesion across the different parts of the work.

In particular, the reviewer’s suggested modifier analysis is an important next step. We have now emphasised the restricted inferences that can be made from the simulated system, which was designed to test how variation in selfing rate controls the spread of Medea-type elements under simplified conditions.</p><p>The simulations in the original manuscript have penetrance fixed at 95%, and we share the reviewer’s expectation that unequal penetrances of antagonistic drivers would substantially change the evolutionary dynamics and outcomes. We have added a brief description of evolutionary dynamics when antagonistic drivers have unequal strength, similar to those we observed. In the discussion of simulation results, we now note:</p><p>“Effective neutrality in this scenario depends on the equal penetrance of antagonistic haplotypes in the model. […] Overall, selfing reduces Medea load both by decreasing heterozygote frequency and by inducing strong positive frequency-dependent selection that prevents antagonistic alleles from co-occurring.”</p><p>We are aware that any association between selfing rate and Medea elements is at this stage speculation, and have tried to be clear on this throughout the paper. We draw attention, for instance, to the final paragraph of the Introduction, in which “We <italic>hypothesize</italic> that offspring-killing haplotypes select for a high selfing rate in this species”, in the final sentence.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Finally, a main result from the simulations is that selfers should be pretty good at eliminating simple drive systems, yet they seem to be quite common.

The simulations show that drive is not very effective under high rates of selfing, and so other processes may be at play, some of which we discuss throughout the Discussion (specifically in the subsections “Selfing and population genetics”, “Population dynamics of Medea elements” and “Strategies to combat Medea factors”. Our overall hypothesis is that Medeas can fix in local populations of selfers by drift (equally fit homozygous genotypes in highly selfing populations), but then they are not very good at spreading from population to population.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) There is no experimental evidence for how the incompatibilities are determined at the mechanistic level, yet the paper varies in terminology and explicitly assumes a maternal toxin-zygotic antitoxin system at some places, especially in the simulation work.

Although the phenotypic consequences on offspring are not completely equivalent (effects here are mostly on larvae, not embryos), and the mechanistic basis of Medea factors is similarly obscure at present, we think this is an appropriate usage of this subclass of genetic drive. We continue to use “toxin” and “antidote,” with an express caveat, where we first introduce these terms, that they are shorthand for the genetic phenomena of “maternal-effect dominant larval arrest activity” and “zygotic-effect dominant rescue activity.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It is also currently unclear whether the fact that the incompatibility loci are found within islets of genomic divergence is a significant observation, or just a fortuitous coincidence. Given the effort to define those divergent stretches, the authors seem to suggest that they played a disproportionate role, but this could be clarified.</p></disp-quote><p>We think the overlap of incompatibility and divergent loci is probably not coincidental.</p><p>More than 10 Mb of the <italic>C. tropicalis</italic> NIC58 genome is divergent in JU1373, however, and we have mapped three Medea loci to around 100 kb. So this is, at best, informed speculation at present. Our description is meant to provide a full account of data relevant to understanding the incompatibilities, and to connect our findings to precedents set by <italic>C. elegans</italic> Medeas and the <italic>C. tropicalis</italic> Medea characterised by Ben-David et al., 2020.

The authors repeatedly use the word &quot;drive&quot; for what has been called maternally-inherited incompatibility or selfish element by their predecessors. It may seem purely conventional but it considerably obscures the reading -and most readers, that will (unfortunately) take the time for only a superficial reading will misunderstand what the authors mean… The word &quot;drive&quot; (meiotic drive or gene drive) usually describes meiotic distortion, i.e. nonmendelian proportions at the gamete stage. Here what we have is an incompatibility which results from an interaction between maternal and zygotic genotypes, and kills some of the offspring well after fertilization has taken place. It may sound boring, but replacing &quot;drive&quot; or &quot;driver&quot; EVERYWHERE in the manuscript by something like mother-offspring incompatibility or any other adequate term is absolutely necessary – otherwise the impact of this beautiful paper might be to generate confusion.</p></disp-quote><p>We respect the reviewer’s strong views on the use of drive, and have replaced all specific usages with “Medea” elements. Our goal is effective communication, and we appreciate this guidance.</p><p>At the same time, we believe that current usage of “gene drive” is not at all restricted to the meiotic case. The most common usage at present is in the context of CRISPR-engineered gene drive, which is a non-meiotic mechanism, and the next most common is probably gamete-killing (e.g., <italic>t</italic>-alleles in mice and <italic>sd</italic> in flies), which acts postmeiotically. A recent major review of gene drive (Price et al., 2020), the result of a dedicated meeting on the topic, lists Medea-type elements in their Table 1, “Gene drive systems.” We favor a definition of drive that we employed in our 2008 paper (Seidel, Rockman and Kruglyak, 2008) about a paternal-effect Medea-like element: genic drive occurs when selection at the level of alleles within an individual (genic selection) acts independently of selection at the level of individuals within a population (genotypic selection).</p><p>We now note in the Introduction, “Haplotypes that behave in this way are known as Medea elements (Beeman et al., 1992; Beeman and Friesen, 1999), and they represent a form of post-zygotic gene drive (Price et al., 2020; Wade and Beeman, 1994).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) A second, less important, comment is that the very last element of conclusion (that this kind of incompatibilities actually select for selfing) is the only bit that is not properly demonstrated. What the models document is actually the reverse (the impact of fixed selfing rates on incompatibilities); but none of these models actually involves modifiers of selfing rate. Sure, selfing reduces the population cost of incompatibilities, BUT a long history of models has made clear that there is no equivalence between this reduced cost and the fact that a modifier of selfer will easily hitchhike incompatibilities to invade a population. For example, it is not clear that outcrossing actually generates enough heterozygosity at incompatibility loci for this to occur in natural populations. So I'm happy with the assertion in the title (selfing is &quot;safe&quot;) but not really with the idea that more selfing is selected when incompatibilities are present (while the reverse is proven, this kind of incompatibilities can reach higher frequency in the presence of selfing). This idea should be presented as a hypothesis… to be formally modelled and tested elsewhere.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree completely, and aim to be clear in the manuscript that this is indeed a hypothesis, for instance, the final paragraph in the Introduction states, “We <italic>hypothesize</italic> that offspring-killing haplotypes select for a high selfing rate in this species”, and the very last sentence in the paper states, “incompatibility <italic>may</italic> also lead to increased selfing”, which we hope the reviewer can see are not strong assertions of fact. Indeed, we hope to explore this hypothesis through further, more detailed simulations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>[…] Overall I find the work important, exciting and high-quality. However, there are several aspects of the article that require revision prior to publication.</p><p>1) The Abstract references gene drive elements that are consistent with maternal toxin/zygotic antidote systems but there is no mechanistic evidence presented that these are in fact maternal toxin/antidotes. Toxin/antidote systems like zeel/peel have been described in C. elegans (and recently in a preprint in C. tropicalis) but invoke a very specific mechanism where toxins are present in gametes and rescued by antidotes expressed in development. The authors need to scale this back, in some parts of the manuscript (for example the sections describing the crosses) they are very careful to refer to this as gene drive and in other parts (the simulations) it is speculative.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is entirely correct that we do not yet have mechanistic (molecular) evidence that the Medea-type elements we have discovered are maternal toxins/zygotic antidotes. We have now added an introduction to Medea-type elements and we add the disclaimer that “we describe it as a toxin-antidote system for convenience, though the underlying mechanism of maternal-effect dominant lethality and zygotic-effect dominant rescue may be different.” This short-hand makes the models much easier to describe.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The length, breadth and complexity of the manuscript make it a bit difficult to get through. The supplementary material is embedded in the.pdf and I would not have been able to understand the paper without it. Unfortunately that makes it a full 48 pages of text that is not double-spaced, figures and tables. Some display items that are currently listed as supplementary, like Supplementary file 2 and Figure 7—figure supplement 1, should be moved to the main text and the lengthy description of the crosses should be slimmed down and/or partially moved to the supplementary materials.</p></disp-quote><p>We acknowledge this and have now greatly simplified the manuscript around the incompatibilities, moving most of the genomics and population genetics to a separate work. We will happily accept further advice about which supplementary figures should be in the main text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The notation for the simulations was difficult to understand. It begins as a one locus model with haplotypes D and d but the second portion models two antagonistic drivers with the same notation. Similarly, the equilibrium inbreeding coefficient <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf5"><mml:mover><mml:mi>F</mml:mi><mml:mo accent="true">̂</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:math></inline-formula> is defined as S/(2-S) but the Frequency is given as (1-<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf6"><mml:mover><mml:mi>F</mml:mi><mml:mo accent="true">̂</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:math></inline-formula>) below and I couldn't tell if <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf7"><mml:mover><mml:mi>F</mml:mi><mml:mo accent="true">̂</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:math></inline-formula> could evolve or not. I looked at the code on github and it was coded as (1-<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf8"><mml:mover><mml:mi>F</mml:mi><mml:mo accent="true">̂</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:math></inline-formula>) but not clear if that was an initial condition.</p></disp-quote><p>We have rewritten the Materials and methods section to address these issues. We use the neutral equilibrium <italic>Fhat</italic> = <italic>S</italic>/(2-<italic>S</italic>) to determine the starting genotype frequencies for each simulation, but in subsequent generations only <italic>S</italic> is fixed and selection can drive <italic>F</italic> far from neutral equilibrium (as seen in Figure 10—figure supplement 2B).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Related to this, the simulations address a specific scenario of invasion by a gene drive element. The scope of the simulations is limited because of this scenario and some of the hard-coded parameters, for example a fixed cost to inbreeding and the brood proportions under selfing and outcrossing. One (highly speculative) explanation I've read for toxin/antidotes is that they originated as gamete competition proteins, possibly in multiple mating systems. Under this hypothesis the evolution of self-fertility could have been linked to an escape from toxin/antidotes as selfing makes them effectively neutral. In the Discussion the authors state that their simulations suggest antagonistic drive is unlikely to play a role in balancing selection but my intuition is that if certain parameters, for example viability and the inbreeding coefficient, were allowed to evolve the simulations would show different results. The authors do not need to develop extensive simulations but they do need to limit the scope of their discussion of their simulation results.</p></disp-quote><p>These are absolutely important caveats to our simulations, which address a much narrower question than our speculations in the Discussion. We have added text to make it clearer that the simulations do not allow the viabilities or selfing rates to evolve. We also add several sentences describing new simulations about the case of antagonistic Medea elements with unequal penetrances. Additions, as well as some relevant passages from the original version, are listed below.</p><p>Results (new): subsection “Medea dynamics in partial selfers”, first paragraph “Selfing rate is a fixed parameter in this system, and we leave a fuller exploration of the coevolutionary dynamics of selfing and intergenerational incompatibilities to future work”.</p><p>Results (new): subsection “Medea dynamics in partial selfers”, second paragraph “Effective neutrality in this scenario depends on the equal penetrance of antagonistic haplotypes in the model. […] Overall, selfing reduces Medea load both by decreasing heterozygote frequency and by inducing strong positive frequency-dependent selection that prevents antagonistic alleles from co-occurring”</p><p>Discussion (modified): subsection “Population dynamics of Medea elements”, second paragraph “antagonistic Medeas do not generate balancing selection, at least under the scenarios modeled”.</p><p>Materials and methods (modified): subsection “Simulations”, first paragraph “During the simulations <italic>S</italic> is fixed but <italic>F</italic> can be far from its equilibrium value due to selection.”</p><p>Materials and methods (modified): subsection “Simulations”, sixth paragraph.</p><p>Additional changes:</p><p>We performed new experiments to measure the maternal-effect killing of the NIC58 chromosome V haplotype. In our original submission, we had limited, imperfect data for this point, which was reported under the “NIC58 Driver” heading in Figure 9B. With a new strain that carries a fluorescent reporter to distinguish self- and cross-progeny, we were able to generate cleaner data, now reported in the same figure (now Figure 7B) under the “NIC58 Medea” heading. The qualitative results and interpretations are unchanged, but the sample sizes and quality of the data are improved.</p><p>The original text, “Crosses testing the JU1373 drivers showed that both acted via maternal, and not paternal, effect (Figure 9B). Crosses testing the NIC58 driver ruled out paternal effect (Figure 9B); crosses testing a maternal effect were confounded by the poor mating ability of JU1373 males, but were consistent with a maternal effect (Figure 9B). We therefore infer a maternal effect for the NIC58 driver, and conclude that all three driver alleles act via maternal, and not paternal, effect (Figure 9C),” now reads “Crosses testing the JU1373 and NIC58 Medeas showed that all acted via maternal, and not paternal, effect (Figure 7B).” We also added the details of the new cross to the Materials and methods section.</p></body></sub-article></article>
