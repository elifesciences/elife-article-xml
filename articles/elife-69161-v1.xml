parallel the complexity of mammalian brains in terms of neuronal numbers and richness in behavioral output. How the cephalopod brain develops has only been described at the morphological level, and it remains unclear where the progenitor cells are located and what molecular factors drive neurogenesis. Using histological techniques, we located dividing cells, neural progenitors and postmitotic neurons in <italic>Octopus vulgaris</italic> embryos. Our results indicate that an important pool of progenitors, expressing the conserved bHLH transcription factors <italic>achaete-scute</italic> or <italic>neurogenin</italic>, is located outside the central brain cords in the lateral lips adjacent to the eyes, suggesting that newly formed neurons migrate into the cords. Lineage-tracing experiments then showed that progenitors, depending on their location in the lateral lips, generate neurons for the different lobes, similar to the squid <italic>Doryteuthis pealeii</italic>. The finding that octopus newborn neurons migrate over long distances is reminiscent of vertebrate neurogenesis and suggests it might be a fundamental strategy for large brain development.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Octopuses have evolved incredibly large and complex nervous systems that allow them to perform impressive behaviors, like plan ahead, navigate and solve puzzles. The nervous system of the common octopus (also known as <italic>Octopus vulgaris</italic>) contains over half a billion nerves cells called neurons, similar to the number found in small primates. Two thirds of these cells reside in the octopuses’ arms, while the rest make-up a central brain that sits between their eyes.</p><p>Very little is known about how this central brain forms in the embryo, including where the cells originate and which molecular factors drive their maturation in to adult cells. To help answer these questions, Deryckere et al. studied the brain of <italic>Octopus vulgaris</italic> at different stages of early development using various cell staining and imaging techniques. The experiments identified an important pool of dividing cells which sit in an area outside the central brain called the ‘lateral lips’. In these cells, genes known to play a role in neural development in other animals are active, indicating that the cells had not reached their final, mature state.</p><p>In contrast, the central brain did not seem to contain any of these immature cells at the point when it was growing the most. To investigate this further, Deryckere et al. used fluorescent markers to track the progeny of the dividing cells during development. This revealed that cells in the lateral lips take on a specific neuronal fate before migrating to their target region in the central brain. Newly matured neurons have also been shown to travel large distances in the embryos of vertebrates, suggesting that this mechanism may be a common strategy for building large, complex brains.</p><p>Although the nervous system of the common octopus is comparable to mammals, they evolved from a very distant branch of the tree of life; indeed, their last common ancestor was a worm-like animal that lived about 600 million years ago. Studying the brain of the common octopus, as done here, could therefore provide new insights into how complex nervous systems, including our own, evolved over time.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>octopus vulgaris</kwd><kwd>neuronal migration</kwd><kwd>neurogenesis</kwd><kwd>transcription factors</kwd><kwd>brain development</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003130</institution-id><institution>Fonds Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SB/1S19517N</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Deryckere</surname><given-names>Astrid</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003130</institution-id><institution>Fonds Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SB/11D4120N</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Elagoz</surname><given-names>Ali Murat</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004040</institution-id><institution>KU Leuven</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ID-N/20/007</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Seuntjens</surname><given-names>Eve</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100010685</institution-id><institution>Stazione Zoologica Anton Dohrn</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Styfhals</surname><given-names>Ruth</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004040</institution-id><institution>KU Leuven</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>IOFm/17/014</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Maes</surname><given-names>Gregory E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Neurogenic progenitor cells surrounding the eye placode generate neurons that migrate over long distances to the developing octopus brain.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cephalopod mollusks represent an invertebrate lineage that exhibits morphological as well as behavioral complexity reminiscent of vertebrates. Studying species from this group thus brings an opportunity to understand the genetic drivers of the development of nervous systems that evolved convergently with vertebrates. The adult cephalopod mollusk <italic>Octopus vulgaris</italic> has a highly centralized brain containing about 200 million nerve cells in the supra- and subesophageal mass and two optic lobes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib133">Young, 1963</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib135">Young, 1971</xref>), yet the cellular and molecular mechanisms driving brain development remain poorly understood. At hatching, the <italic>O. vulgaris</italic> brain counts about 200,000 cells and occupies roughly one fourth of the total body, indicating extensive embryonic neurogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Budelmann, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Giuditta et al., 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Packard and Albergoni, 1970</xref>). In general, neural progenitor cells are generated from ectodermal cells and divide symmetrically and asymmetrically to generate all neurons of the nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Florio and Huttner, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Kriegstein and Alvarez-Buylla, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib129">Wodarz and Huttner, 2003</xref>). In clades harboring species with diffuse nerve nets such as cnidaria and hemichordates, the proliferating neural progenitor cells are distributed throughout the ectoderm generating local neurons, while in (sub)phyla with a centralized nervous system including vertebrates, arthropods and some annelids, the neural progenitor cells are grouped in the neurectoderm. The proliferating neural progenitor cells either remain on the apical surface of the neurectoderm in vertebrates and annelids, or internalize as is the case for insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Cunningham and Casey, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Götz and Huttner, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Hartenstein and Stollewerk, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Lowe et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Meyer and Seaver, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Rentzsch et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Simionato et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib123">Taverna et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Urbach and Technau, 2004</xref>). In addition, long-distance migration of neurons has been described for developing vertebrate brains, in which neurons born in different zones follow long trajectories to their final location, where they intermingle to form complex circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">García-Moreno and Molnár, 2020</xref>). Although neuronal migration has been described in developing invertebrate nervous systems as well, this process is generally limited to restricted cell populations, for example the Q, CAN and HSN neuroblasts in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Blelloch et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Forrester et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Montell, 1999</xref>), or to short-range migratory events, for example in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> visual system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Apitz and Salecker, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bhat, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Morante et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Molecular studies in vertebrates, <italic>Drosophila</italic>, <italic>C. elegans</italic>, but also cnidarians, have revealed a set of regulatory transcription factors involved in neurogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arendt et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bertrand et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Galliot et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Hirth, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Layden et al., 2012</xref>). First, group B SRY-related HMG box genes (<italic>soxB</italic> genes) regulate the generation of the neurectoderm and also maintain neurectodermal cells in an undifferentiated and proliferative state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Guth and Wegner, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Sarkar and Hochedlinger, 2013</xref>). After neurectoderm formation, members of the superfamily of basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors control the specification of neural progenitor cells and also activate neuronal differentiation pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bertrand et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib125">Vervoort and Ledent, 2001</xref>). The bHLH protein superfamily is divided in groups A-F, based on structural and biochemical properties. bHLH genes such as <italic>atonal</italic>, <italic>neurogenic differentiation</italic> (<italic>neuroD</italic>) and <italic>neurogenin</italic> (<italic>ngn</italic>), and <italic>achaete-scute</italic> (<italic>asc</italic>) complex members are classified in group A. The role of bHLH genes is best described in nervous system development where members of this group A (and some of group B) regulate the patterning, differentiation and specification of neurons, from sponges to primates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Powell and Jarman, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Simionato et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib125">Vervoort and Ledent, 2001</xref>). Although the level of differentiation of progenitor cells in which these factors are expressed and the sequential expression of bHLH genes differs slightly across species, they all steer progenitor cells towards a neural fate. After this neural progenitor commitment, regulatory genes such as <italic>musashi</italic>, <italic>prospero</italic>, and <italic>embryonic lethal abnormal vision</italic> (<italic>elav</italic>) (vertebrate <italic>hu</italic>), will activate programs to initiate differentiation of progenitor cells into neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Choksi et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Okano et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Pascale et al., 2008</xref>). In the end, postmitotic neurons will mature, form synapses, and produce neurotransmitters to form a fully functional central nervous system (CNS).</p><p>These neurogenic processes are poorly studied in lophotrochozoans, and above all, in lophotrochozoans with a complex nervous system such as <italic>O. vulgaris</italic>. How and where neurons are generated, whether they migrate and what factors drive their differentiation and integration remain largely unknown. One lineage tracing study in the squid <italic>Doryteuthis pealeii</italic> revealed that cells surrounding the eye placode contribute to the anterior chamber organ, the supraesophageal mass, the buccal mass and the buccal ganglion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Koenig et al., 2016</xref>). Our study is the first combining gene expression data with functional lineage tracing to explain neurogenesis in cephalopods. The high fecundity of <italic>O. vulgaris</italic>, spawning small and transparent eggs that can be kept in a remote tank system, as well as the available genomic data recently made it a tractable species for embryonic studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Deryckere et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib137">Zarrella et al., 2019</xref>). Here, we have visualized the anatomy of brain development in 3D using light sheet microscopy. Expression analysis of several transcription factors, proliferation and neural markers revealed the spatial and temporal pattern of <italic>O. vulgaris</italic> brain development from stage IX onwards. Lastly, lineage-tracing studies using CFDA-SE flash labeling proved that the neurogenic area is spatially and temporally patterned. Our data suggest that <italic>O. vulgaris</italic> deploys a neurogenic transcription factor sequence during neurogenesis, as well as extensive neural migration, that are reminiscent of vertebrate mechanisms of large brain generation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The rapidly growing octopus brain suggests massive embryonic neurogenesis</title><p><italic>O. vulgaris</italic> displays a direct embryonic development, giving rise to actively feeding paralarvae. Their embryonic development takes approximately 40 days at 19°C and has been classified in 20 major stages I-XX, with some stages subdivided in an early and late part (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Deryckere et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Naef, 1928</xref>). Organogenesis starts at Stage VII.2 and can be split in early, mid-, and late phases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We used paraffin sectioning and light sheet imaging combined with DAPI staining to document the different steps of brain development in 2 and 3 dimensions. In the early organogenesis phase, the brain anlagen (cordal) are elongated and interconnected (in three dimensions) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>) as also described by Shigeno et al. for <italic>Octopus bimaculoides</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Shigeno et al., 2015</xref>). On the most anterior side, lateral and posterior to the mouth and foregut, the cerebral cord (CC) will give rise to the lobes of the supraesophageal mass (SEM), while on the posterior side of the embryo, the palliovisceral (PVC) and pedal (PC) cords will form the subesophageal mass (SUB). The two bilateral optic cords (OC) will differentiate and grow to form the optic lobes (OL) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,C</xref>). At hatching, the central brain that now surrounds the esophagus is considerably big and contains densely packed nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). In contrast to the growing brain cords, the tissue adjacent to the eye primordia first grows in size from Stage VII.2 to Stage XV.2, and then shrinks to disappear at hatching, suggesting this tissue might contribute to the inner head structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). This tissue was first described as ‘Kopflappen’ by Marquis and later as ‘anterior chamber organ’ by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Koenig et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Marquis, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Shigeno et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib132">Yamamoto et al., 2003</xref>. However, the term ‘anterior chamber organ’ was introduced by Young, referring to neurovenous tissue adjacent to the adult eye, that presumably regulates the fluid content between the lens and cornea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib134">Young, 1970</xref>). The term was most likely wrongly adopted embryonically as the tissue at that stage is not restricted to the anterior side of each eye, but is rather placed lateral to the eye fields. Based on 3D light sheet imaging, we could clearly show that the structure is also connected to the central brain, through a stream-like transition zone. Because of its position and shape, we renamed the tissue to ‘lateral lips’ (LL, indicated in mint green in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,E</xref>) and introduced the terms ‘anterior transition zone’ (ATZ) and ‘posterior transition zone’ (PTZ) for the region that interconnects the lateral lips with the central brain on the anterior or posterior side of the embryo, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,F</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Overview of the developing <italic>O. vulgaris</italic> embryo and its nervous system.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Overview of <italic>O. vulgaris</italic> embryonic development from Stage IX to Stage XX.2, covering early-, mid-, and late- organogenesis events and maturation.

These stages serve as a starting point for the characterization of nervous system development during organogenesis (Stage IX-XVII) and maturation phases (Stage XIX.1 and XX.2) of embryonic development. <italic>Ov-elav</italic> transcripts were detected throughout development with little expression at Stage IX in the cerebral, palliovisceral, pedal, and optic cords (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Strong staining was observed from Stage XI onwards, with low-level staining in the lateral lips surrounding the eye placode and more intense staining in all cords and surrounding the mouth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). A similar pattern was observed at subsequent stages with highest staining intensity in the central brain cords/masses and low intensity staining in the lateral lips. At Stage XIII, a region in between the lateral lips and the central brain on the posterior side of the embryo showed intermediate <italic>Ov-elav</italic> expression. This region corresponds to the posterior transition zone (PTZ), introduced earlier (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). From Stage XV.2 onwards, cells on the anterior side of the embryo and laterally from the supraesophageal mass, corresponding to the anterior transition zone (ATZ), showed intermediate <italic>Ov-elav</italic> expression levels as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D,E</xref>). In the optic lobes at stages XIX.1 and XX.2, <italic>Ov-elav</italic> expression was highest in the medulla and inner granular layer, but lower in the outer granular layer. The ATZ and PTZ shrink toward the end of embryonic development and seem to become integrated in the developing brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F,G</xref>). In summary, our data indicate that neuronal differentiation is present at early organogenesis phases already, and the transition zones as well as the growing cords and masses contain large numbers of differentiating neurons.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Formation of the <italic>O. vulgaris</italic> brain.</title><p>In situ hybridization of <italic>Ov-elav</italic> (left column) and <italic>Ov-syt</italic> (middle column) and immunoreactivity against acetylated alpha tubulin (right column) on transversal sections of embryos at Stage IX, XI, XIII, XV.2, XVII, XIX.1, and XX.2 with anterior up and posterior down.

At the beginning of organogenesis (Stage IX and XI), <italic>Ov-neuroD</italic> was expressed in the cerebral, palliovisceral, pedal and optic cords of the central nervous system. Transcripts were also detected in the lateral lips, although in fewer cells compared to the cords (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4O,P</xref>). At Stage XI in the optic cords, a medio-lateral expression gradient was observed with high <italic>Ov-neuroD</italic> at the medial side and low <italic>Ov-neuroD</italic> at the lateral side, closer to the eyes. <italic>Ov-neuroD</italic> also seemed more highly expressed in the cerebral and palliovisceral cords compared to the pedal cord (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4P</xref>). At Stage XIII, <italic>Ov-neuroD</italic> transcripts were absent from the region of <italic>Ov-ascl1</italic> expressing cells in the lateral lips, but were present adjacent to those cells on the posterior side of the embryo next to the sinus ophthalmicus, and mark the posterior transition zone. In addition, <italic>Ov-neuroD</italic> expression in the cerebral, palliovisceral and optic cords was significantly reduced compared to earlier stages and expression in the pedal cord was elevated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4Q</xref>). At Stages XV.2 and XVII, high level <italic>Ov-neuroD</italic> expression marked both the anterior and posterior transition zones. In the central brain, transcripts were present at low level in the optic lobes on the medial side, and in the outer layers of the supra- and subesophageal masses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4R,S</xref>, low level staining in the developing cords/lobes that did not consistently appear in all replicates was considered background). A similar expression pattern was visible at Stages XIX.1 and XX.2 with clear expression in the transition zones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4T,U</xref>). <italic>Ov-neuroD</italic> transcripts thus label the transition zones that connect the proliferative lateral lips to the postmitotic central brain.</p><p>While our data indicate that the lateral lips are a proliferating region with cells expressing the typical neurogenic transcription factors <italic>Ov-ascl1</italic> and <italic>Ov-ngn,</italic> it is not clear whether these represent different progenitor types. In addition, it was not proven yet that <italic>Ov-neuroD</italic> effectively labeled postmitotic cells. In a hybridization chain reaction experiment combined with immunohistochemistry, we show that <italic>Ov-ngn</italic> and <italic>Ov-ascl1</italic> are likely expressed in a different subset of progenitor cells, since their expression was not overlapping (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–C</xref>). Furthermore, co-staining with the PH3 antibody demonstrated that <italic>Ov-ascl1<sup>+</sup></italic> progenitor cells seem more proliferative compared to <italic>Ov-ngn<sup>+</sup></italic> progenitors, that rarely overlap with the PH3<sup>+</sup> population at this late-organogenesis stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–G</xref>).

If the progenitor cells in the lateral lips identified in this study would contribute neurons to the CNS, postmitotic neurons would need to travel long distances from the lateral lips to the central brain.

This technique has been applied in vivo to study temporal neurogenesis patterns in the mammalian cerebral cortex because of the short lifetime of the dye when not incorporated in cells and thus high temporal specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Govindan et al., 2018</xref>). We labeled different populations of cells in the lateral lips in early, mid or late organogenesis phases (Stages IX, XII.1, or XV.2) and traced their progeny to the maturation phase (Stage XIX.2). First, we will focus on the supra- and subesophageal masses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). At hatching, the major lobes described for the adult supra- and subesophageal masses can be distinguished, with the supraesophageal mass consisting of buccal, inferior frontal, superior frontal, subfrontal, vertical, subvertical, basal, dorsal basal and medial basal lobes, and the subesophageal mass consisting of the palliovisceral and pedal lobes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A–C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib135">Young, 1971</xref>). For these regions, we identified progenitor cells in the lateral lips that generate output to the different lobes in the supra- and subesophageal masses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D–J</xref>). Specifically, a major contribution to the palliovisceral lobe found its origin in progenitor cells in the dorsal-posterior quadrant of the lateral lips at Stage IX, as was suggested but not empirically proven by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Koenig et al., 2016</xref> (example in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D–E</xref>). Other ventral-posterior progenitor populations generated a limited output to the palliovisceral lobe (orange and red injection spots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D,G,I</xref>). In addition, progenitor cells in the posterior lateral lip distinctly contributed cells to the inferior and superior frontal lobes of the supraesophageal mass at all stages, which has not been reported before by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Koenig et al., 2016</xref> (example in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G–H</xref>). Progenitor cells in the ventral lateral lips also produced cells destined to the basal lobes (basal lobe, dorsal basal lobe, medial basal lobe) of the supraesophageal mass (orange and red injection spots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D,G,I</xref>). The majority of cells located in the supraesophageal mass, however, were derived from ventral-anterior progenitor cells in the lateral lips (example in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D,F,I,J</xref>). In contrast to the supraesophageal mass and the palliovisceral lobe, few labeled progenitor populations generated cells for the pedal lobe of the subesophageal mass. Apart from the ventral-anterior progenitor populations at Stage XV.2 (example in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I–J</xref>), we did not identify progenitor populations that gave rise to a significant number of cells that migrated to the pedal lobe. Occasionally, we identified few, single randomly dispersed cells in the pedal or palliovisceral lobes originating from more ventrally located progenitor populations.

We further delineated embryonic neurogenesis in <italic>O. vulgaris</italic> using neural progenitor, pan-neuronal and differentiated-neuron marker genes with conserved expression in neurogenesis, neural specification and differentiation in protostomes and deuterostomes. The spatiotemporal expression patterns of these neurogenic genes suggest their involvement in regulating the development of the CNS in <italic>O. vulgaris</italic>. Koenig et al. have suggested a basic fate map of the neural primordia in <italic>D. pealeii</italic> using DiI tracing experiments, and identified contributions of cells from the lateral lips to the developing central brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Koenig et al., 2016</xref>). Our data using a carboxyfluorescein ester that is less leaky compared to DiI, indicate that the spatial map seems to be conserved in cephalopods. In addition, we show that patterning is established at early neurogenesis stages and is grossly temporally maintained, suggesting that lobe-specificity is determined early on within the progenitor area. Next to clear spatial patterning in the lateral lips, we identified long-distance migration of cells generated in the lateral lips towards the central brain in octopuses.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title><italic>Octopus vulgaris</italic> CNS maturation is delayed compared to other cephalopods</title><p>To determine when and where the first postmitotic immature neurons and differentiated neurons are formed in <italic>O. vulgaris</italic> embryos, we studied the expression of <italic>Ov-elav</italic> and <italic>Ov-syt</italic>, respectively. In the organogenesis phase, <italic>Ov-elav</italic> is expressed in embryonic cells lining the yolk envelope that form the cords, as in <italic>O. bimaculoides</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Shigeno et al., 2015</xref>). The expression pattern is also consistent with the description of brain precursor regions proposed by Marquis after cytological studies in <italic>O. vulgaris</italic>, reinforcing the use of <italic>elav</italic> as a reliable marker for young octopus neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Marquis, 1989</xref>). We observed low level expression in all cords at Stage IX. In <italic>O. bimaculoides</italic>, expression was already reported from Stage VII.2 onwards, pointing toward rapid neuronal differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Shigeno et al., 2015</xref>). In contrast to both octopus species, <italic>Sof-elav1</italic> expression in the cuttlefish <italic>Sepia officinalis</italic> is unequally distributed over the different cords, and disappears toward the end of embryonic development, pointing to a different timing of neuronal differentiation and a more advanced maturation of the <italic>Sepia</italic> brain at hatching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Buresi et al., 2013</xref>). Consistent with this, <italic>S. officinalis</italic> embryos have been described to respond to tactile and chemical as well as visual cues from within the egg capsule from Stage XV.1 and XVI onwards, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Romagny et al., 2012</xref>) (for interspecies stage comparison, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Deryckere et al., 2020</xref>). In our hands, <italic>O. vulgaris</italic> embryos only seem to react to visual stimuli (chromatophore contraction in response to light change) and mechanical stimuli (mantle contraction after tapping the chorion) from Stage XIX.1 onwards (preliminary observation). Furthermore, neural processes visualized with immunostaining against acetylated alpha-tubulin revealed the presence of neurites in the cerebral, palliovisceral, pedal, and optic cords of <italic>O. bimaculoides</italic> and <italic>S. officinalis</italic> embryos as early as Stage VIII, while we only observed expression of <italic>Ov-syt</italic> and presence of acetylated alpha-tubulin in the central brain from Stages XIII and XV.2 onwards, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baratte and Bonnaud, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Shigeno et al., 2015</xref>). These findings further support the delayed maturation of the brain in <italic>O. vulgaris</italic>, that perhaps uses its paralarval phase to complete maturation of the nervous system.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Model of <italic>O. vulgaris</italic> neurogenesis and the specification of neural cell types</title><p><italic>Ov-soxB1</italic> expression is not restricted to neurectodermal progenitor regions. Consistent with <italic>Sof-soxB1</italic> expression in <italic>S. officinalis</italic>, <italic>Ov-soxB1</italic> is expressed at high level in the surface ectoderm, in the developing eyes, and is absent from the gills and stellate ganglia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Focareta and Cole, 2016</xref>). Next to (neur)ectodermal expression, <italic>soxB1</italic> is also expressed in sensory epithelia in vertebrates, invertebrate mollusks and acoelomate worms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Focareta and Cole, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Guo et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Kiernan et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Le Gouar et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Neves et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Semmler et al., 2010</xref>). In addition, SOXB1 proteins are present in both neurectodermal stem cells and differentiated neurons in certain species. <italic>Drosophila soxN</italic> and <italic>Schmidtea polychroa soxB1</italic> for example are expressed in early specification events in the CNS, but also in differentiated parts where they are involved in neuronal differentiation and axonal patterning, suggesting a dual role for protostome soxB1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ferrero et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Girard et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Monjo and Romero, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Phochanukul and Russell, 2010</xref>). While such a general function in neuronal differentiation of vertebrate soxB1 factors has not been shown, some subtypes of (inter)neurons do require SOXB1 proteins for proper specification and migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cavallaro et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ekonomou et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Panayi et al., 2010</xref>). Similar to many other species, our expression data suggest a dual role for <italic>Ov-soxB1</italic>, in early nervous system development to specify neural fate, and later on to steer neural cell differentiation.</p><p>After neurectoderm establishment and neural stem cell formation regulated by SOXB1 transcription factors, neural progenitors must be specified. In most bilaterians, this function has been attributed to members of the bHLH family of transcription factors, including <italic>atonal</italic>, <italic>neurogenin</italic>, <italic>neuroD</italic> and <italic>achaete-scute</italic> subfamilies. Our study is the first one mapping the expression of <italic>ascl1</italic> in cephalopods and together with the expression pattern of <italic>Ov-ngn</italic>, suggests the presence of a neurogenic domain in the lateral lips, outside the cords of the central brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A,B</xref>). In the annelids <italic>Capitella teleta</italic> and <italic>P. dumerilii</italic>, <italic>neurogenin</italic> and <italic>ash1</italic> are both expressed in actively proliferating neural progenitor cells in the neurectoderm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>). While <italic>Ct-ngn</italic> positive cells stay on the apical side, the <italic>Ct-ash1</italic>-positive progenitors ingress and undergo limited division before becoming <italic>Ct-elav</italic> positive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Demilly et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Meyer and Seaver, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Simionato et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">Sur et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Sur et al., 2020</xref>). In <italic>O. vulgaris</italic>, the <italic>Ov-ascl1</italic> progenitor population seems to be more proliferative compared to the <italic>Ov-ngn</italic> progenitor population, at least at Stage XV.2 (late organogenesis), which suggests their sequential expression could be turned around in cephalopods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B,C</xref>). In addition, the <italic>Ov-elav</italic> expressing neurons in the cords are not located immediately basal from the <italic>Ov-ascl1</italic> or <italic>Ov-ngn</italic> positive pool of neural progenitor cells. In particular, a population of <italic>Ov-neuroD</italic> expressing cells is found in the transition zones, in between the <italic>Ov-ascl1<sup>+</sup></italic> and <italic>Ov-ngn<sup>+</sup></italic> lateral lips and the developing <italic>Ov-elav<sup>+</sup></italic> brain, suggesting an intermediate, <italic>Ov-neuroD<sup>+</sup></italic> population is present in <italic>O. vulgaris</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A,B</xref>). While lost in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and <italic>Ciona intestinalis</italic>, <italic>neuroD</italic> genes can be widely found in bilaterians, where they steer the differentiation of neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Ledent et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Stollewerk and Simpson, 2005</xref>). In contrast, in the trunk of the annelid <italic>P. dumerilii</italic> (but not <italic>C. teleta</italic>) and in the developing nervous system of the planaria <italic>S. polychroa</italic> and <italic>S. mediterranea</italic>, <italic>neuroD</italic> seems broadly expressed in the neurectoderm, which suggests that the role of neuroD might not be conserved in Spiralia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Cowles et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Meyer and Seaver, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Monjo and Romero, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Simionato et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Sur et al., 2020</xref>). However, co-localization studies of <italic>neuroD</italic> with progenitor marker genes are still lacking in these species. In vertebrates, <italic>ascl1</italic> and <italic>ngn</italic> are expressed in a complementary fashion, both exerting proneuronal functions in neurogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bertrand et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Castro et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Farah et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Gradwohl et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Lee et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Ma et al., 1996</xref>). Similar to our data in octopus, n<italic>eurogenin</italic> expression precedes, but also partially overlaps with that of <italic>neuroD</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Grimaldi et al., 2008</xref>). In contrast, <italic>Drosophila</italic> has only one <italic>neurogenin/neuroD</italic> homolog called <italic>tap</italic>, which relates better to <italic>neurogenin</italic> based on sequence similarities, but does not have a proneural role and is expressed in a few neurons, regulating their differentiation, axonal growth and guidance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Gautier et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib125">Vervoort and Ledent, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib136">Yuan et al., 2016</xref>). In arthropods, the members of the <italic>achaete-scute</italic> subfamily are expressed in proneural clusters and promote the generation of neural progenitor cells from quiescent ectodermal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bertrand et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Cubas et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Quan and Hassan, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Skeath and Carroll, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Stollewerk and Chipman, 2006</xref>). In cnidaria as well, <italic>ashA</italic> promotes neurogenesis during its development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Layden et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>). In <italic>O. bimaculoides</italic>, <italic>neurogenin</italic> and <italic>neuroD</italic> transcripts were detected in the prospective cerebral, palliovisceral and pedal cords at Stage VIII, based on whole mount in situ hybridization, but did not distinguish the lateral lips from the cordal areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Shigeno et al., 2015</xref>). Based on cross-sections, <italic>neurogenin</italic> transcripts were found on the surface of the embryo, and <italic>neuroD</italic> more at the level of the cords, similar to our observations in <italic>O. vulgaris</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Shigeno et al., 2015</xref>). In the vertebrate neural tube, NEUROD was also found on the basal side, in postmitotic neuronal and glial cells and is required for the differentiation of neurons in the inner ear, cerebellum and hippocampus (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Dennis et al., 2019</xref>). Its expression pattern in <italic>O. vulgaris</italic> suggests that upon differentiation, neurons express <italic>Ov-neuroD</italic> before expressing <italic>Ov-elav</italic>, which is similar to the role of <italic>Ov-neuroD</italic> as neuronal-differentiation bHLH transcription factor, as described for vertebrates and the annelid <italic>C. teleta</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bertrand et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Farah et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Lee et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Sur et al., 2020</xref>). We also revealed possible overlapping expression of <italic>Ov-soxB1</italic> with <italic>Ov-ascl1</italic> and <italic>Ov-ngn</italic> in the lateral lips throughout development, suggesting a similar activation of <italic>Ov-ascl1</italic> and <italic>Ov-ngn</italic> by <italic>Ov-soxB1</italic> in the presumptive neurectoderm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amador-Arjona et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ferrero et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore, <italic>Ov-ngn</italic> and <italic>Ov-ascl1</italic> are expressed at the right time and place to be the major proneuronal genes for the formation of the central nervous system in <italic>O. vulgaris</italic>. Our data further substantiate the conserved expression of proneural bHLH transcription factors, which suggests they might already have been present in the ur-bilateria.</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Overview of the expression of neurogenic genes and hypothetical neurogenesis process in <italic>O. vulgaris</italic>.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The expression domains of <italic>Ov-ngn</italic> (purple), <italic>Ov-ascl1</italic> (green), <italic>Ov-neuroD</italic> (red), and <italic>Ov-elav</italic> (pink) are depicted during <italic>O. vulgaris</italic> neurogenesis.

The overt absence of proliferative cells in the developing brain in an organism with such a big and centralized CNS is striking, but not uncommon for mollusks. Mitosis in the <italic>Aplysia</italic> CNS is infrequent from early embryogenesis to adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Jacob, 1984</xref>). Compared to other invertebrates with large brains such as insects, however, this seems to be a rather unique strategy. The developing optic lobe in <italic>Drosophila</italic> for example has dividing neuroblasts in two main proliferation centers inside the lobe. These neuroblasts had previously invaginated from the neuroepithelium and start dividing only when in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Álvarez and Díaz-Benjumea, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Apitz and Salecker, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Green et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Hofbauer and Campos-Ortega, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib126">Walsh and Doe, 2017</xref>). The physical disconnection between the neural stem cells and their progeny in octopus suggests that secondary progenitor cells or neurons migrate towards the central brain where they integrate.</p><p>In lophotrochozoans such as the annelids <italic>C. teleta</italic> and <italic>P. dumerilii,</italic> dividing neural progenitors are located on the apical side of the neuroepithelium and it is their progeny that ingresses to form the CNS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Meyer and Seaver, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Monjo and Romero, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Sur et al., 2020</xref>). While resembling the postmitotic migration in <italic>O. vulgaris</italic>, their migratory path is short and the number of neurons remains limited, making direct comparison with <italic>O. vulgaris</italic> difficult. As described here and by Shigeno et al., the nervous system of cephalopods originates from a system of cords, similar to the nervous system of primitive mollusks like Aculifera including chitons, and in contrast to Concifera including gastropods, whose CNS knows a ganglionic origin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Richter et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Shigeno et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Sumner-Rooney and Sigwart, 2018</xref>). Gastropod ganglia seem to derive from ectodermal cells in the body wall that proliferate and delaminate/migrate inwards to join the developing ganglia. These studies suggest that similar to annelids, neural progenitor cells in the gastropod mollusk <italic>Aplysia californica</italic>, divide in proliferative zones in the body wall and their progeny migrates few cell lengths to the nearest ganglion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Demian and Yousif, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Jacob, 1984</xref>). Depending on the location in the proliferative zone, cells migrate either in a columnar stream, or individually using pseudopodia. Evidence for cell migration in cephalopods came from <italic>Loligo vulgaris</italic>, where in vitro cultures of the ‘oculo-ganglionar complex’ showed extensive migration of cells and differentiation into bi-and multipolar neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Marthy and Aroles, 1987</xref>). Here, we showed that the progeny of octopus lateral lip progenitors migrates over long distances before integration in the CNS. Strikingly, we observed that the migratory path does not just represent the shortest route to destiny. Instead, we found that independent from the anterior-posterior axis, progenitor populations in the dorsal lateral lips generate cells for the optic lobe that pass through the posterior transition zone. Cells thus migrate from the most anterior part towards the posterior part of the lateral lips before entering the posterior transition zone and eventually migrating in all directions, spreading throughout the optic lobe. This suggests active, directed migration controlled by guidance cues. Which cell intrinsic and/or extrinsic cues govern the migratory process, remains to be studied.</p><p>Active neural migration guided by extrinsic cues is common in vertebrates that build their brain from a large, spatially patterned and proliferating neural epithelium folded into a tube. Neurons are generated in a temporally controlled fashion and migrate away from the progenitor zone surrounding the ventricles to form the grey matter. The latter entirely consists of postmitotic neurons that start growing neurites and connect while additional postmitotic neurons are migrating in between them to their target region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Marín et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Marín and Rubenstein, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Paridaen and Huttner, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib123">Taverna et al., 2014</xref>). In that respect, the development of the <italic>O. vulgaris</italic> brain seems strikingly similar. Yet <italic>O. vulgaris</italic> seems to pattern the lateral lips in such a manner that entire brain lobes are derived from specific areas in the lateral lips, whereas specification in vertebrates links spatial (i.e. progenitor area) or temporal patterning to cell types that are intermingled in certain regions. An example is the subpallium, that generates (among other cell types) cortical interneurons, while the dorsal pallium generates pyramidal neurons, and both are mixed in the cerebral cortex. Another example is the postnatal V-SVZ, where different areas generate distinct interneuron types destined for the olfactory lobe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Hatten, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Marín and Rubenstein, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Marín and Rubenstein, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Medina and Abellán, 2009</xref>).</p><p>Neurons that are born in a specific region of the lateral lips thus seem instructed to migrate to a certain brain lobe, but how they get specified to different cell types within that lobe remains unclear. Indeed, cells from one injection site mostly spread out over a whole lobe, except for the optic lobe, where we identified lateral lip subregions that are biased to generate optic lobe cortex or optic lobe medulla neurons. Interestingly, the proportion of cells in those layers increased when progenitor labeling was performed at later stages, indicating that cell types might be specified in a temporal manner as well. To investigate this observation in more detail, additional molecular markers for different neuronal subpopulations need to be identified. Furthermore, while proneural bHLH transcription factors are likely involved in specifying and maintaining neural progenitor identity, the transcription factors that serve as terminal selectors need to be revealed. Lastly, as the lateral lips shrink to almost completely disappear towards the end of development, there must be a second, yet undefined source of progenitors, which generates additional neurons in post-hatching stages for the adult brain.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key

Almansa (IEO, Tenerife), transferred to the lab of Developmental neurobiology and kept in a closed standalone system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Deryckere et al., 2020</xref>). Embryos were observed, staged and sampled daily, followed by overnight fixation in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in phosphate buffered saline (PBS). After a wash in PBS, embryos were manually dechorionated with tweezers and transferred to embedding cassettes (Tissue-Tek Biopsy 6-Chamber Cassette, Sakura). For paraffin processing, the cassettes were immersed in 0.9% NaCl overnight before progressive dehydration and paraffin-embedding using an Excelsior AS Tissue Processor and HistoStar Embedding Workstation (Thermo Scientific). 6 μm-thick transversal sections were made for subsequent immunohistochemistry or in situ hybridization.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Immunohistochemistry on paraffin sections</title><p>Embryo sections were processed using an automated platform (Ventana Discovery, Roche) for direct fluorescent staining. Primary antibodies mouse anti-Acetylated alpha Tubulin (Sigma T6793), rabbit anti phospho-histone H3 (Ser10) (Millipore 06–570), and goat anti fluorescein (Novus Biologicals NB600-493) and secondary antibodies donkey anti-mouse Alexa 488, donkey anti-rabbit Alexa 555, and donkey anti-goat Alexa 488 (Life Technologies) were each diluted in Pierce Immunostain or antibody diluent (Roche) and incubated at a final concentration of 1:300. Sections were then incubated in DAPI and mounted in Mowiol. Images were acquired with a Leica DM6 upright microscope and minimum/maximum displayed pixel values were adjusted in Fiji (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>).

RNA was extracted from a pool of 25 Stage XI-XII embryos using Tri-reagent (Invitrogen) and the Qiagen Micro kit (Qiagen). cDNA was synthesized with the Clontech SMARTer PCR cDNA Synthesis Kit (Takara Bio Inc). RNA was also extracted from dissected brains of one-day old paralarvae in a similar manner and cDNA was synthesized using the NEBNext cDNA Synthesis and amplification kit. Both samples were sequenced on the PacBio Sequel at the Genomics Core at KU Leuven (Belgium) following the protocol recommended by PacBio. Only cDNAs containing polyA-tails were selected, with the aim to retrieve full-length transcripts. This resulted in a total of 12,017,703 subreads for the embryo and 15,426,835 subreads for the brain sample. The raw data files were processed with SMRT Link release 9.0.0 software. The IsoSeq 3.3 pipeline was followed to generate consensus reads (inc polish, min.passes = 1). Lima (-isoseq) was used to retain full-length fragments that possess both primers only, to remove unwanted primer combinations and to orient the sequences. Subsequently, Poly(A) tails were trimmed and concatemers were removed. This resulted in 22,757 and 28,490 high-quality polished isoforms for the embryo and hatchling brain samples, respectively.

The resulting PCR products were TA cloned into the pCRII-TOPO vector (Invitrogen) and sequenced by LGC Genomics (Berlin). After plasmid linearization, anti-sense digoxigenin-(DIG) labeled RNA probes were generated using an Sp6- or T7-RNA polymerase and DIG RNA labeling mix (both Roche) following the manufacturer’s protocol. The probes were cleaned using Micro Bio-Spin P-30 Gel Columns with RNase-free Tris Buffer (BioRad).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Colorimetric in situ hybridization</title><p>Paraffin sections were processed using an automated platform (Ventana Discovery, Roche) with RiboMap fixation and BlueMap detection kits (Roche) for in situ hybridization. In short, sections are deparaffinated, heated to 37°C, post-fixed and pretreated. Then, a 4 min digestion with proteinase K (Roche, 1:1000 in PBS-DEPC) is followed by probe titration (100–300 ng per slide dependent on the probe, dissolved in Ribohybe reagent (Roche)), denaturation at 90°C for 6 min and hybridization at 70°C for 6 hr. Three stringency washes in 0.1X SSC at 68°C for 12 min each are followed by post-fixation. The anti-DIG-Alkaline phosphatase antibody (Roche) is added and sections are incubated for 30 min after which a colorimetric signal (BCIP/NBT) is developed for 4–9 hr (probe dependent). The tissue is counterstained with Red Counterstain II (Roche), followed by dehydration and mounting using Eukitt quick-hardening mounting medium (Sigma). Bright-field images were taken with a Leica DM6 upright microscope and background was subtracted in Photoshop.

Hereto, we used the insitu_probe_generator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Null and Özpolat, 2020</xref>), followed by BLAST searches using Blast2GO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Conesa et al., 2005</xref>) to minimize potential off-target hybridization. DNA oPools were ordered from Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc (probe sets in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>) and dissolved in DNase/RNase-Free distilled water (Invitrogen). HCR amplifiers with fluorophores B1-Alexa Fluor-546, B2-Alexa Fluor-647, and B3-Alexa Fluor-488 were ordered from Molecular Instruments, Inc. The Molecular Instruments HCR v3.0 protocol for FFPE human tissue sections, based on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Choi et al., 2016</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Choi et al., 2018</xref> was followed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Choi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Choi et al., 2018</xref>). Described here are adaptations from this protocol. Paraffin sections were baked at 65°C for 30 min and subsequently deparaffinized with Xylene (2 x 4 min) and 100% EtOH (3 x 4 min). To permeabilize the tissue, slides were treated with proteinase K (Roche, 1:3000 in PBS-DEPC) for 5 min at 37°C. Slides were then rinsed 2 x 2 min with autoclaved MQ and immediately processed for HCR. After a 30 min pre-hybridization step, probe solution (0.4 pmol per probe in probe hybridization buffer) was incubated overnight. The next day, 4.5 pmol of hairpin h1 and 4.5 pmol of hairpin h2 were snap-cooled (95°C for 90 s, 5 min on ice followed by 30 min at room temperature) and added to 75 µL of amplification buffer. After overnight amplification, excess hairpins were removed by washing 3 x 10 min with 5X SSCT. After HCR, we proceeded with immunohistochemistry as described above and lastly, sections were incubated in DAPI and mounted in Mowiol. Images were acquired using a confocal microscope (Fluoview FV1000, Olympus) and minimum/maximum displayed pixel values were adjusted in Fiji (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>). Autofluorescence in the different channels and potential aspecific amplifier binding were assessed first. Then, all probes were tested individually before multiplexing. HCR was performed on at least three slides per probe, on at least two different embryos.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Phylogenetic analysis</title><p>To determine homology, phylogenetic analyses of ASH, NEUROD, NEUROG, ELAV, and SOX families were performed.

In the case of <italic>E. scolopes</italic>, the BLAST genome server together with peptide sequences on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://cephalopodresearch.org/">cephalopodresearch.org</ext-link> were used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Belcaid et al., 2019</xref>). In the case of <italic>O. vulgaris</italic>, nucleotide sequences were obtained using tBLASTn searches against the Iso-Seq transcriptomes, followed by a search for open reading frames using the ORFfinder tool in NCBI, which also provided the translated protein sequences (<italic>O. vulgaris</italic> protein sequences in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6</xref>). All protein sequences were aligned using the ‘MUSCLE Alignment’ feature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Edgar and Sjölander, 2004</xref>) within MEGA-X (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Kumar et al., 2018</xref>). The matrix was then trimmed using TrimAI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Capella-Gutiérrez et al., 2009</xref>) via the <italic>Automated one</italic> algorithm. The best-fit substitution model for each alignment was determined using the Bayesian information criterion in IQ-TREE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Nguyen et al., 2015</xref>). Maximum likelihood analyses using the LG+G4 (ELAV), JTT+I+G4 (NEUROD/NGN), VT+I+G4 (ASH), or JTT+G4+F (SOX) substitution models for protein evolution were also performed in IQ-TREE, with branch supports calculated by 10.000 Ultrafast bootstrap replicates (UFBoot2) from maximum 1000 iterations (stopping rule) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Hoang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Nguyen et al., 2015</xref>).

Excess seawater was removed from the egg using a tissue after which the egg was transferred to a Sylgard-coated Petri dish (Sylgard 170, Dowsil). The egg was stabilized with tweezers and the capillary was inserted in the embryonic tissue, from the stalk side through the chorion, in an angle of about 10–30 ° relative to the dorso-ventral axis of the embryo. A single 50–100 nL dose of a carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester (CFDA-SE) working solution (1 mM for trajectory mapping, 0.1 mM for long term tracing in filtered sea water, 3% FastGreen) was injected in the lateral lips anterior, posterior, dorsal or ventral from the eye placode at developmental Stage XIV for trajectory mapping (n = 8) and Stages IX (n = 20), XII.1 (n = 21) and XV.2 (n = 16) for long-term tracing. CFDA-SE is a non-fluorescent and highly membrane-permanent molecule that is cleaved by intracellular esterases once taken up by cells, resulting in a trapped, fluorescent carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE) molecule that is bound to amino groups of intracellular proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Progatzky et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Quah et al., 2007</xref>). The dye thus acutely labels all cells present at the injection location, and their progeny due to its long-lasting stability. After injection, embryos were placed back in a Petri dish with filtered sea water. Successful uptake of the dye was verified after 30 min using a fluorescence binocular (SteREO Discovery.V8 with AxioCam MRc5 (Zeiss)). Individual eggs were then incubated in a 96-well plate in filtered sea water, 2% Penicillin/Streptomycin, in a 19°C incubator in the dark (Heratherm IMC18, Thermo Scientific). Viable embryos were sampled after 48 or 72 hr for trajectory mapping or when reaching Stage XIX.2 for long-term tracing, fixed overnight in 4% PFA in PBS and then stored in PBS until dechorionation and clearing or paraffin embedding.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Clearing and whole mount immunohistochemistry</title><p>Dechorionated embryos were cleared before light sheet imaging as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Deryckere et al., 2020</xref>).

It will be of broad interest to scientists in the field of evolutionary developmental and neurobiology.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Identification of neural progenitor cells and their progeny reveals long distance migration in the developing octopus brain&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Sonia Sen as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Catherine Dulac as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Shuichi Shigeno (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We appreciated the quality, thoroughness and insights that this manuscripts provides. We had a few concerns that the authors could easily address, and these are listed below:</p><p>1) What is the nature of the migratory cells? The authors have shown that the migratory cells are largely elav<sup>+</sup>, post-mitotic cells. We're concerned that the low magnification images shown in the figures might miss that there are other cell types that migrate in the transition zones. Could the authors please provide higher magnification images of these regions and comment on whether they think other cell types – for example, glia or progenitors – might also be migrating from the LL to the cords?</p><p>2) Is the lateral lip the only neurogenic region? We noticed a low level of expression of ascl1 as well as PCNA in the developing brain cords. Is it possible that there's also a pool of progenitors in the brain cords? Once again, could the authors please provide higher magnification images of this and comment on it? If there are a pool of progenitors that do divide in the developing brain (albeit a smaller number) we suggest modifying the text accordingly.</p><p>Related to these essential points are comments in the individual reviews. Could the authors please refer to them while addressing these two main concerns?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The lineage tracing experiments are beautiful! I had trouble navigating them, though. I found myself going back and forth between figure 1 and 6 to orient myself. It's possible that this is because I am unfamiliar with the neuroanatomy. But maybe the authors could consider unpacking this section a bit? This could be done by splitting this figure. For example – deal with only the optic lobe at stage IX first, then at stage XII. Next deal with PVL/PV similarly?</p><p>I got the impression that there might be temporal pattering within the regions as well? For example, PVL neurons seem to be born only at the early time points. What are the authors' thoughts on this?</p><p>Do the authors think that the lateral lip is what also contributes to postembryonic neurogenesis?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1) Classic histological and embryological studies of cephalopod brains have identified a stream-like cell clusters from neurogenic territories surrounding eye regions to the brain, but these regions develop to jaxta-neuronal or neurosecretory tissues called the paravertical body, subpedunculate tissues, neurosecretory tissue of vena cava, and anterior chamber organs as described in Young JZ (1970). Actually, many cells of the subpedunculate tissue are largely embedded in the optic lobes, and cells of the paravertical body are attached to the vertical lobe, and seen in the subvertical and basal lobes. Vascular associated tissues are in the subesophageal mass. Topographically, this study's new terms are corresponding to those developing tissues: lateral lip: LL = sub-buccal tissue and anterior chamber organ, ATZ = paravertical body, and PTX = subpedunculate tissues.</p><p>The readers would be convinced that the ectodermal neurogenic regions certainly produced migratory cells for many brain lobes with a stepwise developmental manner as in Figure 6 and 7, but might not be convinced that there are no other cell types migrating from the lateral lip to the brain lobes. Confirming cell types of migratory cells would be essential to propose the main conclusion of this study.</p><p>Also, these eye region wrapping optic lobe produce the white body, hematopoietic organs that might be easily labeled with leaked dye and the labeled cells distribute to many brain lobes. The neurotracing (Figure 6) is a really good study and Figure 6I would be the important figure, showing migratory cells may be neurons in the vertical lobe, but the marked cells look big size and not sure these are neurons or endothelial cells of the vasculature. At least a few enlarged figures would be required to characterize the cell types.</p><p>2) During the late embryonic stages, the octopus brain continues to develop dramatically to large size, but the expression of neurogenic genes examined in this study disappears. The lateral lip is also very restricted to small areas and the migratory cells can not expect to contribute to major neurogenesis of the brain. One idea may be that weak NeuroD expression and Sox-B1 marked stem-like populations or novel genes are used. This point may be included in the discussion shortly.</p><p>In mammalian brain, the migratory cell stream is important for producing certain cell types, e.g. GABAergic neurons in the developing cortex from the ganglionic eminence, but it is not the main contributor to shape the cortex. The ventricular zones mainly produce various cell types as many readers know. The neurogenin and other genes keep being expressed there. However, the octopus developing brain looks very different on this point, indicating octopus neurogenesis still remains a mystery. This view would be helpful for future studies.</p><p>In addition to this, there are three points that may increase the impact and justification for this study.</p><p>1) In the introductory or late figures, the possible boundaries of LL, ATZ, and PTX could be clearly marked. This is because these are key areas for the main story.</p><p>2) I think, as a supplementary, the neurosecretory tissues associated with eye regions could be explained to avoid confusion about what tissues are tracing, although a sentence only for anterior chamber organ is seen in Materials and methods.</p><p>3) &quot;The lateral lips harbor the neurogenic zone whereas the developing cords are postmitotic&quot;. I almost agree with this, but this statement is a hypothesis where there are neurogenic cells for brain cords. Elav in situ hybridization might not be able to detect a small population of neurogenic cells in the developing brain. In other sentences, the authors need to be careful about progenitor cells that may be in the overall area of the developing brains. Actually an anonymous has a result of BrdU pulse-labeled and positive cells that are distributed in many areas of developing octopus brains, although there is one publication that might show possibly false-positive cells in the vertical lobe. Therefore, neurogenesis for octopus lobes remains controversial and we need more convincing experiments and conclusions.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Based on anti PH3 and Ov-pcna expression, cell divisions, which might be correlated with neural progenitor formation/division, can be seen across the areas where the supra- and subesophageal ganglia form, and are thus not restricted to the lateral lips. This expression pattern is also acknowledged in the Results section: &quot;While at Stages VII.2 and IX, transcripts were found in most embryonic tissues (mouth apparatus, retina, lateral lips and cords, in the latter at lower intensity), transcripts gradually disappeared in the optic, cerebral, palliovisceral and pedal cords from Stage XI onwards.&quot; The absence of cell divisions in later stages does not prove that the neuroepithelium from which the brain potentially develops is not neurogenic, i.e. that all progenitors arise from the lateral lips – they might simply have ceased dividing. Secondly, the expression of genes (SoxB, ASC, neurogenin) that are consistently expressed in neural progenitors across the animal kingdom, are expressed in all areas of the developing brain. Contrary to the description given in the Results section, both Ov-ascl1 and Ov-ngn seem to be expressed in the whole developing brain in stages XV, Ov-ascl1 also in stage XVII and later (Figure 4).</p><p>I agree with the authors that the lateral lips are neurogenic regions. The cell lineage tracing data also clearly show the migration of neural precursors into various brain areas (confirming the results by Koenig et al); however, it is also possible that neural progenitors do arise from other regions of the developing brain.

The authors have shown that the migratory cells are largely elav<sup>+</sup>, post-mitotic cells. We're concerned that the low magnification images shown in the figures might miss that there are other cell types that migrate in the transition zones. Could the authors please provide higher magnification images of these regions and comment on whether they think other cell types – for example, glia or progenitors – might also be migrating from the LL to the cords?</p></disp-quote><p>To clarify this issue, we have performed an additional experiment (including higher magnification images) showing that the lateral lips are neurogenic and that most of the migrating cells are differentiating neurons. Specifically, embryos were fixed 48 hrs after progenitor labeling with CFDA-SE and thin sections were made. We then performed HCR to visualize the expression of Ov-neuroD and Ov-elav and show that the labeled cells in the PTZ indeed express Ov-neuroD and/or Ov-elav (Figure 8 – supplementary figure 2). The CFSE mark revealed that these cells also often presented a neurite-like process. Although we cannot exclude that other cell types are migrating through the PTZ (markers for glia or endothelial cells (cfr Reviewer 2) are not yet known for this species), our data seem to confirm that the bulk of migrating cells in our experiments are neurons. (see also Reviewer 2, question 1 and Reviewer 3, questions 1 and 2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Is the lateral lip the only neurogenic region? We noticed a low level of expression of ascl1 as well as PCNA in the developing brain cords. Is it possible that there's also a pool of progenitors in the brain cords? Once again, could the authors please provide higher magnification images of this and comment on it? If there are a pool of progenitors that do divide in the developing brain (albeit a smaller number) we suggest modifying the text accordingly.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that in the earliest stages (before Stage XI), a limited number of dividing cells is present in the developing cords themselves, and have adapted the text accordingly. From Stage XI onwards, however, we could no longer observe PH3, Ov-pcna, Ov-ascl1, nor Ov-ngn in the cords. As this was a striking observation for us as well, we have confirmed this finding with multiple biological and technical replicates, as well as with a second expression study method (HCR). Taking these data together, we concluded that the low-level staining observed for Ov-pcna, Ov-ascl1 and Ov-ngn in the colorimetric assay is background staining. (see also Reviewer 2, question 5 and Reviewer 3, questions 8 and 9).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Related to these essential points are comments in the individual reviews. Could the authors please refer to them while addressing these two main concerns?</p><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The lineage tracing experiments are beautiful! I had trouble navigating them, though. I found myself going back and forth between figure 1 and 6 to orient myself. It's possible that this is because I am unfamiliar with the neuroanatomy. But maybe the authors could consider unpacking this section a bit? This could be done by splitting this figure. For example – deal with only the optic lobe at stage IX first, then at stage XII. Next deal with PVL/PV similarly?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the suggestion to improve the interpretation of the lineage tracing data. We have split the original Figure 6 in two parts, addressing the SEM/SUB (Figure 6) and OL/PdC (Figure 7) separately. In addition, to facilitate navigation through the different lobes in the SEM/SUB, we have reshuffled panels E-F from Figure 1 to Figure 6.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I got the impression that there might be temporal pattering within the regions as well? For example, PVL neurons seem to be born only at the early time points. What are the authors' thoughts on this?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this observation. We indeed have the impression that there is temporal patterning of the progenitors as well. This is the clearest for the optic lobe, where progenitor cells on the posterior side produce cells for the medulla in late stages only. This observation is mentioned in the discussion (line 543-544) and added to the introduction (line 89) and results (line 354) sections. For the palliovisceral lobe, this phenomenon is still preliminary. It indeed looks like cells destined to this lobe are produced at early stages only, but as the progenitor region seems small, more experiments are required to confirm this observation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Do the authors think that the lateral lip is what also contributes to postembryonic neurogenesis?</p></disp-quote><p>As the lateral lips shrink to almost completely disappear at hatching, we suspect that there must be a different, new source of progenitor cells that contributes to neurogenesis during the paralarval and adult phases. Current literature describes dividing cells in the adult brain lobes, but we could not replicate these results and question their validity (see also Reviewer 2, question 5). Although we believe that identifying the source of postembryonic neurons is an important question to solve, the focus of this paper is to characterize embryonic neurogenesis. We have added a supporting sentence at the end of the discussion (line 548-550).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1) Classic histological and embryological studies of cephalopod brains have identified a stream-like cell clusters from neurogenic territories surrounding eye regions to the brain, but these regions develop to jaxta-neuronal or neurosecretory tissues called the paravertical body, subpedunculate tissues, neurosecretory tissue of vena cava, and anterior chamber organs as described in Young JZ (1970). Actually, many cells of the subpedunculate tissue are largely embedded in the optic lobes, and cells of the paravertical body are attached to the vertical lobe, and seen in the subvertical and basal lobes. Vascular associated tissues are in the subesophageal mass. Topographically, this study's new terms are corresponding to those developing tissues: lateral lip: LL = sub-buccal tissue and anterior chamber organ, ATZ = paravertical body, and PTX = subpedunculate tissues.</p><p>The readers would be convinced that the ectodermal neurogenic regions certainly produced migratory cells for many brain lobes with a stepwise developmental manner as in Figure 6 and 7, but might not be convinced that there are no other cell types migrating from the lateral lip to the brain lobes. Confirming cell types of migratory cells would be essential to propose the main conclusion of this study.</p><p>Also, these eye region wrapping optic lobe produce the white body, hematopoietic organs that might be easily labeled with leaked dye and the labeled cells distribute to many brain lobes. The neurotracing (Figure 6) is a really good study and Figure 6I would be the important figure, showing migratory cells may be neurons in the vertical lobe, but the marked cells look big size and not sure these are neurons or endothelial cells of the vasculature. At least a few enlarged figures would be required to characterize the cell types.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this detailed concern. To our understanding, the embryonic origin of those adult juxta-neuronal and neurosecretory tissues has not been experimentally traced. Our study could only trace cells until Stage XIX.2 (right before hatching), and thus cannot provide the evidence that these adult tissues are indeed of lateral lip origin. Concerning the morphology of cells: we observed neurite-like extensions in the migrating cells. However, this observation comes with some caveats: in embryonic stages, morphology of cells might be different from the much better characterized adult cell morphology of these different cell types. It is therefore difficult, or at least insufficient, to use morphology as the sole proxy for determining cell fate. Cells in the lateral lips are packed and have large nuclei and small cytoplasmic areas. Expression of neural markers is extensive. We therefore suspect that the bulk of the cells generated in or migrating out of the lateral lips will be of neural fate, and at least for those periods that we traced the cells, we showed experimental evidence. Indeed, to prove that the lateral lips are neurogenic and that the migrating cells are differentiating neurons, we performed an additional tracing and HCR experiment (Figure 8 – supplementary figure 2). Embryos were fixed 48 hrs after progenitor labeling and thin sections were made. We then performed HCR to visualize the expression of Ov-neuroD and Ov-elav. Although this experiment cannot exclude that other cell types are produced in the lateral lips, we clearly show that the CFSE labeled cells in the PTZ do express Ov-neuroD and/or Ov-elav (line 367-371).</p><p>Future identification of markers of glial or endothelial cells should enable us to document the origin of those cells and their contribution to embryonic brain development.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) During the late embryonic stages, the octopus brain continues to develop dramatically to large size, but the expression of neurogenic genes examined in this study disappears. The lateral lip is also very restricted to small areas and the migratory cells can not expect to contribute to major neurogenesis of the brain. One idea may be that weak NeuroD expression and Sox-B1 marked stem-like populations or novel genes are used. This point may be included in the discussion shortly.</p><p>In mammalian brain, the migratory cell stream is important for producing certain cell types, e.g. GABAergic neurons in the developing cortex from the ganglionic eminence, but it is not the main contributor to shape the cortex. The ventricular zones mainly produce various cell types as many readers know. The neurogenin and other genes keep being expressed there. However, the octopus developing brain looks very different on this point, indicating octopus neurogenesis still remains a mystery. This view would be helpful for future studies.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for raising this concern and suggestion. We believe that most larval brain neurons are produced by the late embryonic stages. Next to a limited number of neurons added by the last progenitors in the lateral lips during maturation stages, the increase in brain size could also result from an increase in cell size, and increased connectivity (see Figure 2, showing a tremendous growth of neuropil stained by an AcTub antibody).</p><p>The lateral lips do decrease in size until they disappear almost completely from the hatchling, suggesting that embryonic and post-hatching neurogenesis use a different stem cell pool. In our opinion, neurogenesis post-hatching is most likely re-initiated, from a hitherto unknown population of cells (see also our response to comment 3 below). Further investigation of this phenomenon is out of the scope of this paper. We have added a supporting sentence at the end of the discussion (line 548-550).</p><p>The widespread expression of SoxB1 in the brain suggests that soxB1 might participate in the differentiation process of neurons. A similar, dual role for soxB1 (neural stem cell/ differentiation of neurons) has been described for other invertebrate species as well (cfr discussion lines 424-432). Whether these cells are then reactivating the cell cycle later on remains to be determined.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In addition to this, there are three points that may increase the impact and justification for this study.</p><p>1) In the introductory or late figures, the possible boundaries of LL, ATZ, and PTX could be clearly marked. This is because these are key areas for the main story.</p></disp-quote><p>The discovery of the boundaries of these domains happens throughout the story in this paper and the only way to reliably indicate the boundaries of LL, ATZ and PTZ is through in situ hybridization with Ov-ascl1 and Ov-elav or Ov-neuroD. To introduce the naming, we have therefore opted to first add these three different domains to the schematic illustration in Figure 1C, and kept general annotations for the subsequent figures. In Figures 5 and 8, after the molecular boundaries are set, the LL and PTZ boundaries are clearly indicated.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) I think, as a supplementary, the neurosecretory tissues associated with eye regions could be explained to avoid confusion about what tissues are tracing, although a sentence only for anterior chamber organ is seen in Materials and methods.</p></disp-quote><p>To our understanding, the embryonic origin of the adult juxta-neuronal and neurosecretory tissues that the reviewer is referring to, has not been experimentally traced. We can therefore not make an argument that they arise from the lateral lips. We have specifically explained this for the anterior chamber organ/lateral lips in the Results section (line 110-121).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) &quot;The lateral lips harbor the neurogenic zone whereas the developing cords are postmitotic&quot;. I almost agree with this, but this statement is a hypothesis where there are neurogenic cells for brain cords. Elav in situ hybridization might not be able to detect a small population of neurogenic cells in the developing brain. In other sentences, the authors need to be careful about progenitor cells that may be in the overall area of the developing brains. Actually an anonymous has a result of BrdU pulse-labeled and positive cells that are distributed in many areas of developing octopus brains, although there is one publication that might show possibly false-positive cells in the vertical lobe. Therefore, neurogenesis for octopus lobes remains controversial and we need more convincing experiments and conclusions.</p></disp-quote><p>Our data show a limited number of proliferating cells at very early stages (before Stage XI). We believe these cells build the initial cord structures as a scaffold upon which the bulk of neurons generated later and arriving from the lateral lips are actually forming the brain. Nevertheless, we agree that we cannot exclude a very small population of neurogenic cells in the cords. Therefore, we changed the subtitle to “The lateral lips harbor proliferating cells whereas the developing cords are mostly postmitotic”. (line 168). In our opinion, the potential contribution of a cordal neurogenic population would be very low and by far outcompeted by the influx of neurons from the lateral lips since dividing cells in the developing cords are almost absent from Stage XI onwards, after which the brain grows tremendously.</p><p>We are also convinced that Ov-ascl1, nor Ov-ngn is expressed in the developing brain, already from Stage IX onwards, with the low signal observed in the cords being background (by comparing multiple rounds of colorimetric ISH, see lines 259, 268). Although we cannot exclude low level expression in the brain, our observation is confirmed by independent HCR experiments, in which we did not identify significant Ov-ascl1 and Ov-ngn expression in the brain either (e.g. Figure 5).</p><p>In the framework of another study, we have tried to reproduce the adult BrdU and PCNA published data (Bertapelle et al. 2017 and Di Cosmo et al., 2018), but could not find any evidence that these are reproducible. Specifically, using the same PCNA antibody and protocol as published, we did not identify PCNA positive cells in multiple adult brains. Additionally, our Ov-pcna probe for in situ hybridization that shows very strong signal on our embryonic sections did not reveal pcna expression in adult brain slices. Lastly, we have performed numerous experiments with BrdU or EdU on Octopus vulgaris embryos, but so far, these have not resulted in labeled cells. We thus agree with the reviewer that those published data might be false-positive and require additional, more convincing experiments.</p><p>As mentioned before, further investigation of this neurogenesis beyond hatching is out of the scope of this paper. We have added a supporting sentence at the end of the discussion (line 548-550).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Based on anti PH3 and Ov-pcna expression, cell divisions, which might be correlated with neural progenitor formation/division, can be seen across the areas where the supra- and subesophageal ganglia form, and are thus not restricted to the lateral lips. This expression pattern is also acknowledged in the Results section: &quot;While at Stages VII.2 and IX, transcripts were found in most embryonic tissues (mouth apparatus, retina, lateral lips and cords, in the latter at lower intensity), transcripts gradually disappeared in the optic, cerebral, palliovisceral and pedal cords from Stage XI onwards.&quot; The absence of cell divisions in later stages does not prove that the neuroepithelium from which the brain potentially develops is not neurogenic, i.e. that all progenitors arise from the lateral lips – they might simply have ceased dividing. Secondly, the expression of genes (SoxB, ASC, neurogenin) that are consistently expressed in neural progenitors across the animal kingdom, are expressed in all areas of the developing brain. Contrary to the description given in the Results section, both Ov-ascl1 and Ov-ngn seem to be expressed in the whole developing brain in stages XV, Ov-ascl1 also in stage XVII and later (Figure 4).</p><p>I agree with the authors that the lateral lips are neurogenic regions. The cell lineage tracing data also clearly show the migration of neural precursors into various brain areas (confirming the results by Koenig et al); however, it is also possible that neural progenitors do arise from other regions of the developing brain. This is my main concern – that the data do not convincingly show that the lateral lips are the only areas with neurogenic potential. Corresponding statements/discussions in the results and Discussion sections should be amended accordingly. Additional studies such as cell lineage tracing in the developing cords or laser dissections of the lateral lips would reveal the degree of involvement of the lateral lips in brain neurogenesis.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that other structures in the head region bear proliferating cells and that at very early stages, a limited number of proliferating cells can be found in the developing brain. Therefore, we changed the subtitle to “The lateral lips harbor proliferating cells whereas the developing cords are mostly postmitotic”. (line 168), and have made several adjustments to the text (line 22-23 in the abstract, line 172 and 200 in the Results section and line 489-490 in the discussion). However, dividing cells are almost absent from Stage XI onwards, after which the brain grows tremendously. It is possible that these cells cease to divide, but they do not seem to re-enter the cell cycle during embryonic development and can therefore not account for the majority of neurons in the hatchling brain. In addition, there are indeed other regions in the head that contain dividing cells. The mouth region stands out and we have performed preliminary lineage tracing experiments from that region and found that progeny of these cells mostly integrates in the gastrointestinal tract.</p><p>We are also convinced that Ov-ascl1, nor Ov-ngn is expressed in the developing brain, already from Stage IX, with the low signal observed in the cords being background (by comparing multiple rounds of ISH, see lines 259, 268).

Secondly, the authors would have to analyse different time points since the Ov-ascl1<sup>+</sup> and the Ov-nngn<sup>+</sup> populations might be mitotically active at different times.</p><p>The corresponding sentence in the Discussion section &quot;In O. vulgaris, the Ov ascl1 progenitor population seems to be more proliferative compared to the Ov-ngn progenitor population, which suggests their sequential expression could be turned around in cephalopods&quot; should be amended accordingly.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer to point out that these data deserved a more clear depiction. We have made several adjustments to figure 5 to make overlap between PH3 and the marker, or absence thereof, more convincing. First, we chose to show only one optical section instead of a z-projection in order to delineate the cells better. Second, we marked the PH3 signal on ascl1/neurogenin as well as on neuroD and enlarged different panels so that overlap, or absence of overlap, is more clear.</p><p>In addition, we amended the text in the results (line 305, 309) and discussion (line 446) sections to clarify that analysis was performed at Stage XV.2, in order to avoid making overstatements.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>&quot;Occasionally, we identified few, single randomly dispersed cells in the pedal or palliovisceral lobes originating from more ventrally located progenitor populations. Considering the very low number of cells compared to the major output from those progenitors, these cells were not taken into account as they might have been labeled while migrating through another area.&quot;</p><p>If this is the case, the labelling technique needs to be explained better. If progenitors are labeled in a certain area of the lateral lip and their progeny then traced, how can cells then randomly pick up the dye?</p></disp-quote><p>The CFDA-SE dye is not selective for cell types, and will label any cell present at the location where it is introduced (progenitor or not). However, it labels very locally and only acutely, as the dye is immediately cleaved by esterases and binds cytoplasmic proteins locking it inside cells (information added to line 671-675). We could not observe leakiness, confirming it labels only cell types present in a particular lateral lip area at the time of injection. Based on our hypothesis, these are foremost neural progenitor cells, but our data also suggest there is long distance migration in the lateral lips and precise entry areas into the central brain. Therefore, we cannot exclude that we might have labeled few travelling cells passing by the injection site as well. In any case, as we cannot distinguish travellers from locally generated cells, we cannot make the assumption that these few “outlier” cells “might have been labeled while migrating through another area”. We have therefore adjusted this part of the sentence (line 343).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Discussion</p><p>&quot;This study showed that grossly, the embryonic octopus brain does not contain dividing progenitor cells.</p><p>This is not what the data show and contradicts the statement in the Results section 'While at Stages VII.2 and IX, transcripts were found in most embryonic tissues (mouth apparatus, retina, lateral lips and cords, in the latter at lower intensity), transcripts gradually disappeared in the optic, cerebral, palliovisceral and pedal cords from Stage XI onwards.&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the word “grossly” could be misleading. We have adapted the sentence to “This study showed that the embryonic octopus brain is practically devoid of dividing cells from Stage XI onwards” to avoid making overstatements. (line 377-378).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>We further delineated embryonic neurogenesis in O. vulgaris using neural progenitor, pan-neuronal and differentiated-neuron marker genes with conserved functions in neurogenesis, neural specification and differentiation in protostomes and deuterostomes.</p><p>Inaccurate.

Different functions in neurogenesis have been reported for neural genes in different phyla/species and even within the same organism.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out and have adapted the text accordingly (line 381).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors also discuss a delay in neural maturation compared to other cephalopods based on the temporal expression of postmitotic neuronal markers; however, without explaining how embryonic stages can be compared between species, specifically in relation to other developmental processes, the discussion is not convincing.</p></disp-quote><p>We strongly agree with the reviewer that comparing different cephalopod species is not straightforward. We therefore performed a diligent analysis, comparing multiple characteristics of developing cuttlefish, squid and octopuses and published this last year (Deryckere et al., 2020, BMC Developmental Biology). This staging scale now allows reliable comparison of developing embryos across cephalopod orders. We now clearly mentioned this in the discussion (line 407-408).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figures</p><p>Figures should be mentioned and sorted in the correct order, including figure panels.
