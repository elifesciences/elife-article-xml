It is the most prevalent parasitic infection of the central nervous system and one of the leading causes of adult-acquired epilepsy worldwide. However, little is known about how cestode larvae affect neurons directly. To address this, we used whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiology and calcium imaging in rodent and human brain slices to identify direct effects of cestode larval products on neuronal activity. We found that both whole cyst homogenate and excretory/secretory products of cestode larvae have an acute excitatory effect on neurons, which can trigger seizure-like events <italic>in vitro</italic>. This effect was mediated by glutamate receptor activation but not by nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, acid-sensing ion channels, or Substance P. Glutamate-sensing fluorescent reporters (iGluSnFR) and amino acid assays revealed that the larval homogenate of the cestodes <italic>Taenia crassiceps</italic> and <italic>Taenia solium</italic> contained high concentrations of the amino acids glutamate and aspartate. Furthermore, we found that larvae of both species consistently produce and release these excitatory amino acids into their immediate environment. Our findings suggest that perturbations in glutamatergic signalling may play a role in seizure generation in NCC.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>One of the main causes of epilepsy in adults – particularly in developing countries – is a parasitic brain infection called neurocysticercosis. This can happen when people swallow tapeworm eggs, which hatch into larvae and migrate throughout the body. When these larvae infect the brain, they form structures called cysts, which can cause seizures.</p><p>It is thought that inflammation in the brain contributes to the development of seizures in neurocysticercosis, but how this might work is still poorly understood. The larvae produce chemicals that can interact with nearby cells in the body, including the defensive cells of our immune system. However, it remains unknown whether those chemicals also interact with brain cells.</p><p>De Lange, Tomes et al. set out to determine if tapeworm larvae produced any specific chemicals that affect the activity of brain cells, and if they might play a role in epileptic seizures. To do this, the researchers collected materials from tapeworm larvae, which included both the substances they naturally released and a mixture made from crushed whole larvae. They then applied these substances to brain tissue grown in cell culture while recording the electrical activity of individual brain cells.</p><p>Experiments using brain tissue derived from rats, mice and humans revealed that the larval products made brain cells more excited and led to them firing more electrical signals than normal. This excitation was strong enough to trigger larger patterns of activity across the brain tissue that mimicked the effect of an epileptic seizure.</p><p>Further biochemical analysis of the larval products and the larvae themselves revealed that tapeworm larvae continuously release a chemical called glutamate, which is known to excite brain cells. These results suggested that tapeworm larvae might cause epilepsy by producing excess glutamate and overexciting brain cells – a mechanism similar to the way that other brain conditions, like tumors, also trigger seizures.</p><p>This work has revealed a new mechanism for how tapeworm larvae might cause seizures in neurocysticercosis. The next step will be understanding how the larvae release glutamate into the brain, for example, if they actively produce it, or if it is passively released when they die. In the future, de Lange et al. hope this knowledge will help develop new treatments that help prevent seizures in people with neurocysticercosis.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>neurocysticercosis</kwd><kwd>glutamate</kwd><kwd><italic>Taenia</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>Taenia crassiceps</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>Taenia solium</italic></kwd><kwd>cestode</kwd><kwd>epilepsy</kwd><kwd>seizures</kwd><kwd>aspartate</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd>Rat</kwd><kwd><italic>Taenia crassiceps</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>Taenia solium</italic></kwd><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010269</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id award-id-type="doi">10.35802/214042</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Raimondo</surname><given-names>Joseph V</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010269</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id award-id-type="doi">10.35802/222968</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Raimondo</surname><given-names>Joseph V</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000288</institution-id><institution>Royal Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FLR \R1\190829</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Raimondo</surname><given-names>Joseph V</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Royal Society Newton Advanced Fellowship</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NA140170</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Raimondo</surname><given-names>Joseph V</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>The FLAIR Fellowship Programme</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FLR\R1\190829</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Raimondo</surname><given-names>Joseph V</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>European Commission Marie Sklodowska-Curie Global Fellowship</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>657638</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Smith</surname><given-names>Katherine Ann</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>CYSTINET-Africa'</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>01KA1610</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sikasunge</surname><given-names>Chummy</given-names></name><name><surname>Prodjinotho</surname><given-names>Ulrich Fabien</given-names></name><name><surname>da Costa</surname><given-names>Clarissa Prazeres</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.

It is caused by the presence of larvae of the cestode <italic>Taenia solium</italic> in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Trevisan et al., 2016</xref>). The most common symptom of NCC is recurrent seizures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Garcia et al., 2017</xref>). As a result, NCC is one of the leading causes of adult-acquired epilepsy worldwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Nash et al., 2013</xref>), resulting in significant morbidity and mortality. In <italic>T. solium</italic> endemic areas, 29% of people with epilepsy also had NCC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ndimubanzi et al., 2010</xref>). Despite the impact of NCC, there is a paucity of studies investigating the seizure mechanisms involved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">de Lange et al., 2019</xref>). As far as we are aware, there have been no studies to date that investigated the direct, acute effects of cestode larval products on neurons. As a result, precisely how larvae perturb neuronal circuits is still relatively poorly understood.</p><p>In NCC seizures may occur at any stage following initial infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Garcia et al., 2017</xref>). It is thought that inflammatory processes in the brain play an important role in the development of recurrent seizures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Vezzani et al., 2016</xref>). Previous research investigating seizure development in NCC has therefore typically focused on how the host neuroinflammatory response to larvae may precipitate seizures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">de Lange et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Nash et al., 2015</xref>). One study by Robinson et al<italic>.</italic> found that production of the inflammatory molecule and neurotransmitter, Substance P, produced by peritoneal larval granulomas, precipitated acute seizures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Robinson et al., 2012</xref>). In addition to host-derived substances, cestodes themselves are known to excrete or secrete various products that interact with host cells in their vicinity. Cestode larvae-derived factors are known to modulate the activation status of immunocytes such as microglia and dendritic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sun et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Vendelova et al., 2016</xref>). However, comparatively little is known about how factors contained in, or secreted by, cestode larvae might affect neurons and neuronal networks directly, including whether these may have pro-seizure effects.</p><p>To address this, we used whole-cell patch-clamp recordings and calcium imaging in rodent hippocampal organotypic slice cultures and in acute human cortical brain slices to demonstrate the direct effects of larval products on neuronal activity. We find that both the whole cyst homogenate and the excretory/secretory (E/S) products of <italic>Taenia crassiceps</italic> and <italic>Taenia solium</italic> larvae have strong, acute excitatory effects on neurons. This was sufficient to trigger seizure-like events (SLEs) <italic>in vitro</italic>. Underlying SLE induction was larval-induced neuronal depolarization, which was mediated by glutamate receptor activation and not by nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs), or Substance P. Both imaging using glutamate-sensing fluorescent reporters (iGluSnFR) and direct measurements using amino acid assays revealed that the homogenate and E/S products of both <italic>T. crassiceps</italic> and <italic>T. solium</italic> larvae contain high levels of the excitatory amino acid glutamate and, to a lesser extent, aspartate. Lastly, we provide evidence that larvae of both species, to varying degrees, can produce and release these excitatory amino acids into their immediate environment. This suggests that these parasites release amino acids that could contribute to seizure generation in NCC.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>T. crassiceps</italic> homogenate excites neurons and can elicit epileptiform activity</title><p>To investigate the potential acute effects of <italic>T. crassiceps</italic> larvae on neurons, <italic>T. crassiceps</italic> larval somatic homogenate was prepared using larvae, harvested from the peritonea of mice, which were freeze-thawed and homogenized (see Materials and methods and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings were made from CA3 pyramidal neurons in rodent hippocampal organotypic brain slice cultures and layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons in human cortical acute brain slices. Pico-litre volumes of <italic>T. crassiceps</italic> homogenate were directly applied to the soma of neurons using a custom-built pressure ejection system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Forman et al., 2017</xref>). Application of the homogenate (20-ms puff) elicited immediate, transient depolarization of the membrane voltage in recordings from rat, mouse, and human neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). Increasing the amount of homogenate delivered by increasing the pressure applied to the ejection system resulted in increasingly large membrane depolarization, which could trigger single or multiple action potentials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–D</xref>). To further explore the acute excitatory effect of <italic>T. crassiceps</italic> on neurons, neuronal networks, and the propagation of network activity, we performed fluorescence Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging in mouse hippocampal organotypic brain slice cultures. Neurons were virally transfected with the genetically encoded Ca<sup>2+</sup> reporter, GCAMP6s, under the synapsin promoter and imaged using widefield epifluorescence microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video1">Figure 1—video 1</xref>, and Materials and methods). To simulate a pro-ictal environment, a low Mg<sup>2+</sup> artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) was used (0.5 mM Mg<sup>2+</sup>) and neurons in the dentate gyrus were imaged whilst small, spatially restricted puffs of <italic>T. crassiceps</italic> homogenate were delivered every 15 s using a glass pipette (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). The cells within the direct vicinity of the puffing pipette showed a sharp increase in fluorescence immediately following the delivery of <italic>T. crassiceps</italic> homogenate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>, t<sub>1</sub>) for all three puffs, indicating Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry following membrane depolarization and action potential generation. Cells in the periphery showed notable increases in fluorescence at a delayed interval following some (but not all) puffs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>, t<sub>2</sub>). The excitation of these cells are likely the result of being synaptically connected to the cells that were exposed to the puff itself. Indeed, a current-clamp recording from a neuron in the same slice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>, inset) indicates that a single, spatially restricted puff of <italic>T. crassiceps</italic> homogenate can elicit the onset of a regenerative SLE lasting far longer than the puff itself.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title><italic>Taenia crassiceps</italic> homogenate excites neurons and can elicit epileptiform activity.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic showing the experimental setup in which whole-cell patch-clamp recordings were made from CA3 hippocampal pyramidal neurons in rodent organotypic slice cultures whilst a puff pipette delivered pico-litre volumes of homogenized <italic>Taenia crassiceps</italic> larvae (<italic>T. crass</italic>. hom.) targeted at the cell soma.

Whilst this is likely important, it does not preclude the involvement of additional or exacerbating pathogenic mechanisms for seizure generation and epileptogenesis in NCC. In this study we have identified that <italic>Taenia</italic> larvae have a direct excitatory effect on neurons via glutamatergic signalling. This is important, as the central role of glutamatergic signalling in epileptogenesis has conclusively been shown using multiple cell culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sun et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Sombati and Delorenzo, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">DeLorenzo, 1998</xref>), slice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anderson et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Stasheff et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ziobro et al., 2011</xref>), and <italic>in vivo</italic> models of epilepsy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Croucher and Bradford, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Croucher et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Rice and DeLorenzo, 1998</xref>).</p><p>Clinically, beyond NCC, other major causes of adult-acquired epilepsy are stroke, traumatic brain injury and CNS tumours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hauser et al., 1940</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Forsgren et al., 2005</xref>). In these other causes of acquired epilepsy, glutamatergic signalling, and glutamate excitotoxicity, are thought to be central to the pathogenic process. Glutamate excitotoxicity occurs when depolarized, damaged, or dying neurons release glutamate, which activate surrounding neurons via NMDA and AMPA receptors, resulting in sustained neuronal depolarization, Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx and the subsequent activation of signalling cascades and enzymes. These, in turn, lead to cell death via necrosis and apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ankarcrona et al., 1995</xref>), the further release of intracellular glutamate, and the propagation of the excitotoxic process to neighbouring cells. In the neurons that survive, the prolonged exposure to glutamate has been shown to cause hyperexcitability and seizures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sun et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">DeLorenzo, 1998</xref>) via multiple mechanisms, including enhanced intrinsic excitability and NMDA receptor-dependent disruption of GABAergic inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lee et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Terunuma et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Buckingham et al., 2011</xref>). Given our finding that cestode larvae contain and release significant quantities of glutamate, it is possible that the brain’s homeostatic mechanisms for taking up and metabolizing excess glutamate are overwhelmed by larval-derived glutamate released into the extracellular space. Therefore, similar glutamate-dependent excitotoxic and epileptogenic processes that occur in stroke, traumatic brain injury, and CNS tumours are likely to also occur in NCC.</p><p>Glioma, a common adult primary brain tumour, which typically presents with seizures in over 80% of patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Santosh and Sravya, 2017</xref>), is an intriguing condition for comparison to NCC. Here, the tumour cells themselves have been shown to release glutamate into the extracellular space via the system x<sub>c</sub><sup>−</sup>cystine–glutamate antiporter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Buckingham et al., 2011</xref>). Interestingly, there is compelling evidence that tumoural release of glutamate via this mechanism both causes seizures and favours glioma preservation, progression, and invasion in cases of malignant glioma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Sontheimer, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Takano et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Huang et al., 2013</xref>). Analogously, it is possible that <italic>Taenia</italic> larvae in the brain utilize the release of glutamate and the induction of glutamate excitotoxicity to facilitate their growth and expansion, with the accompanying effect of seizure generation. In addition, the death of <italic>Taenia</italic> larvae, or larval-derived cells, would also result in the release of metabolic glutamate, further contributing to glutamate release and excitotoxicity. In the case of glioma, where the mechanism of glutamate release by tumour cells is known, pharmacological agents (e.g. sulfasalazine), which block glutamate release have considerable potential as therapeutic agents for reducing seizure burden in this condition. Therefore, it is important that future work attempts to identify the molecular mechanisms underlying the <italic>Taenia</italic>-specific production of glutamate to inform the development of new therapeutic strategies to potentially reduce larval expansion and possibly treat seizures in NCC.</p><p>An important consideration is how we might reconcile our findings of glutamate release by <italic>Taenia</italic> larvae with the clinical picture of delayed symptom onset in NCC. In people with NCC, some experience acute seizures immediately following infection whilst others present with seizures months to years following initial infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adalid-Peralta et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Verma et al., 2011</xref>). This suggests that multiple different, or possibly interacting, mechanisms might be involved in the epileptogenic process in NCC. A recent report has shown that products from <italic>T. solium</italic> cysts mimicking viable cysts contain the enzyme glutamate dehydrogenase, which metabolizes glutamate, whilst products mimicking degenerating cysts do not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Prodjinotho et al., 2022</xref>). This predicts that the glutamate levels the brain would be exposed to would be highest when a cyst dies and releases its contents into its immediate surroundings. Neuroinflammation has long been thought to be central to the development of seizures in NCC. In support of this, larval suppression of host inflammatory responses could help explain why many patients may remain asymptomatic for years following infection. Our findings are not at odds with this line of thinking when considering the effect of neuroinflammation on extracellular glutamate uptake. In the healthy brain parenchymal astrocytes are optimized to maintain extracellular glutamate at low concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Perea and Araque, 2010</xref>). However, the inflammatory transition of astrocytes to a reactive phenotype is known to impede their ability to buffer uptake of extracellular glutamate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Seifert et al., 2010</xref>). It is therefore conceivable that cyst-associated reactive astrocytosis may gradually erode the ability of homeostatic mechanisms to compensate for larvae derived extracellular glutamate resulting in delayed symptom onset in NCC.</p><p>There is still considerable uncertainty regarding the precise sequence of events leading to seizure onset in NCC. Nonetheless our findings provide the first evidence that, as is the case with the other common causes of adult-acquired epilepsy (i.e. stoke, traumatic brain injury, and glioma), increased extracellular, parasite-derived excitatory amino acids such as glutamate, and perturbed glutamatergic signalling, possibly play a role in the development of seizures in NCC.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title><italic>Taenia</italic> maintenance and preparation of whole cyst homogenates and E/S products</title><p>Larvae of <italic>T. crassiceps</italic> (ORF strain) were donated to us by Dr Siddhartha Mahanty (University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Australia) and propagated <italic>in vivo</italic> by serial intraperitoneal infection of 5- to 8-week-old female C57BL/6 mice.

In the lab, the pia mater was carefully removed, and the tissue was trimmed into blocks for sectioning using a Compresstome (Model VF-210-0Z, Precisionary Instruments). Slices were cut at a thickness of 350 µm and allowed to recover for ~30 min at 34°C in standard aCSF composed of NaCl (120 mM, Sigma-Aldrich); KCl (3 mM, Sigma-Aldrich); MgCl<sub>2</sub> (2 mM, Sigma-Aldrich); CaCl<sub>2</sub> (2 mM, Sigma-Aldrich); NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> (1.2 mM, Sigma-Aldrich); NaHCO<sub>3</sub> (23 mM, Sigma-Aldrich); and <sc>D</sc>-glucose (11 mM, Sigma-Aldrich). The aCSF was adjusted to pH 7.4 using 0.1 mM NaOH (Sigma-Aldrich), was continuously carbogenated, and had an osmolality of ~300 mOsm. After recovery, slices were left for at least 1 hr at room temperature before recording.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Electrophysiology, calcium and glutamate imaging</title><p>For experiments using calcium and glutamate imaging, mouse hippocampal organotypic brain slices were used. For all other experiments rat hippocampal organotypic brain slices were used. A subset of experiments used acute human cortical brain slices and are specified. Brain slices were transferred to a submerged recording chamber on a patch-clamp rig, which was maintained at a temperature between 28 and 30°C and were continuously superfused with standard aCSF bubbled with carbogen gas (95% O<sub>2</sub>:5% CO<sub>2</sub>, Afrox) using peristaltic pumps (Watson-Marlow). The standard aCSF was composed of NaCl (120 mM, Sigma-Aldrich); KCl (3 mM, Sigma-Aldrich); MgCl<sub>2</sub> (2 mM, Sigma-Aldrich); CaCl<sub>2</sub> (2 mM, Sigma-Aldrich); NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> (1.2 mM, Sigma-Aldrich); NaHCO<sub>3</sub> (23 mM, Sigma-Aldrich); and <sc>D</sc>-glucose (11 mM, Sigma-Aldrich) in deionized water with pH adjusted to between 7.35 and 7.40 using 0.1 mM NaOH (Sigma-Aldrich). Neurons in the CA3 region of the hippocampus were visualized using a Zeiss Axioskop or Olympus BX51WI upright microscope using 20× or 40× water-immersion objectives and targeted for recording. Micropipettes were prepared (tip resistance between 3 and 7 MΩ) from borosilicate glass capillaries (outer diameter 1.2 mm, inner diameter 0.69 mm, Harvard Apparatus Ltd) using a horizontal puller (Sutter). Recordings were made in current-clamp mode using Axopatch 200B amplifiers (Axon Instruments) and data acquired using WinWCP (University of Strathclyde) or Igor (Markram Laboratory, Ecole polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne). Matlab (MathWorks) was utilized for trace analysis. Basic properties of each cell were recorded (see Figure supplements). Cells were excluded from analyses if the Ra was greater than 80 Ω or if the resting membrane potential was above –40 mV. Two internal solutions were used: a ‘standard’ internal solution (K-gluconate (126 mM), KCl (4 mM), HEPES (10 mM), Na<sub>2</sub>ATP (4 mM), NaGTP (0.3 mM), and Na<sub>2</sub>-phosphocreatine (10 mM); Sigma-Aldrich) and a ‘cesium’ internal solution (CsOH (120 mM), gluconic acid (120 mM), HEPES (40 mM), Na<sub>2</sub>ATP (2 mM), NaGTP (0.3 mM), and NaCl (10 mM); Sigma-Aldrich). Experimental substances were puffed onto neurons using an OpenSpritzer, a custom-made pressure ejection system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Forman et al., 2016</xref>). Current was injected if required to ensure a neuronal resting membrane potential within 2 mV of –60 mV. In all puffing experiments each data point represents the mean peak puff-induced change in membrane potential from 10 sweeps. For wash-in recordings drugs were washed in for 8 min before recordings were made. Drugs were washed out for at least 8 min before washout recordings were made. In some experiments, TTX (2 µM, Sigma-Aldrich) was added to the aCSF to block voltage-gated sodium channels.</p><p>For calcium and glutamate imaging, organotypic hippocampal mouse brain slices were virally transfected with a genetically encoded Ca<sup>2+</sup> reporter (GCAMP6s under the synapsin 1 gene promoter, AAV1.Syn.GCaMP6s.WPRE.SV40, Penn Vector Core) or a genetically encoded glutamate reporter (iGluSnFR under the human synapsin 1 gene promoter, pAAV.hSynapsin.SF-iGluSnFR.A184S, Addgene) 1 day post culture using the OpenSpritzer and imaged 5 days later using an Olympus BX51WI microscope, 20× water-immersion objective, CCD camera (CCE-B013-U, Mightex for the calcium imaging and an Andor Zyla 4.2 for the glutamate imaging). For the calcium imaging excitation was provided using a 470-nm LED (Thorlabs). For glutamate imaging, excitation was generated using an LED-based light engine, 475/28 nm (Lumencor). For both imaging paradigms a Chroma 39002 EGFP filter set (480/30 nm excitation filter, 505 nm dichroic, 535/40 nm emission filter) was utilized. Images were collected using µManager (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Edelstein et al., 2010</xref>). Calcium imaging data were analysed using Caltracer3 beta. Glutamate imaging data were analysed using custom scripts written in Matlab.</p><p>For real-time imaging of glutamate signalling in neurons adjacent to a live <italic>T. crassiceps</italic> larva, mouse hippocampal organotypic brain slices were virally transfected with a genetically encoded glutamate reporter (iGluSnFR under the human synapsin 1 promoter, pAAV.hSynapsin.SF-iGluSnFR.A184S) 1 day post culture using the OpenSpritzer. Five to six days later a brain slice would be removed from the culture insert by cutting a roughly 15-mm diameter circle of the membrane out, with the brain slice located in the centre of the circle. The membrane was then placed in a glass-bottomed Petri dish containing a drop of aCSF, with the brain slice making contact with the glass bottom. At this point, a single <italic>T. crassiceps</italic> larvae (harvested on the same day or 1 day prior) of approximately 1–2 mm in length was inserted under the membrane with a pasteur pipette and carefully maneuvered until it was adjacent to one edge of the slice. A stainless-steel washer of an appropriate size was then placed on top of the membrane such that it surrounded the brain slice and larva, securing them in place. An additional 2–3 ml of carbogen-bubbled aCSF was then added to the Petri dish. The Petri dish was placed in a small incubating chamber (37°C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>) in an LSM 880 airyscan confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss, ZEN SP 2 software). Glutamate signalling in the brain area directly adjacent to the larvae was captured with a tile scan of the area every 90 s for 15 min using a 40× water-immersion lens (Zeiss) and a 488-nm laser (Zeiss). Transmitted light was also captured to confirm presence and movement of the larva at the site of interest.</p><p>Pharmacological manipulations were performed by bath application of drugs using a perfusion system (Watson-Marlow). Mecamylamine, amiloride, D-AP5, and CNQX were purchased from Tocris. Kynurenic acid and Substance P were acquired from Sigma-Aldrich.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Data analysis and statistics</title><p>Data were graphed and analysed using Matlab, ImageJ, Microsoft Excel, and GraphPad Prism. All data were subjected to a Shapiro–Wilk test to determine whether it was normally distributed. Normally distributed populations were subjected to parametric statistical analyses, whilst skewed data were assessed using non-parametric statistical analyses, these included: Mann–Whitney test; Wilcoxon ranked pairs test; Kruskal–Wallis one-way ANOVA with post hoc Dunn’s multiple comparison test; and Friedman test with post hoc Dunn’s multiple comparison test. The confidence interval for all tests was set at 95%.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Visualization</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Resources, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Resources, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Resources, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Resources, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Resources, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Resources</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Resources, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con11"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Data curation, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Ethical approval for use of human tissue was granted by the University of Cape Town Human Research Ethics Committee (HREC 016/2018) according to institutional guidelines.

NCC is a common parasitic infection that leads to severe neurological problems. It is a major cause of epilepsy, but little is known about how the infection causes epilepsy. The authors used neuronal recordings, imaging of calcium transients in neurons, and glutamate-sensing fluorescent reporters. A strength of the paper is the use of both rodent and human preparations. The results provide <bold>convincing</bold> evidence that the larvae secrete glutamate and this depolarizes neurons.

Is initial release on day 1, no release and recovery in the following days reproducible? Is very high glu content of E/S content (15-fold higher in comparison to solium homogenate AND 6-fold higher in comparison to crassiceps homogenate and E/S content). Not sure if Fig 6D is adding relevant information, especially since it is based on n = 1</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that a N=1 is only sufficient for proof of principle. However it is worth noting that the measurements still reflect the cumulative release from 20 larvae. Nonetheless, the statement in text has been simplified to say: ‘These results demonstrate that T. solium larvae continually release glutamate and aspartate into their immediate surroundings.’ As this focusses on the point that the larvae release glutamate and aspartate continuously and that we can’t draw conclusions about the variability over days.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Methods:</p><p>- Human slices, mention cortex - what part, patient data would be interesting.

We respond to the identified weaknesses below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>There are some weaknesses:</p><p>(1) The main one relates to the statement: &quot;Together, these results indicate that T. crassiceps larvae homogenate results not just in a transient depolarization of cells in the immediate vicinity of application, but can also trigger a wave of excitation that propagates through the brain slice in both space and time. This demonstrates that T. crassiceps homogenate can initiate seizurelike activity under suitable conditions.&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>The only &quot;evidence&quot; of propagation is an image at two time points. It is one experiment, and there is no quantification. Either increase n's and perform a quantification, or remove such a statement.</p><p>We acknowledge that the data is from one experiment, with the intention of demonstrating that it is plausible for intense depolarization of a subset of neurons to result in the initiation and propagation of seizure-like activity to nearby neurons under suitable conditions. However, we agree that it is prudent to remove this statement and have done so.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Likewise, there is no evidence of seizure genesis. A single cell recording is shown. The presence of a seizure-like event should be evaluated with field recordings.</p></disp-quote><p>In this experiment the Ca2+ imaging demonstrates activity spreading from the site of the restricted homogenate puff to all surrounding neurons. Furthermore, the whole-cell recoding is typical of a slice wide seizure-like event.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Control puff experiments are lacking for Fig 1. Would puffing ACSF also produce a depolarization, and even firing, as suggested in Fig. 2D? This is needed for at least one species.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and have added this data for the rat and mouse neuron in a new Figure 1-figure supplement 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) What is the rationale to use a Cs-based solution? Even in the presence of TTX and with blocking K channels, the depolarization may be sufficient to activate Ca channels (LVGs), which would further contribute to the depolarization. Why not perform voltage clamp recordings to directly the current?</p></disp-quote><p>The intention of the Cs-based solution was to block K+ channels and reduce the effect of moderately raised K+ in the homogenate to isolate the contribution of other causative agents of depolarization (i.e. glutamate / aspartate). We agree that performing voltage clamp recordings would have been useful for directly recording the currents responsible for depolarization.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Why did you use organotypic slices? Since you wish to model adult epilepsy, it would have been more relevant to use fresh slices from adult rats/mice. At least, discuss the caveat of using a network still in development in vitro.</p></disp-quote><p>Recordings were performed 6–14 days post culture, which is equivalent to postnatal Days (P) 12 to 22. Previous work has shown that neurons in the organotypic hippocampal brain slice are relatively mature (Gähwiler et al., 1997). For example they possess mature Cl- homeostasis mechanisms at this point, as evidenced by their hyperpolarizing EGABA (Raimondo et al., 2012).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) Please include both the number of slices and number of cells recorded in each condition. This is the standard (the number of cells is not enough).</p></disp-quote><p>This has now been added to all relevant sections of the results text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) Please provide a table with the basic properties of cells (Rin, Rs, etc.). This is standard to assess the quality of the recordings.</p></disp-quote><p>Tables containing the basic properties for each cell recording have been created for each figure (as Figure supplements) and the following statement was added to the electrophysiology section of the Methods: ‘Basic properties of each cell were recorded (see Figure supplements).’</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) Please provide a table on patient's profile. This is standard when using human material. Were these TLE cases (and &quot;control&quot; cortex) or epileptogenic cortex?</p></disp-quote><p>We have now added a basic table on the patient’s profiles to the Materials and Methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Globally, the authors achieved their aims. They show convincingly that larvae material can depolarize neurons, with glutamate (and aspartate) as the most likely candidates.</p><p>This is important not only because it provides mechanistic insight but also potential therapeutic targets. The result is impactful, as the authors use quasi-naturalistic conditions, to assess what might happen in the human brain. The experimental design is appropriate to address the question. It can be replicated by any interested person.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer 2 for their enthusiastic and constructive assessment of our manuscript.

The infection is caused by larvae of the parasitic cestode Taenia solium It is a leading cause of epilepsy in adults worldwide</p><p>To address the effects of cestode larvae, homogenates and excretory/secretory products of larvae were added to organotypic brain slice cultures of rodents or layer 2/3 of human cortical brain slices from patients with refractory epilepsy.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank Reviewer 3 for their helpful comments and suggestions for improvement which we address below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A self-made pressure ejection system was used to puff larvae homogenate (20 ms puff) onto the soma of patched neurons. The mechanical force could have caused depolarizaton so a vehicle control is critical. On line 150 they appear to have used saline in this regard, and clarification would be good. Were the controls here (and aCSF elsewhere) done with the low Mg2+o aCSF like the larvae homogenates?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and have added examples where aCSF alone was pressure ejected onto the same rat and mouse neurons in a new Figure 1-figure supplement 1. In Figure 1, the same aCSF as that was used to bathe the slices was used. In Figure 2D-G, either PBS (which larval homogenates were prepared in) or growth medium (which contain larval E/S products) were used as comparative controls.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>They found that neurons depolarized after larvae homogenate exposure and the effect was mediated by glutamate but not nicotinic receptors for acetylcholine (nAChRs), acid-sensing channels or substance P. To address nAChRs, they used 10uM mecamyline, and for ASICs 2mM amiloride which seems like a high concentration. Could the concentrations be confirmed for their selectivity?</p></disp-quote><p>We did not independently verify the selectivity of the antagonist concentrations used in our study. However, the persistence of depolarizations despite the use of high concentrations of mecamylamine (10 μM) and amiloride (2 mM) provides strong evidence that neither nAChRs nor ASICs are primarily responsible for mediating these responses. The high concentrations used, while potentially raising concerns about specificity, actually strengthen our conclusion that these receptor types are not involved in the observed effect.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Glutamate receptor antagonists, used in combination, were 10uM CNQX, 50uM DAP5, and 2mM kynurenic acid. These concentrations are twice what most use. Please discuss.</p></disp-quote><p>We intentionally used higher-than-typical concentrations of glutamate receptor antagonists in our experimental design. Our rationale for this approach was to ensure maximal blockade of glutamate receptors, thereby minimizing the possibility of residual receptor activity confounding our results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also, it would be very interesting to know if the glutamate receptor is AMPA, Kainic acid, or NMDA. Were metabotropic antagonists ever tested? That would be logical because CNQX/DAPR/Kynurenic acid did not block all of the depolarization.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer's interest in the specific glutamate receptor subtypes involved in our study. Our research primarily focused on ionotropic glutamate receptors as a group, without differentiating the individual contributions of AMPA, Kainate, and NMDA receptors. This approach, while broad, allowed us to establish the involvement of glutamatergic signalling in the observed effects. We acknowledge that we did not investigate metabotropic glutamate receptors in this study. Importantly, we demonstrate later in our manuscript that the larval products contain both glutamate and aspartate. Therefore the precise nature of the glutamate-dependent depolarization observed using a particular experimental preparation would depend on the specific types of neurons exposed to the homogenate and the expression profile of different glutamate receptor subtypes on these neurons.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>They also showed the elevated K+ in the homogenate (~11 mM) could not account for the depolarization. However, the experiment with K+ was not done in a low Mg2+o buffer (Or was it -please clarify).</p></disp-quote><p>The experiment where 11.39 mM K+ as well as the experiment with T. crass. Homogenate with a cesium internal and added TTX were all done in standard 2 mM Mg2+ containing aCSF.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>They also confirmed that only small molecules led to the depolarization after filtering out very large molecules. That supports the conclusion that glutamate - which is quite small - could be responsible. It is logical to test substance P because the Intro points out prior work links the larvae and seizures by inflammation and implicates substance P. However, why focus on nAChRs and ASIC?</p></disp-quote><p>These were chosen as they are ionotropic receptors which mediate depolarization and hence could conceivably be responsible for the homogenate-induced depolarization we observed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The depolarizations caused seizure-like events in slices. The slices were exposed to a proconvulant buffer though- low Mg2+o. This buffer can cause spontaneous seizure-like events so it is important to know what the buffer did alone.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that a low M2+ buffer solution can elicit seizure-like events in organotypic slices alone. However, the timing of the onset of the seizure-like event in the example presented in Figure 1 strongly suggests that it was triggered by the T. crass homogenate puff. Nonetheless, on the suggestion of the other reviewers we have reduced emphasis on our experimental evidence for the ability of T. crass. homogenate to illicit seizure-like events.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>They suggest the effects could underlie seizure generation in NCC. However, there is only one event that is seizure-like in the paper and it is just an inset. Were others similar? How frequency were they? How long?</p></disp-quote><p>Please see the response above as well as our response to Reviewer 1 who raised a similar concern.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Using Glutamate-sensing fluorescent reporters they found the larvae contain glutamate and can release it, a strength of the paper.</p><p>Fig. 4. Could an inset be added to show the effects are very fast? That would support an effect of glutamate.</p></disp-quote><p>We have not added an inset. However, given the scale bar (500 ms) for the trace provided, the response is very fast.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Why is aspartate relatively weak and glutamate relatively effective as an agonist?</p></disp-quote><p>Glutamate generally has a higher affinity for glutamate receptors compared to aspartate. This is particularly true for AMPA and kainate receptors, where glutamate is the primary endogenous agonist. Similarly iGluSnFR has a higher sensitivity for glutamate over aspartate (Marvin et al., 2013).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Could some of the variability in Fig 4G be due to choice of different cell types? That would be consistent with Fig 5B where only a fraction of cells in the culture showed a response to the larvae nearby.</p></disp-quote><p>Whilst differences in cell types could contribute to the variability in Fig 4G, all the responses were recorded from hippocampal pyramidal neurons and hence it is more likely that the variability is a function of other sources of variation including differences in iGluSnFR expression, depth of the cell imaged, the proximity of the puffer pipette etc. In Fig. 5B we think the lack of response may be due to the fact that any released glutamate by the live larvae was not able reach the iGluSnFR neurons at sufficient concentrations due to the nature of our submerged recording setup. We have added the following sentence to the results. ‘Our submerged recording setup might have led to swift diffusion or washout of released glutamate, possibly explaining the lack of observable changes.’</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>On what basis was the ROI drawn in Fig. 5B.</p></disp-quote><p>The ROI drawn in Fig. 5B was selected to include all iGluSnFR expressing neurons in the brain slice. which were captured in the field of view.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also in 5B, I don't see anything in the transmitted image. What should be seen exactly?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that it is difficult to resolve much in the transmitted image. However, both the brain slice on the left as well as a T. crass. larva on the right is visible and outlined with a green or orange dashed line respectively.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Human brain slices were from temporal cortex of patients with refractory epilepsy. Was the temporal cortex devoid of pathology and EEG abnormalities? This area may be quite involved in the epilepsy because refractory epilepsy that goes to surgery is often temporal lobe epilepsy. Please discuss the limitations of studying the temporal cortex of humans with epilepsy since it may be more susceptible to depolarizations of many kinds, not just larvae.</p></disp-quote><p>We acknowledge the important limitations of using temporal cortex tissue from patients with refractory epilepsy. While we aimed to use visually normal tissue, we recognize that the tissue may have underlying pathology or functional abnormalities not visible to the naked eye. It may also be more susceptible to induced depolarizations due to epilepsy-related changes in neuronal excitability. Despite these limitations, we believe our human tissue data still provides valuable data that the larval homogenates can induce depolarization in human as well as rodent neurons.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Please discuss the limitations of the cultures - they are from very young animals and cultured for 6-14 days.</p></disp-quote><p>We acknowledge the potential limitations of our experimental model using organotypic hippocampal slice cultures from young animals. The use of relatively immature tissue may not fully represent the adult nervous system due to developmental differences in receptor expression, synaptic connections, and network properties. The 6-14 day culture period, while allowing some maturation, may induce changes that differ from the in vivo environment, including alterations in cellular physiology and network reorganization. Despite these limitations, this model provides a valuable balance between preserved local circuitry and experimental accessibility. Future studies comparing results with acute adult slices and in vivo models would be beneficial to validate and extend our findings.</p><p>References:</p><p>Gähwiler, B.H. et al.
