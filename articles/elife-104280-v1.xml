suggests that mechanical load on the Î±Î² T-cell receptor (TCR) is crucial for recognizing the antigenic peptide-bound major histocompatibility complex (pMHC) molecule. Our recent all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations revealed that the inter-domain motion of the TCR is responsible for the load-induced catch bond behavior of the TCR-pMHC complex and peptide discrimination (Chang-Gonzalez et al., 2024). To further examine the generality of the mechanism, we perform all-atom MD simulations of the B7 TCR under different conditions for comparison with our previous simulations of the A6 TCR. The two TCRs recognize the same pMHC and have similar interfaces with pMHC in crystal structures. We find that the B7 TCR-pMHC interface stabilizes under â¼15 pN load using a conserved dynamic allostery mechanism that involves the asymmetric motion of the TCR chassis. However, despite forming comparable contacts with pMHC as A6 in the crystal structure, B7 has fewer high-occupancy contacts with pMHC and exhibits higher mechanical compliance during the simulation. These results indicate that the dynamic allostery common to the TCRÎ±Î² chassis can amplify slight differences in interfacial contacts into distinctive mechanical responses and nuanced biological outcomes.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>T-cell receptor</kwd><kwd>catch bond</kwd><kwd>mechanobiology</kwd><kwd>major histocompatibility complex</kwd><kwd>molecular dynamics</kwd><kwd>allostery</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P01AI143565</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chang-Gonzalez</surname><given-names>Ana Cristina</given-names></name><name><surname>Akitsu</surname><given-names>Aoi</given-names></name><name><surname>Mallis</surname><given-names>Robert J</given-names></name><name><surname>Lang</surname><given-names>Matthew J</given-names></name><name><surname>Reinherz</surname><given-names>Ellis L</given-names></name><name><surname>Hwang</surname><given-names>Wonmuk</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AI136301</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chang-Gonzalez</surname><given-names>Ana Cristina</given-names></name><name><surname>Akitsu</surname><given-names>Aoi</given-names></name><name><surname>Mallis</surname><given-names>Robert J</given-names></name><name><surname>Lang</surname><given-names>Matthew J</given-names></name><name><surname>Reinherz</surname><given-names>Ellis L</given-names></name><name><surname>Hwang</surname><given-names>Wonmuk</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Recognition of antigenic ligand by T-cell receptors is a nuanced process where mechanical force can be leveraged to diversify functional outcomes of different T-cells for the same ligand.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The A6 T-cell receptor (TCR)Î±Î² and B7 TCRÎ±Î² (herein we call TCRÎ±Î² simply as TCR) are both specific for the same Tax peptide (LLFGYPVYV) of the human T lymphotropic virus 1 (HTLV-1) bound to HLA-A2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Garboczi et al., 1996a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Garboczi et al., 1996b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ding et al., 1998</xref>). A6 and B7 derive from T-cell clones isolated from two patients with HTLV-1-associated myelopathic/tropical spastic paraparesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Utz et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ding et al., 1998</xref>). They share the same VÎ² germline gene (TRBV6-5) and differ only in the VÎ± germline gene (A6: TRAV12-2; B7:TRAV29/DV5), with sequence similarity of 45% for VÎ±, 96% for VÎ², and 100% for CÎ± and CÎ² (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ding et al., 1998</xref>). The only structural differences between the two TCRs are from the residues of the VÎ± domain and the highly variable complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3Î²) loop of the VÎ² domain that is crucial for peptide recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ding et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bourcier et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Rudolph et al., 2006</xref>). In crystal structures, both TCRs bind in a diagonal orientation to the Tax peptide-bound major histocompatibility complex (pMHC), such that both VÎ± and VÎ² contact the MHC Î±1 and Î±2 helices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Garboczi et al., 1996a</xref>). The similar diagonal binding modes are achieved by interactions involving different CDR residues of A6 and B7 contacting largely the same sets of pMHC residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ding et al., 1998</xref>). Only 1 out of 17 residues contacting pMHC in B7 is also found in the A6 pMHC interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ding et al., 1998</xref>). T-cell response assays demonstrated that single-residue mutations to the Tax peptide elicit different responses in the two TCRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ding et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hausmann et al., 1999</xref>). Interfacial interactions may play a role in this TCR-specific response, as residue charges at the surface of the A6 and B7 variable domains show different electrostatic profiles, where the pocket for the Tax peptide Y5 residue is positively charged in A6 but negatively charged in B7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ding et al., 1998</xref>). Overall, the B7 VÎ± surface has fewer charged residues exposed than A6 VÎ±. While A6 and B7 recognize Tax-MHC with similar affinities and kinetics, it has been suggested that they achieve binding via different thermodynamic pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Davis-Harrison et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>However, since Î±Î²TCR is a mechanosensor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Reinherz et al., 2023</xref>), the TCR-pMHC bond lifetime under physiological piconewton (pN) level load should be more functionally relevant than the equilibrium binding pathway. In this regard, we have previously used all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to show that contacts with pMHC of A6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chang-Gonzalez et al., 2024</xref>) and JM22 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hwang et al., 2020</xref>) TCRs are stabilized when an adequate 15â20 pN force is applied. The force-induced stabilization occurs as the asymmetric domain motion of the TCR chassis leads to weakening of the interface with pMHC either in the absence of an adequate level of force or if the sequence of the bound peptide is incompatible with maintaining contacts in the loaded state. The goal of this study is to determine whether the load-dependent control of the binding with pMHC is also present in B7 TCR, and identify any differences with A6 that may impact the response of the T-cell while responding to the same pMHC.</p><p>We find that the mechanism of dynamic allostery is largely conserved in B7, yet the loaded state does not stabilize contacts with pMHC as robustly as in the A6. Thus, while both A6 and B7 possess comparable equilibrium binding affinity for pMHC, A6 appears to exhibit a stronger catch bond behavior under load. Given the nuanced and dynamic nature of TCRs against the same pMHC, including the effect of ligand abundance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akitsu et al., 2024</xref>), difference in mechanical response between A6 and B7 suggests T-cell clones bearing those TCRs may operate differently in vivo. Our study also underscores the importance of dynamics when comparing between TCRs that have similar crystal structures and equilibrium binding affinities.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Our simulation systems include the B7 TCR bound to Tax pMHC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>) with no, low, and high extensions to apply different loads, and an isolated B7 TCR (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). We also used systems without the C-module (VÎ±Î² and VÎ±Î²-pMHC) to study the role of the C-module. To apply a load, we held the terminal C<sub>Î±</sub> atoms of the added strands at different extensions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). This reflects the constant spacing between a T-cell and an APC maintained by adhesion molecules such as CD2 and CD58 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Reinherz et al., 2023</xref>). In in vitro single-molecule experiments, pulling to a fixed separation and holding is also commonly done. On the other hand, simulation for B7<sup>0</sup> was performed by lightly holding the MHC Î±3 domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) in a construct without added strands (Methods).

Absence of the C-module (VÎ±Î²-pMHC) also promoted more contacts with pMHC, suggesting the allosteric role of the C-module for binding with pMHC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). These results agree well with the behaviors seen in A6 and JM22 TCRs in our previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chang-Gonzalez et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hwang et al., 2020</xref>). However, the number of pMHC contacts with B7 was reduced compared to A6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). This is despite their comparable number of contacts with the pMHC in crystal structures and comparable equilibrium binding affinity in solution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ding et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Davis-Harrison et al., 2005</xref>). In fact, we had to modify our simulation protocol to avoid premature breakage of contacts between B7 and pMHC when preparing the system for production run under load (see Methods).</p><p>Time-dependent behavior of the TCR-pMHC interface further supports the load-mediated enhancement of binding. For this, we calculated instantaneous force and contact occupancy in 40 ns overlapping intervals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). B7<sup>high</sup> had overall more inter- and intramolecular contacts (more orange-yellow circles) than B7<sup>low</sup> (more purple), suggesting that the increased load stiffens the TCR-pMHC complex. B7<sup>0</sup> had fewer TCR-pMHC contacts but more intra-TCR contacts (horizontal bars in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), indicating decoupling of the TCR from pMHC in the absence of load. However, after about 1300 ns, B7<sup>high</sup> started to lose the initial high-occupancy contacts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). This is likely because the fixed extension (end-to-end distance) imposed in simulation can adversely impact the interfacial stability of the B7 TCR-pMHC complex that has a higher compliance than A6, as discussed further below. For analysis of average properties, we thus used the 500â1000 ns interval, to be consistent with other systems.</p><p>Comparing average counts of high-occupancy pMHC contacts for both A6 and B7 TCRs indicates that interfacial contacts were dominated by MHC-VÎ± (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

Importantly, the breakage is not due to a high force, but instead it happened when instantaneous force was low.

This trend was also observed in A6 and JM22. Such concentration of high-occupancy contacts may protect TCR-pMHC interactions from breakage by water. In A6 and JM22 TCRs, the greater number of contacts with pMHC in the high-load cases and VÎ±Î²-pMHC correlated with larger buried surface area (BSA) of the residues forming contacts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chang-Gonzalez et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hwang et al., 2020</xref>). B7 did not follow this trend, as B7<sup>high</sup> and VÎ±Î²-pMHC had reduced total and per-residue BSA than B7<sup>0</sup> and B7<sup>low</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). This is likely because the fewer high-occupancy contacts in B7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) tend to be more exposed, making the relationship between the BSA and load less direct. Consistent with this, the total BSA of B7 was 67.4% (B7<sup>0</sup>) to 44.2% (B7<sup>high</sup>) of the corresponding values of A6.</p><p>The residues of pMHC forming greater than 50% average occupancy under high load differed between A6 and B7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>), as did the location of V-module residues forming respective contacts with the pMHC residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), further highlighting their divergence in the interfacial footprint under load. Despite this, the root mean square fluctuation (RMSF) of C<sub>Î±</sub> atoms of the Tax peptide measured after 500 ns was reduced in B7<sup>high</sup> and VÎ±Î²-pMHC compared to B7<sup>0</sup> and B7<sup>low</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1E</xref>), as observed for A6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chang-Gonzalez et al., 2024</xref>), which supports load-induced stabilization of the complex.</p><p>We calculated the distance between the V-module and pMHC as another measure of the interfacial stability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1F</xref>; Methods). The distance was stably maintained in VÎ±Î²-pMHC and B7<sup>high</sup> (before 1300 ns) whereas it fluctuated more in B7<sup>0</sup> and B7<sup>low</sup>. Of note, the former two systems maintained the distance greater than that in the crystal structure by 0.3â0.9 Ã. Thus, a slight separation engendered by force or in the absence of constraint imposed by the C-module provides room for adjusting residues to form more stable contacts. The more stable maintenance of the distance between V-module and pMHC in VÎ±Î²-pMHC and B7<sup>high</sup> is consistent with other measures of their stability explained above.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>CDR3 positions are controlled by load-dependent VÎ±-VÎ² motion</title><p>The greater number of VÎ±-VÎ² contacts in B7<sup>0</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) is consistent with the increase in total intra-TCR contact occupancy (horizontal bar in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, bottom panel).

This suggests a more pronounced asymmetric motion in B7<sup>low</sup>. The no-load B7<sup>0</sup> HÎ² amplitude was larger compared to HÎ± (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, bottom, negative value for PC1 of B7<sup>0</sup>). For B7<sup>0</sup>, the small PC1 amplitude of the overall V-C motion without load (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>) does not suppress the motional asymmetry between Î± and Î² chains, while in B7<sup>high</sup>, the chassis becomes less mobile under load.</p><p>The V-C angles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, â TCRÎ± and â TCRÎ²) reveal the motional asymmetry in addition to PCA. As in the case of low-load A6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chang-Gonzalez et al., 2024</xref>), â TCRÎ± of B7<sup>low</sup> shows a wide bimodal distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). â TCRÎ± decreased at around 700 ns as B7<sup>low</sup> bent more (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1B</xref>). This would put the V-module in an unfavorable orientation to bind pMHC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hwang et al., 2020</xref>). The dependence of CDR3 distance on V-C angles was most steady in B7<sup>high</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). This supports the allosteric mechanism by which the asymmetric V-C motion of the whole TCR controls the VÎ±-VÎ² motion and the V-C orientation that in turn affects the stability of the TCR-pMHC interface.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>As a protein-protein complex, TCR-pMHC forms a weak interface. A typical heterodimeric protein-protein interface with BSA comparable to that of TCR-pMHC (â¼1700 Ã<sup>2</sup>) has sub-Î¼M binding affinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2013</xref>) while the affinity of the TCR-pMHC complex ranges between Î¼M to hundreds of Î¼M (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Rudolph and Wilson, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Rudolph et al., 2006</xref>). Given the low equilibrium affinity, recent findings highlight the importance of mechanosensing, where force generated during immune surveillance of Î±Î² T-cells is utilized to discriminate cognate vs. non-cognate pMHCs (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Zhu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Liu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Reinherz et al., 2023</xref>). Our earlier simulation studies of the JM22 and A6 TCRs showed that the dynamical motion of the TCR chassis is responsible for the force-driven stabilization of the contacts with pMHC, i.e., catch bond formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hwang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chang-Gonzalez et al., 2024</xref>). Examining additional TCRs via all-atom MD simulation can inform how the mechanism is adopted. By finding similarities and differences between A6 and B7 TCRs, which recognize the same Tax pMHC, we can elucidate how mechanical force is utilized by each to impact the differential function of T-cells.</p><p>Catch bond mechanisms generally differ among proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Thomas et al., 2008</xref>). For example, FimH and vinculin have relatively well-defined weak- and strong-binding states where there are corresponding crystal structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bakolitsa et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Le Trong et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sauer et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mei et al., 2020</xref>). Availability of the end-state structures enable using simulation approaches such as enhanced sampling of individual states and studying the transition between the two states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Languin-CattoÃ«n et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Ccoa et al., 2024</xref>). In contrast, TCRs do not have any structurally well-defined weak- or strong-binding states, which requires a different approach. As demonstrated in our present work as well as in our previous papers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hwang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chang-Gonzalez et al., 2024</xref>), our microsecond-long simulations of the complex under realistic pN-level loads and a combination of analysis methods are effective for elucidating the catch bond mechanism of TCRs, which shows that the load-dependent stabilization of the TCR-pMHC complex differs from simple relaxation of the structure in the initial crystallographic confinement.</p><p>Recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Choi et al., 2023</xref>, proposed a mathematical model of TCR catch bond formation. Their assumptions are based mainly on the steered MD simulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wu et al., 2019</xref>) where partial unfolding of MHC and tilting of the TCR-pMHC interface were considered as required. Our mechanism does not conflict with their assumptions since the complex in the fully folded state should first bear load in a ligand-dependent manner in order to allow any subsequent larger-scale changes.</p><p>We found that the dynamic allostery of the TCR chassis observed in A6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chang-Gonzalez et al., 2024</xref>) and JM22 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hwang et al., 2020</xref>) is largely conserved in B7. CÎ± and CÎ² domains form extensive contacts to construct a base, and the VÎ²-CÎ² contacts are more extensive than VÎ±-CÎ± contacts. This leads to an asymmetric V-C motion where VÎ± is more mobile relative to the C-module than VÎ². In turn, the motional asymmetry affects the relative positioning of CDR loops, as measured by the CDR3 distance as well as the orientation of the TCR-pMHC interface relative to the loading direction. Unless an adequate load is applied to the complex to suppress the motion, destabilization of the interface occurs. As noted in A6 and JM22, the C domain renders a disadvantage to binding except under force. This is indicated by the greater number of interfacial contacts and decreased VÎ±-VÎ² motion of VÎ±Î²-pMHC (no C-module) simulations. The increased interfacial stability of VÎ±Î²-pMHC is also consistent with our discovery that the C-module likely undergoes a partial unfolding to an extended state, where the bond lifetime increases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Das et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akitsu et al., 2024</xref>). Therefore, while the variable domain dictates TCR fit with pMHC, a logical evolutionary pressure would be for the constant domain to maximize discriminatory power by adding instability to the TCR chassis. Furthermore, considering single-chain versions of an antibody lacking the C-module (scFv) are in widespread use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahmad et al., 2012</xref>) including CAR T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Reinherz et al., 2023</xref>), a better understanding of a TCR lacking the C-module may help with developing a novel TCR-based immunotherapy. Given the conservation of the asymmetric motion, we also predict the CÎ² FG-loop deletion mutant of B7 TCR to possess a diminished catch-bond response, as our previous experiment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Das et al., 2015</xref>) and simulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hwang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chang-Gonzalez et al., 2024</xref> demonstrated for other TCRs.</p><p>While dynamic allostery is overall conserved, A6 and B7 differ in the behavior of the TCR-pMHC interface under load. The crystal structures of the two complexes have a comparable number of TCR-pMHC contacts, with a total of 33 for A6 and 29 for B7 in terms of residue pairs, while the number of distinct atom pairs forming contacts are 46 for A6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Garboczi et al., 1996a</xref>) and 63 for B7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ding et al., 1998</xref>). During MD simulations, many of these contacts become transient, resulting in fewer high-occupancy contacts. In the thermally fluctuating state, there is a fourfold increase in the difference in number of contacts between A6 and B7 over the difference for static crystal structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Previously, contacts found in crystal structures have been used to explain differences in responses to point mutations to the Tax peptide. For example, the sensitivity of B7 to the mutation of Y5 of Tax was explained based on the Y5-D30Î± hydrogen bond and stacking of Y5 with Y101Î² of B7 (Y101Î² in the present study was numbered Y104Î² in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ding et al., 1998</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hausmann et al., 1999</xref>). In comparison, the more amenable pocket for Y5 on A6 was suggested to be responsible for the greater tolerance of A6 under mutations of Y5. In MD simulations of B7, the Y5-D30Î± hydrogen bond is formed only in B7<sup>high</sup>, after about 300 ns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1C</xref>), and the Y5-Y101Î² nonpolar contact breaks during simulation of B7<sup>0</sup> and is not present in B7<sup>low</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1A and B</xref>) while it persists with 62% occupancy in B7<sup>high</sup> and 52% occupancy in VÎ±Î²-pMHC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and D</xref>; these occupancies are for the whole simulation period). Changes to T-cell specificity by point mutations on Y5 are thus unlikely to arise solely from the size or the polarity of its binding pocket as a static structure. Instead, point mutations affect the organization and dynamics of the surrounding contacts in addition to fit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chang-Gonzalez et al., 2024</xref>). In a related vein, intermolecular motional network has been suggested to be a controlling factor for allostery in a peptide-SH3 domain complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gomez et al., 2024</xref>), which aligns with the nonlocal and dynamic role of contacts at the TCR-pMHC interface. The inter-domain motion of TCR enables long-range allosteric discrimination of pMHCs, integrating the motion of the two entities such that they influence each other.</p><p>The 14.5 pN force on B7<sup>high</sup> was applied under 190.0 Ã extension (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>), whereas the corresponding high-load simulation for A6 was with 18.2 pN at a slightly lower 187.7 Ã extension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chang-Gonzalez et al., 2024</xref>). The average total intra-TCR contact occupancy for B7<sup>high</sup> between 500 and 1000 ns is 30.4Â±0.49 contacts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), compared to 38.7Â±0.87 for A6 under high load (after 500 ns), which further supports a higher compliance of the former. With its higher compliance, the B7 TCR-pMHC complex needs to be under a greater extension than A6 to apply comparable levels of force, and it would be more difficult to achieve load-induced stabilization of the TCR-pMHC interface. This leads us to predict that B7 will exhibit a weaker catch bond where the peak of the TCR-pMHC bond lifetime is at a lower force. And the destabilization of B7<sup>high</sup> at 1300 ns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2B</xref>) may have been a result of our constant-extension approach to apply load, which allows reaching low-force states by the compliant B7. Although this approach was motivated by the constant spacing between a T-cell and an APC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Reinherz et al., 2023</xref>), the actin cytoskeleton also adjusts the load applied to the TCR-pMHC complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Feng et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hu et al., 2024</xref>). How fluctuation in the applied load affects the TCR-pMHC dynamics is a subject of a future study.</p><p>As a related example to A6 and B7 TCRs, PA59 and PA25 TCRs share the same <italic>TRBV</italic> and <italic>TRBJ</italic> genes, and they share 11-aa CDR3Î² loops that differ only at a single position (Trp vs. Leu) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akitsu et al., 2024</xref>). Recognizing the same pMHC (PA<sub>224-233</sub>/D<sup>b</sup>), their maximum bond lifetimes and the peak catch bond forces differ considerably, 75 s at 21 pN for PA59, and 13 s at 15 pN for PA25 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akitsu et al., 2024</xref>). These differences may facilitate actions of the corresponding T-cells in tissues that present diverse mechanical environments provided by cell movement, adhesion molecules, tight junction, and noncompliant inflammation.</p><p>Likewise, T-cells bearing A6 and B7 may also perform differently in vivo depending on tissue localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akitsu et al., 2024</xref>) even though they behave similarly in vitro in terms of cytotoxicity and secretion of select cytokines (Î³-IFN, MIP-1Î±, and TNFÎ±) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ding et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hausmann et al., 1999</xref>). We also predict the different catch bond profiles of A6 and B7 will render the two types of T cells to respond differently when the pMHC copy number on the APC is limited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akitsu et al., 2024</xref>).

Elucidating details of those differences is beyond the scope of the present work.</p><p>Disparate biological outcomes between structurally similar TCRs recognizing the same pMHC are mechanically possible since slight changes in interfacial contacts can result in altered distribution of loads across the TCR chassis so that changes in its dynamics affect interaction with CD3 signaling subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Reinherz et al., 2023</xref>).

We aligned all complexes to the backbone C<sub>Î±</sub> atoms of the selected residues of B7<sup>low</sup> then built BOCs to monitor the motion of the V-module relative to the C-module.</p></sec></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing - original draft, Writing â review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Writing â review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Conceptualization, Investigation, Writing â review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Conceptualization, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Project administration, Writing â review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Conceptualization, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Project administration, Writing â review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing - original draft, Project administration, Writing â review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media xlink:href="elife-104280-mdarchecklist1-v1.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>Sample simulation systems and scripts are available in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/hwm2746/b7_tcr_ladder">GitHub</ext-link> (copy archived at <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hwang, 2025</xref>).</p></sec><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was funded by US National Institutes of Health Grants P01AI143565 and R01AI136301.

While our manuscript is meant to be a âshortâ contribution, our significant new finding is that even for TCRs targeting the same pMHC, having similar structures, and leading to similar functional outcomes in conventional assays, their response to applied load can be different. This supports out recent experimental work where TCRs targeting the same pMHC differed in their catch bond characteristics, and importantly, in their response to limiting copy numbers of pMHCs on the antigen-presenting cell (Akitsu <italic>et al.</italic>, Sci. Adv., 2024).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>While generally well supported by data, the conclusions would nevertheless benefit from a more concise presentation of information in the figures, as well as from suggesting experimentally testable predictions.</p></disp-quote><p>b. We have updated all figures for clear and streamlined presentation. We have also created four figure supplements to cover more details.</p><p>Regarding testable predictions, an important prediction is that B7 TCR would exhibit a weaker catch bond behavior than A6 (line 297â298). This is a nontrivial prediction because the two TCRs targeting the same pMHC have similar structures and are functionally similar in conventional assays. This prediction can be tested by singlemolecule optical tweezers experiments. Based on our recent experiments Akitsu <italic>et al.</italic>, Sci. Adv. (2024), we also predict that A6 and B7 TCRs will differ in their ability to respond to cases when the number of pMHC molecules presented are limited. Details of how they would differ require further investigation, which is beyond the scope of the present work (line 314-319).</p><p>Another testable prediction for the conservation of the basic allostery mechanism is to test the C<italic>Î²</italic> FG-loop deletion mutant located at the hinge region of the <italic>Î²</italic> chain, where the deletion severely impairs the catch bond formation (line 261â264).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer 2:</bold></p><p>In this work, Chang-Gonzalez and coworkers follow up on an earlier study on the force-dependence of peptide recognition by a T-cell receptor using all-atom molecular dynamics simulations.

As mentioned above and as the reviewer correctly pointed out, the condensed appearance of this manuscript arose largely because we intended it to be a Research Advances article as a short follow up study of our previous paper on A6 TCR published in eLife. Most of the analysis scripts for the A6 TCR study are already available on Github. For the present manuscript, we have created a separate Github repository containing sample simulation systems and scripts for the B7 TCR.</p><p>Regarding the focus issue, it is in part due to the complex nature of the problem, which required simulations under different conditions and multi-faceted analyses. We believe the extensive updates to the figures and texts make clearer and improved presentation. But we note that even in the earlier version, the reviewer pointed out the main take-away message well: âThe primary result is that while the unloaded interaction strength is similar, A6 exhibits more force stabilization.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Detailed comments:</p><p>(1) In Table 1 - are the values of the extension column the deviation from the average length at zero force (that is what I would term extension) or is it the distance between anchor points which is what I would assume based on the large values. If the latter, I suggest changing the heading, and then also reporting the average extension with an asterisk indicating no extensional restraints were applied for B7-0, or just listing 0 load in the load column. Standard deviation in this value can also be reported. If it is an extension as I would define it, then I think B7-0 should indicate extension = 0+/- something. The distance between anchor points could also be labeled in Figure 1A.</p></disp-quote><p>R2-b. âExtensionâ is the distance between anchor points that the reviewer is referring to (blue spheres at the ends of the added strands in Figure 1A). While its meaning should be clear in the section âLaddered extensionsâ in âMD simulation protocolâ (line 357â390), in a strict sense, we agree that using it for the end-to-end distance can be confusing. However, since we have already used it in our previous two papers (Hwang <italic>et al.</italic>, PNAS 2020 and Chang-Gonzalez <italic>et al.</italic>, eLife, 2024), we prefer to keep it for consistency. Instead, in the caption of Table 1, we explained its meaning, and also explicitly labeled it in Figure 1A, as the reviewer suggested.</p><p>Please also note that the no-load case B7<sup>0</sup> was performed by separately building a TCR-pMHC complex without added linkers (line 352), and holding the distal part of pMHC (the <italic>Î±</italic>3 domain) with weak harmonic restraints (line 406â408). Thus, no extension can be assigned to B7<sup>0</sup>. We added a brief explanation about holding the MHC <italic>Î±</italic>3 domain for B7<sup>0</sup> in line 83â85.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) As in the previous paper, the authors apply âconstant forceâ by scanning to find a particular bond distance at which a desired force is selected, rather than simply applying a constant force. I find this approach less desirable unless there is experimental evidence suggesting the pMHC and TCR were forced to be a particular distance apart when forces are applied. It is relatively trivial to apply constant forces, so in general, I would suggest this would have been a reasonable comparison. Line 243-245 speculates that there is a difference in catch bonding behavior that could be inferred because lower force occurs at larger extensions, but I do not believe this hypothesis can be fully justified and could be due to other differences in the complex.</p></disp-quote><p>R2-c. There is indeed experimental evidence that the TCR-pMHC complex operates under constant separation. The spacing between a T-cell and an antigen-presenting cell is maintained by adhesion molecules such as the CD2CD58 pair, as explained in our paper on the A6 TCR Chang-Gonzalez <italic>et al.</italic>, eLife, 2024 and also in our previous review paper Reinherz <italic>et al.</italic>, PNAS, 2023. In in vitro single-molecule experiments, pulling to a fixed separation and holding is also commonly done. We added an explanation about this in line 79â83 of the manuscript. On the other hand, force between a T cell and antigen-presenting cell is also controlled by the actin cytoskeleton, which make the applied load not a simple function of the separation between the two cells. An explanation about this was added in line 300â303. Detailed comparison between constant extension vs. constant force simulations is definitely a subject of our future study.</p><p>Regarding line 243â245 of the original submission (line 297â298 of the revised manuscript), we agree with the reviewer that without further tests, lower forces at larger extensions <italic>per se</italic> cannot be an indicator that B7 forms a weaker catch bond. But with additional information, one can see it does have relevance to the catch bond strength. In addition to fewer TCR-pMHC contacts (Figure 1C of our manuscript), the intra-TCR contacts are also reduced compared to those of A6 (bottom panel of Figure 1D vs. Chang-Gonzalez <italic>et al.</italic>, eLife, 2024, Figure 8A,B, first column). Based on these data, we calculated the average total intra-TCR contact occupancies in the 500â1000-ns interval, which was 30.4Â±0.49 (averageÂ±std) for B7 and 38.7Â±0.87 for A6. This result shows that the B7 TCR forms a looser complex with pMHC compared to A6. Also, B7<sup>low</sup> and B7<sup>high</sup> differ in extension by 16.3 Ã while A6<sup>low</sup> and A6<sup>high</sup> differ by 5.1 Ã, for similar â¼5-pN difference between low- and high-load cases. With the higher compliance of B7, it would be more difficult to achieve load-induced stabilization of the TCR-pMHC interface, hence a weaker catch bond. We explained this in line 129â132 and line 292â297.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) On a related note, the authors do not refer to or consider other works using MD to study force-stabilized interactions (e.g. for catch bonding systems), e.g. these cases where constant force is applied and enhanced sampling techniques are used to assess the impact of that applied force: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.cell.com/biophysj/fulltext/S0006-3495(23)00341-7">https://www.cell.com/biophysj/fulltext/S0006-3495(23)00341-7</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.10.10.617580v1">https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.10.10.617580v1</ext-link>.

Availability of the end-state structures permits simulation approaches such as enhanced sampling of individual states and studying the transition between the two states. In contrast, TCR does not have any structurally well-defined weak- or strong-binding states, which requires a different approach. As demonstrated in our current manuscript as well as in our previous two papers (Hwang <italic>et al.</italic>, PNAS 2020 and Chang-Gonzalez <italic>et al.</italic>, eLife, 2024), our microsecond-long simulations of the complex under realistic pN-level loads and a combination of analysis methods are effective for elucidating the catch bond mechanism of TCR. These are explained in line 227â238 of the manuscript.</p><p>The third paper (Choi, <italic>et al.</italic>, 2023) proposes a mathematical model to analyze extensive sets of data, and also perform new experiments and additional simulations. Of note, their model assumptions are based mainly on the steered MD (SMD) simulation in their previous paper (Wu, <italic>et al.</italic>, Mol. Cell. 73:1015, 2019). In their model, formation of a catch bond (called catch-slip bond in Choiâs paper) requires partial unfolding of MHC and tilting of the TCR-pMHC interface. Our mechanism does not conflict with their assumptions since the complex in the fully folded state should first bear load in a ligand-dependent manner in order to allow any larger-scale changes.

The methods and simulation protocols are essentially identical to those employed in a previous study by the same group (Chang-Gonzalez et al., eLife 2024). In the current manuscript, the authors compare the binding of the same pMHC to two different TCRs, B7 and A6 which was investigated in the previous paper. While the binding is more stable for both TCRs under load (of about 10-15 pN) than in the absence of load, the main difference is that, with the current MD sampling, B7 shows a smaller amount of stable contacts with the pMHC than A6.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The topic is interesting because of the (potential) relevance of mechanosensing in biological processes including cellular immunology.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The study is incomplete because the claims are based on a single 1000-ns simulation at each value of the load and thus some of the results might be marred by insufficient sampling, i.e., statistical error. After the first 600 ns, the higher load of B7<sup>high</sup> than B7<sup>low</sup> is due mainly to the simulation segment from about 900 ns to 1000 ns (Figure 1D). Thus, the difference in the average value of the load is within their standard deviation (9 +/- 4 pN for B7<sup>low</sup> and 14.5 +/- 7.2 for B7<sup>high</sup>, Table 1). Even more strikingly, Figure 3E shows a lack of convergence in the time series of the distance between the V-module and pMHC, particularly for B7<sup>0</sup> (left panel, yellow) and B7<sup>low</sup> (right panel, orange). More and longer simulations are required to obtain a statistically relevant sampling of the relative position and orientation of the V-module and pMHC.</p></disp-quote><p>R3-a. The reviewer uses data points during the last 100 ns to raise an issue with sampling. But since we are using realistic pN range forces, force fluctuates more slowly. In fact, in our simulation of B7<sup>high</sup>, while the force peaks near 35 pN at 500 ns (Figure 1D of our manuscript), the interfacial contacts show no noticeable changes around 500 ns (Figure 2B and Figure 2âfigure supplement 1C of our manuscript). Similarly slow fluctuation of force was also observed for A6 TCR (Figure 8 of Chang-Gonzalez <italic>et al.</italic>, eLife (2024)). Thus, a wider time window must be considered rather than focusing on forces in the last 100-ns interval.</p><p>To compare fluctuation in forces, we added Figure 1âfigure supplement 2, which is based on Appendix 3âFigure 1 of our A6 paper. It shows the standard deviation in force versus the average force during 500â1000 ns interval for various simulations in both A6 (open black circles) and B7 (red squares) systems. Except for Y8A<sup>low</sup> and dFG<sup>low</sup> of A6 (explained below), the data points lie on nearly a straight line.</p><p>Thermodynamically, the force and position of the restraint (blue spheres in Figure 1A of our manuscript) form a pair of generalized force and the corresponding spatial variable in equilibrium at temperature 300 K, which is akin to the pressure <italic>P</italic> and volume <italic>V</italic> of an ideal gas. If <italic>V</italic> is fixed, <italic>P</italic> fluctuates. Denoting the average and std of pressure as â¨<italic>P</italic>â© and â<italic>P</italic>, respectively, Burgess showed that â<italic>P/</italic>â¨<italic>P</italic>â© is a constant (Eq. 5 of Burgess, Phys. Lett. A, 44:37; 1973). In the case of the TCR<italic>Î±Î²</italic>-pMHC system, although individual atoms are not ideal gases, since their motion leads to the fluctuation in force on the restraints, the situation is analogous to the case where pressure arises from individual ideal gas molecules hitting the confining wall as the restraint. Thus, the near-linear behavior in the figure above is a consequence of the system being many-bodied and at constant temperature. The linearity is also an indicator that sampling of force was reasonable in the 500â1000-ns interval. The fact that A6 and B7 data show a common linear profile further demonstrates the consistency in our force measurement. About the two outliers of A6, Y8A<sup>low</sup> is for an antagonist peptide and dFG<sup>low</sup> is the C<italic>Î²</italic> FG-loop deletion mutant. Both cases had reduced numbers of contacts with pMHC, which likely caused a wider conformational motion, hence greater fluctuation in force.</p><p>Upon suggestion by the reviewer, we extended the simulations of B7<sup>0</sup>, B7<sup>low</sup> and B7<sup>high</sup> to about 1500 ns (Table 1). While B7<sup>0</sup> and B7<sup>low</sup> behaved similarly, B7<sup>high</sup> started to lose contacts at around 1300 ns (top panel of Figure 1D and Figure 2B). A closer inspection revealed that destabilization occurred when the complex reached low-force states. Even before 1300 ns, at about 750 ns, the force on B7<sup>high</sup> drops below 5 pN, and another drop in force occurred at around 1250 ns, though to a lesser extent (Figure 1D). These changes are followed by increase in the Hamming distance (Figure 2B). Thus, in B7<sup>high</sup>, destabilization is caused not by a high force, but by a lack of force, which is consistent with the overarching theme of our work, the load-induced stabilization of the TCR<italic>Î±Î²</italic>-pMHC complex.</p><p>The destabilization of B7<sup>high</sup> during our simulation is a combined effect of its overall weaker interface compared to A6 (despite having comparable number of contacts in crystal structures; line 265â269), and its high compliance (explained in the second paragraph of our response R2-c above). Under a fixed extension, the higher compliance of the complex can reach a low-force state where breakage of contacts can happen. In reality, with an approximately constant spacing between a T cell and an antigen-presenting cell, force is also regulated by the actin cytoskeleton (explained in the first paragraph of R2-c above). While detailed comparison between constant-extension and constant-force simulation is the subject of a future study, for this manuscript, we used the 500â1000-ns interval for calculating time-averaged quantities, for consistency across different simulations. For time-dependent behaviors, we showed the full simulation trajectories, which are Figure 1D, Figure 2B, Figure 2âfigure supplement 1 (except for panel E), and Figure 4âfigure supplement 1B.</p><p>Thus, rather than performing replicate simulations, we perform multiple simulations under different conditions and analyze them from different angles to obtain a consistent picture. If one were interested in quantitative details under a given condition, e.g., dynamics of contacts for a given extension or the time when destabilization occurs at a given force, replicate simulations would be necessary. However, our main conclusions such as load-induced stabilization of the interface through the asymmetric motion, and B7 forming a weaker complex compared to A6, can be drawn from our extensive analysis across multiple simulations. Please also note that reviewer 1 mentioned that our conclusions are âgenerally well supported by data.â</p><p>A similar argument applies to Figure 2âfigure supplement 1F (old Figure 3B that the reviewer pointed out). If precise values of the V-module to pMHC distance were needed, replicate simulations would be necessary, however, the figure demonstrates that B7<sup>high</sup> maintains more stable interface before the disruption at 1300 ns compared to B7<sup>low</sup>, which is consistent with all other measures of interfacial stability we used.

Is the overall point that it is essential for proper peptide discrimination?</p></disp-quote><p>R1-c. This is somewhat a philosophical question. Rather than recapitulating experiment, we believe the goal of simulation is to gain insight. Hence, a model should be justified by its utility rather than its direct physiological relevance. The system lacking the C-module is useful since it informs about the allosteric role of the C-module by comparing its behavior with that of the full TCR<italic>Î±Î²</italic>-pMHC complex. The increased interfacial stability of V<italic>Î±Î²</italic>-pMHC is also consistent with our discovery that the C-module likely undergoes a partial unfolding to an extended state, where the bond lifetime increases (Das, <italic>et al.</italic>, PNAS 2015; Akitsu <italic>et al.</italic>, Sci. Adv., 2024). In this sense, V<italic>Î±Î²</italic>-pMHC has a more direct physiological relevance. Furthermore, considering single-chain versions of an antibody lacking the C-module (scFv) are in widespread use (Ahmad <italic>et al.,</italic> J. Immunol. Res., 2012) including CAR T cells, a better understanding of a TCR lacking the C-module may help with developing a novel TCR-based immunotherapy. These explanations have been added in line 253â261.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Suggest changing V<italic>Î±Î²</italic>-pMHC to B7<sup>0</sup>âC to emphasize that the constant domain is deleted.</p></disp-quote><p>R1-d. While we appreciate the reviewerâs suggestion, the notation V<italic>Î±Î²</italic>-pMHC was used in our previous two papers (Hwang, PNAS 2020, Chang-Gonzalez, eLife 2024). We thus prefer to keep the existing notation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Suggest adding A6 data to table 1 for comparison, making it clear if it is from a previous paper.</p></disp-quote><p>R1-e. Table 1 of the present manuscript and Table 1 of the A6 paper differ in items displayed. Instead of merging, we added the extension and force for A6 corresponding to B7<sup>low</sup> and B7<sup>high</sup> in the caption of Table 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Suggest discussing the catch-bond behavior in terms of departure from equilibrium, e.g. is it possible to distinguish between different (catch vs slip) bond behaviors on the basis of work of separation histograms? If the difference does not show up in equilibrium work, the exponential work averages would be similar, but work histograms could be very different.</p></disp-quote><p>R1-f. Although energetics of the catch versus slip bond will provide additional insight, it is beyond the scope of the present simulations that do not involve dissociation events nor simulations of slip-bond receptors. We instead briefly mention the energetic aspect in terms of T-cell activation in line 316â319.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) Have the simulations in Figure 1 reached steady state? The force and occupancy increase almost linearly up until 500ns, then seem to decrease rather dramatically by 750ns. It might be worthwhile to extend one simulation to check.</p></disp-quote><p>R1-g. We did extend the simulation to about 1500 ns. The large and slow fluctuation in force is an inherent property of the system, as explained in R3-a above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) Is the loss of contacts for B7<sup>0</sup> due to thermalization and relaxation away from the X-ray structure?</p></disp-quote><p>R1-h. The initial thermalization at 300 K is not responsible for the loss of contacts for B7<sup>0</sup> since we applied distance restraints to the initial contacts to keep them from breaking during the preparatory runs (line 358â370). While ârelaxation away from the X-ray structureâ gives an impression that the complex approaches an equilibrium conformation in the absence of the crystallographic confinement, our simulation indicates that the stability of the complex depends on the applied load. We made the distinction between relaxation and the load-dependent stability clearer in line 233â238.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) Figure 4 contains a very large amount of data. Could it be simplified and partly moved to SI? For example, panel G is somewhat hard to read at this scale, and seems non-essential to the general reader.</p></disp-quote><p>R1-i. Upon the reviewerâs suggestion, we simplified Figure 4 by moving some of the panels to Figure 4âfigure supplement 1. Panels have also been made larger for better readability.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(8) If the coupling between C and V domains is necessary for catch-bond behavior, can one propose mutations that would disrupt the interface to test by experiment? This would be interesting in light of the authorsâ own comment on p. 8 that âa logical evolutionary pressure would be for the C domains to maximize discriminatory power by adding instability to the TCR chassis,â which might lead to a verifiable hypothesis.</p></disp-quote><p>R1-j. This has already been computationally and experimentally tested for other TCRs by the C<italic>Î²</italic> FG-loop deletion mutants that diminish the catch bond (Das, <italic>et al.</italic>, PNAS 2015; Hwang <italic>et al.</italic>, PNAS 2020; ChangGonzalez <italic>et al.</italic>, eLife, 2024). Furthermore, the V<italic>Î³Î´</italic>-C<italic>Î±Î²</italic> chimera where the C-module of TCR<italic>Î³Î´</italic> is replaced by that of TCR_Î±Î²_ that strengthens the V-C coupling achieved a gain-of-function catch bond character while the wild-type TCR<italic>Î³Î´</italic> is a slip-bond receptor (Mallis, <italic>et al.</italic>, PNAS 2021; Bettencourt <italic>et al.</italic>, Biophys. J. 2024). We added our prediction that the FG-loop deletion mutants of B7 TCR will behave similarly in line 261â264.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(9) Regarding extending TCR and MHC termini using native sequences, as described in the methods, what would be the disadvantage of using the same sequence, which could be made much more rigid, e.g. a poly-Pro sequence? After all, the point seems to be applying a roughly constant force, but flexible/disordered linkers seem likely to increase force fluctuation.</p></disp-quote><p>R1-k. The purpose of adding linkers was to allow a certain degree of longitudinal and transverse motion as would occur in vivo. While it will be worthwhile to explore the effects of linker flexibility on the conformational dynamics of the complex, for the present study, we used the actual sequence for the linkers for those proteins (line 341â344).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>(1) Figure 2 is almost illegible, especially Figure 2A-D. I do not think that these contacts vs time would be useful to anyone except for someone interested in this particular pMHC interaction, so I would suggest moving it to a supporting figure and making it much larger.</p></disp-quote><p>R2-e. Thanks for the suggestion. We created Figure 2âfigure supplement 1 and made panels larger for clearer presentation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Figure 4 is overwhelming, and does not convey any particular message.</p></disp-quote><p>R2-f.

Please see our response R1-i.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>(1) The label âbeta2mâ in Figure 1A should be moved closer to the beta2 microglobulin domain. A label TCR should be added to Figure 1A.</p></disp-quote><p>R3-c. Thanks for pointing out about <italic>Î²</italic>2m. We have corrected it. About putting the label âTCR,â to avoid cluttering, we explained that V<italic>Î±</italic>, V<italic>Î²</italic>, C<italic>Î±</italic>, and C<italic>Î²</italic> are the 4 subdomains of TCR in the caption of Figure 1A.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Hydrogen atoms should be removed from the peptide in Figure 1B.</p></disp-quote><p>R3-d. We have removed the hydrogen atoms.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) The authors should consider moving Figures 1 A-D to the SI and show a simpler description of the contact occupancy than the heat maps. The legend of Figure 2A-D is too small.</p></disp-quote><p>R3-e. By âFigures 1 A-Dâ we believe the reviewer meant Figure 2AâD. This is the same comment as reviewer 2âs comment (1). Please see our response R2-e above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Vertical (dashed) lines should be added to Figure 3E at 500 ns to emphasize the segment of the time series used for the histograms.</p></disp-quote><p>R3-f.
