Such a temporary and spatially confined site is required to render host cells compatible with the intracellular progression of rhizobia. Although it has been suggested that early infection events might involve a pre-mitotic cell-cycle arrest, this process has not been dissected with cellular resolution. Here, we show that a dual-color <italic>Medicago</italic> histone reporter robustly identifies cells with different mitotic or endoreduplication activities in the root cortex. By imaging deep root tissues, we found that a confined trajectory of cortical cells that are transcellularly passed by infection threads is in a stage of the cell cycle that is distinct from directly adjacent cells. Distinctive features of infected cells include nuclear widening and large-scale chromatin rearrangements consistent with a cell-cycle exit prior to differentiation. Using a combination of fluorescent reporters demarcating cell-cycle phase progression, we confirmed that a reduced proliferation potential and modulating the G2/M transition, a process possibly controlled by the NF-YA1 transcription factor, mark the success of rhizobial delivery to nodule cells.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cell

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cell-cycle regulation is a key pathway to maintain beneficial and sustainable symbiotic associations that are of primary importance in both marine and terrestrial ecosystems. One common theme to stabilize facultative associations is to achieve a mutual control of cell proliferation and differentiation dynamics in both the host and the symbionts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kondorosi and Kondorosi, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Russo and Genre, 2021</xref>). Prime examples are flowering plants from a single phylogenetic clade, comprising four orders (Fabales, Fagales, Cucurbitales, Rosales) with legumes being the most prominent ones, that evolved the unique ability to accommodate soil-borne rhizobia intracellularly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Parniske, 2018</xref>). Within this symbiosis, rhizobia fix atmospheric nitrogen and deliver ammonium to the host in exchange for plant photosynthates. The conversion of atmospheric dinitrogen into a usable form is highly energy-demanding and requires a low-oxygen environment, which is provided within nodules, specialized lateral organs formed on the roots that are densely populated by rhizobia. A widely adopted mechanism to access the developing nodule cells is the formation of cortical infection threads, transcellular conduits formed upon the invagination of the host plasma membrane and hijacking the cellular machinery of infected root cortical cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Timmers et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Su et al., 2023</xref>). Although the molecular and cellular understanding of the infection mechanisms is expanding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Tsyganova et al., 2021</xref>), our knowledge on how exactly these processes are interconnected with the control of cell-cycle progression in cells hosting intracellular infection threads has remained fragmentary.</p><p>Plants engaging in arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) or root nodule symbioses (RNS) have recruited a common range of cell-cycle processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Foucher and Kondorosi, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Russo and Genre, 2021</xref>). In <italic>Medicago truncatula</italic> (<italic>M.t</italic>.; hereafter, Medicago), the perception of and colonization by the AM fungus result in occasional cell divisions in the inner cortical layers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Russo et al., 2019</xref>) and in diffuse endoreduplication events as intraradical hyphae spread throughout the root cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carotenuto et al., 2019a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carotenuto et al., 2019b</xref>). During RNS, the perception of rhizobia results in the onset of a signaling cascade that triggers an outward gradient of cell-cycle reactivation and cell divisions. Although this is initiated in the pericycle, cell-cycle reactivation occurs throughout the inner cortical (C) layers C5, C4, and the middle C3 layer in Medicago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Timmers et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Xiao et al., 2014</xref>). The successful establishment of RNS further involves the tight coordination of the infection and organogenesis programmes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Guan et al., 2013</xref>). It requires the progression of cortical infection threads through the C3 layer prior to subsequent periclinal divisions that produce a persistent nodule meristem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Xiao et al., 2014</xref>). The resulting indeterminate nodules will later form well-defined developmental zones, with actively dividing meristematic cells giving rise to post-meristematic, differentiating central tissues of increasing ploidy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Vinardell et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Nagymihály et al., 2017</xref>). While those cells can be intracellularly colonized, the infection competence of nodule-like structures as being induced by exogenous application of cytokinin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gauthier-Coles et al., 2019</xref>), constitutive activation of common symbiotic components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Gleason et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Singh et al., 2014</xref>) or the expression of meristematic factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dong et al., 2021</xref>) may be massively reduced in many of these spontaneous nodules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hayashi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Liu et al., 2022</xref>). The lack of infectibility cannot be overcome even when applying bacterial strains which enter plant cells from the intercellular space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Liang et al., 2019</xref>). This clearly demonstrates the ultimate requirement of cells being in a so far uncharacterized state of infection competence.</p><p>Transcriptome profiling of Medicago root hairs, treated with rhizobial Nod factors or undergoing rhizobial colonization, uncovered changes in several cell-cycle-related genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Breakspear et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Liu et al., 2019a</xref>). This perception of Nod factors results in the increased transcription of D-type cyclins, genes known to respond to extrinsic signals and to promote cell-cycle progression from the first GAP (G1) phase to the DNA-synthesis (S) phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dewitte et al., 2003</xref>). Subsequently, the initiation of infection threads coincides with the highest expression of genes required for DNA replication, modification, and repair, strongly suggesting that the epidermal infection programme involves cell cycle re-entry and progression to a post-replicative phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Breakspear et al., 2014</xref>). A repression of the endocycle was further proposed to occur since infected root hairs accumulate transcripts of the <italic>OSD1/UVI4</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Breakspear et al., 2014</xref>), whose activity prevents an unscheduled increase in ploidy by inhibiting the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Iwata et al., 2011</xref>). However, much less is known about the transcriptional signature of infected cells along the cortical trajectory of transcellularly progressing infection threads. Such ability to guide rhizobia <italic>via</italic> cortical infection threads is yet thought to be an important innovation since it has been evolutionary maintained in the vast majority of nodulating species as it, most likely, maximizes the host control over bacterial delivery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Parniske, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cathebras et al., 2022</xref> – pre-print).</p><p>A central regulator for controlling infection and organogenesis is the transcription factor <italic>Nodule Inception</italic> (<italic>NIN</italic>). Co-opted from nitrate response circuits, NIN acts as a master coordinator of infection, nodule organogenesis, and nodule number (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Marsh et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Fournier et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Soyano et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cathebras et al., 2022</xref> – pre-print). It promotes the expression of several growth targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Liu et al., 2019a</xref>) including <italic>NF-YA1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Soyano et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Feng et al., 2021</xref>), a subunit of the conserved heterotrimeric Nuclear Factor-Y (NF-Y) transcription factor. A-, B-, and C-type subunits of the NF-Y complex act as specialized modules, interacting with other transcription factors and recruiting chromatin remodeling enzymes to adjust cell specification to environmental or developmental needs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Zanetti et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Myers and Holt, 2018</xref>). In vertebrates, the CCAAT-binding NF-Y transcription factor targets genes involved in all major activities executed in G2 and mitosis (M; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Linhart et al., 2005</xref>) and is an important regulator of the G2/M transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Manni et al., 2001</xref>). In legumes, the rhizobium-induced NF-YA1 subunit functions in cortical infection thread progression, in the establishment and maintenance of the nodule meristem and in the early differentiation of nodule cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Combier et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Laporte et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Xiao et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hossain et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lee et al., 2024</xref>). Yet, whether the Medicago NF-YA1 protein regulates the G2/M transition is not known.</p><p>The hypothesis that intracellular infection at least partially relies on cell-cycle control is further supported by structural rearrangements in cortical cells anticipating transcellular infection thread progression. These include the formation of pre-infection threads (PITs), which are transvacuolar, cytoplasmic bridges comparable to those occurring in pre-mitotic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">van Brussel et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Timmers et al., 1999</xref>). In situ detection of marker transcripts revealed that outer cortical cells recruit histone H4 used during DNA replication but do not express a B-type, mitotic cyclin gene – implying that activated target cells stop in the G2 phase of the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Yang et al., 1994</xref>). G2-phase cell-cycle arrests have been repeatedly described in eukaryotic cells as appropriate gates for executing cell fate and patterning decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Meserve and Duronio, 2017</xref>), for wound healing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cosolo et al., 2019</xref>) or for host infection during pathogenic and biotrophic interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Wildermuth et al., 2017</xref>). Modulating the G2/M transition combines well-described transcriptional and post-translational mechanisms, leading to the repression of genes necessary to execute cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Berckmans and De Veylder, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kobayashi et al., 2015</xref>), controlling the activity of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK) and the stability of transcriptional repressors and mitotic inducers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kondorosi and Kondorosi, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2017</xref>).

We demonstrate that the first generation of Medicago cells successfully internalizing rhizobia shows unique features, including a marked decrease in their histone H3.1 content and a reduced competence for both cell division and chromosome segregation. We also show that tetraploid (4n) cells reaching an 8C DNA content are optimal for infection by rhizobia. Our results strongly suggest that, upon transcellular infection thread passage, cortical cells undergo a last GAP phase after DNA replication and exit to differentiation. Furthermore, we present the first evidence that the symbiosis-induced NF-YA1 subunit, by controlling mitotic entry in a heterologous system and ectopically in transgenic Medicago roots, holds potential to contribute to this process.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A reduced proliferative potential typifies cells supporting cortical infection thread progression</title><p>In <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> (<italic>A.t</italic>.; hereafter, <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>), the incorporation and eviction dynamics of histone H3 variants have been used to identify cells with different cell division and reprogramming potentials, during organ patterning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Otero et al., 2016</xref>) or when acquiring reproductive competence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hernandez-Lagana and Autran, 2020</xref>).

By contrast, host cells sustaining cortical infection thread progression in the middle and inner cortex (C3 and C4) up to the first recipient cells in the nodule primordium (C4/5-derived; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) exhibited enlarged nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) with a significantly decreased histone H3.1 content compared to their direct neighboring cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).

Although the last infected cortical cells showed significant nuclear enlargement in all three genetic backgrounds investigated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), failure to coordinate organogenesis and infection programs in the mutants resulted in an increased occurrence of infected cells accumulating more H3.1 than their direct neighbors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Together, these data reveal that an appropriate attenuation in cell-cycle activity and associated chromatin changes in infected cells preferentially occur when progressing cortical infections and the formation of a nodule primordium are temporarily fully aligned.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Cortical cells supporting transcellular infection control their commitment to cell division</title><p>In Medicago and other plants producing indeterminate nodules, a local control of mitotic activity could be especially important for rhizobia to timely cross the middle cortex, where sustained cellular proliferation gives rise to the nodule meristem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Xiao et al., 2014</xref>). To investigate in greater detail whether cells competent for transcellular infection are selectively kept away from transiting to mitosis, we first used a triple fluorescent sensor enabling us to track all cell-cycle phases in planta. Originally developed for <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, the plant cell-cycle indicator (PlaCCI) combines a component of the pre-replication complex (CDT1a), the replicative histone variant (H3.1) and the N-terminal domain of a B-type cyclin (N-CYCB1;1) as G1-, S- and late G2-phase reporters, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Desvoyes et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Echevarría et al., 2021</xref>). The N-terminal domain of CYCB1;1 contains a destruction box (D-box) ensuring a rapid turnover of the protein after one mitotic cell cycle. These cell-cycle markers are expressed at early stages of organ development but disappear in terminally differentiated cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Desvoyes et al., 2020</xref>). When expressing the PlaCCI construct in transgenic Medicago roots, all three markers were successfully visualized in reactivated cortical cells upon nodule primordium formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B–C</xref>). Cortical cells passed by an infection thread kept low but detectable amounts of the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> H3.1 variant, indicating that they transited through S-phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). However, these cells stopped before accumulating substantial levels of N-CYCB1;1, in contrast to their direct neighbors. We also confirmed latter observations by using an <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> CYCB1;2-based fluorescent reporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), labeling only cells that transit through G2/M (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Weimer et al., 2016</xref>). Based on these results and to adapt the PlaCCI reporter system to the study of legume-rhizobia interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Nadzieja et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Echevarría et al., 2021</xref>), we designed an alternative version of the PlaCCI sensor (named PlaCCI v2) that includes the histone H3.1 variant from Medicago, functioning as a robust reporter of G2-arrested cells in composite plants. Observed in early nodule primordia, the PlaCCI v2 sensor enabled us to verify that the cells involved in transcellular infection presumably undergo a prolonged GAP phase without accumulating the B1;2 mitotic cyclin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A–C</xref>). Together, these results confirmed a selective decrease in mitotic competence occurring on the cortical infection thread trajectory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Yang et al., 1994</xref>) as rhizobia pass the middle cortical layer (C3) to access colonizable cells in Medicago roots.

Using the pKNOLLE::NLS-3xVenus construct, we found that the activation of the <italic>KNOLLE</italic> promoter was lower on the cortical infection thread trajectory in comparison to neighboring, proliferating cells from nodule primordia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). An equivalent construct, ensuring the timely elimination of fluorescent reporters after one canonical cell cycle (pKNOLLE::D-box-3xVenus-NLS; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>), corroborated a selective control of the G2/M transition in cells undergoing transcellular infection. Combining our observations of enlarged nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), the absence of a G1 marker, and the reduced H3.1 levels and expression of mitotic genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4B–D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–B</xref>), we conclude that the initial cortical cells along the infection thread trajectory conduct a single cell-cycle round and stay in a post-replicative (i.e. G2) phase as long as they are crossed.</p><p>We further took advantage of the fact that the PlaCCI sensor provides a full view on cell-cycle phase progression in root tissues, in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Desvoyes et al., 2020</xref>) and Medicago (this study). CDT1a- and CYCB1;1-associated signals in the root tip enabled us to identify 2C (i.e. G1) and 4C (i.e. G2) nuclei, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3A</xref>) – where 2C and 4C chromatin values correspond to the DNA content of a basic diploid genome. Measuring the area of nuclei exhibiting the CYCB1;1-YFP signal in cortical layers of the root apical meristem (root tip) or the nodule primordium revealed that they were on average 1.57 or 1.63 times larger than the ones producing CDT1a-eCFP, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3B</xref>). This is in agreement with an increased DNA content as cells transit from the G1- to the late G2-phase. Surprisingly, proliferating nodule cells contained significantly wider nuclei than their diploid counterparts in the proliferation zone of the root apical meristem (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3B</xref>), suggesting a higher ploidy level early on. These results lead to the intriguing possibility that reactivated inner cortical cells in Medicago enter the mitotic cell cycle with an increased amount of genetic material.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Proliferation of endopolyploid cortical cells is a distinctive feature of Medicago root nodules</title><p>Our data suggest that the dividing cortical cells contributing to nodule primordium formation are polyploid – that is they contain more than the two genome copies of a diploid (2n) cell, where ‘n’ refers to the number of separate chromosomes.

By contrast, endocycling cells undergo repeated rounds of DNA synthesis without segregating the newly replicated parts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Edgar et al., 2014</xref>). Here, copied chromosome arms do not condense and spatial separation of sister kinetochores does not occur, so that the number of compact CENH3 signals corresponds to the initial number of chromosomes (up to 8C; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Lermontova et al., 2006</xref>). As the occurrence of endocycling cells has been previously reported in tissues infected by AM fungi, we first tested the CENH3-reporter in roots inoculated with <italic>Rhizophagus irregularis</italic>. Indeed, cortical cells entered by the fungus displayed large nuclei with no more than 16 labeled foci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2B</xref>), supporting their endocycling nature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carotenuto et al., 2019a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Lermontova et al., 2006</xref>). Up to 16 CENH3 foci were also observed in diploid cortical cells from the root tip and pericycle cells from lateral root primordia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2C</xref>). However, the majority of nodule cells exhibited between 26 and 32 fluorescent centromeric foci (75.5% in nodule primordia from stage IV to VI, n = 106; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2B–C</xref>) and a visibly increased number of mitotic chromosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2B</xref>). These observations strongly support previously published data proposing that proliferating cortical cells giving rise to indeterminate root nodules are tetraploid (4n = 32 in <italic>Medicago truncatula</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Torrey and Barrios, 1969</xref>).</p><p>We next tested whether endopolyploid cells are already present at an earlier stage of nodule development, where cell division events are confined to the pericycle, the inner cortical cells (C4, C5) and occasionally occur in the third (C3) and second (C2) cortical layers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Xiao et al., 2014</xref>).

For this, we made use of the pre-mitotic loading characteristics of CENH3 to the centromeres, which mainly occurs during the G2 phase and prior to the spatial separation of sister kinetochores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Lermontova et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Lermontova et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Lermontova et al., 2006</xref>). In proliferating populations of the root tip (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A–B</xref>) and nodule primordia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A–B</xref>), late G2 cells contained large nuclei where the majority of sister kinetochores was split and appeared as twin foci. We further noticed that centromere separation in Medicago is a gradual rather than a simultaneous process, as root tip cells with comparable nuclear areas often exhibited an intermediate number of fluorescent doublets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A</xref>) of similar appearance and length on a single focal plane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B–D</xref>). To address the question to which extent cortical cells that are competent for infection can commit to nuclear division, we assessed the gradual formation of sister centromeres. Although the nuclear size of infected C3 cells suggested an 8C DNA content, as found in late G2-phase cells of the nodule tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B and C</xref>), none of these infected cells showed the typical CENH3 twin foci formed when sister kinetochores split (n = 13; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B and D</xref>). Such control over mitotic commitment was tightly maintained in the majority of infected, C4/5-derived cells (75.5%; n = 53; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>) which did not display any visible sign of centromere separation across image stacks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>), despite a presumably duplicated genomic DNA content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). A smaller proportion of the recently infected cells (20.7%) partially prepared for chromosome segregation and showed up to three fluorescent doublets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>) of comparable lengths to those measured in G2-phase progressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>), whereas only two cells (3.8%) with internalized bacteria got closer to nuclear and likely to cell division (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B and D</xref>). Together, by combining several marker strategies based on histone H3 dynamics and on bona fide mitotic reporters, we conclude that most middle (C3) and inner (C4/5-derived) cortical cells competent for intracellular infection enter a post-replicative, G2-type phase without proceeding toward M-phase. Endopolyploid cortical cells hosting infection threads have presumably gained the ability to execute a differentiation program rather than entering cell division at the end of G2.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Primary infected nodule primordium cells do not reach full competence for chromosome segregation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of CENH3 deposition at centromeres (blue dots) throughout the different pre-mitotic (G1, S, G2<sup>early</sup>, and G2<sup>late</sup>) cell-cycle phases in plants.

Prominent candidates are NF-YA1 proteins that were evolutionary recruited to RNS, where they sustain both organogenesis and intracellular infection in a range of nodulating legume and non-legume species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Combier et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Laporte et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Xiao et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hossain et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bu et al., 2020</xref>). NF-YA1 plays an unambiguous role as a positive regulator of cell divisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Soyano et al., 2013</xref>) but was also recently shown to function in the early differentiation and specification of nodule cells in Medicago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lee et al., 2024</xref>). This prompted us to assess whether NF-YA1 could act as a switch at mitotic entry. To test this, we used WT NF-YA1 and a mutated variant lacking a functional DNA-binding domain (mutDBD) as eGFP fusion proteins. As expected, both variants localized to the nucleus when being expressed in <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> leaf epidermal cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Laloum et al., 2014</xref>).

As these re-activated cells commit to mitosis and perform cytokinesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>), they also enable the activation of promoters containing MSA cis-elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Xu et al., 2020</xref>) as found in the Medicago <italic>KNOLLE</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>). We confirmed this by expressing eGFP-KNOLLE from its endogenous promoter in the absence and presence of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> CYCD3;1. The KNOLLE fusion protein was only detected when being co-expressed with CYCD3;1 using immunoblot analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1A</xref>) and labeled newly formed cell-division planes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1B</xref>). This is consistent with previous reports showing that the syntaxin KNOLLE accumulates only in dividing cells.

Consequently, and to avoid potential developmental side effects by constitutively and ectopically overexpressing <italic>NF-YA1</italic>, we first checked the cellular activation profile of two symbiosis-specific genes recruited during infection thread formation and growth, <italic>ENOD11</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Journet et al., 2001</xref>) and <italic>NPL</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Xie et al., 2012</xref>). Their respective promoter sequences were previously employed to successfully drive the production of fusion proteins in roots of WT Medicago composite plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Su et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lace et al., 2023</xref>). Weakly active in the pericycle and the vascular cylinder of non-inoculated roots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1A</xref>), the transcription of the two reporter constructs (pNPL::NLS:3xVenus / pENOD11::NLS:2xmCherry) was strongly increased upon colonization of the root cortex, with cells hosting infection threads showing the highest activity. Expression driven from the <italic>NPL</italic> and <italic>ENOD11</italic> promoters gradually decreased in cells neighboring and underlying the infection site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1B</xref>) but remained high along the trajectory of infected cortical cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1C</xref>).</p><p>For the next set of experiments, we selected the <italic>ENOD11</italic> promoter sequence to locally increase NF-YA1 levels in WT roots <italic>via</italic> the symbiotically induced expression of a non-fluorescently tagged version (pENOD11::FLAG-NF-YA1 or hereafter, pENOD11::NF-YA1). Limited to the area close to infection, additional <italic>NF-YA1</italic> expression led to a modest but significant reduction in the number of nodule primordia formed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s2">Figure 9—figure supplement 2A</xref>) without impacting nodule colonization, with 93% of the primordia being infected in both the control condition and upon ectopic <italic>NF-YA1</italic> expression (n = 334 and 216, respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s2">Figure 9—figure supplement 2B–C</xref>). To assess the influence of <italic>NF-YA1</italic> overexpression at the cellular level, we coupled the pENOD11::NF-YA1 construct to the <italic>KNOLLE</italic> G2/M transcriptional reporter (pKNOLLE::D-box-3xVenus-NLS; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s3">Figure 9—figure supplement 3A–B</xref>). As previously observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>), this destabilized nuclear reporter functions as a robust readout of a cell’s competence to be crossed by an infection thread (low reporter signal) or to commit to cell division (high reporter signal) in Medicago roots. In this context, we sought to determine whether more cells become competent to host infection threads and whether NF-YA1 also regulates cell division activity when accumulated in the outer cortex.</p><p>A significant nuclear enlargement was observed in crossed cortical cells of both control roots and those additionally expressing <italic>NF-YA1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s4">Figure 9—figure supplement 4A–B</xref>), implying that elevated levels of NF-YA1 did not prevent infected cells from proceeding through DNA replication. The local increase in <italic>NF-YA1</italic> expression also did not alter the typical expression profile of the transcriptional <italic>KNOLLE</italic> reporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s4">Figure 9—figure supplement 4C</xref>). Although overall reduced compared to control roots, the nuclear levels of triple-Venus fluorescence were kept low in infected cells and gradually increased in the vicinity of an infection site and within nodule primordia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s4">Figure 9—figure supplement 4D</xref>) in transgenic roots ectopically expressing <italic>NF-YA1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s3">Figure 9—figure supplement 3A–B</xref>). Competence for transcellular infection, defined here as a pre-mitotic arrest of the cell cycle, therefore appears to be maintained in the context of local <italic>NF-YA1</italic> overexpression. The latter leads to a slight (non-significant) increase in the number of infected cells per cortical layer: in almost 9% of the examined layers (C1 to C3, n=70), at least three cells hosted an infection thread upon ectopic <italic>NF-YA1</italic> expression, while this was observed only once in C3 (i.e. 3% of the examined cortical layers; n = 32) in control roots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s4">Figure 9—figure supplement 4E–G</xref>). Regarding cell division activity, local overexpression of <italic>NF-YA1</italic> did not influence the proportion of adjacent cells dividing in the vicinity of infected cells (about 33% in each of the transgenic backgrounds; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s5">Figure 9—figure supplement 5A–B</xref>). By contrast, we observed a greater proportion of split cells on the trajectory of the cortical infection thread: 35% of infected cells (n=40) divided anticlinally in the outer cortex when <italic>NF-YA1</italic> expression was locally increased compared to only 12.5% (n=16) in control condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A–B</xref>). This supports the idea that, when accumulated in a symbiotic context, NF-YA1 may facilitate the division of endoreduplicated cortical cells in anticipation of infection. Conversely, increased levels of NF-YA1 presumably repress the transition to mitosis within cells undergoing infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s4">Figure 9—figure supplement 4D</xref>) and appear to also influence the general structure of infection threads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C–E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s3">Figure 9—figure supplement 3B</xref>). Ectopic expression of <italic>NF-YA1</italic> led to a higher proportion of cells forming supernumerary infection thread branches, with 37.5% of infected cells showing at least two additional branches outside the main infection thread (n=96) compared to 20% in control condition (n=50; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9E</xref>).

According to loss- and gain-of-function studies, adequate levels of NF-YA1 appear indeed essential to generate a pool of enlarged (likely endoreduplicated) cells, deriving from a functional meristem in Medicago nodules and competent to host nitrogen-fixing bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Combier et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Xiao et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hossain et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Schiessl et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lee et al., 2024</xref>). Interestingly, <italic>CYCD3;1</italic> and other genes positively regulating the progression of cells through G2 and mitosis are directly controlled by a key regulator of nodule identity, light-sensitive short hypocotyl1 (LSH1; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lee et al., 2024</xref>). It was proposed that LSH1/LSH2 transcription factors foster the proliferation of cortical cells that support bacterial colonization in part <italic>via</italic> promoting <italic>NF-YA1</italic> expression in the newly divided cells associated with the specification of the nodule primordium. At an earlier stage of infection, forcing the expression of Medicago <italic>NF-YA1</italic> in the outer cortex revealed its dual role in promoting cell division and intracellular infection competence on the trajectory to the nodule cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A–E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s4">Figure 9—figure supplement 4A–G</xref>). Although the effects we observed are subtle, they might be explained by the ability of NF-YA1 to modulate the G2/M transition. A couple of recent studies in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> demonstrate that meristematic regulators from the GRAS and AP2 transcription factor families drive cell proliferation while enabling the local accumulation of CDK inhibitors, thereby controlling the duration of G1- and G2 phases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Nomoto et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Echevarria et al., 2022</xref> – pre-print). Whether LSHs and/or NF-YA subunits work similarly, and whether genes responsible for structuring the infection thread are part of the NF-YA1 regulon are exciting possibilities that remain to be explored.</p><p>In summary, we propose that local control of cell-cycle activity and a cell-cycle exit decision along the infection thread trajectory provide a window of cellular competence for cortical infections to progress down to the nodule primordium niche in Medicago. We demonstrated that the cell division and differentiation potentials are controlled in a spatially confined cell file in the root cortex. We also showed that post-replicative, tetraploid cells reaching an 8C DNA content are optimal for intracellular infection. Consequently, it is tempting to hypothesize that exactly these cells comprise a highly specific transcriptional and regulatory landscape that ultimately defines the molecular susceptibility state for intracellular infection competence.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Gene (<italic>Medicago truncatula</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>H3.1</italic></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>M. truncatula</italic> A17 r5.0 genome portal</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">MtrunA17_Chr8g0383781</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">v5.1.9</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Gene (<italic>M. truncatula</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>H3.3</italic></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>M. truncatula</italic> A17 r5.0 genome portal</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">MtrunA17_Chr4g0054161</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">v5.1.9</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Gene (<italic>M. truncatula</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>CENH3</italic></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>M. truncatula</italic> A17 r5.0 genome portal</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">MtrunA17_Chr8g0347231</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">v5.1.9</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Gene (<italic>M. truncatula</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>KNOLLE</italic></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>M. truncatula</italic> A17 r5.0 genome portal</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">MtrunA17_Chr5g0398891</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">v5.1.9</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>M. truncatula</italic> cultivar Jemalong A17)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Medicago; WT</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Heritage Seeds Pty.

All quantitative measurements were performed on single focal planes and single channels from unprocessed z-stacks, acquired from fully transformed Medicago roots. The Fire lookup table (LUT) was applied to facilitate the visualization of low-intensity pixels. Nuclear areas were measured at the equatorial plane using the freehand selection tool, on channels displaying the signal from nuclear (<italic>i.e</italic>., NLS-2xmCherry) or chromatin-associated proteins (i.e. H3.1- or H3.3-FP fusions). H3.1-eGFP levels were quantified in the nucleus of infected cells (IC) and of directly adjacent, neighboring cells (NC) present on the same z-stack in the same cortical layer. For this, an outline was manually drawn around each nucleus at the equatorial plane and area, integrated density, and mean gray values were measured. Three oval selections were drawn adjacent to all measured nuclei to be used for normalization against background fluorescence. The corrected total nuclear fluorescence (CTNF)=integrated density – (area of selected nucleus ×mean fluorescence of background readings) was calculated according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">McCloy et al., 2014</xref> using Microsoft Excel.

After 10 min of incubation at 37 °C in the dark, the fluorescence emitted by GUS-mediated hydrolysis of 4 MUG into 4-Methylumbelliferone (4-MU) was measured using a microplate reader (POLARstar Omega, BMG LABTECH, Ortenberg, Germany). Fluorescence was recorded at 360 nm excitation and 460 nm emission filter (gain 500, 20 flashes per well) every 5 min over a time period of 130–180 min.

This study provides exciting new insights as it represents a comprehensive description of the cell cycle progression during early stages of nodulation using fluorescence markers.</p><p>To briefly summarize, the authors first monitor H3.1 / H3.3 replacement to distinguish between replicating (S phase) and non-replicating cells to show that M. truncatula cortex cells along the bacterial infection thread are non-replicating (while neighbors enter the S phase). Nuclear size measurements revealed that these non-replicative cells are in the post-replicative stage (G2) rather than in the pre-replicative G1 phase, which the authors confirm with the Plant Cell Cycle Indicator (PlaCCI) fluorescent marker to track cell cycle progression in more detail. Cortex cells in the trajectory of the infection thread did not accumulate the late G2 marker of the PlaCCI nor the G2/M marker KNOLLE, indicating that these cells indeed remain in G2. Because nuclear size measurements indicated that infected cells are polyploid, the authors used the centromere histone marker CENH3 to determine chromosome number. They find that cortex cells giving rise to the nodule primordium are endomitotic and tetraploid, probably because their cell cycle is halted at centromere separation. Although not a focus of this manuscript, the authors also use their fluorescent tools to track cell cycle progression during arbuscular mycorrhiza symbiosis. They confirm that infected cells transition from a replicating to a non-replicating state (H3.1 to H3.3) with progressing development of the arbuscules. In addition, the CENH3 marker confirms previous findings that cortex cells infected by fungi are endocycling (i.e., DNA synthesis without segregation of replicated parts). This represents an important confirmation of previous findings and contrasts with the situation during nodulation symbiosis, where chromosomes separate after replication.</p><p>In general, all microscopy images are of very high quality and support the authors' conclusions. While individually each set of fluorescent markers has its limitations, combined they constitute a powerful tool to track various stages of cell cycle progression in individual root cells during symbiosis. Overall, this is a very strong manuscript that comprehensively elucidates root cell cycle changes during microbial infection.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.88588.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Cell cycle control during nitrogen-fixing symbiosis is an important topic, but our understanding of the process is poor and lacks resolution, as the nodule is a complex organ with many cell types that undergo profound changes. The authors aim to define the cell cycle state of individual plant cells in the emerging nodule primordium, as a transcellular infection thread passes through the meristem to reach cells deep in the incipient nodule and releases bacteria to form symbiosomes. The authors used a number of cell cycle reporters, such as different Histone 3 variants and cyclins, to follow cell cycle progress in exquisite detail. They showed that the host cells in the path of an infection thread exhibit a cell fate distinct from their immediate neighbors: after entering the S phase similar to their neighbors, these cells exit the cell cycle and enter a special differentiated state. This is likely an important shift that allows the proper passage of the infection thread. Although definitive proof needs more investigation, they showed that a pioneering transcription factor, NF-YA1, likely represses these endoreduplicated cells from completing the cell cycle.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.88588.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Batzenschlager</surname><given-names>Morgane</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Freiburg</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Freiburg</named-content></addr-line><country>Germany</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Lace</surname><given-names>Beatrice</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Freiburg</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Freiburg</named-content></addr-line><country>Germany</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Ning</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>State Key Laboratory of Wheat Improvement</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Shandong</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Su</surname><given-names>Chao</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Wuhan</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Boiger</surname><given-names>Anna</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Freiburg</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Freiburg</named-content></addr-line><country>Germany</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Egli</surname><given-names>Sabrina</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Heinrich-Heine-University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Düsseldorf</named-content></addr-line><country>Germany</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Krohn</surname><given-names>Pascal</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Max Planck Institute for Breeding Research</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Cologne</named-content></addr-line><country>Germany</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Salfeld</surname><given-names>Jule</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Freiburg</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Freiburg</named-content></addr-line><country>Germany</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Ditengou</surname><given-names>Franck Anicet</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Freiburg</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Freiburg</named-content></addr-line><country>Germany</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Laux</surname><given-names>Thomas</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Freiburg</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Freiburg</named-content></addr-line><country>Germany</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Ott</surname><given-names>Thomas</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Freiburg</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Freiburg</named-content></addr-line><country>Germany</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>(…) In my view, the part about NF-YA1 is less strong - although I realize this is a compelling candidate to be a regulator of cell cycle progression, the experimental approaches used to address this question falls a bit short, in particular, compared to the very detailed approaches shown in the rest of the manuscript. The authors show that the transcription factor NF-YA1 regulates cell division in tobacco leaves; however, there is no experimental validation in the experimental system (nodules). All conclusions are based on a heterologous cell division system in tobacco leaves. The authors state that NF-YA1 has a nodule-specific role as a regulator of cell differentiation. I am concerned the tobacco system may not allow for adequate testing of this hypothesis.</p></disp-quote><p>Reviewer #1 makes a valid point by asking to focus the manuscript more explicitly on the role of NF-YA1 as a differentiation factor in a symbiotic context. We have now addressed this formally and experimentally.</p><p>The involvement of A-type NF-Y subunits in the transition to the early differentiation of nodule cells has been documented in model legumes through several publications that we refer to in the revised version of the discussion (lines 617/623). We fully agree that the CDEL system, because it is heterologous, does not allow us more than to propose a parallel explanation for these observations - i.e_._, that the Medicago NF-YA1 subunit presumably acts in post-replicative cell-cycle regulation at the G2/M transition. Considering your recommendations and those of reviewer #2, we sought to support this conclusion by testing the impact of localized over-expression of <italic>NF-YA1</italic> on cortical cell division and infection competence at an early stage of root colonization. The results of these experiments are now presented in the new Figure 9 and Figure 9-figure supplement 1-5 and described from line 435 to 495.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>With the fluorescent tools the authors have at hand (in particular tools to detect G2/M transition, which the authors suggest is regulated by NF-YA1), it would be interesting to test what happens to cell division if NF-YA1 is over-expressed in Medicago roots?</p></disp-quote><p>To limit pleiotropic effects of an ectopic over-expression, we used the symbiosis-induced, <italic>ENOD11</italic> promoter to increase <italic>NF-YA1</italic> expression levels more specifically along the trajectory of infected cells. We chose to remain in continuity with the experiments performed in the CDEL system by opting for a destabilized version of the <italic>KNOLLE</italic> transcriptional reporter to detect the G2/M transition. The results obtained are presented in Figure 9B (quantification of split infected cells), in Figure 9-figure supplement 1B (<italic>ENOD11</italic> expression profile), in Figure 9-figure supplement 3B (representative confocal images) and Figure 9-figure supplement 4D (quantification of pKNOLLE reporter signal). There, we show that mitosis remains inhibited in cells accommodating infection threads, but is completed in a higher proportion of outer cortical cells positioned on the infection trajectory, where <italic>ENOD11</italic> gene transcription is active before their physical colonization.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Based on NF-YA1 expression data published previously and their results in tobacco epidermal cells, the authors hypothesize that NF-YA regulates the mitotic entry of nodule primordial cells. Given that much of the manuscript deals with earlier stages of the infection, I wonder if NF-YA1 could also have a role in regulating mitotic entry in cells adjacent to the infection thread?</p></disp-quote><p>The expression profile of <italic>NF-YA1</italic> at early stages of cortical infection (Laporte et al., 2014) is indeed similar to the one of <italic>ENOD11</italic> (as shown in Figure 9-figure supplement 1C) in wild-type Medicago roots, with corresponding transcriptional reporters being both activated in cells adjacent to the infection thread. Under our experimental conditions, additional expression of <italic>NF-YA1</italic> (driven by the <italic>ENOD11</italic> promoter) in these neighbouring cells did not impact their propensity to enter mitosis and to complete cell division. These results are presented in Figure 9-figure supplement 4D (quantification of pKNOLLE reporter signal) and Figure 9-figure supplement 5 (quantification of split neighbouring cells).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>- In the first part, images show the qualitative presence/absence of H3.1 or H3.3 histones.</p><p>Upon closer inspection, many cells seem to have both histones. In Fig1-S1 for example (root meristem), it is evident that there are many cells with low but clearly present H3.1 content in the green channel; however, in the overlay, the green is lost and H3.3 (pink) is mainly visible. What does this mean in terms of the cell cycle?</p></disp-quote><p>We fully agree with reviewer #1 on these points. Independent of whether they have low or high proliferation potential, most cells retain histone H3.1 particularly in silent regions of the genome, while H3.3 is constitutively produced and enriched at transcriptionally active regions. When channels are overlaid, cells in an active proliferation or endoreduplication state (in G1, S or G2, depending on the size of their nuclei) will appear mainly &quot;green&quot; (H3.1-eGFP positive). Cells with a low proliferation potential (e.g., in the QC), G2-arrested (e.g., IT-traversed) or terminally differentiating (e.g., containing symbiosomes or arbuscules) will appear mainly &quot;magenta&quot; (H3.1-low, medium to high H3.3-mCherry content).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Furthermore, all nodule images only display the overlay image, and individual fluorescence channels are not shown. Does the same masking effect happen here? It may be helpful to quantify fluoresce intensity not only in green but also in red channels as done for other experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>Quantifying fluorescence intensity in the mCherry channel may indeed help to highlight the likely replacement of H3.1-eGFP by H3.3-mCherry in infected cells, as described by Otero and colleagues (2016) at the onset of cellular differentiation. However, the quantification method as established (i.e., measuring the corrected total nuclear fluorescence at the equatorial plane) cannot be applied, most of the time, to infected cells' nuclei due to the overlapping presence of mCherry-producing <italic>S. meliloti</italic> in the same channel (e.g., in Figure 2B). Nevertheless, and to avoid this masking effect when the eGFP and mCherry channels are overlaid, we now present them as isolated channels in revised Figures 1-3 and associated figure supplements. As the cell-wall staining is regularly included and displayed in grayscale, we assigned to both of them the Green Fire Blue lookup table, which maps intensity values to a multiple-colour sequential scheme (with blue or yellow indicating low or high fluorescence levels, respectively). We hope that this will allow a better appreciation of the respective levels of H3.1- and H3.3-fusions in our confocal images.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Fig 1 B - it is hard to differentiate between S. meliloti-mCherry and H3.3-mCherry. Is there a way to label the different structures?</p></disp-quote><p>In the revised version of Figure 1B, we used filled or empty arrowheads to point to histone H3-containing nuclei. To label rhizobia-associated structures, we used dashed lines to delineate nodule cells hosting symbiosomes and included the annotation “IT” for infection threads. We also indicated proliferating, endoreduplicating and differentiating tissues and cells using the following annotations: “CD” for cell division, “En” for endoreduplication and “TD” for terminal differentiation. All annotations are explained in the figure legend.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Fig 1 - supplement E and F - no statistics are shown.</p></disp-quote><p>We performed non-parametric tests using the latest version of the GraphPad Prism software (version 10.4.1). Stars (Figure 1-figure supplement 1F) or different letters (Figure 1-figure supplement 1G) now indicate statistically significant differences. Results of the normality and non-parametric tests were included in the corresponding Source Data Files (Figure 1 – figure supplement 1 – source data 1 and 2). We have also updated the compact display of letters in other figures as indicated by the new software version. The raw data and the results of the statistical analyses remain unchanged and can be viewed in the corresponding source files.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Fig 2 A - overview and close-up image do not seem to be in the same focal plane. This is confusing because the nuclei position is different (so is the infection thread position).</p></disp-quote><p>We fully agree that our former Figure may have confused reviewers #1 and #2 as well as readers. Figure 2A was designed to highlight, from the same nodule primordium, actively dividing cells of the inner cortex (optical section z 6-14) and cells of the outer cortex traversed, penetrated by or neighbouring an infection thread (optical section z 11-19). We initially wanted to show different magnification views of the same confocal image (i.e_._, a full-view of the inner cortex and a zoomed-view of the outer layers) to ensure that audiences can identify these details. In the revised version of Figure 2A, we displayed these full- and zoomed-views in upper and lower panels, respectively and we removed the solid-line inset to avoid confusion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Fig 1A and Fig 2E could be combined and shown at the beginning of the manuscript. Also, consider making the cell size increase more extreme, as it is important to differentiate G2 cells after H3.1 eviction and cells in G1. You have to look very closely at the graph to see the size differences.</p></disp-quote><p>We have taken each of your suggestions into account. A combined version of our schematic representation with more pronounced nuclei size differences is now presented in Figure 1A.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Fig. 3 C is difficult to interpret. Can this be split into different panels?</p></disp-quote><p>We realized that our previous choice of representation may have been confusing. Each value corresponds only to the H3.1-eGFP content, measured in an infected cell and reported to that of the neighbouring cell (IC / NC) within individual root samples. Therefore, we removed the green-magenta colour code and changed the legend accordingly. We hope that these slight modifications will facilitate the interpretation of the results - namely, that the relative level of H3.1 increases significantly in infected cells in the selected mutants compared to the wild-type. This mode of representation also highlights that in the mutants, there are more individual cases where the H3.1 content in an infected cell exceeds that of the neighbouring cell by more than two times. These cases would be masked if the couples of infected cells and associated neighbours would be split into different panels as in Figure 3B.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Line 357/359.

This manuscript uses largely cell biological methods, which are always of the highest quality - to investigate host cell cycle progression during the early stages of nodule formation, where cortical infection threads penetrate the nodule primordium. The experiments were carefully conducted, the observations were detail oriented, and the results were thought-provoking. The study should be supported by mechanistic insights.</p><p>(1) One thought provoked by the authors' work is that while the study was carried out at an unprecedented resolution, the relationship between control of the cell cycle and infection thread penetration remains correlative. Is this reduced replicative potential among cells in the infection thread trajectory a consequence of hosting an infection thread, or a prerequisite to do so?</p></disp-quote><p>We understand and share the point of view of reviewer #2. At this stage, we believe that our data won’t enable us to fully answer the question, thus this relationship remains rather correlative. The reasons are that (1) the access to the status of cortical cells below C2 is restricted to fixed material and therefore only represents a snapshot of the situation, and (2) we are currently unable to significantly interfere with mechanisms as intertwined as cell cycle control and infection control. What we can reasonably suggest from our images is that the most favorable window of the cell cycle for cells about to be crossed by an infection thread is post-replicative, i.e., the G2 phase. Typical markers of the G2 phase were recurrently observed at the onset of physical colonization – enlarged nucleus, containing less histone H3.1 than neighbouring cells in S phase (e.g., in Figure 2A). Reaching the G2 phase could therefore be a prerequisite for infection (and associated cellular rearrangements), while prolonged arrest in this same phase is likely a consequence of transcellular passage towards a forming nodule primordium.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>More importantly, in either scenario, what is the functional significance of exiting the cell cycle or endocycle? By stating that &quot;local control of mitotic activity could be especially important for rhizobia to timely cross the middle cortex, where sustained cellular proliferation gives rise to the nodule meristem&quot; (Line 239), the authors seem to believe that cortical cells need to stop the cell cycle to prepare for rhizobia infection. This is certainly reasonable, but the current study provides no proof, yet. To test the functional importance of cell cycle exit, one would interfere with G2/M transition in nodule cells, and examine the effect on infection.</p></disp-quote><p>We fully agree with reviewer #2 that the functional importance of a cell-cycle arrest on the infection thread trajectory remains to be demonstrated. Interfering with cell-cycle progression in a system as complex and fine-tuned as infected legume roots certainly requires the right timing – at the level of the tissue and of individual cells; the right dose; and the right molecular player(s) (i.e., bona fide activators or repressors of the G2/M transition). Using the symbiosis-specific <italic>NPL</italic> promoter, activated in the direct vicinity of cortical infection threads (Figure 9-figure supplement 1B), we tried to force infectable cells to recruit the cell division program by ectopically over-expressing the Arabidopsis <italic>CYCD3.1</italic>, “mimicking” the CDEL system. So far, this strategy has not resulted in a significant increase in the number of uninfected nodules in transgenic hairy roots - though the effect on symbiosome release remains to be investigated. Provided that a suitable promoter-cell cycle regulator combination is identified, we hope to be able to answer this question in the future.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Given that the authors have already identified a candidate, and showed it represses cell division in the CDEL system, not testing the same gene in a more relevant context seems a lost opportunity. If one ectopically expressed NY-YA1 in hairy roots, thus repressing mitosis in general, would more cells become competent to host infection threads? This seems a straightforward experiment and readily feasible with the constructs that the authors already have. If this view is too naive, the authors should explain why such a functional investigation does not belong in this manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>Reviewer #2's point is entirely valid, and we decided to address it through additional experiments. To avoid possible side effects on development by affecting cell division in general, we placed <italic>NF-YA1</italic> under control of the symbiosis-induced <italic>ENOD11</italic> promoter. Based on the results obtained in the CDEL system, the pENOD11::FLAG-NF-YA1 cassette was coupled to a destabilized version of the <italic>KNOLLE</italic> transcriptional reporter to detect the G2/M transition. Competence for transcellular infection was maintained upon local <italic>NFYA1</italic> overexpression, the latter leading to a slight (non-significant) increase in the number of infected cells per cortical layer. These results are presented in Figure 9-figure supplement 3A-B (representative confocal images) and in Figure 9-figure supplement 4A-</p><p>G.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(1b) A related comment: on Line 183, it was stated that &quot;The H3.1-eGFP fusion protein was also visible in cells penetrated but not fully passed by an infection thread&quot;. Presumably, the authors were talking about the cell marked by the arrowhead. But its H3.1-GFP signal looks no different from the cell immediately to its left. It is hard to say which cells are ones &quot;preparing for intracellular infection pass through S-phase&quot;, and which ones are just &quot;regularly dividing cortical cells forming the nodule primordium&quot;. What can be concluded is that once a cell has been fully transversed by an infection thread, its H3.1 level is low. Whether this is the cause or consequence of infection cannot be resolved simply by timing the appearance or disappearance of H3.1-GFP.</p></disp-quote><p>We basically agree with comment 1b. In an unsynchronized system such as infected hairy roots, it is challenging to detect the event where a cell is penetrated, but not yet completely crossed by an infection thread. What we wanted to emphasize in Figure 2A, is that host cells in the path of an infection thread re-enter the cell cycle and pass through S-phase just as their neighbours do (as pointed out by reviewer #2 in his summary). The larger nucleus with slightly lower H3.1-eGFP signal than the neighbouring cell (as indicated by the use of the Green Fire Blue lookup table) suggests that the infected cell marked by the arrowhead in Figure 2A is actually in the G2 phase. The main difference is indeed that cells allowing complete infection thread passage exit the cell cycle and largely evict H3.1 while their neighbours proceed to cell division (as exemplified by PlaCCI reporters in Figure 4CD and the new Figure 5-figure supplement 2). Whether cell-cycle exit in G2 is a cause, or a consequence of cortical infection is a question that cannot be easily answered from fixed samples, which is a limitation of our study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The authors have convincingly demonstrated that cortical cells accommodating infection threads exit the cell cycle, inhibit cell division, and down-regulate KNOLLE expression. How do these observations reconcile with the feature called the pre-infection thread? The authors devoted one paragraph to this question in the Discussion, but this does seem sufficient given that the pre-infection thread is a prominent concept. Is the resemblance to the cell division plane superficial, or does it reflect a co-option of the normal cytokinesis machinery for accommodating rhizobia?</p></disp-quote><p>From our point of view, cortical cells forming pre-infection threads are likely in an intermediate state. PIT structures undoubtedly share many similarities with cells establishing a cell division plane. The recruitment of at least some of the players normally associated with cytokinesis has been demonstrated and is consistent with the maintenance of infectable cells in a pre-mitotic phase in Medicago, as discussed in lines 558 to 568. We nevertheless think that the arrest of the cell cycle in the G2 phase, presumably occurring in crossed cortical cells, constitutes an event of cellular differentiation and specialization in transcellular infection.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The following are mainly points of presentation and description:</p><p>(3) Line 158: I can't see &quot;subnuclear foci&quot; in Figure 1-figure supplement 1C-E.

In the <italic>Medicago truncatula</italic> root cortex for example, a tetraploid cell generated via endoreduplication from the diploid state would contain at most two alleles at any locus. The effects of endopolyploidy on cell size, gene expression, cell metabolism and the duration of the mitotic cell cycle are not shared among individual cells or organs, contrasting to a polyploid individual (Scholes and Paige, 2015).</p><p>See Scholes, D.
