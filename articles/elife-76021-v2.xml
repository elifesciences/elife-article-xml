which results in the accumulation and misfolding of the newly synthesized proteins. DTT may potentially impact cellular physiology by ER-independent mechanisms; however, such mechanisms remain poorly characterized. Using the nematode model <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, here we show that DTT toxicity is modulated by the bacterial diet. Specifically, the dietary component vitamin B12 alleviates DTT toxicity in a methionine synthase-dependent manner. Using a forward genetic screen, we discover that loss-of-function of R08E5.3, an <italic>S</italic>-adenosylmethionine (SAM)-dependent methyltransferase, confers DTT resistance. DTT upregulates R08E5.3 expression and modulates the activity of the methionine–homocysteine cycle. Employing genetic and biochemical studies, we establish that DTT toxicity is a result of the depletion of SAM. Finally, we show that a functional IRE-1/XBP-1 unfolded protein response pathway is required to counteract toxicity at high, but not low, DTT concentrations.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Animal and plant cells synthesize a significant fraction of their proteins on a structure known as the endoplasmic reticulum. Researchers often use the molecule dithiothreitol to specifically target this compartment and learn more about its role. The toxin works by disturbing the complex chemical environment present in the reticulum, which is required for the proteins to assemble properly. However, it is important to clarify whether dithiothreitol could also affect other parts of the cell, as this could give rise to misleading results.</p><p>To explore this possibility, Gokul G and Jogender Singh studied the effects of dithiothreitol on the millimetre-long roundworm <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>. Their experiments revealed that vitamin B12 could protect against dithiothreitol toxicity via a complex cascade of molecular events which reduced the levels of an important regulatory molecule known as S-adenosylmethionine. Crucially, the chemical reactions that dithiothreitol targeted took place outside the reticulum, suggesting that the toxin impairs processes in the wider cell.</p><p>These results suggest that dithiothreitol should be reconsidered for use in endoplasmic reticulum studies. However, they also imply that this toxin could be beneficial in small doses, as a reduced concentration of S-adenosylmethionine increases lifespan and health in a variety of organisms.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>S</italic>-adenosylmethionine</kwd><kwd>dithiothreitol</kwd><kwd>ER stress</kwd><kwd>methionine cycle</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100010713</institution-id><institution>Indian Institute of Science Education and Research Bhopal</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>INST/BIO/2019091</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Singh</surname><given-names>Jogender</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100011652</institution-id><institution>Indian Institute of Science Education and Research Mohali</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Intramural funds</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Singh</surname><given-names>Jogender</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001843</institution-id><institution>Science and Engineering Research Board</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Startup Research Grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Singh</surname><given-names>Jogender</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Department of Biotechnology, Ministry of Science and Technology, India</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Ramalingaswami Re-entry Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Singh</surname><given-names>Jogender</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Department of Science and Technology, Ministry of Science and Technology, India</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>INSPIRE-SHE Scholarship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>G</surname><given-names>Gokul</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Department of Biotechnology, Ministry of Science and Technology, India</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BT/RLF/Re-entry/50/2020</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Singh</surname><given-names>Jogender</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001843</institution-id><institution>Science and Engineering Research Board</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SRG/2020/000022</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Singh</surname><given-names>Jogender</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The redox reagent dithiothreitol causes toxicity by depleting <italic>S</italic>-adenosylmethionine levels, and dietary vitamin B12 could alleviate this toxicity via the methionine synthase enzyme.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Diverse biological processes occur via oxidation–reduction (redox) reactions, and therefore, a redox balance is essential for cellular and organismal homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Trachootham et al., 2008</xref>). A consequence of biological redox reactions is the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The physiological flux of ROS regulates cellular processes essential for cell survival, maintenance, and aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sies and Jones, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Trachootham et al., 2008</xref>). In contrast, excessive ROS leads to oxidative stress, a hallmark of many pathological states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sies and Jones, 2020</xref>). To combat excessive ROS, the cellular systems have developed antioxidant networks, including thioredoxin, glutathione, glutathione peroxidases, catalase, and superoxide dismutases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kurutas, 2016</xref>). In addition to endogenous antioxidants, dietary antioxidant supplements are taken under healthy as well as pathological conditions to counteract ROS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kurutas, 2016</xref>). Animal and cell model studies suggest that thiol-based antioxidants, including glutathione, <italic>N</italic>-acetylcysteine (NAC), and dithiothreitol (DTT), may attenuate ROS-induced pathological conditions such as hepatic, hematopoietic, intestinal, and renal injuries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Heidari et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Heidari et al., 2016b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Li et al., 2019</xref>), Alzheimer’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pocernich and Butterfield, 2012</xref>), and dopamine-induced cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Offen et al., 1996</xref>). While the thiol-based antioxidants appear to improve various pathological conditions, their broad effects on cellular physiology remain poorly characterized. Recently, it was shown that glutathione and NAC could have detrimental effects on the health and lifespan of <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gusarov et al., 2021</xref>). Therefore, a better characterization of the physiological effects of various thiol antioxidants is necessary to harness their therapeutic value.</p><p>DTT is a commonly used redox reagent that contains two thiol groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cleland, 1964</xref>) and is known to reduce protein disulfide bonds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Konigsberg, 1972</xref>). Because the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) has an oxidative environment conducive to disulfide bond formation, DTT reduces disulfide bonds in the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Braakman et al., 1992</xref>). Therefore, DTT is widely used as an ER-specific stressor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Braakman et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Oslowski and Urano, 2011</xref>). While DTT has been shown to improve several ROS-based pathological conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Heidari et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Heidari et al., 2016b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Li et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Offen et al., 1996</xref>), high amounts of DTT are toxic and lead to cell death which is thought to be mediated by increased ER stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Li et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Qin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Xiang et al., 2016</xref>). However, some studies suggest that DTT may induce apoptosis by generating hydrogen peroxide and oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Held et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Held and Melder, 1987</xref>). Similarly, several other DTT-mediated phenotypes are shown to be independent of ER stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Guillemette et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">MacKenzie et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Messias Sandes et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tartier et al., 2000</xref>). Therefore, how DTT impacts cellular physiology remains to be fully understood.</p><p>Here, using the <italic>C. elegans</italic> model, we characterized the physiological effects of DTT. We showed that DTT causes developmental defects in <italic>C. elegans</italic> in a bacterial diet-dependent manner. The dietary component vitamin B12 alleviated development defects caused by DTT by acting as a cofactor for methionine synthase. To understand the interplay between DTT and vitamin B12, we isolated <italic>C. elegans</italic> mutants in a forward genetic screen that were resistant to DTT toxicity. Loss-of-function of R08E5.3, an <italic>S</italic>-adenosylmethionine (SAM)-dependent methyltransferase, imparted DTT resistance. DTT resulted in the upregulation of R08E5.3 expression and, therefore, modulated the methionine–homocysteine cycle. DTT resulted in the depletion of SAM, and supplementation of methionine and choline could rescue DTT toxicity. Modulation of the methionine–homocysteine cycle by DTT also resulted in the upregulation of the ER and mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPR) pathways. Finally, we showed that while DTT toxicity primarily occurred via the modulation of the methionine–homocysteine cycle, a functional IRE-1/XBP-1 UPR pathway was required to counteract DTT toxicity.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>DTT affects <italic>C. elegans</italic> development in a bacterial diet-dependent manner</title><p>DTT is known to be toxic to <italic>C. elegans</italic> and affects its development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kozlowski et al., 2014</xref>).

Because <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> virulence might affect the development of <italic>C. elegans</italic>, we used the <italic>gacA</italic> mutant, which has drastically reduced virulence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tan et al., 1999</xref>). Interestingly, <italic>C. elegans</italic> showed no developmental defects on <italic>C. aquatica</italic> DA1877 and <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PA14 diets in the presence of 10 mM DTT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D, E</xref>).

These results showed that bacterial diet has a major effect on DTT toxicity, and likely some bacterial diet component(s) modulated DTT toxicity.</p><p>Previous studies have shown that relative to the <italic>E. coli</italic> OP50 diet, a <italic>C. aquatica</italic> DA1877 diet accelerates <italic>C. elegans</italic> development primarily because it contains higher levels of vitamin B12 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Watson et al., 2014</xref>). Similarly, <italic>E. coli</italic> HT115 and <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PA14 diets are known to have higher amounts of vitamin B12 than the <italic>E. coli</italic> OP50 diet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Revtovich et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Watson et al., 2014</xref>). The amount of dietary vitamin B12 available to <italic>C. elegans</italic> can be reliably determined by a dietary sensor strain expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) under the promoter of acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase (<italic>acdh-1</italic>) gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Watson et al., 2014</xref>). Low levels of vitamin B12 result in the accumulation of the short-chain fatty acid propionate, which leads to transcriptional activation of <italic>acdh-1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Watson et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, the GFP levels in the <italic>acdh-1p::GFP</italic> animals indirectly report the levels of dietary vitamin B12 available to <italic>C. elegans</italic>. When the animals experience low levels of vitamin B12, <italic>acdh-1p::GFP</italic> is strongly induced, and the level of GFP expression reduces as the animals obtain increasing levels of vitamin B12. Using <italic>acdh-1p::GFP</italic> animals, we first tested the levels of vitamin B12 in the animals on different bacterial diets compared to the <italic>E. coli</italic> OP50 diet. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref> and reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Watson et al., 2014</xref>), the animals show very bright GFP expression on the <italic>E. coli</italic> OP50 diet, while the GFP levels were diminished on <italic>E. coli</italic> HT115, <italic>S. enterica</italic>, and <italic>S. marcescens</italic> diets.

The levels of GFP expression in <italic>acdh-1p::GFP</italic> animals on different bacterial diets correlated perfectly with the developmental defects on these bacterial diets in the presence of DTT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Vitamin B12 alleviates DTT toxicity via methionine synthase</title><p>The correlation between the GFP levels in <italic>acdh-1p::GFP</italic> animals and the developmental defects of animals in the presence of DTT on different bacterial diets suggested that vitamin B12 could be the microbial component that alleviates DTT toxicity in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. To test this, we studied the development of N2 animals on <italic>E. coli</italic> OP50 diet containing 10 mM DTT and supplemented with 50 nM vitamin B12.

Since DTT exerts its toxicity via the SAM-dependent methyltransferase RIPS-1, we postulated that either depletion of the metabolites upstream of RIPS-1 activity (methionine and SAM) or accumulation of metabolites downstream of RIPS-1 activity (SAH and homocysteine) or a combination of both would result in DTT toxicity. To discriminate between these possibilities, we carried out methionine supplementation assays in the presence of DTT. We reasoned that if DTT toxicity is because of methionine and/or SAM depletion, supplementation of methionine should attenuate DTT toxicity. On the other hand, if DTT toxicity is caused by the accumulation of SAH and/or homocysteine, supplementation of methionine should enhance DTT toxicity as methionine supplementation would likely enhance levels of SAH and/or homocysteine.

However, the complete spectrum of physiological effects of DTT inside a cell is not fully understood. The ER is known to be a primary target for DTT inside the cell due to its oxidative nature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Merksamer et al., 2008</xref>). The oxidative nature of the ER is crucial for the formation of disulfide bonds and the proper folding of proteins. DTT leads to the reduction of disulfide bonds in the ER, consequently leading to protein misfolding and ER stress. DTT has widely been used as an ER-specific stressor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Braakman et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Oslowski and Urano, 2011</xref>). Increased ER stress is associated with the activation of cell death programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sano and Reed, 2013</xref>), and therefore, the toxicity of DTT has been associated with increased ER stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Li et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Qin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Xiang et al., 2016</xref>).

Because DTT results in the induction of <italic>rips-1</italic> expression, one possibility is that DTT is the substrate for RIPS-1, and <italic>rips-1</italic> expression is induced in response to DTT as a defense mechanism. This hypothesis is supported by studies that showed that multiple thiol reagents, including DTT and β-ME, could be methylated by SAM and SAM-dependent methyltransferases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bremer and Greenberg, 1961</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Coiner et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Maldonato et al., 2021</xref>). The methylation of external thiols could be a defense response for some organisms. For example, the dithiol metabolite gliotoxin produced by <italic>Aspergillus fumigatus</italic> inhibits the growth of other fungi, including <italic>A. niger</italic>, and triggers a defense response in <italic>A. niger</italic> resulting in upregulation of SAM-dependent methyltransferases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dolan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Manzanares-Miralles et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Owens et al., 2015</xref>).

Therefore, the methionine–homocysteine cycle has become an important intervention point for improving lifespan and health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Konno et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lam et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Li et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Parkhitko et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sanderson et al., 2019</xref>). In the current study, we discovered that DTT modulates the methionine–homocysteine cycle resulting in low SAM levels. Reduction of SAM levels is known to enhance the lifespan and metabolic health of a large variety of organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Parkhitko et al., 2019</xref>). Therefore, it will be intriguing to test whether, at nontoxic concentrations, DTT could have health-improving effects via the methionine–homocysteine cycle.</p><p>In the future, it will be interesting to study whether the modulation of the methionine–homocysteine cycle by DTT is a conserved feature across different organisms. In the fungus <italic>Aspergillus niger</italic>, DTT is known to strongly upregulate the expression of two SAM-dependent methyltransferases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">MacKenzie et al., 2005</xref>). Therefore, it is likely possible that DTT modulates the methionine–homocysteine cycle in <italic>Aspergillus niger</italic>. Similarly, DTT results in increased levels of cysteine in Chinese hamster V79 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dennis et al., 1989</xref>). Cysteine is synthesized from homocysteine by the transsulfuration pathway, and increased amounts of homocysteine are known to increase cysteine levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sbodio et al., 2019</xref>). Therefore, it is possible that DTT modulates the methionine–homocysteine cycle in Chinese hamster V79 cells resulting in increased levels of homocysteine and, consequently, increased cysteine levels. Overall, these studies suggest that modulation of the methionine–homocysteine cycle by DTT could be a conserved feature across different organisms. Future research deciphering the mechanism and relevance of activation of SAM-dependent methyltransferases by thiol reagents DTT and β-ME will aid in better understanding the physiological effects of these, and possibly, other thiol reagents.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="center" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="center" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="center" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="center" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>Escherichia coli</italic>)</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">OP50</td><td align="center" valign="bottom"><italic>Caenorhabditis</italic>Genetics Center (CGC)</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">OP50</td><td align="center" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>E. coli</italic>)</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">HT115</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">Source BioScience</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">HT115</td><td align="center" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>)</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">PA14 <italic>gacA</italic></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">Meta Kuehn laboratory</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">PA14 <italic>gacA</italic></td><td align="center" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>Comamonas aquatica</italic>)</td><td align="center" valign="bottom"><italic>C. aquatica</italic> DA1877</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">CGC</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">DA1877</td><td align="center" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>Serratia marcescens</italic>)</td><td align="center" valign="bottom"><italic>S. marcescens</italic> Db11</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">CGC</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">Db11</td><td align="center" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> serovar Typhimurium 1344)</td><td align="center" valign="bottom"><italic>S. enterica</italic></td><td align="center" valign="bottom">Frederick M.

All of the mutants were backcrossed six times with the parental N2 strain before analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Whole-genome sequencing and data analysis</title><p>The genomic DNA was isolated as described earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Singh and Aballay, 2017</xref>). Briefly, the mutant animals were grown at 20°C on NGM plates seeded with <italic>E. coli</italic> OP50 until starvation. The animals were rinsed off the plates with M9, washed three times, incubated in M9 with rotation for 2 hr to eliminate food from the intestine, and washed three times again with M9. Genomic DNA extraction was performed using the Gentra Puregene Kit (Qiagen, Netherlands). DNA libraries were prepared according to a standard Illumina (San Diego, CA) protocol. The DNA was subjected to whole-genome sequencing (WGS) on an Illumina HiSeq sequencing platform using 150 paired-end nucleotide reads. Library preparation and WGS were performed at Clevergene Biocorp Pvt. Ltd, Bengaluru, India.</p><p>The whole-genome sequence data were analyzed using the web platform Galaxy. The forward and reverse FASTQ reads, <italic>C. elegans</italic> reference genome Fasta file (ce11M.fa), and the gene annotation file (SnpEff4.3 WBcel235.86) were input into the Galaxy workflow. The low-quality ends of the FASTQ reads were trimmed using the Sickle tool. The trimmed FASTQ reads were mapped to the reference genome Fasta files with the BWA-MEM tool. Using the MarkDuplicates tool, any duplicate reads (mapped to multiple sites) were filtered. Subsequently, the variants were detected using the FreeBayes tool that finds small polymorphisms, including SNPs, insertions and deletions (indels), multinucleotide polymorphisms, and complex events (composite insertion and substitution events) smaller than the length of a short-read sequencing alignment. The common variants among different mutants were subtracted. The SnpEff4.3 Wbcel235.86 gene annotation file was used to annotate and predict the effects of genetic variants (such as amino acid changes). Finally, the linkage maps for each mutant were generated using the obtained variation.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Plasmid constructs and generation of transgenic <italic>C. elegans</italic></title><p>For rescue of the DTT-resistance phenotype of <italic>rips-1(jsn11)</italic> animals, the <italic>rips-1</italic> gene along with its promoter region (918 bp upstream) was amplified from genomic DNA of N2 animals.

The volume of water used to reconstitute the samples depended on the weight of the preprocessed semisoft pellet of the animals, such that 1 µl of water was added per mg of worm pellet. The reconstituted mixture was centrifuged at 15,000 × <italic>g</italic> for 2 min, and 5 μl was injected for LC–MS analysis. The separation of metabolites was achieved on an Acquity UPLC BEH130 C18 column (2.1 × 100 mm, 1.7 µm particles, Waters) at room temperature. The two mobile phases consisted of (A) water with 0.1% formic acid and (B) acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid. Linear gradients from 100% A to 90% A for 6 min were used for separation at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min. The effluent was then introduced into the electrospray ionization source of the Synapt G2-Si HD mass spectrometer (Waters). The acquisitions were carried out in the positive ion mode. SAM chloride dihydrochloride was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (#A7007) and was used as a standard.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Martin Sebastian Denzel as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by David Ron as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>To support the conclusions made in the paper, the reviewers agreed on a number of essential revisions:</p><p>1. SAM levels should be quantified to support the idea that they are in fact depleted after DTT exposure.</p><p>2. A genetic characterization of drm-1. It would be important to test if a genetic KO phenocopies the point mutants and if overexpression sensitize to DTT.</p><p>3. Published work needs to be cited more accurately and comprehensively. Particularly the experiments with B12/DTT were published before and should be cited in the figure legend.</p><p>4. Alternative plausible hypotheses explaining the DTT effects need to be considered.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>To better support the conclusions, I would like to suggest the following key experiments.</p><p>1. To put the effect of DTT on SAM in context and to make comparisons in other systems possible, it would be important to measure the absolute SAM concentration in worms with and without DTT treatment, and after methionine supplementation.</p><p>2. To address a broad biological significance of the finding that DTT treatment first leads to toxicity through SAM depletion and only at higher concentrations to ER stress it would be important to perform the key experiments in cultured mammalian cells.</p><p>3. What is the effect of 5mM DTT on hsp-4::GFP expression/UPR signaling?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. drm-1 should be fully characterized. It is a point mutation, therefore could be a loss, partial or gain of function allele. In addition, identification of the methylation pathway the drm-1 gene works in critical to bring together aspects of this story.</p><p>2. The data from this paper is largely self reported (<italic>C. elegans</italic> larval stage) or low magnification images. More quantitive assays should be used (for example, expression of adult collagens such as col-19), or higher magnification images of vulval development shown.</p><p>3. GFP images should be quantitated.</p><p>4. Data from the Walhout lab should be directly cited in the figure legend and in the same paragraph that discuss the results.</p><p>5. Direct mechanistic links from the action of DTT to the Met/SAM cycle are needed for the conclusions of the paper to be supportable. There are multiple types of experiments that might be acceptable here.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. The authors conclude on L305 that &quot;By upregulating the expression of SAM-dependent methyltransferase gene drm-1, DTT leads to the depletion of SAM that results in toxicity&quot;. No experiment has shown that drm-1 activation causes lower SAM – this is merely implied from the supplementation data. The authors should provide support of that model and measure SAM levels with and without DTT and with and without B12, as well as in the drm-1 mutant. Such molecular evidence of actual SAM depletion is critical to the main conclusion of the paper – that SAM levels and their depletion are a major driver of DTT toxicity.</p><p>2. If the authors' model is correct that DTT-driven drm-1 induction is the source of developmental delay due to SAM depletion, they should cross their overexpression transgene into the WT background; the prediction would be that this should cause developmental delay on its own. Alternatively, they could use a stronger intestinal promoter to overexpress drm-1. Again, is in the above point, the authors should also quantify SAM in these worms.</p><p>3. One idea that emerges from the data provided here is that drm-1 may be a SAM-dependent enzyme that produces PC; this might be important in the condition of DTT-induced ER stress as it might allow synthesizing more ER membrane, allowing for accumulation of misfolded proteins. It would be great if the authors could test whether the drm-1 mutant has lower levels of PC.</p><p>4. The role of thiol agents should be expanded beyond DTT. The authors could readily test whether the mechanism described here also protects against toxic concentrations of other agents, e.g. test B12/methionine/choline and/or drm-1 rescue of toxic concentration of NAC.</p><p>5.The authors showed that drm-1 is induced by DTT, and so were two of its orthologs, R08E5.1, R08F11.4 (but not K12D9.1). To examine whether protection against DTT is is specific to drm-1, the authors should use mutants in the other three genes to test whether they, too, block toxic effects of DTT (one might predict the former two should, the latter maybe not, because it is not induced by DTT). RNAi might work as well, there is now an option to do RNAi in OP50. The screen did not identify alleles in these genes, and while this doesn't rule out their importance, it is somewhat compelling and suggests that drm-1 is key here, so these experiments are not essential.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Dithiothreitol causes toxicity in <italic>C. elegans</italic> by modulating the methionine-homocysteine cycle&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by David Ron (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>1. SAM data should be displayed in absolute values and in the same graph so that it's possible to understand the effect of <italic>rips-1</italic> mutation on SAM.</p><p>2.

Alternative plausible hypotheses explaining the DTT effects need to be considered.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added a new paragraph in the discussion to provide a hypothesis for explaining the effects of DTT. The revised manuscript reads (lines 377-392): “One question that arises from the current study concerns the substrate for the SAM-methyltransferase RIPS-1. Because DTT results in the induction of <italic>rips-1</italic> expression, one possibility is that DTT is the substrate for RIPS-1, and <italic>rips-1</italic> expression is induced in response to DTT as a defense mechanism. This hypothesis is supported by studies that showed that multiple thiol reagents, including DTT and β-ME, could be methylated by SAM and SAM-dependent methyltransferases (Bremer and Greenberg, 1961; Coiner et al., 2006; Maldonato et al., 2021). The methylation of external thiols could be a defense response for some organisms. For example, the dithiol metabolite gliotoxin produced by Aspergillus fumigatus inhibits the growth of other fungi, including A. niger, and triggers a defense response in A. niger resulting in upregulation of SAM-dependent methyltransferases (Dolan et al., 2014; Manzanares-miralles et al., 2016; Owens et al., 2015). Methylation of gliotoxin by SAMdependent methyltransferases confers A. niger protection against the dithiol metabolite. Incidentally, the same methyltransferases that are required for the defense mechanism against gliotoxin are induced by DTT (MacKenzie et al., 2005; Manzanares-miralles et al., 2016). Therefore, upregulation of methyltransferases might be a general defense response against multiple thiol reagents.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>To better support the conclusions, I would like to suggest the following key experiments.</p><p>1.

The authors conclude on L305 that &quot;By upregulating the expression of SAM-dependent methyltransferase gene drm-1, DTT leads to the depletion of SAM that results in toxicity&quot;. No experiment has shown that drm-1 activation causes lower SAM – this is merely implied from the supplementation data. The authors should provide support of that model and measure SAM levels with and without DTT and with and without B12, as well as in the drm-1 mutant. Such molecular evidence of actual SAM depletion is critical to the main conclusion of the paper – that SAM levels and their depletion are a major driver of DTT toxicity.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for suggesting this important experiment.

If the authors' model is correct that DTT-driven drm-1 induction is the source of developmental delay due to SAM depletion, they should cross their overexpression transgene into the WT background; the prediction would be that this should cause developmental delay on its own. Alternatively, they could use a stronger intestinal promoter to overexpress drm-1. Again, is in the above point, the authors should also quantify SAM in these worms.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for another very important suggestion. We tested the sensitivity of <italic>rips-1</italic> overexpressing animals to DTT and indeed found them to be more sensitive to DTT. The revised manuscript reads (lines 216-218): “To establish that the toxic effects of DTT are indeed due to the upregulation of <italic>rips-1</italic>, we tested the effects of overexpression of <italic>rips-1</italic> on DTT sensitivity. Animals overexpressing <italic>rips-1</italic> exhibited enhanced sensitivity to DTT toxicity (Figure 3—figure supplement 3C-D).” We could not quantify SAM levels in the <italic>rips-1</italic> overexpressing animals as the array is extrachromosomal (resulting in both transgenic and non-transgenic progeny), and several thousands of worms are required to quantify SAM levels.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. One idea that emerges from the data provided here is that drm-1 may be a SAM-dependent enzyme that produces PC; this might be important in the condition of DTT-induced ER stress as it might allow synthesizing more ER membrane, allowing for accumulation of misfolded proteins. It would be great if the authors could test whether the drm-1 mutant has lower levels of PC.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this interesting conjecture. However, we observed that choline supplementation, which enhances PC synthesis, rescues DTT toxicity. Because SAM levels are critical for maintaining PC levels (in the absence of choline supplementation), it is likely that DTT leads to reduced levels of PC (supported by the rescue of DTT toxicity by choline supplementation). Therefore, if the <italic>rips-1</italic> mutants had lower levels of PC, they would have been more sensitive to DTT. However, because <italic>rips-1</italic> mutants are resistant to DTT, it is unlikely that <italic>rips-1</italic> is involved in PC synthesis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The role of thiol agents should be expanded beyond DTT. The authors could readily test whether the mechanism described here also protects against toxic concentrations of other agents, e.g. test B12/methionine/choline and/or drm-1 rescue of toxic concentration of NAC.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this important suggestion. We studied whether the thiol reagents, β-mercaptoethanol (β-ME) and NAC, caused toxicity via <italic>rips-1</italic>. Interestingly, we observed that β-ME, but not NAC, shares the toxicity pathway with DTT. These results are described in a new Results subsection and a new Figure (Figure 4). The revised manuscript reads (lines 263-272): “β-Mercaptoethanol, but not NAC, shares toxicity pathway with DTT We tested whether the other thiol reagents, β-mercaptoethanol (β-ME) and NAC, caused toxicity via <italic>rips-1</italic>. Interestingly, <italic>rips-1(jsn11)</italic> animals exhibited resistance to β-ME toxicity, but not NAC toxicity (Figure 4A-B). We studied the effect of these thiol reagents on the expression levels of <italic>rips-1p::GFP</italic>. While NAC exposure did not affect the expression of rips1p::GFP, β-ME resulted in its dramatic upregulation (Figure 4C-D). Finally, we studied the effects of vitamin B12 supplementation of the toxicities of β-ME and NAC. Vitamin B12 supplementation alleviated β-ME, but not NAC, toxicity (Figure 4E-F). These results suggested that β-ME shares the toxicity mechanism with DTT. On the other hand, NAC causes toxicity by a mechanism different from DTT.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5.The authors showed that drm-1 is induced by DTT, and so were two of its orthologs, R08E5.1, R08F11.4 (but not K12D9.1). To examine whether protection against DTT is is specific to drm-1, the authors should use mutants in the other three genes to test whether they, too, block toxic effects of DTT (one might predict the former two should, the latter maybe not, because it is not induced by DTT). RNAi might work as well, there is now an option to do RNAi in OP50. The screen did not identify alleles in these genes, and while this doesn't rule out their importance, it is somewhat compelling and suggests that drm-1 is key here, so these experiments are not essential.</p></disp-quote><p>We studied the role of <italic>rips-1</italic> and <italic>rips-1</italic>-related methyltransferases in DTT toxicity by their RNAi-mediated knockdown. The revised manuscript reads (202-215): “Because DTT resulted in the upregulation of methyltransferases closely related to <italic>rips-1</italic>, we used RNAi knockdown to study the role of these methyltransferases in the toxic effects of DTT. As expected, knockdown of <italic>rips-1</italic> in the N2 animals resulted in a drastic improvement in their development in the presence of DTT (Figure 3—figure supplement 3A-B). Interestingly, knockdown of R08E5.1 resulted in a phenotype similar to <italic>rips-1</italic> knockdown. On the other hand, knockdown of R08F11.4 and K12D9.1 improved the development in the presence of DTT only marginally (Figure 3—figure supplement 3A-B). These results suggest that the <italic>rips-1</italic>-related methyltransferases might also be required for DTT toxicity. It is also possible that the knockdown of these methyltransferases results in the knockdown of <italic>rips-1</italic> by cross RNAi. The level of sequence similarity between <italic>rips-1</italic> and R08E5.1 (78 % identical) indicates that these genes would undergo complete cross RNAi (Rual et al., 2007). Because we did not recover mutants of any of the <italic>rips-1</italic>-related methyltransferases in our genetic screen in contrast to the twelve alleles of <italic>rips-1</italic>, the <italic>rips-1</italic>-related methyltransferases likely have only minor roles in DTT toxicity.”</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>1.

We have displayed the SAM quantification data for both N2 and <italic>rips-1(jsn11)</italic> animals in the same graph (Figure 5F).</p><p>SAM is a very unstable molecule. The SAM standard that we purchased from Σ (#A7007) has this cautionary note: “This material is 80-90% pure when prepared, but is very unstable. As much as 10% purity loss per day at 25 °C has been noted.” Therefore, its absolute quantification may not be reliable. It is a standard practice to present SAM levels in relative values. Because for each experiment, all four of the samples (N2 and <italic>rips-1(jsn11)</italic> with and without 10 mM DTT) were prepared and processed simultaneously, the relative SAM quantification in these samples is reliable and sufficient to understand the effects of DTT on relative SAM levels.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

This suggested that while phosphatidylcholine is one important downstream product of SAM involved in attenuating DTT toxicity, other SAMrelated functions may also be involved in rescuing DTT toxicity. We have added these points in the manuscript (lines 295-301): “Supplementation of choline rescued the developmental defects in N2 and metr-1(ok521) animals on an <italic>E. coli</italic> OP50 diet containing 10 mM DTT (Figure 5G-H).

From the data it appears that knockdown of all 4 methyltransferases results in some rescue, so perhaps they are all involved? This requires no experimentation, just a change in the wording of the interpretation.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. Indeed, the knockdown of all 4 methyltransferases results in some rescue of DTT toxicity. This could be because of the following two reasons: Either all the 4 methyltransferases are involved in mediating DTT toxicity, or because of high sequence similarity among these methyltransferases, cross-RNAi takes place. We have now discussed both of these possibilities. We have added a new sentence in the manuscript (lines 215-216): “However, our studies do not rule out the involvement of the <italic>rips-1</italic>-related methyltransferases in DTT toxicity.” The whole paragraph on methyltransferases RNAi reads: “Because DTT resulted in the upregulation of methyltransferases closely related to <italic>rips-1</italic>, we used RNAi knockdown to study the role of these methyltransferases in the toxic effects of DTT.
