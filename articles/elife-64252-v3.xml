Recently, various condensates with filamentous morphology have been observed in cells. One such condensate is the TIS granule network that shares a large surface area with the rough endoplasmic reticulum and is important for membrane protein trafficking. It has been unclear how condensates with mesh-like shapes but dynamic protein components are formed. In vitro and in vivo reconstitution experiments revealed that the minimal components are a multivalent RNA-binding protein that concentrates RNAs that are able to form extensive intermolecular mRNA–mRNA interactions. mRNAs with large unstructured regions have a high propensity to form a pervasive intermolecular interaction network that acts as condensate skeleton. The underlying RNA matrix prevents full fusion of spherical liquid-like condensates, thus driving the formation of irregularly shaped membraneless organelles. The resulting large surface area may promote interactions at the condensate surface and at the interface with other organelles.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>RNA biology</kwd><kwd>biomolecular condensates</kwd><kwd>RNA multivalency</kwd><kwd>in vivo reconstitution</kwd><kwd>condensate morphology</kwd><kwd>RNA-RNA interactions</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000052</institution-id><institution>NIH Office of the Director</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DP1-GM123454</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mayr</surname><given-names>Christine</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P30 CA008748</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mayr</surname><given-names>Christine</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Pershing Square Sohn Cancer Research Alliance</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mayr</surname><given-names>Christine</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Binding of a multivalent RNA-binding protein to mRNAs that are able to form pervasive RNA–RNA interactions induces formation of mesh-like condensates, whereas binding of mostly structured mRNAs induces sphere-like condensates.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Despite lacking a surrounding lipid membrane, membraneless organelles are micron-sized structures that compartmentalize the subcellular space to organize biological reactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hyman et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Banani et al., 2017</xref>).

Recently, several mesh-like condensates were found in cells that include the TIS granule network, FXR1 condensates, and localization bodies (L-bodies) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ma and Mayr, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Neil et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Smith et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>TIS granules are formed through assembly of the RNA-binding protein TIS11B. TIS granules have tubule-like structures and generate a reticular meshwork that is intertwined with the rough endoplasmic reticulum (ER), one of the major sites of protein translation. The mesh-like morphology of the TIS granule network allows it to share a lot of surface area with the ER, thus, generating a large condensate–organelle interface. TIS granules are present in various cell types under physiological conditions and provide a translation environment for mRNAs that contain several AU-rich elements in their 3′ untranslated regions (3′UTRs). Translation in the TIS granule–ER interface, the so-called TIGER domain, allows membrane proteins to form specific protein complexes, indicating that TIS granules are important for the trafficking of plasma membrane proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ma and Mayr, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mayr, 2019</xref>).</p><p>In addition to mammalian cells, mesh-like condensates also exist in other organisms. During <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocyte maturation, the ER and maternal mRNAs localize to the vegetal pole, which is critical for proper embryonic patterning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Deshler et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Neil et al., 2020</xref>).

Although TIS granules were found in somatic cells, they seem to share a lot of characteristics with L-bodies.</p><p>Many biomolecular condensates or RNA granules contain protein and RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Teixeira et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Schwartz et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Smith et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Banerjee et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fuller et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lee et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fernandes and Buchan, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hyman et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Banani et al., 2017</xref>). It is well established that both components contribute to the multivalency of phase separation systems. Through use of RNA, including total RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Van Treeck and Parker, 2018</xref>), RNA with repeats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jain and Vale, 2017</xref>), artificial RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ries et al., 2019</xref>) or homopolymers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Elbaum-Garfinkle et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wei et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Boeynaems et al., 2019</xref>), and a handful of mRNAs, it has been demonstrated that RNA can phase separate without protein and that RNA can promote or inhibit phase separation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jain and Vale, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Maharana et al., 2018</xref>). It has also been shown that protein–RNA interactions can influence the identity and material properties of condensates in vitro and in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Elbaum-Garfinkle et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Langdon et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Boeynaems et al., 2019</xref>). However, as RNA is not a uniform entity, it is currently unknown how different RNAs influence various aspects of phase separation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Van Treeck and Parker, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jain and Vale, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ries et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Elbaum-Garfinkle et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wei et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Boeynaems et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Langdon et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Early on, it was established that spherical condensates are liquid-like (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brangwynne et al., 2009</xref>). Moreover, different phase separation systems can have a wide range of material properties ranging from liquid-like to gel-like to solid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alberti et al., 2019</xref>). Surface tension promotes sphere formation of liquid droplets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hyman et al., 2014</xref>). This led to the widely accepted conclusion that non-spherical and irregularly shaped condensates are aggregates and must be gel-like or solid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Molliex et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Qamar et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Boeynaems et al., 2019</xref>). Our recent finding contradicts this notion. In the course of our studies, we made the intriguing and, at first glance, paradoxical observation of condensates with mesh-like or filamentous morphology, but with dynamic protein components. This raised the question of how liquid-like, but non-spherical, organelles are generated and how their mesh-like morphology is determined.</p><p>We used chimeric RNA-binding proteins as models to study how the three-dimensional organization of mesh-like condensates is controlled and found that it is determined by RNA. We examined the influence of 47 human in vitro transcribed 3′UTRs on phase separation behavior of an RNA-binding protein. Whereas the addition of predominantly structured mRNAs generated spherical condensates, the addition of largely unstructured mRNAs induced formation of mesh-like condensates. In vitro and in vivo reconstitution experiments revealed that large unstructured RNA regions form extensive, multivalent intermolecular RNA–RNA interactions that drive the generation of mesh-like condensates whose protein components are highly mobile. The non-spherical geometry allows the dynamic membraneless organelles to maximize their surface area. This morphology may promote reactions that occur on the surface or in the interface between RNA granules and other organelles as is the case for TIS granules and the ER.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>RNA is required to generate mesh-like RNA granules in cells</title><p>TIS granules have a mesh-like morphology and form through assembly of the RNA-binding protein TIS11B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ma and Mayr, 2018</xref>).

This observation suggested that at this time point TIS granules generated from transfected constructs have somewhat dynamic protein components despite being irregularly shaped. This observation is reminiscent of L-bodies in frog oocytes, which have a mesh-like morphology but dynamic protein components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Neil et al., 2020</xref>). Our FRAP experiments suggested that the mesh-like shape of TIS granules obtained by transfection cannot simply be explained by gel-like biophysical properties. It is important to point out that the material properties of endogenous TIS granules are currently unknown as all experiments so far have been performed with fluorescently tagged TIS11B constructs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ma and Mayr, 2018</xref>).</p><p>As TIS11B binds to AU-rich elements and the localization element of the <italic>Vg1</italic> mRNA is highly AU-rich, we hypothesized that mRNAs play a role in determining the mesh-like morphology of condensates.

To assess the importance of the TIS11B RBD for mesh-like condensate formation, we tested if it results in network formation in the context of different multivalent domains. Expression of SUMO-SIM generates sphere-like condensates in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Banani et al., 2016</xref>).

In the context of FUS-TIS, the RBD of TIS11B is functional as it recruits the same mRNAs to the condensates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>).</p><p>Importantly, both FUS-TIS and SUMO-SIM-TIS show fast fluorescence recovery in FRAP experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), indicating that the filamentous networks have highly mobile protein components and are not aggregates. These experiments reveal that in the context of various multivalent domains the TIS11B RBD generates mesh-like condensates in vivo. Based on the current knowledge, this observation represents a paradox as it is thought that biomolecular condensates with dynamic protein components should be sphere-like because of surface tension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hyman et al., 2014</xref>). However, the seemingly liquid-like condensates generated by FUS-TIS and SUMO-SIM-TIS have mesh-like morphologies in cells. This observation motivated us to investigate how filamentous but liquid-like condensates are generated. To do so, we chose to perform in vitro reconstitution experiments with FUS-TIS as a model system as it formed mesh-like condensates and showed a highly dynamic behavior in the FRAP experiments in cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Specific RNAs drive mesh-like condensate formation in vitro</title><p>We recombinantly expressed and purified FUS-TIS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>).

Within this size-restricted cohort, the number of AU-rich elements or the GC-content of the RNA had no influence on network formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B, C</xref>). We then used RNAfold to predict the secondary structure of the RNAs. RNAfold predicts the minimum free energy secondary structure and the centroid structure, which is the RNA structure that contains a minimal base-pair distance to all structures in the thermodynamic ensemble (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gruber et al., 2008</xref>). Every RNA is predicted to have unstructured regions (indicated by the green and blue colors) and regions of strong local structure (red color code; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D, E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3A–D</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aw et al., 2016</xref>). We observed a strong association between the propensity of an RNA to induce network formation and the predicted ‘unstructured-ness’ of the RNA. For sphere-inducing RNAs, the majority of their nucleotides are predicted to form strong local structures, whereas RNAs with a high propensity for network formation are predicted to contain large, unstructured regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D, E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3A–D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata1">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>). We call the unstructured regions ‘large disordered regions’ (LDRs) of mRNAs.</p><p>Can we use RNA-fold-based structure prediction as a tool to identify network-forming RNAs? Ensemble diversity is the number of potential RNA structures that are predicted for a given RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lorenz et al., 2011</xref>). As ensemble diversity increases with RNA length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ding et al., 2005</xref>), we are using a length-normalized value (NED). RNAs with low NED values have predominantly strong local structures, whereas RNAs predicted to have high NED values often have LDRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D, E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3A–D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata1">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>). The NED values correlated strongly with the ability of an RNA to induce network formation and clearly separated the two groups of RNAs with respect to network formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). The majority of network-forming RNAs had NED values that were higher than 0.280, whereas the majority of sphere-forming RNAs had NED values lower than 0.265. This is consistent with their stronger secondary structure as, for example, highly structured RNAs such as tRNAs and six MS2 repeats have NED values of 0.04 and 0.17, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3E, F</xref>). We want to emphasize that we do not use RNAfold to predict the correct secondary structure of an RNA molecule, but we are using the NED value that estimates the conformational heterogeneity of an RNA as a tool to predict RNAs that induce formation of sphere-like or mesh-like condensates.</p><p>To test the predictive value of NED, we chose a new set of 24 AU-rich element-containing 3′UTRs purely based on their NED values and tested their network-forming abilities. We found that 19/24 (79%) of the tested RNAs were predicted correctly with respect to their sphere- or network-forming abilities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G,</xref> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4A, B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata1">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>). As the number of AU-rich elements in both groups is comparable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5A</xref>), the high success rate strongly suggests that LDRs of 3′UTRs determine network formation. To test this prediction experimentally, we performed a loss-of-function experiment. We used the <italic>TNFSF11</italic> 3′UTR that contains several LDRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>) and introduced strong local base-pairing by the addition of two oligonucleotides that were perfectly complementary to upstream regions and did not disrupt AU-rich elements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5B</xref>). The <italic>TNFSF11</italic> 3′UTR mutant has stronger local structures indicated by increased base-pairing and a lower NED value, and it has largely lost the ability for network formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H, I</xref>). Taken together, these results support a model wherein a high diversity of predicted structural conformations correlates with the extent of LDRs in RNAs and is associated with the formation of mesh-like condensates.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>RNAs work additively to induce formation of granule networks</title><p>The minimum RNA concentration for network formation was 20 nM.

Therefore, we tested whether two RNAs co-localize in the network. Labeling of several pairs of RNAs with two different fluorescent dyes showed that they co-localize (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Furthermore, the mixing of suboptimal amounts of four network-forming RNAs, together with FUS-TIS, resulted in network formation, indicating that the different RNAs have an additive effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Importantly, mixing 10 mRNAs together with FUS-TIS only required 2 nM (0.7–3.2 ng/µl) of each mRNA which is substantially lower than the average mRNA expression in cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).

We observed that the distribution of sphere-forming mRNAs is relatively uniform in the FUS-TIS condensates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A</xref>). In contrast, the network-forming mRNAs are unevenly distributed and generate an underlying scaffold for the phase-separated protein that resembles a skeleton (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>).</p><p>We propose the following speculative model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). Fusion of condensates that contain structured RNAs allows the mixing of components, thus resulting in the formation of larger spheres. Highly structured RNAs can be viewed to be globule-like, and their movement within condensates is only somewhat restricted due to very weak interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hyman et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Ranganathan and Shakhnovich, 2020</xref>). In contrast, the LDRs within RNAs (depicted as loops and tails) form pervasive interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E, F</xref>), thus forming an RNA matrix. When two condensates that contain such an RNA skeleton come into contact, the semi-rigidity of the crosslinked RNA network prevents full fusion and only allows mixing of the components at the contact sites. This arranges the condensates as beads-on-a-string and results in formation of filamentous mesh-like condensates whose protein components are dynamic. These data suggest that the fusion force provided by the surface tension of liquid condensates is counteracted by an anti-fusion effect provided by the underlying RNA matrix, thus forming a mesh-like condensate.</p><p>This model predicts that sphere-forming mRNAs are mobile and exchange with their environment, whereas network-forming mRNAs are static within the mesh-like condensates. We used FRAP on several RNAs to test the prediction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B</xref>).

These condensates include TIS granules and L-bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ma and Mayr, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Neil et al., 2020</xref>). In the process of investigating the morphology of TIS granules, we generated chimeric proteins with multivalent domains fused to the RBD of TIS11B and observed that these proteins generated mesh-like condensates with highly dynamic protein components in cells. This observation seemed paradoxical at first glance as surface tension is known to promote sphere formation of liquid-like droplets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hyman et al., 2014</xref>). This raised the question of how can liquid-like condensates have shapes other than spheres? To address this question, we used a reductionist approach and reconstituted mesh-like condensates in vitro and in vivo. We found that multivalent RNA–RNA interactions drive the formation of mesh-like condensates.</p><p>Our in vivo reconstitution of mesh-like condensates revealed that the minimal components consist of a multivalent RNA-binding protein that recruits RNAs that are able to form extensive intermolecular mRNA–mRNA interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). In contrast, if the same multivalent RNA-binding protein recruits RNAs without pervasive intermolecular interactions – that were generated through omission of RNA dimerization elements – mostly sphere-like condensates are generated in cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). In the in vitro experiments, both sphere-forming and network-forming RNAs are equally recruited to the condensates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A, D</xref>) as the chosen RNAs had comparable numbers of AU-rich elements, the known binding sites for the TIS11B RBD. This indicates that both mesh-like and sphere-like condensates contain RNAs, but they contain different kinds of RNAs. This is further exemplified by the FRAP experiments that revealed that RNAs that form sphere-like condensates show dynamic behavior, whereas RNAs that form mesh-like condensates have little or no FRAP recovery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>). The non-dynamic nature of these RNAs supports our model that pervasive interactions of these RNAs form an underlying RNA matrix that causes the mesh-like condensate morphology. Importantly, the characteristic FRAP behavior with dynamic protein components and non-dynamic RNA components was not only observed in our in vitro reconstitution experiments of mesh-like condensates, but also in the naturally occurring mesh-like L-bodies in frog oocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Neil et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Our results further indicate that a large fraction of 3′UTRs has high RNA multivalency. Our results show that the extent of RNA multivalency can be tested experimentally through native RNA gel analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C, E</xref>). The multivalent 3′UTRs have a high propensity to form pervasive intermolecular interactions. When they are present at high concentration, they form an RNA skeleton for mesh-like condensates. The multivalent 3′UTRs are further predicted to adopt diverse structural conformations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). As this feature correlates with ‘unstructured-ness’ of the RNA, our observations suggest that the formation of a multivalent RNA interaction network is an emergent property of unstructured mRNA. The most important RNA feature to induce formation of mesh-like condensates is their capacity for pervasive intermolecular RNA–RNA interactions. This means that predominantly structured RNAs that are somehow able to form extensive intermolecular interactions are also able to form mesh-like condensates. This was revealed by our in vivo reconstitution experiment where known RNA dimerization motifs that are mostly structured but that form a pervasive RNA matrix through multivalent RNA–RNA interactions are sufficient for mesh-like condensate formation in the presence of a multivalent RNA-binding protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).</p><p>It remains to be shown if pervasive RNA–RNA interactions are the basis for the mesh-like morphology of TIS granules. It is possible that binding of the TIS11B RBD to its target RNA could induce a conformational change in TIS11B, thus inducing condensation and branching. Such a mechanism was recently shown to be the case for G3BP1 that forms sphere-like granules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Yang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sanders et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Guillén-Boixet et al., 2020</xref>). Alternatively, the RNAs that are bound by TIS11B may have a high propensity for intermolecular RNA–RNA interactions, thus creating mesh-like TIS granules. This model is supported by our transcriptome-wide analysis on NED values. We found that the target mRNAs of TIS11B – which are characterized by the presence of multiple AU-rich elements in their 3′UTRs – have higher NED values than 3′UTRs without AU-rich elements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A, B</xref>). This predicts that mRNAs that are enriched in TIS granules are less structured and have a higher tendency to form multivalent RNA–RNA interactions, thus making it likely that an underlying RNA matrix causes the mesh-like morphology of TIS granules.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>3′UTRs may fulfill structural roles in the cytoplasm</title><p>Our data suggest that, in addition to acting as information templates for protein synthesis, mRNAs and, in particular, 3′UTRs may further fulfill roles as structural elements for cytoplasmic RNA granules. This is reminiscent of the scaffolding roles of lncRNAs in nuclear bodies, including paraspeckles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chujo et al., 2016</xref>). Both 3′UTRs and lncRNAs have a similar AU-content and hexamer composition that differs substantially from the coding region. This finding provides further support for the scaffolding role of 3′UTRs because a higher AU-content is associated with decreased RNA structure and higher RNA flexibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Niazi and Valadkhan, 2012</xref>). Here, we identified two RBDs (TIS11B and HuR) that both bind to longer 3′UTRs with high NED values that are able to form mesh-like condensates in cells. Therefore, it is likely that interacting 3′UTRs do not only act as RNA matrix for TIS granules and L-bodies, but may also scaffold additional cytoplasmic membraneless compartments, possibly on other membrane surfaces or on the cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Smith et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Béthune et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Formation of filamentous and mesh-like condensates is not restricted to the chimeric RNA-binding proteins used here but was also observed by others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Boeynaems et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Smith et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Neil et al., 2020</xref>).

The PR30 condensates showed little fluorescent recovery upon FRAP, thus, suggesting that physical cross-linking of the base-paired RNA structures and the PR molecules arrests phase separation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Boeynaems et al., 2019</xref>). It is likely that this represents a pathological feature of PR molecules that were shown previously to reduce FRAP recovery in many phase separation systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lee et al., 2016</xref>). In contrast, in our system, we used the TIS11B and HuR RBDs that bind to 3′UTRs that contain mixtures of structured and unstructured regions under physiological conditions.

As translation of these proteins does not require them to be incorporated into membranes, it seems that for these reactions the shape of TIS granules is irrelevant. Rather, these reactions may take advantage of the local environment generated by TIS granules where a connected membraneless compartment may enable the enriched protein components to exchange relatively freely, thus allowing the sharing of RNA-binding proteins and chaperones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ma and Mayr, 2018</xref>).</p><p>One potential biological implication for intermolecular mRNA–mRNA interactions in TIS granules could be to facilitate co-translational protein complex assembly.

RNA can also mimic the shape of proteins and protein interaction surfaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Athanassiou et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Shao and Hegde, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mizrak and Morgan, 2019</xref>). Here, we found that the network structure and morphogenesis of the tubular ER that is generated by proteins and lipids can be mimicked by phase-separated condensates formed by protein and RNA. Our work showed that dynamic subcellular structures with complex shapes can be generated through phase separation without the need for lipid membranes.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or <break/>reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td>HeLa</td><td>Jonathan S.

Only 3′UTRs with a length &lt;7500 nt can be analyzed by RNAfold. As the values for ensemble diversity depend on the sequence length, we calculated the NED by dividing the value of ensemble diversity by the length of the 3′UTR in nucleotides. All values are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig6sdata1">Figure 6—source data 1</xref>. For the 47 experimentally tested 3′UTRs, the NED values range from 0.18 to 0.38. Among the RNAs that induced mesh-like condensates (<italic>N</italic> = 28), 75% of them had NED values higher than 0.28, whereas 75% of the RNAs that induced sphere-like condensates had NED values lower than 0.265. We used these cut-offs to identify 3′UTRs with high or low NED values transcriptome-wide. The range of transcriptome-wide NED values is 0–0.44.</p></sec><sec id="s4-17"><title>3′UTR length, number of AU-rich elements, and HuR binding sites in 3′UTRs</title><p>The 3′UTR length is the full-length 3′UTR length obtained from Refseq. For counting of AU-rich elements, we only considered the canonical sequence AUUUA. We counted the number of AU-rich elements in annotated 3′UTRs of mRNAs expressed in HeLa cells. All values are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig6sdata1">Figure 6—source data 1</xref>.</p><p>PAR-CLIP data of HuR were analyzed from two datasets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lebedeva et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mukherjee et al., 2011</xref>). Processed peak files were downloaded from POSTAR2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zhu et al., 2019</xref>). Peaks were intersected with a bed file containing human 3′UTRs coordinates (hg38) using bedtools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Quinlan and Hall, 2010</xref>), and the number of CLIP tags that fall into 3′UTRs was counted. The union of CLIP tags was used to categorize the different groups, meaning that the indicated number of CLIP tags was detected in at least one dataset.</p></sec><sec id="s4-18"><title>Statistical methods</title><p>For all pair-wise comparisons, a two-sided Mann–Whitney test was performed.

Although mRNA can adopt secondary structures, it is generally considered to be a floppy molecule without much intrinsic structure. The authors use a score they derive from a folding program, the NED, that can distinguish RNAs with higher structure (similar to the circularization score in Aw, et al., 2016). These programs are usually suggestive rather than predictive and it's not particularly clear exactly what constitutes a disordered region. A test of the RNAs with higher NEDs (less structured) gives an encouraging 79% correspondence with mesh formation. RNAs with low NEDs sometimes could form meshes however (Figure 3, F and G). The line between high and low NEDs seems therefore arbitrary, as if another factor is missing that would make it clearer what is needed for network formation. It's not evident exactly how much the protein component contributes to the mesh formation in vivo, but apparently, it's a major contributor, more than the NED would suggest.</p><p>And then there's the question as to what all this means. The authors speculate about it in the Discussion (meshes presumably have more surface interactions, spheres are at the minimal available surface). The functional consequences of mesh disruption have been partially addressed experimentally in a previous publication as aiding in the localization and insertion of membrane proteins and perhaps co-translational assembly of protein complexes. This latter possibility is the most exciting, since it is not clear what role mRNA might play in the assembly of multipolypeptide complexes. A search through the databases might yield some physiological relevance for the mRNAs capable of intermolecular hybridization. This would be a major step toward understanding its contribution to cell physiology.</p><p>In all, I feel this work advances our insights into mechanisms leading to the spatial organization and compartmentalization in the cell. It is thoroughly done and at times gets into complex experimentation with a lot of variables (I had to read it four times), so will be a bit of a slog for the average reader. Nonetheless, the extra effort yielded new insights (to me at least) about the possibility of mRNA scaffolds controlling cell homeostasis.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>TIS granules form in various animal cells under physiological conditions. They display liquid-like properties typical of condensates that form during liquid-liquid phase separation and yet have a mesh-like morphology characteristic of condensates that undergo gelation. In their manuscript, Ma and co-authors aim to address how the mesh-like architecture of TIS granules arises in light of their liquid-likes properties. The authors propose that interacting mRNAs that enrich in TIS granules form an underlying network, which drives the irregular shape of TIS granules while allowing rapid exchange of the TIS granule resident proteins. The authors propose that the RNA structure confers the ability of mRNAs to engage in intermolecular RNA:RNA interactions, which then determines the morphology of TIS granules. The authors arrive at this model by examining the ability of in vitro transcribed 3'UTRs of 47 human mRNAs to induce the mesh-like architecture, all of which are proposed TIS11B targets. The authors find that in silico predicted unstructured 3' UTRs predominantly generated mesh-like granules, whereas, structured 3' UTRs tend to generate spherical granules. Based on these results the authors argued that unstructured RNA are more exposed and thus present more sequences amenable for intermolecular RNA:RNA base-pairing, which then drives the mesh-like granule architecture. In contrast, highly structured mRNAs cannot form such mRNA-mRNA interactions (or at least not many), preventing network formation, thus generating spherical condensates.</p><p>In general, this manuscript is well written and provides a coherent message. The images are clear. The authors used in vivo and in vitro systems to address their questions. The methods are well-written and the statistics are properly analyzed. The experiment in Figure 6 A-D is strong and provides compelling evidence for the authors' proposed model. In addition, FRAP data in Figure 7F and Figure 7—figure supplement 1B demonstrated that the RNAs within in vitro reconstituted TIS granules exchange less than the TIS-FUS resident protein that forms the granule and lands further support that the RNA could instruct the shape and stability of RNA granules. These observations agree well with previous in vitro and in vivo measurements which demonstrated that RNAs rather than the granule proteins appear as stable components of a condensate. Overall, I don't think that the authors' model is wrong, however I question whether the authors fully demonstrated that intermolecular RNA:RNA interactions are the major if not the only mechanism that determines the shape and biophysical properties of TIS granules as suggested by the authors. The properties of TIS granules have mostly been examined from a protein point of view and much less from an RNA point of view and mostly in vitro and the evidence of sequence-driven intermolecular RNA:RNA interactions occurring in vivo is very weak. The evidence of interactions occurring in vitro is not sufficient to conclude that these interactions also form in vivo. Specifically, trans-compensatory mutations, which would perturb intermolecular base-pairing and RNA structure are missing. Co-localization data of wild type and mutated interacting TIS11B target mRNAs in cells are also missing. Because of this and possible alternative models that could explain the data, it is difficult to unequivocally conclude that the intermolecular RNA:RNA interactions occur in vivo and that they are responsible for the mesh-like architecture of TIS granules. I have several comments the authors should address before their manuscript is published. While the authors could address these concerns experimentally to bolster their model, I also believe that instead most of these concerns could simply involve amendments to the writing. These re-writings would include a possibility of alternative models, and reflect a more suggestive rather than definitive model of how branched TIS granules could form through intermolecular RNA:RNA interactions. My comments are as follows:</p><p>The manuscript warrants publication in <italic>eLife</italic> but should have some conclusions/claims rewritten or addressed. The title of the authors' paper is &quot;A multivalent RNA matrix drives the formation of mesh-like condensates&quot;. However, the authors did not unequivocally demonstrate that multivalent intermolecular RNA:RNA interactions indeed occur in vivo and that they are responsible for the mesh-like architecture of TIS granules. In addition, alternative models could explain the data (see major comments posted originally). The authors could address these concerns with revisions of their claims and by discussing alternative models rather than providing substantial amount of additional experimentation. I have listed the concerns the authors should address in my initial review. The authors should also define the NED value better (see Figure 3). These are computational experiments and could be done quickly and should be included in the revised manuscript. Specifically, the authors should address if the NED values in Figure 3 are for 3' UTR or full-length RNA? Are the structures and NEDs of 3' UTRs shown in Figure 3D, E and G consistent with those 3' UTRs from the full-length RNAs? Are the mRNAs, which have unstructured 3'UTR also unstructured in full length? Finally, in Figure 3F, the authors should define the upper and lower limit of NED. Currently, it is difficult to judge whether the NEDs shown present a big or small difference. The authors should predict the NED for a very structured RNA, such as 24 MS2 repeats RNA or a tRNA as well as a linear RNA polymer, such as polyA or polyC RNA.</p><p>1) Evidence of pervasive mRNA-mRNA interactions occurring in vivo is missing. Based on the models in Figures 7E and 6D, the authors define intermolecular mRNA-mRNA interactions when one mRNA base pairs with another and propose possible RNA sequences that could base pair. However, this model was never tested. The dimerization experiments using in vitro RNA oligomerization assays revealed that RNAs indeed pair with each other in vitro (Figure 6) but whether this also occurs in vivo is unknown. To test their model, the authors should mutate RNA sequences in TLR8 and MYC to prevent dimerization and test the effect of these mutations on dimerization in vitro and in vivo and to test the effect these sequences have on the granule morphology. The authors could achieve this by using trans-compensatory mutations and mRNA co-localization experiments in vivo (see (Jambor et al., 2011, Ferrandon et al., 1997) for the outline of these experiments). In addition, using FISH, the authors should demonstrate that wild type, interacting mRNAs co-localize in cells while mutated mRNA don't. This should be done with interacting TIS11B target mRNAs.</p><p>2) The mesh-like architecture could be driven by a conformational change in the TIS11B protein induced by RNA-binding rather than by intermolecular RNA:RNA interactions. Specifically, the 3'UTRs of TIS11B target mRNAs CD47, ELAV and CD274 induce mesh-like structure of granules while the 3'UTR of FUS, which is not a target mRNAs of TIS11B does not (Figure 2A). However, 3'UTR of FUS is still recruited to the granule, even though it does not appear to be a TIS11B target. Thus, binding of the RNA binding domain (RBD) of TIS11B to its true target could induce a conformational change in TIS11B, which could then induce condensation and branching. A similar conformation-based model was recently proposed for the phase separation of the stress granule protein G3BP1/2 (Yang et al., 2020). This becomes more problematic when the authors test additional 3'UTRs belonging to 47 different human mRNAs. These RNAs all contain multiple AU-rich elements and are considered targets of TIS11B. I had a hard time finding data in the authors' current manuscript or their previous work, which demonstrates that these 47 3'UTRs are bona fide TIS11B targets. It is therefore difficult to determine whether specific binding of TIS11B RBD to true targets induces a conformational change in the protein, which then triggers the mesh-like behavior of granules or whether granule branching is indeed achieved through dimerizing RNAs.</p><p>3) The effect of RNA structure on intermolecular RNA:RNA interactions. RNA structure of 3'UTRs predicted in silico drives sphere or mesh-like appearance of TIS granules in vitro. More structured mRNAs cause spherical formation of the granules while less structured RNA tend to trigger mesh-like networks. As the authors propose, this could be due to availability of RNA sequences for intermolecular RNA:RNA interactions. They are exposed in unstructured mRNAs and hidden in structured ones. However, if I follow the point 2 I raised above, then the secondary structure could also hide RNA sequences in target mRNAs that TIS11B protein binds to regardless of how many predicted AU-rich sequences that 3'UTR might have. Conversely, less structured mRNAs could have more exposed sequences for TIS11B binding, which would influence the architecture of TIS granules. This model would also explain the lack of correlation between the number of AU elements and the morphology of granules (Figure 3—figure supplement 5).</p><p>4) Reconstituted SUMO-SIM-TIS and FUS-TIS granules do not recapitulate the biophysical properties of TIS11B granules and full length TIS11B granules appear hydrogel-like. The data demonstrate that the tagged full-length TIS11B forms granules that display hydrogel-like rather than liquid-like properties. Specifically, using FRAP, the authors show that a transiently transfected full-length (FL) TIS11B fused with mCherry forms mesh-like condensates reminiscent of the endogenous TIS11B protein. They determine that 16h after of transfection only 20% of TIS11B-GFP exchanged within 120 second. This slow exchange is characteristic of gel-like condensates rather than predominantly liquid-like condensates. This measurement is in contrast to the authors' statement where they indicated that TIS granules are &quot;liquid-like&quot; and that the granule resident proteins are &quot;highly mobile&quot;. In addition, to examine granules, the authors chose to work with fluorescently tagged chimeric FUS and SUMO-SIM proteins fussed with the RBD of TIS11B. In contrast to full-length TIS11B, these proteins form mesh-like granules that appear liquid-like; 75% of FUS-TIS exchanges in 25 seconds while close to 100% of SUMO-SIM fully exchanges in just a few seconds (Figure 1E). These data indicate that the chimeras did not recapitulate the basic behavior of TIS granules. In addition, the mCherry-TIS11B protein has a different recovery than mGFP-TIS11B, with the latter one recovering to ~ 43% in 10s (Figure 1—figure supplement 1A). The authors should address these discrepancies in recovery rates and whether TIS-granules are more gel-like instead of liquid-like. Finally, the rationale for switching from tagged FL TIS11B to FUS-TIS and SUMO-SIM-TIS is not clear particularly given that these chimeras do not recapitulate the behavior of FL TIS11B. It is therefore difficult to assess the effect of mRNAs on the biophysical properties of TIS granule resident proteins using a system that behaves fundamentally different than the endogenous system.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>In this study Ma et al. investigate the mechanisms influencing the unique morphology of TIS granules.

The authors use a combination of in vivo and in vitro reconstitution experiments using a TIS-FUS fusion protein and various RNAs.

The results are very intriguing and provocative and lend support for a key role for RNA in dictating the structure of membraneless organelles.</p><p>The mechanisms underlying the filamentous structure of TIS-FUS granules remains unclear. The authors consider the possibility that the filaments may be assemblies of smaller condensates that stick rather than fuse with each other, forming elongated &quot;beads on a string&quot;. This possibility could be tested by observing the morphology of the condensates at earlier time points. The authors may also want to refer to a recent theoretical study that explains how interactions between multivalent molecules can cause condensates to become kinetically arrested, i.e. unable to grow or fuse as the valency of molecules inside the condensates reach saturation (https://elifesciences.org/articles/56159). This theory may provide a good framework for the authors' observations.</p><p>1) An important question addressed by this study is how non-spherical condensates are formed from dynamic protein components. Accordingly, the authors use FRAP experiments to conclude that TIS11 behaves dynamically in vivo. However, only 40% of TIS11 signal recovers after photobleaching (Figure 1—figure supplement 1A). The authors should discuss whether this observation supports conventional liquid-like behavior, or whether a fraction of TIS11 in condensates may be non-dynamic. Stable assembly of TIS11 in vivo raises the possibility that TIS11 protein may contribute to mesh-like condensate assembly.</p><p>2) In many cases, the authors base their conclusions on observations made with transfected/tagged TIS11 proteins. Whether these conclusions apply to the native protein is not discussed (is endogenous TIS11 dynamic?). Also the authors should refrain from making sufficiency conclusions based solely on the behavior of transfected proteins. For example, – the TIS11 RNA binding domain is sufficient to make mesh-like condensates in vivo – what is the evidence that this domain is generating a condensate and not just simply localizing to a pre-existing structure?</p><p>3) The authors should include the control : GFP-FUS-Strep lacking the TIS11 RBD to ensure that the observed condensates require the TIS11 RBD.</p><p>4) The authors should note clearly in the text and figures that the crowding agent dextran is included in all in vitro phase separation assays. They might also comment on the behavior of their construct in the absence of 5% dextran.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.64252.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>The manuscript by Ma et al. investigates the filamentous condensates formed by RNA-protein interactions in cells that have been shown to be ER associated.

But it is likely that the ability of proteins to form mesh-like condensates is not limited to a specific multivalent domain, as various multivalent proteins, when bound to RNA, including TIS11B, FXR1, FUS-IDR, SUMO-SIM and PR peptides form mesh-like condensates.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>And then there's the question as to what all this means. The authors speculate about it in the Discussion (meshes presumably have more surface interactions, spheres are at the minimal available surface). The functional consequences of mesh disruption have been partially addressed experimentally in a previous publication as aiding in the localization and insertion of membrane proteins and perhaps co-translational assembly of protein complexes. This latter possibility is the most exciting, since it is not clear what role mRNA might play in the assembly of multipolypeptide complexes. A search through the databases might yield some physiological relevance for the mRNAs capable of intermolecular hybridization. This would be a major step toward understanding its contribution to cell physiology.</p></disp-quote><p>We currently do not have direct experimental evidence to show the biological relevance of mesh-like condensates. Before our study, mesh-like condensates were largely viewed as aggregates. We hope that our study will motivate more and more people to incorporate mesh-like condensates into their thinking and into their experimental approaches.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In all, I feel this work advances our insights into mechanisms leading to the spatial organization and compartmentalization in the cell. It is thoroughly done and at times gets into complex experimentation with a lot of variables (I had to read it four times), so will be a bit of a slog for the average reader. Nonetheless, the extra effort yielded new insights (to me at least) about the possibility of mRNA scaffolds controlling cell homeostasis.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>[…] My comments are as follows:</p><p>The manuscript warrants publication in eLife but should have some conclusions/claims rewritten or addressed. The title of the authors' paper is &quot;A multivalent RNA matrix drives the formation of mesh-like condensates&quot;. However, the authors did not unequivocally demonstrate that multivalent intermolecular RNA:RNA interactions indeed occur in vivo and that they are responsible for the mesh-like architecture of TIS granules. In addition, alternative models could explain the data (see major comments posted originally). The authors could address these concerns with revisions of their claims and by discussing alternative models rather than providing substantial amount of additional experimentation. I have listed the concerns the authors should address in my initial review. The authors should also define the NED value better (see Figure 3). These are computational experiments and could be done quickly and should be included in the revised manuscript. Specifically, the authors should address if the NED values in Figure 3 are for 3' UTR or full-length RNA? Are the structures and NEDs of 3' UTRs shown in Figure 3D, E and G consistent with those 3' UTRs from the full-length RNAs? Are the mRNAs, which have unstructured 3'UTR also unstructured in full length? Finally, in Figure 3F, the authors should define the upper and lower limit of NED. Currently, it is difficult to judge whether the NEDs shown present a big or small difference. The authors should predict the NED for a very structured RNA, such as 24 MS2 repeats RNA or a tRNA as well as a linear RNA polymer, such as polyA or polyC RNA.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for spending the time to review our manuscript and for the insightful comments. We have discussed alternative models in the revised manuscript.</p><p>Based on the reviewer’s suggestion, we changed the title. The new title is: in vivo reconstitution finds multivalent RNA-RNA interactions as drivers of mesh-like condensates.</p><p>NED values are for 3′UTRs. We used 3′UTRs in our study as they are not protected by ribosomes. We found a weak correlation between the NED values of 3′UTRs and NED values of the full-length mRNAs (Pearson R = 0.17; N = 7,455; P = 3x10<sup>49</sup>). For the 47 experimentally tested 3′UTRs, the NED values range from 0.18 – 0.38. The range of transcriptome-wide NED values is 0 – 0.44 (Figure 6—figure supplement 1). We have added this information to the Materials and methods.</p><p>As suggested, we predicted the NED for known structured RNAs. The NED value of tRNA and 6xMS2 are 0.04 and 0.17 respectively, which is consistent with their strong local secondary structures. We added some context to the Results when we describe the NED.</p><p>We also predicted the NED values of polyA or polyC RNA, both are 0. This is probably because polyA or polyC cannot form any intramolecular base pairing. We did not include this in the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) Evidence of pervasive mRNA-mRNA interactions occurring in vivo is missing. Based on the models in Figures 7E and 6D, the authors define intermolecular mRNA-mRNA interactions when one mRNA base pairs with another and propose possible RNA sequences that could base pair. However, this model was never tested. The dimerization experiments using in vitro RNA oligomerization assays revealed that RNAs indeed pair with each other in vitro (Figure 6) but whether this also occurs in vivo is unknown. To test their model, the authors should mutate RNA sequences in TLR8 and MYC to prevent dimerization and test the effect of these mutations on dimerization in vitro and in vivo and to test the effect these sequences have on the granule morphology. The authors could achieve this by using trans-compensatory mutations and mRNA co-localization experiments in vivo (see (Jambor et al., 2011, Ferrandon et al., 1997) for the outline of these experiments). In addition, using FISH, the authors should demonstrate that wild type, interacting mRNAs co-localize in cells while mutated mRNA don't. This should be done with interacting TIS11B target mRNAs.</p></disp-quote><p>In our in vitro and in vivo reconstitution experiment, the engineered RNAs have three degrees of valency (TLR8-MYC interaction, interaction of D1-D1, and interaction of D2-D2) to enable multivalent RNA-RNA interactions. We used two well-studied dimerization elements: the HIV dimerization motif and the tracrRNA/crRNA dimerization motifs from the CRISPR system. Both dimerization motifs were reported in the literature to dimerize in vivo (Paillart et al., 2004)(Khan et al., 2019).</p><p>To show the importance of RNA multivalency in our reconstitution experiment we disrupted the multivalent RNA-RNA interactions. To do so, we removed the dimerization elements D1 and D2. We showed both in vitro and in vivo that reduction of valency (lack of D1 and D2) leads to a dramatic decrease in the ability to induce formation of mesh-like condensates. This result supports our conclusion that multivalent RNA-RNA interactions are required to induce formation of mesh-like condensates.</p><p>In our opinion, this experiment is equivalent to mutating the TLR8 or MYC mRNAs as in our manuscript, we only emphasize the requirement of multivalent RNA interactions. We do not focus on specific mRNAs or particular sequence-specific RNA-RNA interactions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The mesh-like architecture could be driven by a conformational change in the TIS11B protein induced by RNA-binding rather than by intermolecular RNA:RNA interactions. Specifically, the 3'UTRs of TIS11B target mRNAs CD47, ELAV and CD274 induce mesh-like structure of granules while the 3'UTR of FUS, which is not a target mRNAs of TIS11B does not (Figure 2A). However, 3'UTR of FUS is still recruited to the granule, even though it does not appear to be a TIS11B target. Thus, binding of the RNA binding domain (RBD) of TIS11B to its true target could induce a conformational change in TIS11B, which could then induce condensation and branching. A similar conformation-based model was recently proposed for the phase separation of the stress granule protein G3BP1/2 (Yang et al., 2020). This becomes more problematic when the authors test additional 3'UTRs belonging to 47 different human mRNAs. These RNAs all contain multiple AU-rich elements and are considered targets of TIS11B. I had a hard time finding data in the authors' current manuscript or their previous work, which demonstrates that these 47 3'UTRs are bona fide TIS11B targets. It is therefore difficult to determine whether specific binding of TIS11B RBD to true targets induces a conformational change in the protein, which then triggers the mesh-like behavior of granules or whether granule branching is indeed achieved through dimerizing RNAs.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the insightful comment. It is possible that the formation of mesh-like morphology is driven by a conformational change in the RNA-binding protein. In our opinion, this model cannot fully explain our experimental results. This model would only work if all by chance all network-forming RNAs are true targets and all sphere-forming RNAs are not true targets despite having the similar numbers of AU-rich elements. AU-rich elements are the binding sites for TIS11B, but their presence does not prove that TIS11B actually binds. In the meantime, we obtained iCLIP data for TIS11B and found no difference in the number of iCLIP tags in sphere-forming vs network-forming RNAs.</p><p>Besides, in our in vivo reconstitution experiment, we use the MS2 coat protein and SUMO-SIM, and mRNAs are recruited to the condensates by MS2 repeats. All RNAs have the same MS2 binding sites and are true targets of MCP-SUMO-SIM. But still, when the RNA dimerization motifs D1 and D2 were eliminated, the ability to induce mesh-like condensate formation is significantly reduced compared to RNAs that contain the D1 and D2 elements. Therefore, we do not think that our data are better explained by a model that infers a conformational change in the protein.</p><p>For TIS granules, our transcriptome-wide analysis showed that TIS11B target mRNAs have a high propensity to form multivalent RNA-RNA interactions as they are enriched for large disordered regions and have high NED values. It is likely that multivalent RNA-RNA interactions are responsible for the mesh-like morphology of TIS granules. Nevertheless, we agree with the reviewer that we do not have direct evidence to show that multivalent RNA-RNA interactions happen in TIS granules. We cannot exclude the possibility that the mesh-like architecture of TIS granules could be driven by a conformational change in the TIS11B protein induced by RNA-binding. It is possible that TIS granules either use RNA interactions or a conformational change, or that both mechanisms contribute to its mesh-like morphology. We have added this alternative model to our manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The effect of RNA structure on intermolecular RNA:RNA interactions. RNA structure of 3'UTRs predicted in silico drives sphere or mesh-like appearance of TIS granules in vitro. More structured mRNAs cause spherical formation of the granules while less structured RNA tend to trigger mesh-like networks. As the authors propose, this could be due to availability of RNA sequences for intermolecular RNA:RNA interactions. They are exposed in unstructured mRNAs and hidden in structured ones. However, if I follow the point 2 I raised above, then the secondary structure could also hide RNA sequences in target mRNAs that TIS11B protein binds to regardless of how many predicted AU-rich sequences that 3'UTR might have. Conversely, less structured mRNAs could have more exposed sequences for TIS11B binding, which would influence the architecture of TIS granules. This model would also explain the lack of correlation between the number of AU elements and the morphology of granules (Figure 3—figure supplement 5).</p></disp-quote><p>Both groups of mRNAs have similar numbers of TIS11B binding sites identified by iCLIP, suggesting that similar numbers of binding sites are accessible. See our response to comment 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Reconstituted SUMO-SIM-TIS and FUS-TIS granules do not recapitulate the biophysical properties of TIS11B granules and full length TIS11B granules appear hydrogel-like. The data demonstrate that the tagged full-length TIS11B forms granules that display hydrogel-like rather than liquid-like properties. Specifically, using FRAP, the authors show that a transiently transfected full-length (FL) TIS11B fused with mCherry forms mesh-like condensates reminiscent of the endogenous TIS11B protein. They determine that 16h after of transfection only 20% of TIS11B-GFP exchanged within 120 second. This slow exchange is characteristic of gel-like condensates rather than predominantly liquid-like condensates. This measurement is in contrast to the authors' statement where they indicated that TIS granules are &quot;liquid-like&quot; and that the granule resident proteins are &quot;highly mobile&quot;. In addition, to examine granules, the authors chose to work with fluorescently tagged chimeric FUS and SUMO-SIM proteins fussed with the RBD of TIS11B. In contrast to full-length TIS11B, these proteins form mesh-like granules that appear liquid-like; 75% of FUS-TIS exchanges in 25 seconds while close to 100% of SUMO-SIM fully exchanges in just a few seconds (Figure 1E). These data indicate that the chimeras did not recapitulate the basic behavior of TIS granules. In addition, the mCherry-TIS11B protein has a different recovery than mGFP-TIS11B, with the latter one recovering to ~ 43% in 10s (Figure 1—figure supplement 1A). The authors should address these discrepancies in recovery rates and whether TIS-granules are more gel-like instead of liquid-like. Finally, the rationale for switching from tagged FL TIS11B to FUS-TIS and SUMO-SIM-TIS is not clear particularly given that these chimeras do not recapitulate the behavior of FL TIS11B. It is therefore difficult to assess the effect of mRNAs on the biophysical properties of TIS granule resident proteins using a system that behaves fundamentally different than the endogenous system.</p></disp-quote><p>In our previous paper, we performed FRAP experiments after 16 hours of transfection of mCherry-TIS11B and observed that only about 20% of the fluorescent signal recovered in 120 seconds. This observation led to the conclusion that the mesh-like morphology of TIS granules is simply caused by their gel-like nature. Later, we performed FRAP experiments after 5 hours of transfection of GFP-TIS11B and observed that 43% of the fluorescent signal recovered in 10 seconds. At this time point, it is impossible to record longer as TIS granules move very fast in cells. Because of 43% recovery in 10 seconds, we did no longer consider TIS granules as gel-like and we described them in this manuscript as “somewhat dynamic”. At the 5-hour time point the morphology of TIS granules is irregular.

When we saw that the mesh-like condensates formed by SUMO-SIM-TIS or FUS-TIS showed fast FRAP recovery (their fluorescence recovered to more than 75% and 90% within 30 seconds of bleaching), we became very excited. Based on the FRAP data, SUMO-SIM-TIS and FUS-TIS condensates would be considered to have liquid-like properties.

We are not saying that this is the only mechanism as there are likely other mechanisms that induce mesh-like condensates with dynamic protein components.</p><p>We added a more extensive explanation on the rationale for the use of chimeric proteins to the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>In this study Ma et al. investigate the mechanisms influencing the unique morphology of TIS granules. TIS granules are elongated, filamentous condensates that form extensive contacts with the ER. The authors use a combination of in vivo and in vitro reconstitution experiments using a TIS-FUS fusion protein and various RNAs. They find that long unstructured RNAs are best at generating condensates resembling TIS granules. In contrast, RNAs with secondary structure form rounder condensates. The results are very intriguing and provocative and lend support for a key role for RNA in dictating the structure of membraneless organelles.</p><p>The mechanisms underlying the filamentous structure of TIS-FUS granules remains unclear. The authors consider the possibility that the filaments may be assemblies of smaller condensates that stick rather than fuse with each other, forming elongated &quot;beads on a string&quot;. This possibility could be tested by observing the morphology of the condensates at earlier time points. The authors may also want to refer to a recent theoretical study that explains how interactions between multivalent molecules can cause condensates to become kinetically arrested, i.e. unable to grow or fuse as the valency of molecules inside the condensates reach saturation (https://elifesciences.org/articles/56159). This theory may provide a good framework for the authors' observations.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for spending the time to review our manuscript and for the insightful comments. We did confocal 3D time-lapse imaging of FUS-TIS condensates in vitro after 30 min of mixing with CD47 3′UTR RNA (network formation) or TLR8 3′UTR RNA (sphere formation). The results showed that smaller FUS-TIS condensates mixed with CD47 3′UTR RNA stick rather than fuse with each other. The data were shown in Figures 7A and 7B. In cells, the morphology of FUS-TIS condensates cannot be observed at an earlier time point as they move very fast when they are small. We thank the reviewer for suggesting to cite this paper. We added it to the new version of the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) An important question addressed by this study is how non-spherical condensates are formed from dynamic protein components. Accordingly, the authors use FRAP experiments to conclude that TIS11 behaves dynamically in vivo. However, only 40% of TIS11 signal recovers after photobleaching (Figure 1—figure supplement 1A). The authors should discuss whether this observation supports conventional liquid-like behavior, or whether a fraction of TIS11 in condensates may be non-dynamic. Stable assembly of TIS11 in vivo raises the possibility that TIS11 protein may contribute to mesh-like condensate assembly.</p></disp-quote><p>In our previous paper, we performed FRAP experiments after 16 hours of transfection of mCherry-TIS11B and observed that only about 20% of the fluorescent signal recovered in 120 seconds.

Whether these conclusions apply to the native protein is not discussed (is endogenous TIS11 dynamic?). Also the authors should refrain from making sufficiency conclusions based solely on the behavior of transfected proteins. For example, – the TIS11 RNA binding domain is sufficient to make mesh-like condensates in vivo – what is the evidence that this domain is generating a condensate and not just simply localizing to a pre-existing structure?</p></disp-quote><p>As pointed out in the manuscript and in the previous comment, the manuscript does not primarily focus on TIS granules as we currently do not have the tools to assess the material properties of endogenous TIS granules. However, our findings are likely valid for endogenous TIS granules because our transcriptome-wide analyses showed that the TIS11B target mRNAs have higher NED values than other mRNAs and thus, have a higher propensity to form multivalent RNA-RNA interactions.

However, the size and localization of SUMO-SIM-TIS condensates is very different from both FUS-TIS condensates and endogenous TIS granules. Therefore, it is unlikely that they simply localize to endogenous TIS granules. But we cannot exclude the possibility that FUS-TIS and SUMO-SIM-TIS localize to two different pre-existing structures. We have deleted the statement of sufficiency.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors should include the control : GFP-FUS-Strep lacking the TIS11 RBD to ensure that the observed condensates require the TIS11 RBD.</p></disp-quote><p>It was reported by Anthony Hyman’s lab that FUS IDR requires a very high concentration to undergo phase separation. With 10% dextran, a concentration of more than 20 µM is required to induce significant phase separation of the FUS IDR (Jie et al., Cell 2018. Figure S2D). In our experiment, we use 10 µM protein and 5% dextran. With this condition, we expect that the FUS IDR will not undergo phase separation.
