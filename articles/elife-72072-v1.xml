both between and within species, has been long known to be shaped by the mutualistic interactions that plants establish with their pollinators. However, increasing evidence suggests that abiotic selection pressures influence floral diversity as well. Here, we analyse the genetic and environmental factors that underlie patterns of floral pigmentation in wild sunflowers. While sunflower inflorescences appear invariably yellow to the human eye, they display extreme diversity for patterns of ultraviolet pigmentation, which are visible to most pollinators. We show that this diversity is largely controlled by <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory variation affecting a single MYB transcription factor, HaMYB111, through accumulation of ultraviolet (UV)-absorbing flavonol glycosides in ligules (the ‘petals’ of sunflower inflorescences). Different patterns of ultraviolet pigments in flowers are strongly correlated with pollinator preferences. Furthermore, variation for floral ultraviolet patterns is associated with environmental variables, especially relative humidity, across populations of wild sunflowers. Ligules with larger ultraviolet patterns, which are found in drier environments, show increased resistance to desiccation, suggesting a role in reducing water loss. The dual role of floral UV patterns in pollinator attraction and abiotic response reveals the complex adaptive balance underlying the evolution of floral traits.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Flowers are an important part of how many plants reproduce. Their distinctive colours, shapes and patterns attract specific pollinators, but they can also help to protect the plant from predators and environmental stresses.</p><p>Many flowers contain pigments that absorb ultraviolet (UV) light to display distinct UV patterns – although invisible to the human eye, most pollinators are able to see them. For example, when seen in UV, sunflowers feature a ‘bullseye’ with a dark centre surrounded by a reflective outer ring. The sizes and thicknesses of these rings vary a lot within and between flower species, and so far, it has been unclear what causes this variation and how it affects the plants.</p><p>To find out more, Todesco et al. studied the UV patterns in various wild sunflowers across North America by considering the ecology and molecular biology of different plants. This revealed great variation between the UV patterns of the different sunflower populations. Moreover, Todesco et al. found that a gene called <italic>HaMYB111</italic> is responsible for the diverse UV patterns in the sunflowers. This gene controls how plants make chemicals called flavonols that absorb UV light.</p><p>Flavonols also help to protect plants from damage caused by droughts and extreme temperatures. Todesco et al. showed that plants with larger bullseyes had more flavonols, attracted more pollinators, and were better at conserving water. Accordingly, these plants were found in drier locations.</p><p>This study suggests that, at least in sunflowers, UV patterns help both to attract pollinators and to control water loss. These insights could help to improve pollination – and consequently yield – in cultivated plants, and to develop plants with better resistance to extreme weather. This work also highlights the importance of combining biology on small and large scales to understand complex processes, such as adaptation and evolution.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>sunflower</kwd><kwd>floral pigmentation</kwd><kwd>pollination</kwd><kwd>abiotic stress</kwd><kwd>adaptation</kwd><kwd>transcription factors</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd><kwd>Sunflower (Helianthus annuus)</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008762</institution-id><institution>Genome Canada</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>LSARP2014-223SUN</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Todesco</surname><given-names>Marco</given-names></name><name><surname>Rieseberg</surname><given-names>Loren H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000233</institution-id><institution>Genome British Columbia</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>LSARP2014-223SUN</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Todesco</surname><given-names>Marco</given-names></name><name><surname>Rieseberg</surname><given-names>Loren H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>IOS-1444522</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rieseberg</surname><given-names>Loren H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>IOS-1759942</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Blackman</surname><given-names>Benjamin K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004412</institution-id><institution>Human Frontier Science Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>LT000780/2013</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Todesco</surname><given-names>Marco</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006978</institution-id><institution>University of California Berkeley</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Blackman</surname><given-names>Benjamin K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Variation in patterns of floral UV pigmentation is controlled by a single transcription factor in sunflower and affects both pollinator attraction and responses to environmental stresses.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The diversity in colour and colour patterns found in flowers is one of the most extraordinary examples of adaptive variation in the plant world. As remarkable as the variation that we can observe is, even more of it lays just outside our perception. Many species accumulate pigments that absorb ultraviolet (UV) radiation in their flowers; while these patterns are invisible to the human eye, they can be perceived by pollinators, most of which can be seen in the near UV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chittka et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Tovée, 1995</xref>). UV patterns have been shown to increase floral visibility and to have a major influence on pollinator visitation and preference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brock et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Horth et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Rae and Vamosi, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sheehan et al., 2016</xref>). Besides their importance for pollinator attraction, patterns of UV-absorbing pigments in flowers have increasingly been recognized to have a role in responses to other biotic and abiotic factors, including defence against insect herbivory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gronquist et al., 2001</xref>), protection against UV radiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Koski and Ashman, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Koski et al., 2020</xref>), and adaptation to different temperatures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Koski and Ashman, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Koski et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Sunflowers are one of the most recognizable members of the Asteraceae family, which comprises circa 10% of all flowering plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mandel et al., 2019</xref>). Besides cultivated sunflower, about 50 species of wild sunflowers are found across North America. Wild sunflowers are adapted to a variety of different habitats and display a remarkable amount of phenotypic and genetic diversity, which makes them a model system for studies of adaptation, speciation, and domestication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bock et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Heiser et al., 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Todesco et al., 2020</xref>). In addition to being a major crop, sunflowers are also ubiquitous in popular culture, largely due to their iconic yellow inflorescences. Indeed, like many Asteraceae species, wild sunflowers have ligules (the enlarged modified petals of the outermost whorl of florets in the sunflower inflorescence) that appear of the same bright yellow colour to the human eye. However, ligules also accumulate UV-absorbing pigments at their base, while their tip reflects UV radiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Harborne and Smith, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Wojtaszek and Maier, 2014</xref>). Across the whole inflorescence, this results in a bullseye pattern, with an external UV-reflecting ring and an internal UV-absorbing ring. Considerable variation in the size of UV bullseye patterns has been observed between and within plant species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Koski and Ashman, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Koski and Ashman, 2016</xref>); however, few studies have investigated the ecological factors that drive this variation or the genetic determinants that control it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brock et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Koski and Ashman, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Moyers et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sheehan et al., 2016</xref>). Here, we explore the diversity of floral UV pigmentation in wild sunflowers and the genetic mechanisms and environmental factors that shape this variation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Floral UV patterns in wild sunflowers</title><p>A preliminary screening of 19 species of wild sunflowers, as well as cultivated sunflower, suggested that UV bullseye patterns are common across sunflower species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). In several cases, we also observed substantial within-species variation for the size of UV floral patterns. Patterns of floral UV pigmentation have been previously investigated in the silverleaf sunflower <italic>Helianthus argophyllus</italic>, which is endemic to Southern Texas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Limited diversity was found between individuals, but transgressive segregation was observed in mapping populations; while several QTL affecting this trait were detected, genetic mapping resolution was insufficient to identify individual causal genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Moyers et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>To better understand the function and genetic regulation of variation for floral UV pigmentation, we focused on two widespread species of annual sunflowers, <italic>Helianthus annuus</italic> and <italic>Helianthus petiolaris. H. annuus</italic>, the common sunflower, grows across most of North America; it is probably the most diverse of the sunflower species and is the progenitor of domesticated sunflower (<italic>H. annuus</italic> var. <italic>macrocarpus</italic>). <italic>H. petiolaris</italic> also has a broad distribution across North America, but prefers sandier soils. It includes two subspecies: subsp. <italic>petiolaris</italic>, which is common in the central plains of the United States, and subsp. <italic>fallax</italic>, which is found in the Southwestern USA and has repeatedly adapted to growing on sand dunes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Heiser et al., 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Todesco et al., 2020</xref>). Over two growing seasons, we measured floral UV patterns (as the proportion of the ligule that absorbs UV radiation, henceforth ‘ligule ultraviolet proportion’ [LUVp]) in 1589 <italic>H</italic>. <italic>annuus</italic> individuals derived from 110 distinct natural populations and 351 <italic>H</italic>. <italic>petiolaris</italic> individuals from 40 populations, grown in common garden experiments in Vancouver, Canada (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Todesco et al., 2020</xref>). The populations of origin of these plants were selected to represent the whole range of <italic>H. annuus</italic>, and most of the range of <italic>H. petiolaris</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a and b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). While extensive variation was observed within both species, it was particularly striking for <italic>H. annuus</italic>, which displayed a phenotypic continuum from ligules with almost no UV pigmentation to ligules that were entirely UV-absorbing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c–e</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata2">Figure 1—source data 2</xref>). Floral UV patterns have been proposed to act as nectar guides, helping pollinators orient towards nectar rewards once they land on the petal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Daumer, 1958</xref>), although recent experiments have challenged this hypothesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Koski et al., 2014</xref>). A relatively high proportion of <italic>H. annuus</italic> individuals in our survey (~13%) had completely UV-absorbing ligules and therefore lacked UV nectar guides, suggesting that pollinator orientation is not a necessary function of floral UV pigmentation in sunflower.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Diversity for floral ultraviolet (UV) pigmentation patterns in wild sunflowers.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Geographical distribution of sampled populations for <italic>H. annuus</italic> and (<bold>b</bold>) <italic>H. petiolaris</italic>.

Crucially, they absorb strongly in the near UV range (300–400 nm) and are the pigments responsible for floral UV patterns in several plant species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rieseberg and Schilling, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sheehan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Thompson et al., 1972</xref>).

Both quercetin glycosides and CQA were more abundant at the base of sunflower ligules, and in ligules of plants with larger LUVp. However, this pattern was much more dramatic for flavonols, and they represented a much larger fraction of the total UV absorbance in UV-absorbing (parts of) ligules, suggesting that flavonols are the main pigments responsible for UV patterning in sunflower ligules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a and b</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title><italic>MYB111</italic> is associated with floral ultraviolet (UV) pigmentation patterns and flavonol accumulation in sunflower and <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) UV chromatograms (350 nm) for methanolic extracts of the upper and lower third of ligules with intermediate UV patterns, and (<bold>b</bold>) of ligules with large and small floral UV patterns.

Similar to observations in <italic>Rudbeckia hirta</italic>, another member of the <italic>Heliantheae</italic> tribe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Schlangen et al., 2009</xref>), UV pigmentation is established early in ligule development in both <italic>H. annuus</italic> and <italic>H. petiolaris</italic> as their visible colour turns from green to yellow before the inflorescence opens (R4 developmental stage; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Schneiter and Miller, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3g</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). <italic>HaMYB111</italic> is highly expressed in the part of the ligule that accumulates UV-absorbing pigments, and especially in developing ligules, consistent with a role in establishing pigmentation patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3h</xref>). We also observed a matching expression pattern for <italic>HaFLS1</italic>, the sunflower homolog of a gene encoding one of the main enzymes controlling flavonol biosynthesis in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (<italic>FLAVONOL SYNTHASE 1, AtFLS1</italic>), whose expression is regulated directly by <italic>AtMYB111</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Stracke et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3i</xref>). Finally, we compared <italic>HaMYB111</italic> expression levels in a set of 46 field-grown individuals with contrasting LUVp values, representing 21 different wild populations. <italic>HaMYB111</italic> expression levels differed significantly between the two groups (p=0.009; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3j</xref>). Variation in expression levels within phenotypic classes was quite large; this is likely due at least in part to the strong dependence of <italic>HaMYB111</italic> expression on developmental stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3g</xref>) and the difficulty of accurately establishing matching ligule developmental stages across diverse wild sunflowers.</p><p>These expression analyses further point to <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory rather than coding sequence differences between <italic>HaMYB111</italic> alleles being responsible for LUVp variation. Accordingly, direct sequencing of the <italic>HaMYB111</italic> locus from multiple wild <italic>H. annuus</italic> individuals, using a combination of Sanger sequencing and long PacBio HiFi reads, identified no coding sequence variants associated with differences in floral UV patterns, or with alleles at the Chr15_LUVp SNP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1 supp2">Supplementary files 1 and 2</xref>). However, we observed extensive variation in the promoter region of <italic>HaMYB111</italic>, differentiating wild <italic>H. annuus</italic> alleles from each other and from the reference assembly for cultivated sunflower (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3 supp4">Supplementary files 3 and 4</xref>). Relaxing quality filters to include less well-supported SNPs in our LUVp GWAS did not identify additional variants with stronger associations than Chr15_LUVp SNP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). However, many of the polymorphisms we identified by direct sequencing were either larger insertions/deletions (indels) or fell in regions that were too repetitive to allow accurate mapping of short reads, and would not be included even in this expanded SNP dataset. While several of these variants in the promoter region of <italic>HaMYB111</italic> appeared to be associated with the Chr15_LUVp SNP, further studies will be required to confirm this, and to identify their eventual effects on <italic>HaMYB111</italic> activity (see discussion in the legend of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, when we sequenced the promoter region of <italic>HaMYB111</italic> in several <italic>H. argophyllus</italic> and <italic>H. petiolaris</italic> individuals, we found that they all carried the S allele at the Chr15_LUVp SNP, and that their promoter regions were generally more similar in sequence to those of <italic>H. annuus</italic> individuals carrying the S allele at the Chr15_LUVp SNP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3 supp4">Supplementary files 3 and 4</xref>). Similarly, in a set of previously re-sequenced wild sunflowers, we found the S allele to be fixed in several perennial (<italic>Helianthus decapetalus</italic>, <italic>Helianthus divaricatus,</italic> and <italic>Helianthus grosseserratus</italic>) and annual sunflower species (<italic>H. argophyllus</italic>, <italic>Helianthus niveus</italic>, <italic>Helianthus debilis</italic>), and to be at &gt;0.98 frequency in <italic>H. petiolaris</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata2">Figure 1—source data 2</xref>). Conversely, the L allele at Chr15_LUVp SNP was almost fixed (&gt;0.98 frequency) in a set of 285 cultivated sunflower lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mandel et al., 2013</xref>). Consistent with these patterns, UV bullseyes are considerably smaller in <italic>H. argophyllus</italic> (mean LUVp ± SD = 0.27 ± 0.09), <italic>H. niveus</italic> (0.15 ± 0.09), and <italic>H. petiolaris</italic> (0.27 ± 0.12; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>) than in cultivated sunflower lines (0.62 ± 0.23). Additionally, while 50 of the cultivated sunflower lines had completely or almost completely UV-absorbing ligules (LUVp &gt; 0.8), no such case was observed in the other three species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>A dual role for floral UV pigmentation</title><p>Although our results show that <italic>HaMYB111</italic> explains most of the variation in floral UV pigmentation patterns in wild <italic>H. annuus</italic>, why such variation exists in the first place is less clear. Several hypotheses have been advanced to explain the presence of floral UV patterns and their variability. Like their visible counterparts, UV pigments play a fundamental role in pollinator attraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Horth et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Koski et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Rae and Vamosi, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sheehan et al., 2016</xref>). For example, in <italic>Rudbeckia</italic> species, artificially increasing the size of bullseye patterns to up to 90% of the petal surface resulted in rates of pollinator visitation equal to or higher than wild-type flowers (which have on average 40–60% of the petal being UV-absorbing). Conversely, reducing the size of the UV bullseye had a strong negative effect on pollinator visitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Horth et al., 2014</xref>). To test whether the relative size of UV bullseye patterns affected pollination, we assessed insect visitation rates for wild <italic>H. annuus</italic> lines with contrasting UV bullseye patterns. An initial experiment compared inflorescences from pairs of plants from two populations (ANN_03 from California and ANN_55 from Texas), which were selected to have large or small floral UV patterns. In this setup, inflorescences with large UV patterns received significantly more visits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>). While this experiment revealed a clear pattern of pollinator preferences, it involved plants from only two different populations, and effects of other unmeasured factors unrelated to UV pigmentation on visitation patterns cannot be excluded. Therefore, we monitored pollinator visitation in plants grown in a common garden experiment including 1484 individuals from 106 <italic>H</italic>. <italic>annuus</italic> populations, spanning the entire range of the species. Assaying a much more diverse population of <italic>H. annuus</italic> individuals should reduce effects on pollinator preferences of traits unrelated to floral UV pigmentation. Within this field, we selected 82 plants, from 49 populations, which flowered at roughly the same time and had comparable numbers of flowers. We selected plants falling into three categories of LUVp values, representatives of the more abundant phenotypic classes across the range of wild <italic>H. annuus</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>): small (LUVp = 0–0.3), intermediate (LUVp = 0.5–0.8), and large (LUVp &gt;0.95). Plants with intermediate UV patterns had the highest visitation rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Visitation to plants with small or large UV patterns was less frequent, and particularly low for plants with very small LUVp values (&lt;0.15). Pollination rates are known to be yield-limiting in sunflower (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Greenleaf and Kremen, 2006</xref>), and a strong reduction in pollination could therefore have a negative effect on fitness; this would be consistent with the observation that plants with very small LUVp values were rare (~1.5% of individuals) in our common garden experiment, which was designed to provide a balanced representation of the natural range of <italic>H. annuus</italic>. Although pollinator preferences in this experiment could still be affected by other unmeasured factors (nectar content, floral volatiles), these results are consistent with previous results showing that floral UV patterns play a major role in pollinator attraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Horth et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Koski et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Rae and Vamosi, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sheehan et al., 2016</xref>). They also agree with earlier findings in other plant species, suggesting that intermediate-to-large UV bullseyes are preferred by pollinators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Horth et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Koski et al., 2014</xref>). While we cannot exclude that smaller UV bullseyes would be preferred by pollinators in some parts of the <italic>H. annuus</italic> range, this does not seem likely; the most common pollinators of sunflower are ubiquitous across the range of <italic>H. annuus</italic>, and many bee species known to pollinate sunflower are found in both regions where <italic>H. annuus</italic> populations have large LUVp and regions where they have small LUVp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hurd et al., 1980</xref>). Therefore, while acting as visual cues for pollinators is clearly a major function of floral UV bullseyes, it is unlikely to (fully) explain the patterns of variation that we observe for this trait.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Accumulation of ultraviolet (UV) pigments in flowers affects pollinator visits and transpiration rates.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Rates of pollinator visitation measured in Vancouver in 2017 (p=0.017; Mann–Whitney <italic>U</italic>-tests, W = 150, two-sided; n = 143 pollinator visits) and (<bold>b</bold>) 2019 (differences between ligule ultraviolet proportion [LUVp] categories are significant for p=0.0058, Kruskal–Wallis test, <italic>χ</italic><sup>2</sup> = 14.54, df = 4; n = 1390 pollinator visits).

Additionally, flavonol glycosides, the pigments responsible for floral UV patterns in sunflower, are known to be involved in responses to several abiotic stressors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Korn et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Nakabayashi et al., 2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Pollastri and Tattini, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Schulz et al., 2015</xref>). Therefore, we explored whether some of these stressors could drive diversification in floral UV pigmentation. An intuitively strong candidate is UV radiation, which can be harmful to plant cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Stapleton, 1992</xref>). Variation in the size of UV bullseye patterns across the range of <italic>Argentina anserina</italic> (a member of the <italic>Rosaceae</italic> family) has been shown to correlate positively with intensity of UV radiation. Flowers of this species are bowl-shaped, and larger UV-absorbing regions have been proposed to protect pollen from UV damage by absorbing UV radiation that would otherwise be reflected toward the anthers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Koski and Ashman, 2015</xref>). However, sunflower inflorescences are much flatter than <italic>A. anserina</italic> flowers, making it unlikely that any significant amount of UV radiation would be reflected from the ligules towards the disc flowers. Studies in another plant with non-bowl-shaped flowers (<italic>Clarkia unguiculata</italic>) have found no evidence of an effect of floral UV patterns in protecting pollen from UV damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Peach et al., 2020</xref>).

This possibility is particularly intriguing for sunflower, in which flower temperature plays an important role in pollinator attraction; inflorescences of cultivated sunflowers consistently face east so that they warm up faster in the morning, making them more attractive to pollinators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Atamian et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Creux et al., 2021</xref>). By absorbing more radiation, larger UV bullseyes could therefore contribute to increasing temperature of the sunflower inflorescences, and their attractiveness to pollinators, in cold climates. However, UV wavelengths represents only a small fraction (3–7%) of the solar radiation reaching the Earth’s surface (compared to &gt;50% for visible wavelengths), and might therefore not provide sufficient energy to significantly warm up the ligules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Nunez et al., 1994</xref>). In line with this observation, different levels of UV pigmentation had no effect on the temperature of inflorescences or individual ligules exposed to sunlight (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4e–g</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>While several geoclimatic variables are correlated across the range of wild <italic>H. annuus</italic>, the single variable explaining the largest proportion of the variation in floral UV patterns in this species was summer relative humidity (RH; <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.51, p=1.4 × 10<sup>–18</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4h</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>), with lower humidity being associated with larger LUVp values (i.e., higher concentrations of flavonol glycosides in ligules). Lower RH is generally associated with higher transpiration rates in plants, leading to increased water loss, and flavonol glycosides are known to play an important role in responses to drought stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nakabayashi et al., 2014a</xref>); in particular, <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> lines that accumulate higher concentrations of flavonol glycosides due to overexpression of <italic>AtMYB12</italic> lose water and desiccate at slower rates than wild-type plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Nakabayashi et al., 2014b</xref>). Similarly, in a set of plants representing seven independent natural populations of <italic>H. annuus</italic>, we found that completely UV-absorbing ligules desiccate at a significantly slower rate than largely UV-reflecting ligules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4i</xref>). This is not due to general differences in transpiration rates between genotypes since we observed no comparable trend for rates of leaf desiccation in the same set of sunflower lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4j</xref>). Transpiration from flowers can be a major source of water loss for plants, and this is known to drive, within species, the evolution of smaller flowers in populations living in dry locations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Galen, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Herrera, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lambrecht, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lambrecht and Dawson, 2007</xref>; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>). While desiccation rates are only a proxy for transpiration in field conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Duursma et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hygen, 1951</xref>), and other factors might affect ligule transpiration in this set of lines, this evidence (strong correlation between LUVp and summer RH; known role of flavonol glycosides in regulating transpiration; and correlation between extent of ligule UV pigmentation and desiccation rates) suggests that variation in floral UV pigmentation in sunflowers is driven by the role of flavonol glycosides in reducing water loss from ligules, with larger floral UV patterns helping prevent drought stress in drier environments.</p><p>One of the main roles of transpiration in plants is facilitating heat dispersion at higher temperatures through evaporative cooling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Burke and Upchurch, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Drake et al., 2018</xref>), which could explain the strong correlation between LUVp and temperature across the range of <italic>H. annuus</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>). Consistent with this, summer RH and summer temperatures together explain a considerably larger fraction of the variation for LUVp in <italic>H. annuus</italic> than either variable alone (<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.63, p=0.0017; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>), with smaller floral UV patterns being associated with higher RH and higher temperatures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). Consistent with a role of floral UV pigmentation in the plant’s response to variation in both humidity and temperature, we found strong associations (dB &gt; 10) between SNPs in the <italic>HaMYB111</italic> region and these variables in genotype-environment association (GEA) analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4k</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata4">Figure 4—source data 4</xref>). Despite a more limited range of variation for LUVp, a similar trend (larger UV patterns in drier, colder environments) is present also in <italic>H. petiolaris</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">Figure 4—figure supplement 5</xref>). Interestingly, while the L allele at Chr_15 LUVp SNP is present in <italic>H. petiolaris</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>), it is found only at a very low frequency and does not seem to significantly affect floral UV patterns in this species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). This could represent a recent introgression since <italic>H. annuus</italic> and <italic>H. petiolaris</italic> are known to hybridize in nature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Heiser, 1947</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Yatabe et al., 2007</xref>). Alternatively, the Chr_15 LUVp SNP might not be associated with functional differences in <italic>HaMYB111</italic> in <italic>H. petiolaris</italic>, or differences in genetic networks or physiology between <italic>H. annuus</italic> and <italic>H. petiolaris</italic> could mask the effect of this allele, or limit its adaptive advantage, in the latter species.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Connecting adaptive variation to its genetic basis is one of the main goals of evolutionary biology. Here, we show that regulatory variation at a single major gene, the transcription factor <italic>HaMYB111</italic>, underlies most of the diversity for floral UV patterns in the common sunflower, wild <italic>H. annuus</italic>. Variation for these floral UV patterns correlates strongly with pollinator preferences, but also with geoclimatic variables (especially RH and temperature) and desiccation rates in sunflower ligules. While the effects of floral UV patterns on pollinator attraction are well-known, these associations suggest a role of environmental factors in shaping diversity for this trait. Larger floral UV patterns, due to accumulation of flavonol glycoside pigments in ligules, could help reduce the amount of transpiration in environments with lower RH, preventing excessive water loss and maintaining ligule turgidity. In humid, hot environments (e.g., Southern Texas), lower accumulation of flavonol glycosides would instead promote transpiration from ligules, keeping them cool and avoiding overheating. The presence of UV pigmentation in the petals of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (also controlled by the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> homolog of <italic>MYB111</italic>) further points to a more general protective role of these pigments in flowers since pollinator attraction is likely not critical for fertilization in this largely selfing species. It should be noted that, while we have examined some of the most likely factors explaining the distribution of variation for floral UV patterns in wild <italic>H. annuus</italic> across North America, other abiotic factors could play a role, as well as biotic ones (e.g., the aforementioned differences in pollinator assemblages, or a role of UV pigments in protection from herbivory; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gronquist et al., 2001</xref>). However, a role of floral UV patterns in reducing water loss from petals is consistent with the overall trend in increased size of floral UV patterns over the past 80 years that has been observed in herbarium specimens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Koski et al., 2020</xref>); due to changing climates, RH over land has been decreasing in recent decades, which could result in higher transpiration rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Byrne and O’Gorman, 2018</xref>). Further studies will be required to confirm the existence of this trend and assess its strength.</p><p>More generally, our study highlights the complex nature of adaptive variation, with selection pressures from both biotic and abiotic factors shaping the patterns of diversity that we observe across natural populations. Floral diversity in particular has long been attributed to the actions of animal pollinators. Our work adds to a growing literature demonstrating the contributions of abiotic factors to this diversity.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and

seeds collected from wild populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Todesco et al., 2020</xref>) or obtained from the North Central Regional Plant Introduction Station in Ames, IA. For all experiments except the plants used for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1b</xref>, sunflower seeds were surface sterilized by immersion for 10 min in a 1.5% sodium hypochlorite solution. Seeds were then rinsed twice in distilled water and treated for at least 1 hr in a solution of 1% PPM (Plant Preservative Mixture; Plant Cell Technologies, Washington, DC), a broad-spectrum biocide/fungicide, to minimize contamination, and 0.05 mM gibberellic acid (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). They were then scarified, dehulled, and kept for 2 weeks at 4°C in the dark on filter paper moistened with a 1% PPM solution. Following this, seeds were kept in the dark at room temperature until they germinated. For common garden experiments, the seedlings were then transplanted in peat pots, grown in a greenhouse for 2 weeks, then moved to an open-sided greenhouse for a week for acclimation, and finally transplanted in the field at the Totem Plant Science Field Station of the University of British Columbia (Vancouver, Canada). For all other experiments, seedlings were transplanted in 2-gallon pots filled with Sunshine #1 growing mix (Sun Gro Horticulture Canada, Abbotsford, BC, Canada). Plants grown in greenhouses at the Vancouver campus of the University of British Columbia were kept at 26°C during the day and 20°C during the night, supplemented with LED light on a cycle of 16 hr days and 8 hr nights. For the wild sunflower species shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1b</xref>, following sterilization, seeds were scarified and then dipped in fusicoccin solution (1.45 µM) for 15 min, dehulled, germinated in the dark for at least 8–10 days, and then grown in pots for 3 weeks before transplantation. One group of species was transplanted into 2-gallon pots filled with a blend of sandy loam, organic compost and mulch, and grown at the UC Davis Plant Sciences Field Station (Davis, CA) from July to October 2017. Several additional species were grown in single rows covered with mulch and spaced 0.75 m apart at the Oxford Tract Facility field (Berkeley, CA) from June to October 2021, or in a greenhouse facility at Berkeley, CA.

After germination and acclimation, plants were transplanted at the Totem Plant Science Field Station of the University of British Columbia (Vancouver, Canada). In the 2016 common garden experiment, each sunflower species was grown in a separate field. Pairs of plants from the same population were randomly distributed within each field. In the 2019 common garden experiment, plants were sown using a completely randomized design.</p><p>In the summer of 2016, 10 plants from each of the 151 selected populations of wild <italic>H. annuus</italic>, <italic>H. petiolaris</italic>, <italic>H. argophyllus,</italic> and <italic>H. niveus</italic> were grown. Plants were transplanted in the field on 25 May (<italic>H. argophyllus</italic>), 2 June (<italic>H. petiolaris</italic> and <italic>H. niveus</italic>), and 7 June 2016 (<italic>H. annuus</italic>). Up to four inflorescences from each plant were collected for visible and UV photography.</p><p>In the summer of 2019, 14 plants from each of the 106 populations of wild <italic>H. annuus</italic> were transplanted in the field on 6 June. These included 65 of the populations grown in the previous common garden experiment, and 41 additional populations that were selected to complement their geographical distribution. At least three ligules from at least two different inflorescences for each plant were collected for visible and UV photography. Ligules were selected to be as far apart from each other as possible across the inflorescence, taking care to avoid damaged or otherwise unrepresentative ligules.</p><p>Sample size for the common garden experiments was determined by the available growing space and resources. 10–14 individuals were grown for each population because this would provide a good representation of the variation present in each population, while maximizing the number of populations that could be surveyed. Researchers were not blinded as to the identity of individual samples. However, information about their populations of origin and/or LUVp phenotypes was not attached to the samples during data acquisition.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Ultraviolet and infrared photography</title><p>Ultraviolet patterns were imaged in whole inflorescences or detached ligules (see ‘Common garden’ section) using a Nikon D70s digital camera, fitted with a Noflexar 35 mm lens and a reverse-mounted 2-inch Baader U-Filter (Baader Planetarium, Mammendorf, Germany), which only allows the transmission of light between 320 and 380 nm. Wild sunflower species shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1b</xref> were imaged using a Canon DSLR camera in which the internal hot mirror filter had been replaced with a UV bandpass filter (LifePixel, Mukilteo, WA). Floral UV patterns were scored as LUVp, rather than total area or diameter of the UV bullseye, because LUVp is less influenced by genetic or environmental factors affecting inflorescence size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Moyers et al., 2017</xref>). The length of the whole ligule (L<sub>L</sub>) and the length of the UV-absorbing part at the base of the ligule (L<sub>UV-abs</sub>) were measured using ImageJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Schneider et al., 2012</xref>). LUVp was measured as the ratio between the two (LUVp = L<sub>UV-abs</sub>/L<sub>L</sub>). In some <italic>H. annuus</italic> individuals, the upper, ‘UV-reflecting’ portion of the ligules (L<sub>UV-ref</sub>) also displayed a lower level of UV absorption; in those cases, these regions were weighted at 50% of fully UV-absorbing regions using the formula LUVp = (L<sub>UV-abs</sub>/L<sub>L</sub>) + ½(L<sub>UV-ref</sub>/L<sub>L</sub>). Partial UV absorbance in the tip of ligules was more common in plants with larger floral UV patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). To avoid possible confounding effects, for all experiments plants in the ‘small’ and ‘intermediate’ LUVp classes were selected to have no noticeable UV absorbance in the tips of ligules. For UV pictures of whole inflorescences, LUVp values were measured for three representative ligules chosen to be as far apart from each other as possible, and the average of those three values was used as the LUVp for the inflorescence. LUVp values for all the inflorescences or detached ligules available for each plant were averaged to obtain the LUVp value for that individual.</p><p>Infrared pictures for the experiments shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4e–g</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref> were taken using a Fluke TiX560 thermal imager (Fluke Corporation, Everett, WA) and analysed using the Fluke Connect software (v1.1.536.0). For time-series experiments on whole inflorescences, plants from populations ANN_03 (from CA, USA, with large LUVp) and ANN_55 (from TX, USA, with small LUVp) were germinated as above (see ‘Common garden’), grown in 2-gallon pots in a greenhouse until they produced four true leaves, and then moved to the field. On three separate days in August 2017, pairs of inflorescences with opposite floral UV patterns at similar developmental stages were selected and made to face east. Infrared images were taken just before sunrise, ~5 min after sunrise, and then at 0.5, 1, 2, 3, and 4 hr after sunrise.</p><p>For infrared pictures of detached ligules, plants were grown in a greenhouse. Plants with large LUVp came from populations ANN_03 (CA, USA), ANN_16 (NM, USA), and ANN_19 (NM, USA); plants with small LUVp came from populations ANN_55 and ANN_58 (both from TX, USA). Flowerheads were collected and kept overnight in a room with constant temperature of 21°C, with their stems immersed in a beaker containing distilled water. The following day, pairs of inflorescences were randomly selected from the two LUVp categories, and representative, undamaged ligules were removed and arranged on a sheet of white paper. Infrared pictures were taken immediately before exposing the ligules to the sun, and again 5, 10, and 15 min after that, at around 1 pm on 5 October 2020 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata2">Figure 4—source data 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Library preparation, sequencing, and SNP calling</title><p>Whole-genome shotgun (WGS) sequencing library preparation and sequencing, as well as SNP calling and variant filtering, for the <italic>H. annuus</italic> and <italic>H. petiolaris</italic> individuals used for GWAS analyses in this paper were previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Todesco et al., 2020</xref>).

During genotyping, to reduce computational time and improve variant quality, genomic regions containing transposable elements were excluded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Badouin et al., 2017</xref>). We then used GATK’s VariantRecalibrator (v4.0.1.2) to select high-quality variants.

Visits to all inflorescences for each plant were recorded; pollinators visiting more than one inflorescence per plant were recorded only once. To generate a more homogenous and comparable dataset, measurements for plants with too few (1) or too many (&gt;10) inflorescences were excluded from the final analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata1">Figure 4—source data 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-11"><title>Correlations with environmental variables and GEA analyses</title><p>Twenty topo-climatic factors were extracted from climate data collected over a 30-year period (1961–1990) for the geographical coordinates of the population collection sites using the software package Climate NA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Wang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). Additionally, UV radiation data were extracted from the glUV dataset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beckmann et al., 2014</xref>) using the R package ‘raster’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hijmans, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">R Development Core Team, 2020</xref>). Correlations between individual environmental variables and LUVp was calculated using the ‘lm’ function implemented in R. A correlation matrix between all environmental variables, and LUVp was calculated using the ‘cor’ function in R and plotted using the ‘heatmap.2’ function in the ‘gplots’ package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Warnes et al., 2009</xref>). Plots of the interactions between relative humidity and average temperature in relation to LUVp were generated using the ‘interact_plot’ function implemented in the ‘interactions’ R package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Long, 2020</xref>). It should be noted that the values for climate variables used in these analyses are extrapolated from weather stations across North America, and not measured in situ, meaning that they might not account for microclimatic variation. For example, two populations in Southern Arizona do not fit the pattern we proposed – they have small floral UV patterns and high frequency of S alleles at the Chr15_LUVp SNP, despite being associated with relatively low RH values in our datasets. However, one of them (ANN_13) was collected along the Verde River, near Deadhorse lake, and the description of the collection site is ‘riparian forest and wetland,’ suggesting that humidity might be locally higher than in the surrounding region. Similarly, from satellite pictures, the collection site for the other population (ANN_47) appears considerably more verdant than other collection sites in Arizona.</p><p>GEAs were analysed using BayPass (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gautier, 2015</xref>) version 2.1. Population structure was estimated by choosing 10,000 putatively neutral random SNPs under the BayPass core model. The Bayes factor (denoted BF<sub>is</sub> as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gautier, 2015</xref>) was then calculated under the standard covariate mode. For each SNP, BF<sub>is</sub> was expressed in deciban units [dB, 10 log<sub>10</sub> (BF<sub>is</sub>)]. Significance was determined following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gautier, 2015</xref> and employing Jeffreys’ rule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jeffreys, 1961</xref>), quantifying the strength of associations between SNPs and variables as ‘strong’ (10 dB ≤ BF<sub>is</sub> &lt; 15 dB), ‘very strong’ (15 dB ≤ BF<sub>is</sub> &lt; 20 dB), and ‘decisive’ (BF<sub>is</sub> ≥ 20 dB; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata4">Figure 4—source data 4</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-12"><title>Desiccation assays</title><p>Water loss was determined by measuring changes in the weight of detached ligules and leaves over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Duursma et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hygen, 1951</xref>). In the summer of 2020, fully developed inflorescences and the one or two youngest fully developed leaves from each individual were collected from well-watered, greenhouse-grown plants that had large (LUVp = 1) or small (LUVp ≤ 0.4) floral UV patterns. They were brought immediately to an environment kept at 21°C and were left overnight with their stems or petioles immersed in a beaker containing distilled water. The following morning leaves from each plant, and three ligules removed from each inflorescence (selected to be as far apart from each other as possible across the inflorescence and taking care to avoid damaged or otherwise unrepresentative ligules), were individually weighed and hanged to air dry at room temperature (21°C). Their weight was measured at 1 hr intervals for 5 hr, and then again the following morning. Leaves and ligules were then incubated for 48 hr at 65°C in an oven to determine their dry weight. Total water content was measured as the difference between the initial fresh weight (W<sub>0</sub>) and dry weight (W<sub>d</sub>). Water loss was expressed as a fraction of the total water content of each organ using the formula [(W<sub>i</sub>-W<sub>d</sub>)/(W<sub>0</sub>-W<sub>d</sub>)] × 100, where W<sub>i</sub> is the weight of a sample at a time i. The assay was performed on ligules from 16 inflorescences from 12 individuals belonging to seven different populations of <italic>H. annuus</italic>, and on leaves from 15 individuals from eight different populations. Of the individuals used for assays on leaves, 10 were also used for assays on ligules, 4 were half-siblings of individuals used for ligule assays, and 1 belonged to a different population (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata3">Figure 4—source data 3</xref>).</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec id="s4" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Project administration, Supervision, Visualization, Writing - original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Investigation, Methodology, Project administration, Supervision, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Investigation, Methodology, Project administration, Supervision, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Investigation, Visualization</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Data curation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con11"><p>Conceptualization, Funding acquisition, Supervision, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con12"><p>Conceptualization, Funding acquisition, Supervision, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec id="s5" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>Multiple sequence alignment for <italic>HaMYB111</italic> coding sequence.</title></caption><media mime-subtype="zip" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-72072-supp1-v1.zip"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp2"><label>Supplementary file 2.</label><caption><title>Multiple sequence alignment for <italic>HaMYB111</italic> genomic sequence.</title></caption><media mime-subtype="zip" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-72072-supp2-v1.zip"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp3"><label>Supplementary file 3.</label><caption><title>Multiple sequence alignment for <italic>HaMYB111</italic> proximal promoter region.</title></caption><media mime-subtype="zip" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-72072-supp3-v1.zip"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp4"><label>Supplementary file 4.</label><caption><title>Multiple sequence alignment for <italic>HaMYB111</italic> distal promoter region.</title></caption><media mime-subtype="zip" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-72072-supp4-v1.zip"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp5"><label>Supplementary file 5.</label><caption><title>GenBank dataset details.</title></caption><media mime-subtype="xlsx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-72072-supp5-v1.xlsx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="transrepform"><label>Transparent reporting form</label><media mime-subtype="docx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-72072-transrepform1-v1.docx"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec id="s6" sec-type="data-availability"><title>Data availability</title><p>All raw sequenced data are stored in the Sequence Read Archive (SRA) under BioProjects PRJNA532579, PRJNA398560 and PRJNA736734.

We also include an acceptance summary that explains what the editors found interesting or important about the work.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Genetic basis and dual adaptive role of floral pigmentation in sunflowers&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Jeff Ross-Ibarra as Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Jürgen Kleine-Vehn as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Ian T Baldwin (Reviewer #2).</p><p>All three reviewers are quite enthusiastic about the manuscript and I believe that with some relatively straightforward revisions it would be suitable for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The primary concern echoed by the reviewers, and which came up in our discussion, was the feeling that several of the claims of the paper could do with a bit more caveats and consideration of alternative explanations. For example, reviewer #2 points out previous results on additional metabolites that could be involved. We all agreed the claims about fitness advantages could be tempered some, given that e.g. the water loss experiment is not the same as the actual measure of transpiration, and the link between bullseye size and fitness under different humidity, while likely given other evidence in the paper, is also untested. Although we felt that additional experiments could be done to solidify these claims, we also all felt the current manuscript stands as is with the conclusions softened somewhat.</p><p>Aside from this major concern, each of the reviewers had a number of additional points to consider, and I ask you kindly respond to these in turn as well.</p><p>Thank you again for submitting such a wonderful paper to <italic>eLife</italic>, and I look forward to seeing the revision – I doubt very much it would need to go back out to review.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I'm not a fan of the last line of the conclusion. While I'm not against having some fun with papers, this felt a bit flippant perhaps.</p><p>Any speculation as to what causes the odd non-linear patterns (low UV radiation and temperature) at intermediate LUVP in figure 4c and d?</p><p>Any speculation as to why is the association with temperature stronger than RH in 4k?</p><p>I couldn't quite understand figure 3h. The bars show expression relative to what? Are these stacked bars or overlapping?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The putative fitness benefits of variable bullseye size under different humidity regimes, proposed to explain the observed geographical clines in bullseye size remain untested. These functional hypotheses could have been tested in accessions that naturally vary in bullseye size, or with genome-edited lines, which are subject to alternative explanations and onerous, respectively.</p><p>Alternatively, these hypotheses could have been tested by comparing the reproductive outputs under different watering regimes of myb12 Arabidopsis mutants and those complimented with the pAtMyb111 transgene; both species are largely selfing, so that seed set would be a reasonable proxy of functional significance. Water-loss associated fitness effects of floral flavonol glycoside expression in Arabidopsis would argue strongly for a generalized effect of these glycosides that does not depend on the particular molecular composition of the glycosides.</p><p>While bar graphs of pollinator visitation data from 2019 are presented in a figure, the data from 2017 are only mentioned in the figure caption of Figure 4 supplemental.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>First, thanks for a great read! I enjoyed this manuscript.</p><p>My line notes elaborate on (and identify relevant lines for) the weaknesses I identified in my public review, and I offer possible solutions for some of them. I have only two additional comments here. (1) The authors go a bit too light on methodological details for my liking (e.g. sampling design for UV absorbance, transpiration), or leave out results that could be important and interesting (e.g. would like to Sanger sequencing variation in supplement or data). I think these should be available in the methods or a supplementary text. (2) I think there are a few areas where more could be learned (optionally!), including further exploration of GWAS, and using linear models for proportion data instead of categorizing</p><p>There are many line notes, but these are solely meant to be helpful to the authors. There are NO further critiques. Line notes are only examples, typos, or compliments.</p><p>Line 26: UV patterns are not manipulated in pollinator experiments, and they are observed across populations. Other phenotypes could vary across populations that matter to pollinators. Suggest &quot;strongly correlate with&quot; instead of &quot;have a strong effect on&quot; Same is true at line 29 about UV and transpiration.</p><p>Line 43: This is just my opinion, but the phrasing of the emoji reference feels a little informal.</p><p>Figure 1 is very easy to understand without even reading the caption.

Similarly, I don't understand why a myb112 mutant is explored only in the background of a myb111 mutant?

Also, for qPCR, why was HaEF1alpha chosen as the comparison?</p><p>Line 264: I disagree. Pollinators learn on short timescales. I would expect learning to play a role. For example, pollinators often display &quot;constancy&quot; behavior, by re-visiting a phenotype they have just visited. So if big bullseyes are common (which I expect based on figure 1), there could be a self-reinforcing bias towards visits to big bullseyes. What BC won't have is genetic variation or species filtering patterns in pollinators that might change the relative fitness of UV phenotypes across the sunflower range (though I otherwise agree with the authors' reasoning in lines 283-288). Also, can the authors comment on whether it is known if pollinators care more about proportion of UV absorbing area or the total size? Here, the authors have considered proportion only.</p><p>Line 269: This design confounds any phenotypes that are co-correlated to the UV phenotype across sunflower populations (e.g. due to local adaptation or n\eutral population structure). Therefore, pollinator preferences could arguably be due to co-varying phenotypes. Possible solution: Given that F2s within two different populations were included in the field study, was any pollinator preference data taken for these? Or are any other within population large versus small LUVp comparisons?</p><p>Line 279: I have no idea from the evidence presented how visitation links to fitness.

The authors do consider and eliminate one possible co-correlated phenotype (leaf transpiration, well done) – but there are others I could think of: ligule total size, stomata density on ligules… The authors could consider the F2 individuals, or even just within population individuals, and test if this pattern is independent of population structure.</p><p>Line 339: Is there any evidence that ligules are the main source of inflorescence transpiration in sunflowers? It occurs to me that water loss might also drive pollinator preferences. Presumably pollinators avoid inflorescences with wilt – e.g. because nectar production would be low, or flowers might be old with no pollen.</p><p>Line 348-350: I am struggling to understand. The ANOVA in the source data doesn't include the fitted slopes. How does the expected effect of RH change with temperature?</p><p>Line 356: This is one result the authors interpret with the ideal amount of caution (this is a compliment). I'd be curious to know if other regions of the genome also appear in GEA, and whether any of those co-locate to other SNPs with larger estimated associations with phenotype (even if those are n.s.).</p><p>Figure 4. Why is the x-axis in 4k different from 2b? Figure 4 is otherwise functionally excellent and very aesthetically pleasing. I'm very impressed with these great figures overall, despite my critiques of Figure 3.</p><p>Conclusions: The statements on effects of pollinators and transpiration should be softened to fit the evidence.

In both cases, the visible dips in the intermediate LUVp are at least partially driven from several populations with intermediate LUVp found at high latitudes (Canada, North Dakota), where UV radiation is weaker and temperatures are lower.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Any speculation as to why is the association with temperature stronger than RH in 4k?</p></disp-quote><p>The stronger association with temperature could hint at an effect of HaMYB111 on other traits that are important for responses to temperature, but not, or not as much, for responses to changes in relative humidity. However, in our experience the strength of associations in GEA analyses is quite sensitive to non-biological factors (using different sets of putatively neutral SNPs can affect the relative strengths of associations), and it is therefore hard to tell how much of that difference is biologically relevant. Additionally, the resulting Bayes Factors also depend on the environmental trait distribution across the landscape, so we’re cautious in overinterpreting one factor as being more important purely based on this.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I couldn't quite understand figure 3h.

However, in hindsight that might not have been as intuitive as we had hoped. We have re-designed figures 3h and 3i to hopefully make the interpretation of the experiment more straightforward, by separating expression data for ligule tips and bases.Apologies for omitting to specify that the expression levels are normalized against the average expression levels in the UV-absorbing part of developing ligules in H. annuus.

Throughout the manuscript, we have tried to compensate for that by comparing groups of accessions with different floral UV pattern, to try to average out other factors that could differentiate individual lines. However, this would be particularly complicated for measurements of fitness, which are affected by virtually all other plant traits, meaning that all but the strongest effects would be impossible to detect (and we don’t think that variation in levels of transpiration in ligules would have an oversized effect on classic measures of plant fitness like seed set). An acceptable compromise would be to use isogenic lines in which different alleles of <italic>HaMYB111</italic> have been introduced into cultivated (self-compatible) sunflower. While we are working on that, obtaining suitable lines is likely to take several years.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Alternatively, these hypotheses could have been tested by comparing the reproductive outputs under different watering regimes of myb12 Arabidopsis mutants and those complimented with the pAtMyb111 transgene; both species are largely selfing, so that seed set would be a reasonable proxy of functional significance. Water-loss associated fitness effects of floral flavonol glycoside expression in Arabidopsis would argue strongly for a generalized effect of these glycosides that does not depend on the particular molecular composition of the glycosides.</p></disp-quote><p>While this would be a much more feasible experiment than using sunflowers, it would be complicated by the fact that <italic>AtMYB111</italic>, while strongly expressed in petals, is expressed also throughout the plants, and the <italic>myb111</italic> mutant has altered flavonol profiles in different tissues, including seedlings and rosette and cauline leaves (Stracke <italic>et al.,</italic> Plant J. 2007; Stracke <italic>et al.,</italic> New Phytol. 2010). Since accumulation of flavonol glycosides affects water loss rates in leaves/rosettes (Nakabayashi <italic>et al.</italic>, Plant J. 2014), as well as possibly other traits, it would be difficult to isolate the effect of floral UV pigmentation of plant fitness. Additionally, since sunflower ligules are much larger than Arabidopsis petals (even in proportion to the whole plant), the eventual effect on transpiration might be much less relevant. As mentioned above, sunflower isogenic lines will hopefully be a more suitable system to answer these questions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>While bar graphs of pollinator visitation data from 2019 are presented in a figure, the data from 2017 are only mentioned in the figure caption of Figure 4 supplemental.</p></disp-quote><p>We did not provide a plot with pollinator-specific information for the 2017 experiment because almost all visits were from bumblebee, with only nine visits from sylphid flies, and it would have been difficult to visualize a difference.

Pollinators learn on short timescales. I would expect learning to play a role. For example, pollinators often display &quot;constancy&quot; behavior, by re-visiting a phenotype they have just visited.

What BC won't have is genetic variation or species filtering patterns in pollinators that might change the relative fitness of UV phenotypes across the sunflower range (though I otherwise agree with the authors' reasoning in lines 283-288).

While differences in inflorescence size clearly have a genetic basis, there can be large variation in size between inflorescences of a same plant, depending on developmental stage or environmental factors (and this will affect total UV size). While it is possible that total UV size would affect pollinator preferences, we do not therefore have sufficient data to test that; it should be noted, however, that the plants used for the experiment in Figure 4a were selected to have matching flowering time and inflorescence size, and the individual inflorescences that were recorded were size-matched.</p><p>We have added the information reported above in the legend of Figure 4 and in the relevant parts of the Methods section, where we have also added additional information about the experimental setting for pollinator preference assays.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 269: This design confounds any phenotypes that are co-correlated to the UV phenotype across sunflower populations (e.g. due to local adaptation or neutral population structure).

While the effects of floral UV patterns on pollinator attraction are well-known, these associations suggest a role of environmental factors in shaping diversity for this trait. Larger floral UV patterns, due to accumulation of flavonol glycoside pigments in ligules, could help reduce the amount of transpiration in environments with lower relative humidity, preventing excessive water loss and maintaining ligule turgidity.
