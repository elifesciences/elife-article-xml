<italic>Mir211</italic> are homologous miRNAs with the same gene targeting spectrum. It is known that <italic>Mir204/211</italic> play an important role in protecting osteoarthritis development; however, the roles of <italic>Mir204/211</italic> in RA disease have not been determined. In the present study, we investigated the effects and molecular mechanisms of <italic>Mir204/211</italic> on synovial inflammation and hyperproliferation in RA. The effects of <italic>Mir204/211</italic> on the inflammation and abnormal proliferation in primary fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLSs) were examined by <italic>Mir204/211</italic> gain-of-function and loss-of-function approaches in vitro and in vivo. We identified the structure-specific recognition protein 1 (<italic>Ssrp1</italic>) as a downstream target gene of <italic>Mir204/211</italic> based on the bioinformatics analysis. We overexpressed <italic>Ssrp1</italic>and <italic>Mir204/211</italic> in FLS to determine the relationship between <italic>Ssrp1</italic> and <italic>Mir204/211</italic> and their effects on synovial hyperplasia. We created a collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) model in wild-type as well as <italic>Mir204/211</italic> double knockout (dKO) mice to induce RA phenotype and administered adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated <italic>Ssrp1</italic>-<italic>shRNA</italic> (AAV-<italic>shSsrp1</italic>) by intra-articular injection into <italic>Mir204/211</italic> dKO mice. We found that <italic>Mir204/211</italic> attenuated excessive cell proliferation and synovial inflammation in RA. <italic>Ssrp1</italic> was the downstream target gene of <italic>Mir204/211. Mir204/211</italic> affected synovial proliferation and decelerated RA progression by targeting <italic>Ssrp1</italic>. CIA mice with <italic>Mir204/211</italic> deficiency displayed enhanced synovial hyperplasia and inflammation.

Due to the joint dysfunction caused by RA, patients often have limited activities, and the quality of life is seriously reduced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Wang et al., 2020a</xref>). Although many effective drugs have been developed, the long treatment cycle of RA significantly increases the incidence of adverse drug reactions. Therefore, to provide the basis for individualized therapy, it is vital to elicit the molecular mechanisms of RA pathogenesis.</p><p><italic>MicroRNAs (miRNAs)</italic> are small, non-coding RNA molecules consisting of 21–24 base pairs that specifically bind to target genes through the 3' untranslated region (3'-UTR) and control the expression of multiple genes at the post-transcriptional level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>). In recent years, cumulative evidences have shown that <italic>miRNAs</italic> play crucial roles in the development of RA by regulating cell viability, apoptosis, and invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Lai et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Stanczyk et al., 2008</xref>). In synovial tissue of patients with RA, <italic>miRNA</italic> expression was significantly altered compared with those of healthy individuals. The abnormal <italic>miRNAs</italic> promote the expression of proinflammatory cytokine and enzymes that erodes the cartilage matrix by interfering Wnt, NF-κB, and JAK/STAT signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Han et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>The <italic>Mir204</italic> and <italic>Mir211</italic> have similar nucleotide sequences and share the same seed sequence. There are only two nucleotide differences in humans and one nucleotide difference in mice. These structural similarity and homology between these two <italic>miRNAs</italic> allow them to have the same gene targeting spectrum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Lee et al., 2016</xref>). In breast cancer, <italic>Mir204</italic> acts as a tumor suppressor. The expression of <italic>Mir204</italic> induced apoptosis while the deletion of <italic>Mir204</italic> gene led to abnormal cell invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Imam et al., 2012</xref>). <italic>MiRNA</italic> has also become an indispensable regulatory factor in bone pathophysiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Asahara, 2016</xref>). We have previously reported that homologous <italic>miRNAs</italic>, <italic>Mir204</italic> and <italic>Mir211</italic>, together protecting joint from osteoarthritis development.

Since synovial inflammation is now considered as the major pathology of RA and hyperplasia of fibroblast-like synoviocyte (FLS) displayed tumor-like behaviors that contribute to pannus growth, inflammation, and cartilage damage, here we aimed to investigate whether <italic>Mir204/211</italic> play an indispensable role in RA synovial inflammation and hyperplasia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Winchester et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Structure-specific recognition protein 1 (SSRP1) is a subunit of the histone chaperone transcription (FACT) complex and is involved in almost all chromatin-related processes.

In addition, <italic>Ssrp1</italic> expression was significantly upregulated in a variety of tumors, such as breast and ovarian cancer, and was strongly associated with poorer prognosis. The knockdown of <italic>Ssrp1</italic> expression by <italic>siRNA</italic> technique depressed the proliferation of glioma cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Liao et al., 2017</xref>). SSRP1 inhibitor, CBL0137, induced cell death by down-regulating gene expression in the NF-κB signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barone et al., 2017</xref>). Wu et al. suggested that <italic>Ssrp1</italic> modulates P53 pathway and its downstream molecules, and <italic>Ssrp1</italic> may be involved in the cell cycle progression through regulation of P53 pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Wu et al., 2019a</xref>). Although <italic>Ssrp1</italic> has been shown to stimulate proliferation through cell cycle regulation in a variety of human cancers, the role, mechanism, and clinical significance of <italic>Ssrp1</italic> in RA remain unclear.</p><p>Collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) shares similar characteristics with RA, including synovial hyperplasia and inflammatory articular cartilage destruction, and has been extensively used in RA research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Song et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bas et al., 2016</xref>). Multiple lines of evidence have shown that RA FLSs are the principal cells in participation in the initiation, development, and deterioration of joint inflammation in RA disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Xiao et al., 2021</xref>). In this study, we determined the effects of <italic>Mir204/211</italic> on the inflammatory response and proliferation of primary CIA FLS by overexpression or knockdown of <italic>Mir204/211</italic>, as well as the downstream mechanisms of <italic>Mir204/211</italic> in mitigation of synovial inflammation and excessive proliferation.

It is characterized by synovial inflammation leading to abnormal synovial hyperplasia, which eventually invades cartilage and leads to joint destruction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Li et al., 2018</xref>). The structural similarity and homology between <italic>Mir204</italic> and <italic>Mir211</italic> allow them to have the same gene targeting spectrum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Lee et al., 2016</xref>). Since the roles of <italic>Mir204</italic> and <italic>Mir211</italic> in RA are still unclear, here we will discuss the key role of <italic>Mir204</italic>/<italic>211</italic> in RA from two aspects, synovial inflammation and abnormal synovial proliferation. It has been reported that <italic>Mir204</italic> is down-regulated in synovial tissues of RA patients, and <italic>Mir204</italic> regulates RA FLS survival by regulating STAT3 protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Xiao et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Li et al., 2018</xref>). Consistent with these findings, we found that expression levels of <italic>Mir204</italic> and <italic>Mir211</italic> in FLS of CIA mice were significantly reduced compared with those of normal mice. As demonstrated in this study that <italic>Mir204</italic>/<italic>211</italic> suppress RA progression and play a protective role in RA, in our in vitro cell culture studies, we transfected CIA FLS with <italic>Mir204</italic> mimics (or <italic>Mir204</italic> inhibitor) and <italic>Mir211</italic> mimics (or <italic>Mir211</italic> inhibitor) simultaneously, to verify the important roles of <italic>Mir204</italic>/<italic>211</italic> in RA.</p><p>In in vitro cell culture experiments, simultaneous overexpression of <italic>Mir204</italic>/<italic>211</italic> was found to alleviate synovial inflammation-associated cell phenotypes in RA. We also performed cell scratching assay and cell apoptosis assay using flow cytometry method. The results suggest that simultaneous overexpression of <italic>Mir204</italic>/<italic>211</italic> inhibited the migration of CIA FLS and promoted their apoptosis whereas simultaneous knockdown of <italic>Mir204</italic>/<italic>211</italic> caused opposite phenomena. In RA, inflammatory FLS is the main source of inflammatory cytokines, and these pro-inflammatory mediators will further aggravate synovial inflammation and lead to the RA deterioration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Wu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Wu et al., 2019a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hong et al., 2018</xref>). Yuan et al. reported that the expressions of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as <italic>Il1b, Il6, and Il23</italic>, were all up-regulated in synovial tissues of CIA mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Yuan et al., 2019</xref>). While other cytokines, such as <italic>Il4, Il10,</italic> and <italic>Tgfb1</italic>, played an implicit part in the anti-inflammatory response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Fabbrini and Magkos, 2015</xref>). In our assays, simultaneous overexpression of <italic>Mir204</italic>/<italic>211</italic> decreased the expression of inflammatory cytokines (<italic>Il1b, Il6, Il8, and Il23</italic>) in CIA FLS and promoted the synthesis of anti-inflammatory cytokines (<italic>Il4, Il10,</italic> and <italic>Tgfb1</italic>), while knockdown of both <italic>Mir204</italic> and <italic>Mir211</italic> resulted in absolute opposite outcomes. Our results demonstrated that <italic>Mir204</italic>/<italic>211</italic> treatment suppressed the abnormal migration and apoptotic behavior of RA FLS, as well as inflammatory factor-mediated disease deterioration.</p><p>NF-κB is a crucial transcription factors family and acts as a pro-inflammatory mediator to induce the production of cytokines, chemokines, and cell adhesion molecules in inflammatory cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Umezawa et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Imbert and Peyron, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen et al., 2021</xref>). The translocation of p65 promotes the generation of numerous inflammatory factors (e.g. <italic>Il1b, Il6, Il23</italic>) and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baldwin, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Morgan and Liu, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Yang et al., 2017</xref>). The expressions of these inflammatory factors and MMPs will eventually lead to synovial inflammation and joint destruction, thereby becoming one of the indispensable pathogenic factors of RA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Xu et al., 2018</xref>). We found decreased expression levels of P65 and IKKα, increased I-κBα protein expression in the <italic>Mir204 + Mir211</italic> mimics group, while there were promoted P65 and IKKα protein expressions and declined I-κBα expression level in the <italic>Mir204 + Mir211</italic> inhibitor group. Simultaneous overexpression or knockdown of <italic>Mir204</italic>/<italic>211</italic> had no significant effect on the protein expression of IKKβ, and it seemed <italic>Mir204</italic>/<italic>211</italic> might regulate the activity of NF-κB signaling pathway through modulation of IKKα. Later, IF assays also confirmed the results of western blotting. Above all, we found that <italic>Mir204</italic>/<italic>211</italic> attenuated inflammation-mediated exacerbation by regulation of NF-κB p65 translocation in RA.</p><p>In terms of cell proliferation, CCK-8 analysis and flow cytometry were both conducted. Cell cycle regulatory proteins include cyclins, cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), and CDK inhibitors (CKIs). <italic>Ccnd1</italic> and <italic>Cdkn1c</italic> (CKI) both regulate the cell cycle through regulation of the G1/S phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Wang et al., 2020b</xref>).

Simultaneous overexpression of <italic>Mir204</italic>/<italic>211</italic> blocked cell cycle in G0/G1 phase, notably reduced <italic>Ccnd1</italic> expression, and greatly increased <italic>Cdkn2a</italic>, <italic>Cdkn1a,</italic> and <italic>Cdkn1c</italic> mRNA expression, whereas simultaneous knockdown of <italic>Mir204</italic>/<italic>211</italic> led to a significant increase in <italic>Ccnd1</italic> expression and a significant decrease in <italic>Cdkn2a</italic>, <italic>Cdkn1a,</italic> and <italic>Cdkn1c</italic> expressions. <italic>Mir204</italic>/<italic>211</italic> influenced the cell cycle by regulating <italic>Ccnd1</italic>, <italic>Cdkn2a, Cdkn1a,</italic> and <italic>Cdkn1c</italic> expression, thus inhibited cell proliferation.</p><p>PI3K/AKT is a classical signaling pathway participating in cell proliferation, migration, survival, and angiogenesis. Recent studies have shown that activation of PI3K/AKT signaling promotes the migration of RA FLS and plays an indispensable role in the pathogenesis of RA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Wang et al., 2020c</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Wang et al., 2020a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Jiao et al., 2018</xref>). PI3K regulates cell proliferation, apoptosis, and metabolism. Lin et al. reported increased expression level of PI3K in RA synovial tissue, and the elevated PI3K promoted AKT phosphorylation and activated the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. Activated AKT phosphorylates a variety of proteins and mediates cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lin et al., 2019</xref>). Western blotting results revealed that expression of PI3K and P-AKT protein was suppressed in the <italic>Mir204 + Mir211</italic> mimics group, while upregulations of PI3K and P-AKT were observed in the <italic>Mir204 + Mir211</italic> inhibitor group, revealing that <italic>Mir204</italic>/<italic>211</italic> inhibited aberrant proliferation of CIA FLS by regulating the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway.</p><p>Based on the results of bio-informative analysis, PCR assay, and western blot analysis, we found that <italic>Ssrp1</italic> was the downstream target gene of <italic>Mir204</italic>/<italic>211</italic>. We proposed that the abnormal expression of <italic>Ssrp1</italic> in CIA may be caused by the dysregulation of the upstream miRNAs, <italic>Mir204</italic> and <italic>Mir211. Trp53</italic> is a vital tumor suppressor gene, which plays a role in initiating cell death and leads to the inhibition of <italic>Cdkn1a</italic> in cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>). Wu et al. reported that NF-κB and P53 pathways could be regulated by FACT complex, and activation of NF-κB pathway and inhibition of P53 pathway might play the regulatory role of <italic>Ssrp1</italic> in colorectal cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Wu et al., 2019b</xref>). Ding et al. found that in hepatocellular carcinoma, high expression of <italic>Ssrp1</italic> activated the NF-κB pathway and suppressed the P53 pathway. Cyclins, such as <italic>Cdkn1a</italic> and <italic>Cdkn1b,</italic> are downstream signaling factors and can be regulated by <italic>Trp53</italic>. The expression level of <italic>Ccnd1</italic> could also be negatively regulated by <italic>Cdkn1a</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Vogelstein et al., 2000</xref>). Woksepp et al. demonstrated that knockdown of <italic>Ssrp1</italic> by siRNA enhanced the phosphorylation of P53 and resulted in P53 activation, indicating that <italic>Ssrp1</italic> had an inhibitory effect on <italic>Trp53</italic>. Over-activated NF-κB pathway is a common cause of the inhibition of P53 pathway in tumors, and P53 pathway is negatively regulated by NF-κB pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gasparian et al., 2011</xref>). Liao et al. reported that low expression of <italic>Ssrp1</italic> depressed p65 expression and a series of proliferation-related genes (such as <italic>Ccnd1</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Liao et al., 2017</xref>). Furthermore, Wang et al. also found that <italic>Ssrp1</italic> promoted cell proliferation and apoptosis by activating AKT pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Wang et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, we hypothesized that <italic>Ssrp1</italic> might regulate cell proliferation in RA by cell cycle.</p><p>Ki-67 is a widely used proliferation marker, highly expressed in cyclonic cells and significantly down-regulated in dormant cells. Ki-67 is an important proliferation marker for various cancer grades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Sun and Kaufman, 2018</xref>).

Pessler et al. have quantified a strong correlation between Ki-67 expression and the histological degree of synovitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Pessler et al., 2008</xref>).

In the primary fibroblast-like synoviocyte (FLS) culture studies, the authors found that the miR-204/-211 suppresses inflammation and cell proliferation. Taking advantage of a miR-204/-211 dKO mice, the authors demonstrated that miR-204/-211 attenuated synovial inflammation and excessive proliferation in RA model. Moreover, the authors identified the structure-specific recognition protein 1 (SSRP1) as a downstream target gene of miR-204/-211. Importantly, the authors showed that RA phenotypes observed in miR-204/-211 deficient mice were significantly decelerated by intra-articular administration of AAV-shSSRP1. Overall, the study provides useful new information on the role of miR-204/-211 in antagonize synovial inflammation and hyperproliferation during RA progression. The authors should consider the following concerns:</p><p>1) The authors should explain in the Introduction section on why miR-204/-211 not other miRNAs were chosen to study in RA development.

Cell cycle arrest with p16 and p21 upregulation is a hallmark change of cellular senescence.

Cellular senescence may play beneficial role sometimes depending on specific conditions and tissue microenvironments (Int Rev Cell Mol Biol. 2019;346:97-128; Bone Res. 2021 Sep 10;9(1):41).

The current study used a mouse model of RA and indicated that miR-204/-211 and SSRP1 are new molecules that involve in RA development, and serves as new therapeutic targets for RA. Data show (1) decreased expression of miR-204/-211 in CIA joints and FLS. Overexpression or knockdown of miR-204/-211 in CIA FLS reduces or increased growth, migration, and inflammatory cytokines, respectively. Bioinformatic analysis reveals that SSRP1 is the downstream target gene of miR-204/-211. Further, 204/-211dKO/CIA mice have more severe RA, which is attenuated by SSRP1shRNA. Conclusion is that miR-204/-211 and SSRP1 play a critical role in RA development and treatment. Further exploration is needed to investigate the interaction between miR-204/-211 and SSRP1 in RA. The study has many strengths as follows. (1) The role of miR-204/-211/SSRP1 in RA pathogenesis has not been studied. (2) Decreased expression of miR-204/-211 in CIA FLS is new and significant. (3) Both gain and loss of function approach are used. (4) Provided in vivo evidence to demonstrate the involvement of miR-204/-211/SSRP1.</p><p>1) Change all figures to dot-plot format.</p><p>2) CIA model, the arthritis incidence for mice with DBA background and mir-204/211 KO mice should be provided, specifically since it is difficult to induce CIA arthritis in B6 background. Sex of mir-204/211 KO mice should be provided.</p><p>3) Day of CIA when FLS is isolated and joint inflammation status at this time should be provided.</p><p>4) FLS is an important cell type for RA pathogenesis. However, other cell types such as macrophages and B and T lymphocytes also play a role in RA. Thus it will be important to examine the distribution of miR-204/-211/SSRP1 in joints by IHC or flow cytometry to demonstrate that fibroblasts are the main cells that express miR-204/-211/SSRP1. Another suggestion is to perform bioinformatic analysis using published scRNAdata from mouse or human RA synovium to show fibroblasts are the main cells that express miR-204/-211/SSRP1. These data will provide a strong rationale for focusing FLS in the current study.</p><p>5) The effect of mir204/211 mimics in CIA will be a critical experiment. Another point is if the focus is on mir204/211 target SSRP1, SSRP1 shRNA should be tested in CIA mice to see if SSRP inhibition should attenuate joint lesion for clinical relevance. The rationale of using mir204/211KO CIA mice is not clearly described.</p><p>6) It is not clear why CIA FLS is used in all in vitro experiments. Fundamental finding of this study is that CIA FLS has reduced mir204/211 expression, leading to FLS proliferation-inflammation. If this is the case, WT FLS should be used to see if mir204/211 inhibitor could make WT FLS expressing CIA FLS phenotype. Thus, it makes more sense to use WT FLS in loos of function experiment (mir204/211 inhibitor experiments). However, the overexpression experiment using CIA FLS is OK to show if over-expression in CIA FLS could rescue the phenotypes caused by low mir204/211 expression.</p><p>7) RA is an autoimmune disease and multiple organs may be involved. However, the rationale of using spleen cells in this study is not clear. Why spleen cells have reduced mir204/211 expression in CIA mice if the inflammation occurs in the joints? Is this a systemic effect? If the authors want to demonstrate the systemic changes of mir204/211 in RA, examination of mir204/211 in blood cells such as lymphocytes is more meaningful. I suggest eliminating the spleen data unless the authors provide a strong rationale.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>In the manuscript, the authors are trying to investigate the effect of miR-204/miR-211 on synovial inflammation and hyperplasia during the progression of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and further explore the mechanisms involved in the regulation of miR-204/miR-211 for synovial homeostasis. The authors provided a large amount of data to demonstrate that miR-204/miR-211 could mitigate synovial inflammation and attenuate excessive proliferation of fibroblast-like synoviocytes in RA. Moreover, they showed that SSRP1 could serve as the downstream target gene of miR-204/-211, and intra-articular administration of AAV-shSSRP1 could alleviate synovial inflammation and articular cartilage destruction in CIA miR-204/-211 dKO mice.</p><p>Overall, the study is well-designed and well-conducted. The authors conducted in vitro and in vivo studies, and further implement genetic mouse models and CIA-induced RA animal models to demonstrate that miR204/211 could regulate synovial inflammation and proliferation in RA by targeting SSRP1, and thus they could be novel therapeutic targets for RA. It would be better to include a pain behavior test in addition to paw swelling and arthritis scores, since joint pain is the manifestation of RA in clinic.</p><p>1) Pain test needs to be included to evaluate the effect of miR204/-211 dKO on RA induced joint pain.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.78085.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>In the present study, the authors investigated the effects and molecular mechanisms of miR-204/-211 on synovial inflammation and hyperproliferation in rheumatoid arthritis (RA).

Changes in spleen function and joint damage have been the focus of RA research. In previous studies, we found marked changes in cell proliferation in splenic lymphocytes and in a subset of T cells during RA progression [1-3]. Functional changes in splenocytes could reflect the immune status and disease conditions of RA. The finding of decreased miR-204/211 expression in spleen cells in CIA mice suggests that miR-204/211 have a significant effect on spleen cells in RA disease. We have eliminated the spleen data according to the suggestion of Reviewer 2.</p><p>Synovial inflammation and hyperplasia is suggested to be the major etiopathogenesis of RA. The hyperplasic synovial cells surprisingly display RA-like phenotype, such as anti-apoptosis and aggressive cell migration potential [4,5]. The migration of synovial cells lead to the direct contact of synovial cells with articular cartilage and regulation of articular chondrocyte metabolism. Apoptosis and migration of synovial cells are closely related to the progression of RA. Therefore, we studied how the effects of miR-204/-211 on apoptosis and cell migration.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The finding that miR-204/miR-211 induces cell cycle arrest and upregulate p16 and p21 gene expression is interesting.

Two main signaling pathways mediating the growth arrest of the senescent cells are the ATM/p53/p21Waf1 and the p16INK4a/pRB signaling cascades. The activation of p53 transcription factor increases expression of p21 to arrest the cell cycle. p16INK4a/pRB signaling initiates and maintains permanent cell cycle arrest [6,7]. In our study, we found that miR-204/-211 induce cell cycle arrest and upregulate p16 and p21 gene expression. In the revision, we isolated FLS from WT and miR-204/-211dKO mice and performed a β-galactosidase assay to determine whether miR-204/-211 induce cellular senescence. We found that β-galactosidase activity was down-regulated in miR-204/-211 dKO FLS as compared with WT FLS (Figure 5-supplement 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) In an earlier study, the authors demonstrated that miR-204/-211 loss-of-function induces matrix-degrading proteases in articular chondrocytes and synoviocytes, stimulating articular cartilage destruction.

Compared with CIA WT mice, MMP-13 positive cells were significantly increased in articular joint of CIA dKO mice (Figure 8—figure supplement 1). Furthermore, administration with AAV-shSSRP1 significantly decreased numbers of MMP-13 positive cells as compared with AAV-shRNA Ctrl in CIA dKO mice (Figure 9—figure supplement 1).

The current study used a mouse model of RA and indicated that miR-204/-211 and SSRP1 are new molecules that involve in RA development, and serves as new therapeutic targets for RA. Data show (1) decreased expression of miR-204/-211 in CIA joints and FLS. Overexpression or knockdown of miR-204/-211 in CIA FLS reduces or increased growth, migration, and inflammatory cytokines, respectively. Bioinformatic analysis reveals that SSRP1 is the downstream target gene of miR-204/-211. Further, 204/-211dKO/CIA mice have more severe RA, which is attenuated by SSRP1shRNA. Conclusion is that miR-204/-211 and SSRP1 play a critical role in RA development and treatment. Further exploration is needed to investigate the interaction between miR-204/-211 and SSRP1 in RA. The study has many strengths as follows. (1) The role of miR-204/-211/SSRP1 in RA pathogenesis has not been studied. (2) Decreased expression of miR-204/-211 in CIA FLS is new and significant. (3) Both gain and loss of function approach are used. (4) Provided in vivo evidence to demonstrate the involvement of miR-204/-211/SSRP1.</p><p>1) Change all figures to dot-plot format.</p></disp-quote><p>We have changed all bar graphs to the dot-plot format as the reviewer suggested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) CIA model, the arthritis incidence for mice with DBA background and mir-204/211 KO mice should be provided, specifically since it is difficult to induce CIA arthritis in B6 background. Sex of mir-204/211 KO mice should be provided.</p></disp-quote><p>In the previous studies, we found that the successful rate of CIA model in the DBA background strain was 100% [8]. In this study, the successful rate of CIA model in the miR-204/211 KO mice (B6 strain) was over 60%, which was much higher than that in wide-type B6 mice (20%). Furthermore, compared with CIA wide-type B6 mice, miR-204/-211 dKO mice induced with CIA showed much more severe paw swelling and increased arthritis score. Male miR-204/211 KO mice were used in the study and the sex of miR-204/211 KO mice were provided in Line 591, 595, 612.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Day of CIA when FLS is isolated and joint inflammation status at this time should be provided.</p></disp-quote><p>We have provided the day of CIA when FLS was isolated and joint inflammation status at this time (Line 619-621) in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) FLS is an important cell type for RA pathogenesis. However, other cell types such as macrophages and B and T lymphocytes also play a role in RA. Thus it will be important to examine the distribution of miR-204/-211/SSRP1 in joints by IHC or flow cytometry to demonstrate that fibroblasts are the main cells that express miR-204/-211/SSRP1. Another suggestion is to perform bioinformatic analysis using published scRNAdata from mouse or human RA synovium to show fibroblasts are the main cells that express miR-204/-211/SSRP1. These data will provide a strong rationale for focusing FLS in the current study.</p></disp-quote><p>We have examined the distribution of miR-204/-211/SSRP1 in joints as the reviewer suggested. Representative images of Fisher staining of miR-204/-211 in the knee joint sections of WT mice and CIA mice were shown in the revised manuscript. It is clear that miR-204/-211 were mainly expressed in the synovium of knee joint. Compared with WT mice, the expression of miR-204/-211 was lower in the synovium of CIA mice. SSRP1 was also highly expressed in the synovium of knee joint (Figure 6C and 8B). As compared with WT mice, SSRP1 expression was significantly increased in FLS and synovium in CIA mice (Figure 6C and 8B). We thus focused our work on the role of miR-204/-211/SSRP1 in RA FLS in the current study.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-78085-sa2-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The effect of mir204/211 mimics in CIA will be a critical experiment. Another point is if the focus is on mir204/211 target SSRP1, SSRP1 shRNA should be tested in CIA mice to see if SSRP inhibition should attenuate joint lesion for clinical relevance. The rationale of using mir204/211KO CIA mice is not clearly described.</p></disp-quote><p>Instead of using miR-204/211 mimics in CIA mouse, we used miR-204/211 dKO mice to investigate the role of miR-204/211 in RA progression. Consistent with our in vitro results, we found that miR-204/-211 dKO mice with CIA induction displayed more severe arthritis phenotype as compared with WT mice with CIA induction, suggesting that loss of function of miR-204/-211 aggravates RA progression (Figure 8). To further explore whether miR-204/211 target SSRP1, we performed in vivo experiments and found that RA phenotype observed in miR-204/-211 deficient mice were significantly decelerated by intra-articular administration of AAV-shSSRP1, which was consistent with in vitro results (Figure 9). These in vivo findings confirmed the role of miR-204/-211-SSRP1 signaling during RA development.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) It is not clear why CIA FLS is used in all in vitro experiments. Fundamental finding of this study is that CIA FLS has reduced mir204/211 expression, leading to FLS proliferation-inflammation. If this is the case, WT FLS should be used to see if mir204/211 inhibitor could make WT FLS expressing CIA FLS phenotype. Thus, it makes more sense to use WT FLS in loos of function experiment (mir204/211 inhibitor experiments). However, the overexpression experiment using CIA FLS is OK to show if over-expression in CIA FLS could rescue the phenotypes caused by low mir204/211 expression.</p></disp-quote><p>RA is a multifactorial immune disease. The evidence, obtained from genetic analysis, animal models, and clinical studies, points RA to an immune-mediated disease associated with stromal tissue dysregulation, together propagated chronic inflammation and articular cartilage destruction [9,10]. The phenotype of CIA FLS is completely different from WT FLS. According to the current research, WT FLS switches to the CIA FLS phenotype basically through immune induction which is a complicated process. WT FLS could not switch to CIA FLS in vitro by single miRNA stimulation or modification. In this study, we investigated the importance of miR-204/211 in RA disease progression. Therefore, CIA FLS, but not WT FLS, was used in all in vitro experiments. In in vitro experiments, CIA FLS was stimulated by IL-1β to maintain RA-like disease state so as not to lose the RA phenotype during the research period. We validated the importance of miR-204/211 in RA by lose-of-function and gain-of-function of miR-204/211 in CIA FLS.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) RA is an autoimmune disease and multiple organs may be involved. However, the rationale of using spleen cells in this study is not clear. Why spleen cells have reduced mir204/211 expression in CIA mice if the inflammation occurs in the joints? Is this a systemic effect? If the authors want to demonstrate the systemic changes of mir204/211 in RA, examination of mir204/211 in blood cells such as lymphocytes is more meaningful. I suggest eliminating the spleen data unless the authors provide a strong rationale.</p></disp-quote><p>We have eliminated the spleen data as the reviewer suggested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>In the manuscript, the authors are trying to investigate the effect of miR-204/miR-211 on synovial inflammation and hyperplasia during the progression of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and further explore the mechanisms involved in the regulation of miR-204/miR-211 for synovial homeostasis. The authors provided a large amount of data to demonstrate that miR-204/miR-211 could mitigate synovial inflammation and attenuate excessive proliferation of fibroblast-like synoviocytes in RA. Moreover, they showed that SSRP1 could serve as the downstream target gene of miR-204/-211, and intra-articular administration of AAV-shSSRP1 could alleviate synovial inflammation and articular cartilage destruction in CIA miR-204/-211 dKO mice.</p><p>Overall, the study is well-designed and well-conducted. The authors conducted in vitro and in vivo studies, and further implement genetic mouse models and CIA-induced RA animal models to demonstrate that miR204/211 could regulate synovial inflammation and proliferation in RA by targeting SSRP1, and thus they could be novel therapeutic targets for RA. It would be better to include a pain behavior test in addition to paw swelling and arthritis scores, since joint pain is the manifestation of RA in clinic.</p><p>1) Pain test needs to be included to evaluate the effect of miR204/-211 dKO on RA induced joint pain.</p></disp-quote><p>In our previous work, we have demonstrated that the miR204/-211 dKO mice had increased pain sensitivity tested by behavioral pain tests (von Frey test) and deficiency of miR-204/-211 in mesenchymal progenitor cells and mesenchymal joint tissues contributed to the genesis of OA pain. OA mice receiving miR-204 injection showed higher pain thresholds than those receiving control AAV5 injection, suggesting that miR-204 reintroduction in OA knee joints not only ameliorated histological features, including cartilage degradation and osteophyte formation, but also reduced pain [11]. Since RA is an autoimmune disease and synovial inflammation is the major etiopathogenesis of RA, thereby, in our present work, we concentrated our work on the role of miR-204/-211 in RA synovial inflammation. Since joint pain might also be an indispensable part in RA progression as suggested, we are planning to start a new subject focusing on the role of miR-204/-211 in RA joint pain in the near future.</p></body></sub-article></article>
