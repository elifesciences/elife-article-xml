including transcription, splicing, DNA repair, and messenger RNA export. In this study, we demonstrate that XAB2 is involved specifically and exclusively in Transcription-Coupled Nucleotide Excision Repair (TC-NER) reactions and solely for RNA polymerase 2 (RNAP2)-transcribed genes. Surprisingly, contrary to all the other NER proteins studied so far, XAB2 does not accumulate on the local UV-C damage; on the contrary, it becomes more mobile after damage induction. XAB2 mobility is restored when DNA repair reactions are completed. By scrutinizing from which cellular complex/partner/structure XAB2 is released, we have identified that XAB2 is detached after DNA damage induction from DNA:RNA hybrids, commonly known as R-loops, and from the CSA and XPG proteins. This release contributes to the DNA damage recognition step during TC-NER, as in the absence of XAB2, RNAP2 is blocked longer on UV lesions. Moreover, we also demonstrate that XAB2 has a role in retaining RNAP2 on its substrate without any DNA damage.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>XAB2</kwd><kwd>TC-NER</kwd><kwd>CSA</kwd><kwd>R-loops</kwd><kwd>pre-mRNA splicing</kwd><kwd>RNA polymerase 2</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-14-CE10-0009</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Giglia-Mari</surname><given-names>Giuseppina</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100006364</institution-id><institution>Institut National Du Cancer</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PLBIO17-043</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Giglia-Mari</surname><given-names>Giuseppina</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100006364</institution-id><institution>Institut National Du Cancer</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PLBIO19-126</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Giglia-Mari</surname><given-names>Giuseppina</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004099</institution-id><institution>Ligue Contre le Cancer</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>218398</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Giglia-Mari</surname><given-names>Giuseppina</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100006289</institution-id><institution>Electricité de France</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>218398</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Giglia-Mari</surname><given-names>Giuseppina</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>After DNA damage induction, transcription is blocked and XAB2 is released from R-loops allowing a subset of XAB2 molecules to interact with UV-stalled RNAP2 and participating to the TC-NER process.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The DNA molecule in our cells’ nucleus forms the instruction manual for proper cellular functioning. Unfortunately, the integrity of our DNA is continuously challenged by a variety of endogenous and exogenous agents (e.g., ultraviolet light [UV], cigarette smoke, environmental pollution, oxidative damage, etc.). These DNA lesions interfere with DNA replication, transcription, and cell cycle progression, leading to mutations and cell death, which may cause cancer, inherited diseases, or aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chatterjee and Walker, 2017</xref>).</p><p>To prevent the deleterious consequences of persisting DNA lesions, all organisms are equipped with a network of efficient DNA repair systems. One of these systems is the Nucleotide Excision Repair (NER) which removes helix-distorting DNA adducts caused by UV such as Cyclo-Pyrimidine Dimers (CPDs) and 6-4 Photoproducts (6-4PPs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Giglia-Mari et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>In mammals, the different steps of NER require more than 30 different proteins that are recruited sequentially to the DNA damage site, as demonstrated by the different studies of NER proteins kinetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Moné et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Politi et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Rademakers et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">van den Boom et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Zotter et al., 2006</xref>). The first step of NER consists of damage recognition, followed by the opening of the DNA duplex, dual incisions on both sides of the damage, excision of 24–32 oligonucleotides containing the damage and, finally, gap-filling by repair DNA synthesis.</p><p>NER is divided into two subpathways depending on DNA lesions position within the genome. The Global Genome repair (GG-NER) will detect and repair lesions throughout the genome, whereas Transcription-Coupled repair (TC-NER) is associated with RNA polymerase 2 (RNAP2) to repair lesions on the transcribed strand of active genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Marteijn et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>The NER system has been linked to rare human diseases, classically grouped into three distinct NER-related syndromes. These include the highly cancer-prone disorder Xeroderma Pigmentosum (XP) and the two progeroid diseases: Cockayne Syndrome (CS) and Trichothiodystrophy (TTD). Importantly, CS and TTD patients are not cancer prone but present severe neurological and developmental features (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Hanawalt, 1994</xref>).</p><p>Xeroderma Pigmentosum group A (XPA)-binding protein 2 (XAB2) is a highly conserved protein of 100 kDa and consists of 15 tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) motifs that carry out protein–protein interactions. XAB2 protein was identified as a protein interacting with XPA, a NER factor, using a yeast two-hybrid system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Nakatsu et al., 2000</xref>). Next, it has been shown that XAB2 interacts also with the TC-NER-specific factors, CSA and CSB, and the elongating form of RNAP2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Nakatsu et al., 2000</xref>). XAB2 is also essential for early mouse embryogenesis, as demonstrated by the preimplantation lethality observed in XAB2 knockout mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Yonemasu et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>Downregulation of XAB2, using either anti-XAB2 or siRNA, inhibits normal RNA synthesis and the recovery of RNA synthesis after UV irradiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Kuraoka et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Nakatsu et al., 2000</xref>). Furthermore, injection of anti-XAB2 in GG-NER-deficient cells significantly reduces UV-induced Unscheduled DNA Synthesis (UDS) during repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Nakatsu et al., 2000</xref>). These results suggest the involvement of XAB2 in transcription and TC-NER.</p><p>Further studies have shown that XAB2 is a component of the Prp19/XAB2 complex (Aquarius [AQR], XAB2, Prp19, CCDC16, hISY1, and PPIE) or Prp19/CDC5L-related complex required for pre-mRNA splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Kuraoka et al., 2008</xref>). XAB2, as well as PRP19 and AQR, has been involved in the DNA damage response (DDR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Maréchal et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Onyango et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Sakasai et al., 2017</xref>). Indeed, XAB2 is essential for homologous recombination (HR) by promoting the end resection step (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Onyango et al., 2016</xref>). PRP19 is a sensor of RPA-ssDNA after DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Maréchal et al., 2014</xref>) and AQR contributes to the maintenance of genomic stability via regulation of HR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Sakasai et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, AQR has a role in removing R-loops, a three-stranded nucleic acids structure composed of a DNA:RNA hybrid and the associated nontemplate single-stranded DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Sollier et al., 2014</xref>). These structures can form during transcription, when an RNA molecule emerging from the transcription machinery hybridizes with its DNA template. They are found abundantly in human gene promoters and terminators where RNA processing occurs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Wang et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Despite the knowledge acquired in the last decades on XAB2 and its different cellular roles, little is known about the exact crosstalk and dynamics between its diverse cellular functions, specifically between DNA repair transcription and splicing. In this work, we describe the molecular dynamics of XAB2 within the cell after UV-damage induction and during the TC-NER repair process. We determined in vivo that, in the absence of XAB2, Transcription-Coupled repair reactions are impaired, consequently, restart of transcription after UV damage is abolished. Surprisingly, unlike all the other NER proteins studied so far, the mobility of XAB2 is increased after irradiation, and XAB2 shows no accumulation on local UV lesions. This changing dynamic is not restored until DNA repair is completed. Indeed, in damaged TC-NER-deficient cells, XAB2 remains more mobile. Interestingly, we demonstrate that, after DNA damage induction, XAB2 is not released from the splicing complex but is detached from R-loops, a recently XAB2 identified substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Goulielmaki et al., 2021</xref>). Additionally, we investigate the relation between XAB2 and RNAP2, demonstrating that XAB2 retains RNAP2 on its substrate. Moreover, in the absence of XAB2, RNAP2 interacts strongly and durably with both types of UV lesions (6-4PPs and CPDs), suggesting a role of XAB2 in the DNA damage recognition step of TC-NER.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>XAB2 is involved in TC-NER process</title><p>Two decades ago, Tanaka’s research group demonstrated the involvement of XAB2 in the NER pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Kuraoka et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Nakatsu et al., 2000</xref>). However, the dynamics of XAB2 during the DNA repair process remained to be elucidated. We aimed to study the shuttling between its different functions when DNA damage is induced. Firstly, we wanted to verify that XAB2 is exclusively involved in TC-NER reactions.</p><p>The well-known standard assay used to quantify NER activity is the UDS, which measures replication activity outside the S-phase after ultraviolet light (UV-C) treatment. This technique quantifies the refilling of the single-strand DNA gap by the DNA replicative machinery. When we performed an Unschelduled DNA synthesis (UDS) assay in XAB2-silenced cells, no decreased level of UDS was observed (as well as in mock-treated cells; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> blue and black columns, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).

This result shows that XAB2 is not involved in the GG-NER subpathway, but does not exclude an involvement of XAB2 in the TC-NER subpathway.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>XAB2 is involved in DNA repair.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Quantification of Unscheduled DNA Synthesis (UDS) assay determined by EdU incorporation after local damage (LD) induction with UV-C (100 J/m<sup>2</sup>) in WT cells (MRC5 cells) treated with siRNAs against indicated factors.

This assay measures the newly transcribed RNA by incorporating a nucleoside analog coupled to a fluorophore. The experiment is conducted at different time points after UV irradiation (0, 3, 16, and 24 hr) in order to quantify the decline in transcriptional activity (3 hr after UV damage) and the restart of transcriptional activity (16–24 hr after UV irradiation). In XAB2-silenced cells, no restart of transcription after UV damage was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, blue column and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>), as well as in siXPF-treated cells due to the inability to repair DNA lesions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, red column and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>) and in contrast with siMock-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, black column and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>).

For this assay, we performed the UDS assay in GG-NER-deficient cells using XPC (Xeroderma Pigmentosum complementation group C) mutant cells (XP4PA-SV). The cells were transfected with specific siRNAs and then locally irradiated with UV-C through a filter. In order to precisely localize DNA-damaged areas, a γH2AX coimmunofluorescence labeling was performed, and repair replication was quantified. In siXPF-treated XPC-negative cells, both the GG-NER and the TC-NER pathways are compromised and, as expected, low TCR-UDS levels were observed compared to siMock-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, red and black columns and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>).

We thus decided to investigate the possible interaction between XAB2 and R-loops. Immunoprecipitation experiments with the S9.6 antibody show that XAB2 directly interacts with R-loops (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). To test the specificity of the R-loops antibody, nuclear extracts were treated with Benzonase, an enzyme that specifically degrades DNA:RNA hybrids. Interestingly, after Benzonase treatment, XAB2 is no more immunoprecipitated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), suggesting that XAB2 substrate is indeed DNA:RNA hybrids.</p><p>The interaction between XAB2 and R-loops was next investigated by performing IF and PLA experiments with the S9.6 antibody. It has been demonstrated that the S9.6 signal is prominently cytoplasmic and nucleolar and derives mainly from ribosomal RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Smolka et al., 2021</xref>). Consequently, to increase the specificity of the S9.6 fluorescent signal, the cytoplasm was removed before fixation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A</xref>) and during quantification, the nucleolar signal was subtracted from the nuclear signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Using this analysis method, we observed an increased amount of R-loops in cells silenced for XAB2 or AQR compared to control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3A</xref>).</p><p>Subsequently, we examined whether XAB2 is released from R-loops after DNA damage induction by performing a PLA assay. After UV irradiation, we measured a strong and consistent reduction of more than 40% of the interactions between R-loops and XAB2 and between R-loops and AQR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3B</xref>).

To verify that this result is specific for R-loops and not coming from a nonspecific interaction of XAB2 with RNAs, we performed the same assays (PLA and IF) in the presence of RNAseH which specifically degrades R-loops structures and not single-stranded RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4A, B</xref>). Our results show that RNAseH reduced the quantity of R-loops (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4C,F</xref>) and in doing so, it also decreased the interaction with both XAB2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4C, D</xref>) and AQR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4E, F</xref>).

However, this assay does not discriminate between the two phases of the TC-NER. As a consequence, proteins that are fully proficient in the repair reaction but fail in the transcription restart after DNA repair completion might have the same defect in RRS as those solely deficient in the DNA repair reaction.</p><p>Thus far, all studies have demonstrated the involvement of XAB2 in the TC-NER process using only RRS experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Kuraoka et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Nakatsu et al., 2000</xref>). In this study, we used a specific test developed in-house (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Mourgues et al., 2013</xref>) called TCR-UDS and thus demonstrated that, indeed, XAB2 is solely needed for the repair reaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). This is confirmed by PLA experiments showing an interaction between XAB2 and helix-distorting lesions, 6-4PPs and CPDs, after irradiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). However, these experiments do not clearly discriminate at which step of the repair reaction XAB2 may contribute. Two hypotheses are envisaged: (1) XAB2 functions in damage recognition or (2) in the repair reaction per se.</p><p>XAB2 has been found as part of the pre-mRNA splicing complex composed of AQR, PRP19, CCDC16, PPIE, and ISY1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Kuraoka et al., 2008</xref>). However, none of these proteins take part in the repair process, underlying the peculiar function of the splicing factor XAB2 in TC-NER repair (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">3</xref>).</p><p>We also demonstrated that, unlike all the other NER proteins studied so far, XAB2 protein is released from the damaged region induced by UV-C exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Concomitantly, we also observed an increase in XAB2 cellular mobile fraction after UV irradiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). This release from DNA-damaged area and increased mobility is surprising and atypical for a repair protein. However, this behavior has also been observed for late-stage spliceosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Tresini et al., 2015</xref>) and could be explained by the importance of the cell rapidly providing access to the repair machinery.</p><p>Surprisingly, the increased XAB2 mobility occurs in the absence of CSA and CSB proteins, with inhibitors of DDR after UV irradiation but also after transcription inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). These results strongly suggest that XAB2 remobilization is independent of the repair process but it is more a result of the transcription inhibition induced by the DNA damage. Moreover, the recovery of intrinsic XAB2 mobility is CSA and CSB dependent probably because in TC-NER defective cells, repair of transcribed genes is deficient and transcription is not recovered. As a consequence, a proper repair and re-establishment of the transcription process are needed to restore XAB2 mobility to normal values.</p><p>Previously, we reported that a complete TC-NER mechanism is required to repair the UV lesions present on active rDNA, genes transcribed by RNAP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Daniel et al., 2018</xref>). Notably, both Cockayne syndrome proteins (CSA and CSB) are implicated in this specific repair reaction, as well as the UV-stimulated scaffold protein A (UVSSA), a protein required for the stabilization of CSB specifically after UV irradiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Higa et al., 2016</xref>). By measuring the level of ribosomal RNA, we demonstrate that RNAP1 transcription restarts after irradiation in the absence of XAB2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>), meaning that UV lesions present on active rDNA are repaired. As a consequence, XAB2 is involved only in TC-NER of RNAP2-transcribed genes and probably not in the repair of RNAP1-transcribed genes, confirming a likely specific interaction with RNAP2 and reinforcing the idea that RNAP1 and RNAP2 repair processes are distinct although they share common proteins.</p><p>FRAP experiments in CSA and CSB mutant cells show a more immobile XAB2 fraction than in WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) without any damage induction. Tanaka’s group found that XAB2 interacts in vitro with CSA and CSB protein in the absence of DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Nakatsu et al., 2000</xref>). In addition, several studies demonstrated the involvement of CSB in transcription regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Boetefuer et al., 2018</xref>). As both CSB and XAB2 are necessary during the transcription process, it is therefore possible that the absence of CSB will modify XAB2 mobility. However, it is not excluded that in CSA and CSB mutant cells, a low level of unrepaired oxidative damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">de Waard et al., 2004</xref>) might interfere with the proper XAB2 mobility, eventually modifying the amount of R-loops within these cells. Nevertheless, it is difficult to precisely estimate the exact number of R-loops between different cell types, and this hypothesis is difficult to clearly assess.</p><p>The UV-induced remobilization of XAB2 is not explained by its release from the splicing complex, as demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation and PLA experiments, but it is more the result of the release from chromatin-specific structures, in this particular case the R-loops (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). An R-loop is a three-stranded nucleic acid structure composed of a DNA:RNA hybrid and the associated nontemplate single-stranded DNA. This structure arises naturally in organisms from bacteria to humans, and has a multitude of functions in the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Belotserkovskii et al., 2018</xref>). Our results show that R-loops are a substrate for XAB2, and after DNA damage induction, the interaction between XAB2 and R-loops is strongly reduced. This might explain the increased XAB2 mobility during the TC-NER reaction.</p><p>It was previously demonstrated that, in AQR-depleted cells, R-loops formation is induced. These R-loops are actively processed into DNA double-strand breaks by XPF and XPG, the NER endonucleases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Sollier et al., 2014</xref>). Without any damage, we also observed an increased level of cellular R-loops in both AQR- and XAB2-silenced cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>), suggesting an involvement of these two proteins in R-loops resolution, as recently also demonstrated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Goulielmaki et al., 2021</xref>.</p><p>Transcription process and R-loops formation are finely interconnected. Indeed, R-loops formation can cause transcription blockage. Transcription blockage due to DNA damage appears to result in R-loops formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Mullenders, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Steurer and Marteijn, 2017</xref>). Moreover, transcription activity declines after UV irradiation and mRNAs levels are drastically reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s5">Figure 5—figure supplement 5</xref>). PLA assays show that, after UV irradiation, XAB2 and total RNAs interaction is reduced. However, because the total amount of RNAs is diminished after transcription block, we assume that XAB2_RNAs interaction is lessened because of the intrinsic reduced amount of RNAs. Differently from total RNAs, in our study, we observe that R-loops do not decrease in number after UV damage and transcription inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). Therefore, the interaction XAB2_R-loops and AQR_R-loops is specifically hindered after UV damage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). However, a careful interpretation of these results should be made because a recent paper demonstrates that the S9.6 antibody, specific for DNA:RNA hybrids, can also recognize other nucleic acid structures in immunofluorescence assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Smolka et al., 2021</xref>). To be able to confirm our results, many additional controls were performed: (1) removal of the cytoplasm before fixation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A</xref>); (2) subtraction of the nucleolar signal from the nuclear signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2B</xref>); (3) treatment with RNAseH which degrade specifically R-loops (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4</xref>); and (4) finally interaction of XAB2 with nascent RNA (EU staining) is different from interaction with R-loops (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s5">Figure 5—figure supplement 5</xref>). Although all controls point to a seeming interaction between XAB2 and R-loops or between AQR and R-loops, we cannot exclude that XAB2 and AQR do not release from DNA:RNA hybrids but from other nucleic acid structures, for example, double-stranded DNA.</p><p>Because XAB2 interacts in vitro with CSA and CSB protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Nakatsu et al., 2000</xref>) and recent studies have shown an interaction with XPG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Goulielmaki et al., 2021</xref>), we decided to verify whether these interactions were modified during the DNA repair process and the concomitant transcription inhibition. Our results show a clear and consistent reduction of interaction between XAB2 and CSA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A, B</xref>) and between XAB2 and XPG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C, D</xref>) but not between XAB2 and CSB or between XAB2 and XPB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). These results suggest that XAB2 intervenes in the early steps of TC-NER or at least in the steps that imply the activity of CSB and TFIIH and most probably the early RNAP2 blocking-recognition step. However, the reduction of interactions between XAB2 and CSA or XPG is less striking than the one with R-loops. As suggested in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Goulielmaki et al., 2021</xref>, another working hypothesis would be that XAB2 is released from CSA and XPG proteins associated with R-loops processing.</p><p>The physical interaction between XAB2 and RNAP2 has already been established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Kuraoka et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Nakatsu et al., 2000</xref>), but the exact relation between XAB2 and RNAP2 has not yet been disclosed. Without DNA damage, we observed a difference in nascent RNA synthesis in XAB2-silenced cells compared to control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Since XAB2 functions in both transcription and splicing, it is not surprising that the quantity of nascent RNA is altered in the absence of XAB2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Goulielmaki et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Kuraoka et al., 2008</xref>). Moreover, we have clearly demonstrated by FRAP experiments that RNAP2 mobility is severely affected in the absence of XAB2. Namely, in XAB2-depleted cells, RNAP2 is released from its substrate and its mobility is strongly increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). RNAP2 immobile fraction after UV irradiation does not change significantly in the presence or absence of XAB2. However, we could observe that interactions of RNAP2 with the UV lesions (6-4PPs or CPDs) are stronger after DNA damage and last longer in siXAB2-treated cells compared to siMock-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B–D</xref>). These results suggest that, during transcription, XAB2 helps RNAP2 anchoring to its substrate, whereas during the TC-NER process, it has an effect on stalling of RNAP2 on UV lesions, advocating for a potential role in the DNA damage recognition step.</p><p>In conclusion, we describe here an increased mobility of the protein XAB2 during the DNA damage-dependent transcription inhibition. This increased mobility might partly be explained by the release of XAB2 from its substrate R-loops and its partner CSA and XPG. Importantly, we demonstrate that XAB2 plays an anchoring role for RNAP2 to its substrate during transcription and helps RNAP2 to detach from UV lesions after DNA damage. As aconsequence, the absence of XAB2 hinders the overall transcription activity of the cells and severely affects the TC-NER capacity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>).</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Model of XAB2 dynamics during DNA damage-dependent transcription inhibition.</title><p>Considering our results, a hypothetical model of XAB2 roles and dynamics can be sketched. XAB2 is involved in R-loops removal and pre-mRNA splicing, both processes linked to transcription. After DNA damage induction, transcription is blocked and XAB2 (together with some of the proteins involved in the splicing) is massively released from R-loops allowing a subset of XAB2 molecules to interact with UV-stalled RNA polymerase 2 (RNAP2) and participate in the TC-NER process. In the absence of XAB2, TC-NER is defective and as a consequence, RNAP2 remains longer in the proximity of DNA lesions.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-77094-fig8-v3.tif"/></fig></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell culture and treatments</title><p>The cells used in this study come from Erasmus MC in Rotterdam and were: (1) wild-type SV40-immortalized human fibroblasts (MRC5 [RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:CVCL_D690">CVCL_D690]</ext-link>); (2) XPC-deficient SV40-immortalized human fibroblast (XP4PA-SV, GG-NER deficient [RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:CVCL_6E33">CVCL_6E33</ext-link>]); (3) CSA-deficient SV40-immortalized human fibroblast (CS3BE, TC-NER deficient [RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:CVCL_F631">CVCL_F631</ext-link>]); (4) CSB-deficient SV40-immortalized human fibroblast (CS1AN, TC-NER deficient [RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:CVCL_L472">CVCL_L472</ext-link>]); (5) MRC5-SV stably expressing XAB2-GFP; (6) CS3BE-SV stably expressing XAB2-GFP; (7) CS1AN-SV stably expressing XAB2-GFP; and (8) MRC5-SV stably expressing RNAP2-GFP.

A narrow region of interest (ROI) centered across the nucleus of a living cell was monitored every 20 ms (1% laser intensity of the 488-nm line of a 25-mW Argon laser) until the fluorescence signal reached a steady state level (after ≈2 s). The same region was then photobleached for 20 ms at 100% laser intensity. Recovery of fluorescence in the bleached ROI was then monitored (1% laser intensity) every 20 ms for about 20 s. Analysis of raw data was performed with the ImageJ software. All FRAP data were normalized to the average prebleached fluorescence after background removal.</p><p>XAB2-GFP SPOT FRAP data were analyzed as follows (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). The No UV condition’s average fluorescence (over all cells) was subtracted from the average fluorescence of the UV-treated conditions. The obtained difference between the two FRAP curves was then summed point by point, starting from the bleach up to the following 100 measurements, that is, the area between the curve of interest and the untreated condition curve.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Protein extraction</title><p>For verification of siRNA efficiency, cells were cultured in a 6-well plate. The coverslip needed for the experiment was displaced before fixation, and cells that remained in the dish were collected. The extraction of total proteins has been performed using the PIERCE RIPA buffer (Thermo, #89900) complemented with PIC (Protease Inhibitor Cocktail from ROCHE).</p><p>For immunoprecipitation, cells cultured in 10 cm dishes were harvested by scraping, and the pellet was washed once with PBS supplemented with the PIC.

Moreover, these interactions last longer in time. These results are described in the last part of the “Results section” (lines 539-547). Graphs with signal quantification have been included in Figure 7 together with the result of RNAP2 dynamic, measured by FRAP. We also added representative images of this experiment in Figure 7 —figure supplement 1.</p><p>In parallel, because the results of these PLA “RNAP2-UV-lesions” revealed that depletion of XAB2 influence (directly or indirectly) the retention of RNAP2 on UV-lesions, we decided to perform a PLA experiment between XAB2 and UV lesions after irradiation. The results obtained show that XAB2 interacts directly with or is in proximity of 6-4PP and CPD lesions until their removal and because this is the first time that such a result is obtained, we tool the initiative to add these results in the manuscript in Figure 2 and figure supplement 2. To describe these results, new text has been implemented in the “Results section”, lines 121-127.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Resolve the conflict with Nakatsu et al. 2000 and Kuruoka et al. 2008 regarding the reported increase in transcription with RNAseq experiments with siXAB2 +/- UV.

Indeed, with 1 hour of EU incubation (the same time frame used in the work of Nakatsu) the quantity of nascent RNA is reduced in absence of XAB2 compared to control cells. The difference of nascent RNA synthesis between 1h and 2h of EU incubation could be explained by the role of XAB2 in transcription as well as in splicing. New text has been implemented in the “Results section”, lines 102-107.</p><p>We decide not to explore further this result because we consider it is not in the main scope of this article and it does not change our conclusions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Benzonase treatment in IP XAB2 experiments represents a critical control.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested by the reviewers #4, we performed Benzonase treatment to confirm the interaction of XAB2 with R-loops. We observed that after benzonase treatment and immunoprecipitation with S9.6 antibody, XAB2 is not anymore revealed by western blot, confirming the interaction of XAB2 with DNA:RNA hybrids.

It was not well described in our manuscript in the first version, but when we performed immunofluorescence with S9.6 antibody, we removed the cytoplasm before fixation and; during quantification, the nucleolar signal was subtracted from the nuclear signal.

With no treatment, this measure of fluorescence recovery corresponds to the protein mobility within the living cells. After perturbation of the nuclear environment (e.g. DNA damage), a protein can become less mobile if it physically interacts with a new substrate or a bigger complex; more mobile if the protein is released from its substrate; or eventually will not change its mobility.”</p><p>New version:</p><p>“In this technique, fluorescence molecules are photo-bleached in a small spot by a high-intensity laser pulse. Subsequently, fluorescence recovery within the bleached area is monitored over time. When cells are untreated, the measure of fluorescence recovery corresponds to the protein intrinsic mobility within the living cells. After perturbation of the nuclear environment (e.g., DNA damage), a protein can physically interacts with a new substrate or a slower complex, becoming less mobile or on the contrary can be released from its substrate, becoming more mobile. Eventually, the protein can also have an unchanged mobility.”</p><p>Results part – XAB2 is not released from the splicing complex during DNA repair reactions – 2<sup>nd</sup> paragraph.</p><p>Old version:</p><p>“In order to distinguish between these two possibilities, we firstly investigated whether XAB2 dissociates after DNA damage induction from the splicing complex described earlier. XAB2 was immunoprecipitated together with AQR. Interestingly, XAB2 was strongly and consistently immunoprecipitated 1-hour post-irradiation which corresponded to the time in which XAB2 mobility is increased and at the same time point more AQR is also immunoprecipitated. No clear release of XAB2 from AQR was observed at different time points.”</p><p>New version:</p><p>“In order to distinguish between these two possibilities, we firstly investigated whether, after DNA damage induction, XAB2 dissociates from its splicing partner AQR by immunoprecipitating XAB2 and AQR. Interestingly, XAB2 was immunoprecipitated more strongly and consistently 1-hour post-irradiation, time that corresponds to the XAB2 mobility increase. At the same time point, more AQR is also immunoprecipitated.

A decrease in the interaction between XAB2 and mRNA was observed but this decrease corresponded to the decrease of mRNA caused by UV-dependent transcription inhibition invalidating the results observed in the PLA XAB2-mRNAs.”</p><p>New version:</p><p>“Next, we verified whether the increase in XAB2 mobility observed after UV irradiation is due to a decreased interaction with messenger RNA (mRNA). PLA results show that a reduction in the interaction between XAB2 and mRNA was observed. However, this reduction paralleled the decrease of mRNA caused by UV-dependent transcription inhibition, suggesting that the results observed in the PLA XAB2-mRNAs are due mainly to a decrease in mRNAs amount.”</p><p>[Editors' note: this paper was reviewed by <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.reviewcommons.org/">Review Commons</ext-link>.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>General Statements</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to thank the referees for having reviewed our manuscript. Their comments and requests will help us to improve our manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Description of the planned revisions</p></disp-quote><p>Reviewer 3 thinks that the enhanced mobility of RNA polymerase 2 (RNAP2) after UV due to the absence of XAB2 might be a central observation that should be further explored. As suggest by the reviewer, we will perform PLA with the RNAP2 and CPD or 6-4PP antibody with or without UV and/or siXAB2 to observe if stalling RNAP2 might be affected.</p><p>Our figure S2B is in direct contrast with published findings (Nakatsu et al., 2000; Kuraoka et al. 2008) and with our FRAP experiment on RNAP2 as mentioned by reviewer 4 (point 1 and 2) and also reviewer 1. Indeed, we observed by fluorescence of EU incorporation more RNA in siXAB2 treated cells compared to siMock treated cells, without any damage. An increase of RNA is frequently correlated with an increase in transcription. However, as XAB2 is a splicing factor, we could hypothesize that the observed increased RNA may be linked to splicing defect. Indeed, the paper of Goulielmaki et al. 2021 already show by RNAseq analysis a global impairment of splicing machinery in siXAB2 cells. Nonetheless, this assay was performed with total RNA without any damage. We propose to repeat this experiment of RNAseq in siMock and siXAB2 cells on nascent RNA and in cells UV-irradiated or not.</p><p>We will repeat the IP XAB2 experiment with benzonase digestion as propose by reviewer 4 (point 5). Benzonase remove nucleic acid and by consequence R-loops. The experiment will probably explain why the amount of immunoprecipitated XAB2 increased after UV.</p><p>The discussion will be changed according to the new result and to take into account all the comments of reviewer (for example point 3, 6, 7 and 9 of reviewer 4). A hypothesis will also be proposed. The numerous typographical, grammatical and language errors throughout the manuscript noted by reviewer 4 will be corrected at the end.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Description of the revisions that have already been incorporated in the transferred manuscript</p></disp-quote><p>We have already carry out the following minors modifications in the transferred manuscript as suggest by reviewer 2, 3 and 4.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Description of analyses that authors prefer not to carry out</p></disp-quote><p>Reviewer 1 suggest to present the quantification results of PLA as foci count rather than signal intensity. This method is not applicable in our PLA because with obtain many foci which are difficult to distinguish. Moreover, there is a direct correlation between the number of foci and the signal intensity.</p><p>Reviewer 2 ask to include in Figure 2 images of baseline (NoUV). This request is not necessary as the fluorescence in the local damage is compared to the fluorescence of the whole nucleus without local damages and without nucleolus.</p><p>Reviewer 4 (point 4) find our RNAFish 47S not strong enough to conclude that XAB2 is not involved in TCR of RNAP1-transcribed gene because the recovery in WT cells is higher (150%) than the starting value (without irradiation, 100%), whereas in siXAB2 cells it returns exactly to pre-damage level. Usually, in WT cells the recovery is similar to non-irradiated condition but like any living organism the results are never completely reproducible. In conclusion, we will not perform further experiment to strengthen our RNAFIsh 47S result.</p><p>Reviewer 2 ask why we used a student’s test while data are presented with 3 or more groups, for which this test is not valid. We will not change our statistic method as we always compared only two different conditions: after irradiation compared to No UV condition or siRNA X compared to siMock. It was not specified in our manuscript and we correct this forgets in the figure legends and in the methods section.</p><p>Reviewer 2 and reviewer 4 would like better western blot pictures. We already put in the manuscript our best representative western blot.</p></body></sub-article></article>
