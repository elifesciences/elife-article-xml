compartment in which it resides. This activity primarily relies on the ESX-1 secretion system, predominantly involving the protein duo ESAT-6 and CFP-10. CFP-10 likely acts as a chaperone, while ESAT-6 likely disrupts phagosomal membrane stability via a largely unknown mechanism. we employ a series of biochemical analyses, protein modeling techniques, and a novel ESAT-6-specific nanobody to gain insight into the ESAT-6’s mode of action. First, we measure the binding kinetics of the tight 1:1 complex formed by ESAT-6 and CFP-10 at neutral pH. Subsequently, we demonstrate a rapid self-association of ESAT-6 into large complexes under acidic conditions, leading to the identification of a stable tetrameric ESAT-6 species. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we pinpoint the most probable interaction interface. Furthermore, we show that cytoplasmic expression of an anti-ESAT-6 nanobody blocks Mtb replication, thereby underlining the pivotal role of ESAT-6 in intracellular survival. Together, these data suggest that ESAT-6 acts by a pH-dependent mechanism to establish two-way communication between the cytoplasm and the Mtb-containing phagosome.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>M. tuberculosis</italic></kwd><kwd>VHH</kwd><kwd>Nanobody</kwd><kwd>ESAT-6</kwd><kwd>CFP-10</kwd><kwd>biochemistry</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000865</institution-id><institution>Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>OPP1179922</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tafesse</surname><given-names>Fikadu G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AI141549</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tafesse</surname><given-names>Fikadu G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100018124</institution-id><institution>Silver Family Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tafesse</surname><given-names>Fikadu G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000050</institution-id><institution>National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>5T32HL083808</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bates</surname><given-names>Timothy A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>168998</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Burke</surname><given-names>John E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000245</institution-id><institution>Michael Smith Health Research BC</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>17686</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Burke</surname><given-names>John E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>OHSU Biophysics Shared Resources Core and equipment</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>S10OD023413</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shinde</surname><given-names>Ujwal</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>ESAT-6, a virulence factor of <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic>, dimerizes at neutral pH and transitions to oligomers under acidic pH similar to that of lysosome, helping the bacterium evade host defense mechanisms.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Tuberculosis (TB), caused by <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (Mtb), is a major global health concern, claiming over 1.6 million lives annually. Mtb is highly adept at evading the immune system, and it can persist within an infected person for decades. This situation is worsened by the nearly 1.7 billion people globally who harbor a dormant Mtb infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Houben and Dodd, 2016</xref>), coupled with the rising trend of drug-resistant TB cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">World Health Organization, 2022</xref>).</p><p>To successfully establish an infection in the host, Mtb utilizes a plethora of virulence factors delivered via its several ESX-secretion systems. Studies have indicated that Mtb has the ability to damage the phagosomal membrane, a process that is heavily reliant on the activity of the ESX-1 secretion system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Conrad et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">López-Jiménez et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Schnettger et al., 2017</xref>). Currently, the most probable candidate driving ESX-1 dependent lytic activity is the well-known T cell antigen, the 6 kDa early secreted antigenic target (ESAT-6, or EsxA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Andersen et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Sørensen et al., 1995</xref>), after which the ESX family of T7SSs was originally named (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gey van Pittius et al., 2001</xref>). Secretion of the various ESX-1 substrates are known to be highly complex and interdependent, and while the full scope of ESX-1 components and substrates is still being worked out, many individual ESX-1 component knockouts are known to phenocopy the ESAT-6 deletion, indicating that ESAT-6 itself is responsible for the lion’s share of the activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Clemmensen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cronin et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lienard et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sanchez et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Over the last few decades, there have been numerous studies focused on uncovering the possible mechanism of membrane lysis by ESAT-6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Augenstreich et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Conrad et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">de Jonge et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kinhikar et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Koo et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lienard et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Osman et al., 2022</xref>), and how this might lead to escape of Mtb from the phagosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Houben et al., 2012</xref>). However, the field has been plagued by setbacks such as the discovery that many studies prior to 2017 showing membrane disruption by ESAT-6 were confounded by the contamination with the detergent ASB-14, which was originally added to remove endotoxin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Conrad et al., 2017</xref>). Consequently, most recent studies have focused on the use of intact bacteria in assays, frequently with the closely related <italic>Mycobacterium marinum</italic> (Mm), to avoid using recombinant proteins. The conclusions of these experiments are complicated by the interdependent nature of ESX-1 structural components, chaperones, and substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Augenstreich et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Osman et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Santucci et al., 2022</xref>). Mm has been a valuable model for working out ESX-1 and ESAT-6 function, and many of the key studies in the field have used Mm exclusively. However, the unique characteristics of Mm compared to Mtb can sometimes leads to differing results, and conclusions drawn from one species do not always apply to the other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bosserman et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Carlsson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lienard et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Osman et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Smith et al., 2008</xref>). This is important because the membranolytic activity of the ESX-1 seems to be highly context dependent, and more biochemical work is needed to work out the specific contributions of ESAT-6 to the membrane disruption phenotype.</p><p>Despite extensive research, the precise mechanism of ESAT-6 action remains elusive. This study aims to bridge this gap by performing comprehensive biochemical and cellular investigations of ESAT-6 under neutral and acidic conditions. We use biolayer interferometry (BLI) to measure the tight association between ESAT-6 and CFP-10, and the pH-dependent ESAT-6 self-association. We use fluorescence microscopy to directly observe formation of large ESAT-6 complexes, and we measure the stoichiometry of ESAT-6 under different pH conditions using multi-angle light scattering. We then use molecular dynamics-based modeling to evaluate the most likely modes of ESAT-6 interaction. We also generated a novel ESAT-6-binding alpaca-derived nanobody, E11rv, to further define the significance of ESAT-6 during Mtb infection. We perform biochemical characterization of E11rv, as well as functional testing, which showed inhibition of Mtb growth inside macrophages treated with E11rv or expressing cytoplasmic E11rv.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Recombinant ESAT-6 and CFP-10 purification</title><p>In seeking to perform functional studies of ESAT-6 and CFP-10, we produced recombinant protein using <italic>E. coli</italic> expression plasmids available from BEI Resources: pMRLB.7 (NR-50170) containing ESAT-6, and pMRLB.46 (NR-13297) containing CFP-10.

In general, the α-helices of ESAT-6 are stable, while the C- and N-termini are highly flexible. However, in the monomeric form, the residues between 20 and 50 exhibit increased flexibility at pH 7.5. At pH 4.5, the monomeric form exhibits increased flexibility along a majority of the backbone. At both pH values, dimerization (and tetramerization) result in greater overall stability. At pH 7.5, the average RMSF of the monomer is 2.51, which reduces to 2.33 for the dimer due to the reduced flexibility between residues 20 and 50. The tetramer is only marginally more stable, at 2.27.

Digestion followed by MS allows quantification of the extent of deuteration along the peptide backbone and concomitant binding site estimation. For E11rv, we observed decreased deuteration compared to apo around positions 50–65 (on the C-terminal helix, near the loop), and to a lesser extent positions 98–110 (within the tag). The region between these segments, from residues 66 to 94, displayed an increase in solvent exposure, as did residues 14–28, on the opposing helix directly across from 66 to 94. A likely explanation for this pattern is that E11rv binds around residues 50–65, and that this somehow destabilizes the C-terminal portion of the helix or separates the helices enough to allow more solvent exposure between helices. It is unclear how the small region within the tag might be involved, but <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref> suggests that the positioning of the tag has little impact on binding, and this region is predicted to be largely unstructured.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>E11rv inhibits Mtb replication in macrophages</title><p>We next performed functional testing of E11rv using two complementary approaches for measuring the growth and viability of internalized Mtb in macrophages.

Firstly, ESAT-6 undergoes rapid self-association into large complexes at pH levels below 5.0, and this may be preceded by formation of stable tetramers. Second, in the absence of CFP-10, ESAT-6 exists as a homodimer at neutral pH. Third, our nanobody, E11rv, binds to ESAT-6 and can inhibit the growth of Mtb inside cells when treated externally or via cytoplasmic expression.</p><p>The issue of incomplete information about the amino acid sequence of one of the most widely used ESAT-6 constructs is surprising, but none of the data we have generated suggested a practical difference with differently tagged constructs. Previous studies have found major differences in function between recombinant ESAT-6 in general when compared with ‘native’ ESAT-6 purified from Mtb cultures, which are typically purified using much harsher techniques than recombinant protein due to the lack of affinity tags. One attractive theory for the observed difference between recombinant and native ESAT-6 which is gaining traction is N-terminal acetylation being required for ESAT-6 function, but this has not yet been proven in Mtb infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aguilera et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Collars et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mba Medie et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Okkels et al., 2004</xref>). The most commonly given reason for the importance of N-acetylation is that acetylated ESAT-6 is more easily released from CFP-10 under acidic conditions. Our results suggest that purified ESAT-6 exists in a dimerized state in the absence of CFP-10, but our Native-PAGE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) and SEC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) demonstrate that purified ESAT-6 has no trouble interacting with CFP-10 to form a 1:1 complex. It is unclear whether the observed 1:1 complex is an ESAT-6/CFP-10 heterodimer formed by exchange between ESAT-6 and CFP-10 homodimers, or if we are instead observing formation of a tetramer composed of one each ESAT-6 and CFP-10 homodimers. Further, our low pH BLI results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>) suggest that self-associated ESAT-6 has no difficulty interacting with CFP-10.</p><p>Our modeling and SEC-MALS data suggest that ESAT-6 can interact with itself using both of its faces, one of which is hydrophobic, and one of which is hydrophilic; and both of which are supported by salt bridges formed by charged residues at either edge. This implies that ESAT-6 may still be able to self-associate within membranes via its hydrophilic face. This agrees with the putative requirement for compartment acidification in order to drive membrane damage, as our data suggests that low pH is required for self-association at this interface, but likely does not affect the hydrophobic interface, which must then require a different mechanism for dissociation and membrane insertion. Some have suggested that other mycobacterial factors may help facilitate the membrane insertion of ESAT-6, such as phthiocerol dimycocerosates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Augenstreich et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Augenstreich et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Modeling approaches have also been used previously to propose an organized ESAT-6 pore structure using similar logic, but these have yet to be supported by physical evidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Karki et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Refai et al., 2015</xref>). However, there is precedent for ESAT-6-like WXG proteins to form organized membrane channels, with a recent study demonstrating a pentameric EsxE/EsxF structure capable of membrane insertion and toxin trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Tak et al., 2021</xref>). Critically, EsxE does not dissociate from EsxF in order to insert into the membrane. Such structures have yet to be observed with ESAT-6/CFP-10, but this may just be a matter of finding the appropriate conditions and reagents.</p><p>Finding molecular tools to interrogate the function of Mtb virulence factors remains a challenge due to the complexity of accessing Mtb in its native environment within the phagosome. The nanobody described here presents a novel way of targeting the bacteria in situ, which we demonstrated by modulating its growth using intracellularly expressed E11rv. Because E11rv showed functional effects both when added in the media and when expressed inside the cell cytoplasm, it suggests a significant amount of communication between Mtb inside the phagosome and other compartments of the cell. This is consistent with the findings of many other studies which show numerous putative activities for ESAT-6 such as induction of apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Behura et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Choi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lim et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Yang et al., 2015</xref>), inhibition of interferon-γ production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kumar et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Peng et al., 2011</xref>), inhibition of autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dong et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Romagnoli et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Yabaji et al., 2020</xref>), inhibition of antigen presentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Sreejit et al., 2014</xref>), induction of type I interferon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lienard et al., 2020</xref>), and a more recent study showing an ESX-1-dependent mechanism for incorporation of Mtb antigens into MHC-I presentation via cytosolic antigen processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Leddy et al., 2023</xref>). Most of these functions rely on ESAT-6 getting into the cytoplasm, and this may occur via disruptions in the phagosomal membrane to establish two-way communication between compartments, or by complete phagosomal escape of Mtb into the cytoplasm and subsequent secretion of ESAT-6 directly into the cytoplasm.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plasmids and primers</title><sec id="s4-1-1"><title>Plasmids</title><table-wrap id="inlinetable1" position="anchor"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Name</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Description</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">pMRLB.7</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">ESAT-6 expression vector</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">BEI Resources, NR-50170</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">pMRLB.46</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">CFP-10 expression vector</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">BEI Resources, NR-13297</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">pMRLB.7-LPETG</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">ESAT-6-LPETG expression vector</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">This study</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">pHEN</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Nanobody expression vector</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hoogenboom et al., 1991</xref></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">pInducer20</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Lentiviral expression vector</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Meerbrey et al., 2011</xref></td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></sec><sec id="s4-1-2"><title>Primers</title><table-wrap id="inlinetable2" position="anchor"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Name</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Sequence</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">T7 (sequencing primer)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><named-content content-type="sequence">TAATACGACTCACTATAGGG</named-content></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">ESAT-6-Fw</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><named-content content-type="sequence">CCGGAAACCGGCGGCATCAAGCTTATCGATACCGTCGACCTC</named-content></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">ESAT-6-Rv</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><named-content content-type="sequence">GCCGCCGGTTTCCGGGAGCTCTGCGAACATCCCAGTG</named-content></td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></sec></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Cloning ESAT-6-LPETG</title><p>ESAT-6-LPETG was generated by in vivo assembly (IVA) as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">García-Nafría et al., 2016</xref>).

Bacteria was pelleted at 4000 x <italic>g</italic> for 10 min and resuspended in 40 mLs of lysis buffer (200 mM HEPES, 0.65 mM EDTA, 0.5 M sucrose, at cold pH 8), then incubated at 4°C for 1–2 hr. Add 40 mLs of ice cold water and incubate for 2 hr, rotating, to lyse periplasm by osmotic shock. Periplasmic fraction was isolated by centrifuging lysate at 8000 x <italic>g</italic> for 15 min, twice. VHH E11 was purified with Ni-NTA chromatography. Purified E11 was then buffer exchanged and concentrated with 3 kDa cutoff centrifuge filters (Millipore), then aliquoted and frozen for future use.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)</title><p>ELISA experiments were performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Weinstein et al., 2022</xref>). MaxiSorp plates (Invitrogen 442404) were coated with ESAT-6 at 5 µg/mL in PBS overnight at 4 °C. Plates were blocked in 2% BSA, 2% Polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), 0.1% Tween-20 in PBS (blocking buffer) for 30 min at RT. Dilutions of E11rv or isotype control VHH 52 were made in blocking buffer and added to plates for 1 hr at RT with shaking. Plates were washed with PBST three times for 5 min each and biotinylated anti-VHH antibody (Jackson Immuno 128-065-232) at 1:10,000 in blocking buffer was added for 1 hr at RT with shaking. Plates were washed again and incubated with 1:10,000 streptavidin-HRP (Jackson Immuno 016-030-084) in blocking buffer for 1 hr at RT. Plates were washed again and incubated with 50 µL of ODP (Thermo Fisher 34006), prepared according to the manufacturer’s instructions, for 15 min before stopping with 50 µL of 2 N H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>.

A protein mastermix was created for both reaction conditions (500 nM ESAT6, 1 µM E11rv or equivalent volume of E11rv buffer). The exchange reactions were initiated by the addition of 25 µL of D<sub>2</sub>O buffer (20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl) to 5 µL of protein mastermix (final D<sub>2</sub>O concentration of 78.6% [v/v]). Reactions proceeded for 0.3 s (3 s on ice), 3 s, 30 s, 300 s, and 3000 s at 20 °C before being quenched with ice cold acidic quench buffer, resulting in a final concentration of 0.6 M guanidine HCl and 0.9% formic acid post quench. All conditions and timepoints were created and run in independent triplicate. Samples were flash frozen immediately after quenching and stored at –80 °C until injected onto the ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) system for proteolytic cleavage, peptide separation, and injection onto a QTOF for mass analysis, described below.</p></sec><sec id="s4-17-2"><title>Protein digestion and MS/MS data collection</title><p>Protein samples were rapidly thawed and injected onto an integrated fluidics system containing a HDx-3 PAL liquid handling robot and climate-controlled (2 °C) chromatography system (LEAP Technologies), a Dionex Ultimate 3000 UHPLC system, as well as an Impact HD QTOF Mass spectrometer (Bruker). The full details of the automated LC system are described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Stariha et al., 2021</xref>. The samples were run over one immobilized pepsin column (Waters; Enzymate Protein Pepsin Column, 300 Å, 5 µm, 2.1 mm X 30 mm) at 200 µL/min for 3 min at 2 °C. The resulting peptides were collected and desalted on a C18 trap column (Acquity UPLC BEH C18 1.7 mm column (2.1x5 mm); Waters 186003975). The trap was subsequently eluted in line with an ACQUITY 1.7 μm particle, 100×1 mm<sup>2</sup> C18 UPLC column (Waters), using a gradient of 3–35% B (Buffer A 0.1% formic acid; Buffer B 100% acetonitrile) over 11 min immediately followed by a gradient of 35–80% over 5 min. Mass spectrometry experiments acquired over a mass range from 150 to 2200 m/z using an electrospray ionization source operated at a temperature of 200 °C and a spray voltage of 4.5 kV.</p></sec><sec id="s4-17-3"><title>Peptide identification</title><p>Peptides were identified from a non-deuterated sample of ESAT6 using data-dependent acquisition following tandem MS/MS experiments (0.5 s precursor scan from 150 to 2000 m/z; 12 0.25 s fragment scans from 150 to 2000 m/z). MS/MS datasets were analysed using PEAKS7 (PEAKS), and peptide identification was carried out by using a false discovery-based approach, with a threshold set to 0.1% using a database of purified proteins and known contaminants. The search parameters were set with a precursor tolerance of 20 ppm, fragment mass error 0.02 Da, charge states from 1 to 8, leading to a selection criterion of peptides that had a –10logP score of 16.2.</p></sec><sec id="s4-17-4"><title>Mass analysis of peptide centroids and measurement of deuterium incorporation</title><p>HD-Examiner Software (Sierra Analytics) was used to automatically calculate the level of deuterium incorporation into each peptide. All peptides were manually inspected for correct charge state, correct retention time, appropriate selection of isotopic distribution, etc. Deuteration levels were calculated using the centroid of the experimental isotope clusters. Results are presented as relative levels of deuterium incorporation and the only control for back exchange was the level of deuterium present in the buffer (78.6%). Differences in exchange in a peptide were considered significant if they met all three of the following criteria: ≥4.5% change in exchange, ≥0.45 Da difference in exchange, and a p-value &lt;0.01 using a two tailed student t-test. Samples were only compared within a single experiment and were never compared to experiments completed at a different time with a different final D<sub>2</sub>O level.

EsxA is secreted via the ESX-1 secretion system. Although this system is recognized to be crucial for virulence the actual mechanisms employed by the ESX-1 substrates are still mostly unknown. The EsxA substrate is attracting most attention as the central player in virulence, especially phagosomal membrane disruption. EsxA is secreted as a dimer together with EsxB. The authors show that EsxA is also able to form homodimers and even tetramers, albeit at very low pH (below 5). Furthermore addition of a nanobody that specifically binds EsxA is blocking intracellular survival, also if the nanobody is produced in the cytosol of the infected macrophages.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>Decent biochemical characterization of EsxA and identification of a new and interesting tool to study the function of EsxA (nanobody). Well written.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The findings are not critically evaluated using extra experiments or controls.</p><p>For instance, tetrameric EsxA in itself is interesting and could reveal how EsxA works. But one would say that this is a starting point to make small point mutations that specifically affect tetramer formation and then evaluate what the effect is on phagosomal membrane lysis. Also one would like to see experiments to indicate whether these structures can be produced under in vitro conditions, especially because it seems that this mainly happens when the pH is lower than 5, which is not normally happening in phagosomes that are loaded with M. tuberculosis.</p><p>Also the fact that the addition of the nanobody, either directly to the bacteria or produced in the cytosol of macrophages is interesting, but again the starting point for further experimentation. As a control one would like to se the effect on an Esx-1 secretion mutant. Furthermore, does cytososlic production or direct addition of the nanobody affect phagosomal escape? What happens if an EsxA mutant is produced that does not bind the nanobody?</p><p>Finally, it is a bit strange that the authors use a non-native version of esxA that has not only an additional His-tag but also an additional 12 amino acids, which makes the protein in total almost 20% bigger. Of course these additions do not have to alter the characteristics, but they might. On the other hand they easily discard the natural acetylation of EsxA by mycobacteria itself (proven for M. marinum) as not relevant for the function because it might not happen in (the close homologue) M. tuberculosis.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa4"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.91930.3.sa4</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Bates</surname><given-names>Timothy A</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Oregon Health &amp;

Based on the study by Refai et al. that we cite in the text, ESAT-6 treated with nonionic detergents ASB-14 or LDAO, but not other common detergents, undergoes a conformational change that increases its cytotoxicity in cell assays, hemolytic activity, and ability to dimerize with CFP-10. What is not known at this point, is how similar the ASB-bound conformation is to anything seen physiologically.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Building on the progress in making anti-ESAT-6 nanobodies and their anti-Mtb effects in the cells, it could have been tested in human or mouse primary macrophages infected with Mtb and a mouse model of Mtb infection for its anti-Mtb efficiency.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion, and we agree that these would be very informative next steps for determining the therapeutic potential of anti-ESAT-6 nanobodies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Minor comments:</p><p>Line 133: &quot;It is well established that Mm-induced hemolysis is ESX-1 dependent, but our results suggest that Mtb must lack one or more factors necessary for efficient hemolysis.&quot;. I would tone this down a bit, as it is also known that M. tuberculosis escapes much later than M. marinum from the phagosome, which could indicate different kinetics.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their insightful comments. We agree that the kinetics of Mtb and Mm infection are quite different and that this may impact the hemolysis assay. As described by Augenstreich et al. some hemolysis by Mtb is observed at 48 hours, though the method of normalization makes it impossible to determine absolute amount of hemolysis that occurred in their experiment. Our findings just show that the absolute amount of Mtb hemolysis in 2 hours is negligible, setting it apart from Mm. We have edited the wording of this statement in the manuscript to avoid any confusion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 155: &quot;Because Mtb often exists in an acidified compartment&quot;. First of all, the reference used here does not discuss anything about Mtb, secondly, papers that do measure the acidification of Mtb-loaded phagosomes indicate that this acidification is very mild (typically to pH 6.2).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this point should be articulated more precisely. We have added additional clarification that the pH of Mtb-containing compartments in macrophages can fall in a broad range depending on the activation state of the macrophages, and that non-activated macrophages are typically only mildly acidic. We have updated our references to better describe the current state of knowledge on this topic.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 339: &quot;Whereas most of these functions rely only on the secretion of ESAT-6 into the cytoplasm, the ability of E11rv to access Mtb suggests that this communication is likely two-way.&quot; No, not necessary, there are many processes in which ESX-1 substrates affect the macrophage. This nanobody could affect EsxA functioning only once the bacteria reach the cytoplasm. I think checking phagosomal escape in these cells is therefore crucial.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that phagosomal escape and subsequent direct secretion of ESAT-6 into the cytoplasm is a reasonable alternative hypothesis. We have added this point to our discussion, and we agree that looking directly at phagosomal escape is an important next step.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 7 is not mentioned in the text (mistake for Fig 6).</p></disp-quote><p>This has been corrected.</p></body></sub-article></article>
