Depending on the brain region studied, distinct effects of atRA on excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission have been reported. Here, we used intraperitoneal injections of atRA (10 mg/kg) in adult C57BL/6J mice to study the effects of atRA on excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission in the mouse fascia dentata—a brain region implicated in memory acquisition. No major changes in synaptic transmission were observed in the ventral hippocampus while a significant increase in both spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic current frequencies and synapse numbers were evident in the dorsal hippocampus 6 hr after atRA administration. The intrinsic properties of hippocampal dentate granule cells were not significantly different and hippocampal transcriptome analysis revealed no essential neuronal changes upon atRA treatment. In light of these findings, we tested for the metaplastic effects of atRA, that is, for its ability to modulate synaptic plasticity expression in the absence of major changes in baseline synaptic strength. Indeed, in vivo long-term potentiation (LTP) experiments demonstrated that systemic atRA treatment improves the ability of dentate granule cells to express LTP. The plasticity-promoting effects of atRA were not observed in synaptopodin-deficient mice, therefore, extending our previous results regarding the relevance of synaptopodin in atRA-mediated synaptic strengthening in the mouse prefrontal cortex. Taken together, our data show that atRA mediates synaptopodin-dependent metaplasticity in mouse dentate granule cells.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>vitamin A</kwd><kwd>retinoid signaling</kwd><kwd>hippocampus</kwd><kwd>synaptic plasticity</kwd><kwd>synaptopodin</kwd><kwd>spine apparatus</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003042</institution-id><institution>Else Kröner-Fresenius-Stiftung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EKFS_#2019_A94</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lenz</surname><given-names>Maximilian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CRC 1080</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Deller</surname><given-names>Thomas</given-names></name><name><surname>Vlachos</surname><given-names>Andreas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Project-ID 259373024 B14 - CRC/TRR 167</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Vlachos</surname><given-names>Andreas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>All-trans retinoic acid increases the number of excitatory synapses in the dorsal hippocampus of mice and improves the ability of neurons to express synaptopodin-dependent synaptic plasticity.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Adaptive processes in synaptic sites of the central nervous system are fundamental to normal brain function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Citri and Malenka, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Humeau and Choquet, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Neves et al., 2008</xref>). Several major signaling pathways and mechanisms that mediate and modulate synaptic plasticity have been identified in the past decades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abraham and Bear, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lüscher and Malenka, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Turrigiano, 2008</xref>). One of the key mediators of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic plasticity among plasticity-related signaling molecules is the vitamin A derivative all-trans retinoic acid (atRA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Aoto et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sarti et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yee and Chen, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shibata et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Prior to this study, we showed that atRA potentiates excitatory postsynapses in human cortical slices prepared from neurosurgical access tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lenz et al., 2021</xref>). This observation is consistent with previous reports suggesting that atRA mediates the accumulation of AMPA receptors at synaptic sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Poon and Chen, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Maghsoodi et al., 2008</xref>). Moreover, we demonstrated that the presence of the plasticity-related protein synaptopodin, which is an essential component of the calcium ion-storing spine apparatus organelle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Deller et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mundel et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Vlachos et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Vlachos et al., 2009</xref>), is required for atRA-mediated strengthening of excitatory neurotransmission in the mouse medial prefrontal cortex. In accordance with these findings, atRA triggers structural changes of synaptopodin clusters, spine apparatuses, and dendritic spines in human cortical slices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lenz et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Thus, both atRA and synaptopodin have been firmly linked to the ability of neurons to express distinct forms of synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jedlicka and Deller, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Vlachos, 2012</xref>) and their relevance in homeostatic and associative synaptic plasticity is well established.

Our results demonstrate that atRA promotes the ability of dentate granule cells to express synaptic plasticity. Specifically, a persistent strengthening of excitatory neurotransmission was observed after in vivo LTP-induction in the atRA-treated animals. In line with our recent findings, we showed that the presence of synaptopodin is required for atRA-mediated synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lenz et al., 2021</xref>). Aside from increased sEPSC frequencies and synapse numbers in the dorsal hippocampus, atRA had no significant effect on baseline excitatory and inhibitory synaptic strength in the dentate gyrus. Hence, we propose that atRA modulates the ability of neurons to express synaptic plasticity consistent with a synaptopodin-dependent metaplastic effect of atRA.</p><p>Vitamin A metabolites, such as atRA and their related signaling pathways, have been linked to various physiological brain functions, including synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lenz et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Arendt et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zhong et al., 2018</xref>). Accordingly, atRA has been evaluated in disease models and patients with brain disorders associated with cognitive decline, including Alzheimer’s disease, Fragile X syndrome, and depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bremner et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ding et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Soden and Chen, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Park et al., 2021</xref>). However, the precise mechanisms through which atRA asserts its effects on synaptic transmission and plasticity in health and disease are subjects of further investigations.</p><p>In a recent study, we demonstrated that atRA induces structural and functional synaptic changes in neurons of the adult human cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lenz et al., 2021</xref>). Specifically, an increase in the sEPSC amplitudes was observed 6 hr after exposure of acute cortical slices to 1 µM atRA. These functional changes were highly correlated with increased spine head sizes, and corresponding changes in synaptopodin clusters and spine apparatus organelles were observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lenz et al., 2021</xref>). Consistent with these findings, increased sEPSC amplitudes were observed in acute cortical slices prepared from the medial prefrontal cortex of wild-type but not synaptopodin-deficient mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lenz et al., 2021</xref>). These findings identified atRA as a potent mediator of synaptic plasticity in the adult human cortex. Furthermore, they suggest that synaptopodin-dependent signaling pathways are involved in mediating the synaptic effects of atRA.</p><p>In the present study, however, we did not observe any changes in excitatory synaptic strength in dentate granule cells in either the ventral or the dorsal hippocampus. Specifically, no changes in the sEPSC amplitudes were observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lenz et al., 2021</xref>). Consistent with these results no major changes in the ultrastructural properties of excitatory synapses, that is PSD lengths and presynaptic vesicle counts of asymmetric synapses, were observed between the two groups. Interestingly, ultrastructural analysis revealed an increase in the number of asymmetric synapses in the dorsal hippocampus of atRA-treated animals. Previous studies reported differential effects of atRA in distinct brain regions. For example, in the visual cortex, a reduction in inhibitory neurotransmission and no effect on excitatory neurotransmission were observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zhong et al., 2018</xref>), while in the somatosensory cortex, evidence for increased inhibitory synaptic strength in the absence of changes in excitatory neurotransmission was provided (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yee and Chen, 2016</xref>). Likewise, in the hippocampal CA1 region, atRA seems to potentiate excitatory synapses while depressing inhibitory synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sarti et al., 2013</xref>). These findings support the notion that atRA may assert its effect on synaptic transmission in a brain region- or cell type-specific manner. However, differences in the respective experimental settings must be carefully considered, such as the use of distinct tissue preparations (acute slices vs. organotypic tissue cultures vs. dissociated neurons) and differences in atRA administration (systemic vs. local; in vivo vs. ex vivo). Consequently, additional research is required to better understand the distinct effects of atRA on synaptic transmission and to determine, for example, possible concentration-dependent effects, the impact of a single dose versus repeated (long-term) administration, and the cell-type specific responsiveness to atRA. Nevertheless, the results of the present study demonstrate increased sEPSC frequencies and synapse numbers in the dorsal hippocampus of atRA-treated animals, thereby confirming that atRA targets excitatory synapses in the dorsal hippocampus.</p><p>The results of our mRNA analysis showed that intraperitoneally injected atRA affects the hippocampus and leads to transcriptional changes related to atRA-signaling/atRA-metabolism. These findings concur with previous work demonstrating RA signaling in the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Goodman et al., 2012</xref>). Notably, although a small number of genes showed transcriptional alterations, we did not observe any major changes in synaptic or plasticity-related genes. Thus, it appears unlikely that atRA affects plasticity primarily by regulating the transcription of plasticity-related genes. Rather, as has been suggested by others, atRA-induced changes in mRNA translation can account for the rapid effects of atRA on synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Poon and Chen, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Maghsoodi et al., 2008</xref>). In line with this interpretation, our previous work revealed that atRA-mediated synaptic changes are not observed when protein synthesis is blocked with anisomycin in mouse and human neocortical slices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lenz et al., 2021</xref>), suggesting that atRA modulates protein synthesis and, therefore, the availability of proteins required for the induction of synaptic plasticity. Although these findings do not fully exclude the possibility that atRA-related transcriptional changes influence synaptic plasticity to some extent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Garay et al., 2020</xref>), our data are in line with the effects of atRA on local protein synthesis, which plays a major role in different forms of synaptic plasticity, including metaplasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kang and Schuman, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sutton et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Woo and Nguyen, 2003</xref>).</p><p>It is interesting to theorize that atRA may act as a permissive rather than an instructive plasticity factor in this context. That is to say, atRA may not induce specific changes in excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission in distinct brain regions but rather act by influencing the ability of neurons to express structural and functional synaptic plasticity. Thus, the specific outcome of atRA treatment on excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission may depend on the specific stimuli applied or changes in network activity occurring after atRA administration. Since we did not observe major changes in baseline synaptic transmission, aside from changes in the sEPSC frequencies in the dorsal hippocampus and because no significant changes in input-output properties were observed in our in vivo electrophysiological recordings, we were able to test for such permissive, metaplastic effects of atRA. Therefore, in vivo LTP was probed with a mild plasticity-inducing stimulus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jedlicka et al., 2015</xref>). In the absence of any differences in input-output properties before LTP-induction, atRA promoted the ability of neurons to maintain increased synaptic strength 60 min after LTP-induction. These findings are consistent with atRA-mediated metaplasticity.</p><p>The plasticity-promoting effects of atRA were not observed in synaptopodin-deficient mice, suggesting that synaptopodin is required for atRA-mediated metaplasticity. These findings are in line with our previous work, which showed that the presence of synaptopodin is required for atRA-mediated synaptic strengthening to occur in the mouse prefrontal cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lenz et al., 2021</xref>). Moreover, we were able to demonstrate that atRA triggers an increase in synaptopodin clusters and spine apparatus sizes in human cortical slices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lenz et al., 2021</xref>). These findings call for a systematic assessment of atRA-mediated synaptopodin-dependent synaptic plasticity, including assessing specific stimuli, network states, and other conditions that may trigger associative and homeostatic changes in excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission. Whether and how ultrastructural changes of spine apparatus organelles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lenz et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Vlachos et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Galanis et al., 2021</xref>) reflect the induction of different forms of synaptic plasticity is currently unknown.

After fixation, frontal sections containing the dorsal hippocampus were generated using a Leica VT1000S vibratome. Isolated dorsal hippocampal slices were washed for 4 hr in 0.1 M PB. Subsequently, slices were incubated with 1% osmium tetroxide for 60 min, washed in graded ethanol (up to 50% (v/v)) for 5 min each, and incubated overnight with uranyl acetate (1% (w/v) in 70% (v/v) ethanol) overnight. Slices were then dehydrated in graded ethanol (80%, 90%, and 98% for 5 min each, 2 times 100% for 10 min each). Subsequently, two washing steps were performed in propylene oxide for 10 min each prior to incubation with durcupan/propylene oxide (1:1 for 1 hr) and transferred to durcupan (overnight at room temperature). Slices were embedded in durcupan, and ultra-thin sectioning (55 nm) was performed using a Leica UC6 Ultracut. Sections were mounted onto copper grids (Plano), at which point an additional Pb-citrate contrasting step was performed (3 min). Electron microscopy was performed with a LEO 906E microscope (Carl Zeiss) at 4646× magnification. For each sample, 12 images from the outer two-thirds of the molecular layer were acquired and further analyzed.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>RNA isolation and transcriptome analysis</title><p>Hippocampi were isolated from the brain of adult mice and immediately transferred into RNA protection buffer (New England Biolabs) and RNA was consecutively isolated using a column-based RNA isolation kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Monarch Total RNA Miniprep Kit; #T2010S New England Biolabs). Strand-specific cDNA library preparation from polyA enriched RNA (150 bp mean read length) and RNA sequencing was performed by Eurofins Genomics (Eurofins Genomics Europe Sequencing GmbH, Konstanz, Germany). RNA sequencing was performed using the genome sequencer Illumina HiSeq technology in NovaSeq 6000 S4 PE150 XP sequencing mode. For further analysis .fastq-files were provided. All files contained more than 45 M high-quality reads having at least a phred quality of 30 (&gt;90% of total reads).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>In vivo perforant path long-term potentiation</title><p>Three-month-old C57BL/6J (Synpo<sup>+/+</sup>) or synaptopodin-deficient male animals (Synpo<sup>−/−</sup>; with C57BL/6J genetic background) were kept in a 12 hr light/12 hr dark cycle (Scantainer) with access to food and water ad libitum. To achieve stable anesthesia, an initial dose of urethane (1.25 g/kg, in sodium chloride solution) was injected subcutaneously (s.c.); a supplemental dose of 0.1 g/kg was given as needed. After stable anesthesia was reached, atRA (10 mg/kg in 5% DMSO) or vehicle-only was intraperitoneally injected (blind to experimenter). The surgery and electrode placement were performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jedlicka et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Muellerleile et al., 2020</xref>). Briefly, the mouse was placed in a stereotactic frame (David Kopf Instruments) and local anesthesia with prilocaine (Xylonest 1%, Astra Zeneca, s.c. to the scalp) was applied. Cranial access to the brain was established according to coordinates from the mouse brain atlas (Franklin and Paxinos; stimulation electrode: 2.5 mm lateral to the midline, 3.8 mm posterior to bregma; recording electrode: 1.2 mm lateral to the midline, 1.7 mm posterior to bregma). The ground electrode was placed in the neck musculature. Electrophysiological signals were amplified using a Grass P55 A.C. pre-amplifier (Astro-Med) and digitized at a 10 kHz sampling rate (Digidata 1440A, Molecular Devices). Extracellular stimulation was performed using a STG1004 stimulator (Multichannel Systems). A bipolar stimulation electrode (NE-200, 0.5 mm tip separation, Rhodes Medical Instruments) was lowered 1.5–2.2 mm below the surface of the brain to target the angular bundle of the perforant path. Then a tungsten recording electrode (TM33B01KT, World Precision Instruments) was lowered in 0.1 mm increments while monitoring the waveform of the field excitatory postsynaptic potential (fEPSP) in response to 500 µA test pulses until the granule cell layer in the dorsal part of the hippocampus was reached (1.7–2.2 mm below the surface). The correct placement of the stimulation electrode in the medial portion of the perforant path was verified electrophysiologically by the latency of the population spike (approximately 4 ms), although the activation of some lateral perforant path fibers could not be excluded. Recordings started a minimum of 3 hr after experimental treatment with atRA or vehicle-only. An input-output curve was generated by 30–800 µA current pulses, repeated three times at each intensity, 0.1 ms pulse duration, 60 pulses total at 0.1 Hz. Perforant path-dentate gyrus (PP/DG)-LTP was recorded by applying stimuli with a current intensity set to elicit a 1–2 mV population spike (0.1 Hz, 0.1 ms pulse duration). PP/DG-LTP was induced using a weak TBS protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jedlicka et al., 2015</xref>) composed of three series of six trains with six 400 Hz current pulses at double the baseline intensity and pulse duration (with 200 ms interval between trains and 20 s interval between series). Following LTP induction, evoked fEPSPs were recorded for 1 hr using the baseline stimulation parameters.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Quantification and statistics</title><p>RNA sequencing data were uploaded to the galaxy web platform (public server: usegalaxy.eu; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Afgan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jalili et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Afgan et al., 2016</xref>) and transcriptome analysis was performed using the Galaxy platform in accordance with the reference-based RNA-seq data analysis tutorial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Batut et al., 2018</xref>). Adapter sequences, low quality, and short reads were removed via the CUTADAPT tool (Galaxy version 1.16.5). Reads were mapped using RNA STAR (Galaxy version 2.7.6a) with the mm10 Full reference genome (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>). For an initial assessment of gene expression, unstranded FEATURECOUNT (Galaxy version 2.0.1) analysis was performed from RNA STAR output. Statistical evaluation was performed using DESeq2 (Galaxy version 2.11.40.6+ galaxy1) with treatment as the primary factor that might affect gene expression. Genes were considered as differentially expressed if the adjusted p-value was &lt;0.05. Heatmaps were generated based on z-scores of the normalized count table.</p><p>Single-cell recordings were analyzed off-line using Clampfit 11 of the pClamp11 software package (Molecular Devices). sEPSC and sIPSC properties were analyzed using the automated template search tool for event detection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lenz et al., 2021</xref>). Input resistance was calculated for the injection of –100 pA current at a time frame of 200 ms with a maximum distance to the initial hyperpolarization. Resting membrane potential was calculated as the mean baseline value. AP detection was performed using the input-output curve threshold search event detection tool, and the AP frequency was assessed by the number of APs detected during the respective current injection time. One individual cell (control group, ventral hippocampus) was excluded from the analysis of intrinsic membrane properties, since the membrane patch lost its integrity during the recordings. The AP plots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref> depict cellular responses until 300 pA current injection. Beyond 300 pA, subsets of granule cells in both groups failed to maintain regular AP firing. The treatment did not significantly affect AP frequency beyond 300 pA current injection. In vivo perforant path LTP was analyzed using Clampfit 10.2 and custom MATLAB (Mathworks) scripts. In these experiments, one Synpo<sup>−/−</sup> animal in the vehicle-only group was excluded from further analysis, since an insufficient response to increasing stimulus intensities was detected in the input-output curve.</p><p>Electron microscopy images were analyzed and cross-checked by five investigators blind to experimental conditions. Image analysis was performed using the ImageJ software package (available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/">http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/</ext-link>). For PSD assessment, all visible PSDs in one image were counted and normalized to the image area. Subsequently, PSD length and presynaptic vesicle abundance was manually assessed. In case of perforated synapses, each PSD was analyzed individually. For statistical evaluation, each individual synapse was considered a biological replicate.</p><p>Data were statistically evaluated using GraphPad Prism 7 (GraphPad Software, USA). Statistical comparisons were made using the nonparametric Mann-Whitney test. For statistical comparison of XY plots in whole-cell patch-clamp recordings and fEPSP input-output curves, we used an RM two-way ANOVA test (repeated measurements/analysis) with Sidak’s multiple comparisons. Statistical analysis of fEPSP slope data was performed using the Mann-Whitney test for the three terminal data points. p-values smaller than 0.05 were considered a significant difference. In the text and figures, values represent mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM). Statistical significance in XY plots is indicated in the figure panel.

We went carefully through the manuscript and made several amendments to improve clarity by specifying “no major changes in excitatory synaptic strength are observed”. These findings are now substantiated with an additional dataset that we completed during the course of the revisions (see new figure 6). Assessment of synaptic cross sections in micrographs obtained from transmission electron microscopy showed no differences in basic morphological properties of pre- and postsynaptic compartments, i.e., PSD lengths and presynaptic vesicle counts, in vehicle-only controls and atRA-treated animals. Strikingly, a marked increase in the number of PSDs per area were observed in these experiments. These results show that atRA increases the density of asymmetric synapses in the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus in the dorsal hippocampus, thus providing an explanation for atRA mediated changes in sEPSC frequencies in that area.</p><p>“No major changes in synaptic transmission were observed in the ventral hippocampus while a significant increase in both sEPSC frequencies and synapse numbers were evident in the dorsal hippocampus 6 hours after atRA administration.”</p><p>“Next, transmission electron microscopy was used to assess the structural properties of excitatory synapses in the outer two thirds of the molecular layer in the dorsal hippocampus which is the layer of the major excitatory input from the entorhinal cortex (Figure 6). Cross sections of asymmetric synapses, i.e., the numbers and length of postsynaptic densities (PSD) and presynaptic vesicle counts, were quantified in control and atRA-treated mice (Figure 6A). It is well-established that PSD length in synaptic cross sections correlates to synaptic strength [34]. In agreement with our electrophysiological recordings, which showed no significant difference in the sEPSC amplitudes between the groups (c.f., Figure 1D), PSD lengths did not significantly change in the atRA-treated group (Figure 6B). However, a robust increase in the number of PSDs per area was detected, and presynaptic vesicle counts were not significantly different between the two groups (Figure 6B, C). These results indicate that the structural properties of synapses are not affected by atRA, and that increased synapse numbers may explain the increased sEPSC frequencies in the dorsal hippocampus of atRA-treated mice.”</p><p>“In the present study, however, we did not observe changes in excitatory synaptic strength in dentate granule cells in either the ventral or the dorsal hippocampus. Specifically, no changes in the sEPSC amplitudes were observed [12]. Consistent with these findings no major changes in the ultrastructural properties of excitatory synapses, i.e., PSD lengths and presynaptic vesicle counts of asymmetric synapses, were observed between the two groups. Interestingly, ultrastructural analysis revealed an increase in the number of asymmetric synapses in the dorsal hippocampus of atRA-treated animals.”</p><p>“Nevertheless, the results of the present study demonstrate increased sEPSC frequencies and synapse numbers in the dorsal hippocampus of atRA-treated animals, thereby confirming that atRA targets excitatory synapses in the dorsal hippocampus.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Please specify the part of DG analyzed in in vivo study as dorsal and ventral DG neurons responded differently in slice physiology.</p></disp-quote><p>In vivo recordings were performed in the dorsal DG.</p><p>“Then a tungsten recording electrode (TM33B01KT, World Precision Instruments) was lowered in 0.1 mm increments while monitoring the waveform of the field excitatory postsynaptic potential (fEPSP) in response to 500 µA test pulses until the granule cell layer in the dorsal part of the hippocampus was reached (1.7-2.2 mm below the surface).”</p><p>“To test the effects of atRA on the ability of neurons to express synaptic plasticity, long-term potentiation (LTP) experiments on perforant path synapses to dentate granule cells were carried out in the dorsal hippocampus of anesthetized mice (Figure 7A).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Compared to cortical neurons (from your previous publication) and many other studies on hippocampal pyramidal neurons, hippocampal DG neurons seem to be more resistant to the synapse-enhancing effects of atRA.

Consequently, additional research is required to better understand the distinct effects of atRA on synaptic transmission and to determine, for example, possible concentration-dependent effects, the impact of a single dose vs. repeated (long-term) administration, and the cell-type specific responsiveness to atRA.
