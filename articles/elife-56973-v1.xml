On the other hand, the social environment, which is composed of conspecifics that may vary in their genotypes, also influences social behavior, creating the possibility for indirect genetic effects. Here, we used a zebrafish oxytocin receptor knockout line to investigate how the genotypic composition of the social environment (G<sub>s</sub>) interacts with the oxytocin genotype of the focal individual (G<sub>i</sub>) in the regulation of its social behavior. For this purpose, we have raised wild-type or knock-out zebrafish in either wild-type or knock-out shoals and tested different components of social behavior in adults. G<sub>i</sub>xG<sub>s</sub> effects were detected in some behaviors, highlighting the need to control for G<sub>i</sub>xG<sub>s</sub> effects when interpreting results of experiments using genetically modified animals, since the genotypic composition of the social environment can either rescue or promote phenotypes associated with specific genes.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>social genetic effects</kwd><kwd>indirect genetic effects</kwd><kwd>gxe interaction</kwd><kwd>oxytocin</kwd><kwd>social behavior</kwd><kwd>zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000780</institution-id><institution>European Commission</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Lisboa-01-0145-FEDER-030627</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Oliveira</surname><given-names>Rui F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001871</institution-id><institution>Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PTDC/BIA-ANM/0810/2014</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Oliveira</surname><given-names>Rui F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001871</institution-id><institution>Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFRH/BPD/93317/2013</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nunes</surname><given-names>Ana Rita</given-names></name><name><surname>Teles</surname><given-names>Magda</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000780</institution-id><institution>European Commission</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>LISBOA-01-0145-FEDER-022170</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Oliveira</surname><given-names>Rui F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Individual social behavior results from the interaction between the individuals own oxytocin receptor genotype and the oxytocin receptor genotypes of other individuals present in its social environment.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Social genetic effects (aka indirect genetic effects) occur when the phenotype of an organism is influenced by the genotypes of conspecifics. Previous work has highlighted the major potential evolutionary consequences of social genetic effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Moore et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Wolf et al., 1998</xref>), with evidence for such effects to be present both in interactions between related (e.g. mothers and offspring <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Champagne and Meaney, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Wilson et al., 2004</xref>) and unrelated individuals (e.g. sexual displays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Petfield et al., 2005</xref>), aggression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Wilson et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Sartori and Mantovani, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Santostefano et al., 2017</xref>). More recently, the importance of social genetic effects for health and disease has also been recognized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Baud et al., 2017</xref>), which may explain the pervasiveness of the social environment as a mortality risk in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Holt-Lunstad et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Holt-Lunstad et al., 2015</xref>). Interestingly, the potential consequences of social genetic effects for the interpretation of research results using genetically modified organisms (GMO) has been greatly neglected. GMOs have been widely used in behavioral neuroscience to investigate the causal role of candidate genes and behavioral phenotypes. Typically Knock-in and Knock-out transgenics and mutants have been used to causally link the gain or loss of behavioral function to a specific gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Huang and Zeng, 2013</xref>). In recent years, the development of genome editing techniques, such as CRISPR-Cas9-and TALEN-induced mutations, have increased the interest in this approach and opened the door to studying the genetic basis of behavior in non-model organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hsu et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>However, most studies using GMO in behavioral neuroscience have ignored the potential contribution of the genotypic composition of the social environment to the behavioral phenotype studied. This is because it has been assumed that if the genetic background of these mutants is identical and their environment has been kept constant, any phenotypic differences must come from the genetic manipulation. However, when GMOs are incrossed or visually screened at a very young age (e.g. using reporter genes, GFP) and thereafter raised and housed together until used in experiments, changes in their behavior might be affected by the divergent genotypic composition of social environments experienced by these mutants. In other words, modified behavior might be a result of growing with their peer mutants, rather than the canonical social environment provided by wild-type conspecifics. Such problem is particularly relevant when studying social behavior. Thus, given the rising interest in the study of social behavior in model organisms from worms to higher vertebrates, an assessment of the potential effect of the interaction between the genotype of the individual (G<sub>i</sub>) and the genotypic composition of its social environment (G<sub>s</sub>), on the behavioral phenotype of interest in GMOs used in social neuroscience is crucial.</p><p>Despite the wide variety of species-specific social behaviors, a wealth of evidence has implicated the paralog nonapeptides vasopressin (VP) and oxytocin (OXT) and their receptors in the regulation of different aspects of social behavior across vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Donaldson and Young, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Goodson and Thompson, 2010</xref>), suggesting a genetic toolkit role (sensu evo-devo, i.e. ancient genes highly conserved among taxa that control the same biological process) for these nonapeptides in social behavior. Nonapeptides are an ancestral neuropeptide family found both in vertebrates and invertebrates, that derived from a VP-like peptide, and that evolved along two parallel clades of VP- and OXT-like peptides from the duplication of the VP gene in early jawed fish (ca. 500 Mya). Both peptides have been implicated in the regulation of behavior and physiology across different taxa, with VP being more involved in aggression and agonistic behaviors and OXT-like peptides consistently acting in affiliative behaviors and species-specific social behaviors across diverse taxa (i.e. sexual behavior, social interactions) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Stoop, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Goodson, 2013</xref>). Despite this wealth of evidence on the direct genetic effects of OXT on social behavior, social genetic effects (i.e. G<sub>i</sub>xG<sub>s</sub> effects) of OXT genotypes have never been studied.</p><p>In this study, we aimed to provide a proof of principle for G<sub>i</sub>xG<sub>s</sub> effects in behavioral phenotypes observed in GMO by assessing the occurrence of such effects in a knockout line for the OXT receptor in zebrafish, a commonly used model species in behavioral neuroscience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Orger and de Polavieja, 2017</xref>), which forms social groups (aka shoals, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Miller and Gerlai, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Miller and Gerlai, 2012</xref>) and expresses a rich repertoire of social behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Zebrafish Neuroscience Research Consortium et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Nunes et al., 2017</xref>). For this purpose, we studied the G<sub>i</sub>xG<sub>s</sub> interaction in the effects of the OXT gene (<italic>oxtr</italic>) in different aspects of social behavior, by raising individual zebrafish of the WT (<italic>oxtr<sup>(</sup></italic><sup>+/+)</sup>) or knock-out genotype (<italic>oxtr<sup>(</sup></italic><sup>-/-)</sup>) in different social environments (i.e. <italic>oxtr<sup>(</sup></italic><sup>+/+)</sup> shoal or <italic>oxtr<sup>(</sup></italic><sup>-/-)</sup> shoal; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Since sociality encompasses motivational, cognitive and collective behavioral traits, we have selected a set of tests that aim to characterize these different aspects at a fundamental level: (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Moore et al., 1997</xref>) the social preference and social habituation tests assess the motivation to approach conspecifics, and how it varies with the repeated access to conspecifics; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Wolf et al., 1998</xref>) the social recognition test, which provides an insight into the ability of zebrafish to discriminate between conspecifics based on one-trial learning; and (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Champagne and Meaney, 2006</xref>) tests of shoaling behavior that assess how well the focal individual is able to integrate itself into an unfamiliar shoal and what influence it has on the behavior of the other shoal members.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Genetic variation in the social environment affects zebrafish social behavior.</title><p>The contribution of the individual genotype (G<sub>i</sub>), the genotype of conspecifics in the social group (G<sub>s</sub>) and the interaction between the two (G<sub>i</sub>xG<sub>s</sub>) to the expression of behavioral phenotypes in zebrafish was assessed by raising oxytocin receptor mutant fish and wild types (focal fish marked with *) in shoals of either mutants or wild types (<bold>A</bold>). Social preference, measured by the time fish spend near a shoal vs. empty in a choice test (<bold>B</bold>, upper panel), showed a marginally significant effect of G<sub>s</sub> (<bold>C</bold>; Source data file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>).

Thus, social motivation in zebrafish seems to be influenced by the genotype of conspecifics rather than by the genotype of the individual. Hence, the increased social habituation in <italic>oxtr<sup>(</sup></italic><sup>-/-)</sup> fish does not seem to be due to reduced social motivation, but rather to an heightened habituation to the stimuli, suggesting that the observed G<sub>i</sub>xG<sub>s</sub> interaction effect is related to changes in single-stimulus learning mechanisms in mutant fish rather than to changes in social motivation.</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Effect of genotype of the focal individual (G<sub>i</sub>), genotype of conspecifics present in its social environment (G<sub>s</sub>) and the interaction between the two (G<sub>i</sub>xG<sub>s</sub>) on zebrafish social behavior was assessed using a two-way ANOVA.</title><p>~ indicates marginally significant, *p&lt;0.05, **p&lt;0.01, ***p&lt;0.001. (Source data files <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source datas 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata5">5</xref>).</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr><th/><th colspan="4">Social preference</th><th valign="top"/></tr><tr><th/><th>d.f.</th><th valign="top">Mean squares</th><th>F</th><th>Significance</th><th valign="top">Partial η<sup>2</sup></th></tr><tr><td>G<sub>i</sub></td><td>1</td><td valign="top">0.023</td><td>1.731</td><td>0.195</td><td valign="top">0.038</td></tr><tr><td>G<sub>s</sub></td><td>1</td><td valign="top">0.050</td><td>3.788</td><td>0.058<sup>~</sup></td><td valign="top">0.079</td></tr><tr><td>G<sub>i</sub> x G<sub>s</sub></td><td>1</td><td valign="top">0.001</td><td>0.049</td><td>0.825</td><td valign="top">0.001</td></tr><tr><td>Error</td><td>44</td><td valign="top">0.013</td><td/><td/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><th/><th colspan="4">Habituation</th><th valign="top"/></tr><tr><th/><th>d.f.</th><th valign="top">Mean squares</th><th>F</th><th>Significance</th><th valign="top">Partial η<sup>2</sup></th></tr><tr><td>G<sub>i</sub></td><td>1</td><td valign="top">0.058</td><td>13.927</td><td>0.001 **</td><td valign="top">0.240</td></tr><tr><td>G<sub>s</sub></td><td>1</td><td valign="top">0.008</td><td>1.936</td><td>0.171</td><td valign="top">0.042</td></tr><tr><td>G<sub>i</sub> x G<sub>s</sub></td><td>1</td><td valign="top">0.024</td><td>5.642</td><td>0.022 *</td><td valign="top">0.114</td></tr><tr><td>Error</td><td>44</td><td valign="top">0.004</td><td/><td/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><th/><th colspan="4">Social recognition</th><th valign="top"/></tr><tr><th/><th>d.f.</th><th valign="top">Mean squares</th><th>F</th><th>Significance</th><th valign="top">Partial η<sup>2</sup></th></tr><tr><td>G<sub>i</sub></td><td>1</td><td valign="top">0.213</td><td>7.600</td><td>0.008 **</td><td valign="top">0.147</td></tr><tr><td>G<sub>s</sub></td><td>1</td><td valign="top">0.005</td><td>0.189</td><td>0.666</td><td valign="top">0.004</td></tr><tr><td>G<sub>i</sub> x G<sub>s</sub></td><td>1</td><td valign="top">0.001</td><td>0.041</td><td>0.841</td><td valign="top">0.001</td></tr><tr><td>Error</td><td>44</td><td valign="top">0.028</td><td/><td/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><th/><th colspan="4">Social group integration</th><th valign="top"/></tr><tr><th/><th>d.f.</th><th valign="top">Mean squares</th><th>F</th><th>Significance</th><th valign="top">Partial η<sup>2</sup></th></tr><tr><td>G<sub>i</sub></td><td>1</td><td valign="top">39.486</td><td>24.370</td><td>&lt;0.001 ***</td><td valign="top">0.356</td></tr><tr><td>G<sub>s</sub></td><td>1</td><td valign="top">12.565</td><td>7.755</td><td>0.008 **</td><td valign="top">0.150</td></tr><tr><td>G<sub>i</sub> x G<sub>s</sub></td><td>1</td><td valign="top">12.811</td><td>7.907</td><td>0.007 **</td><td valign="top">0.152</td></tr><tr><td>Error</td><td>44</td><td valign="top">1.620</td><td/><td/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><th/><th colspan="4">Social group dispersion</th><th valign="top"/></tr><tr><th/><th>d.f.</th><th valign="top">Mean squares</th><th>F</th><th>Significance</th><th valign="top">Partial η<sup>2</sup></th></tr><tr><td>G<sub>i</sub></td><td>1</td><td valign="top">174.366</td><td>4.309</td><td>0.044 *</td><td valign="top">0.089</td></tr><tr><td>G<sub>s</sub></td><td>1</td><td valign="top">657.221</td><td>16.240</td><td>&lt;0.001 ***</td><td valign="top">0.270</td></tr><tr><td>G<sub>i</sub> x G<sub>s</sub></td><td>1</td><td valign="top">122.980</td><td>3.039</td><td>0.088</td><td valign="top">0.065</td></tr><tr><td>Error</td><td>44</td><td valign="top">40.469</td><td/><td/><td valign="top"/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>When we tested social recognition, which is a form of social memory needed for individuality in social interactions (i.e. differential expression of social behavior depending on identity of interacting individual), that is known to be modulated by oxytocin both in mammals and zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ferguson et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ribeiro et al., 2020</xref>), we observed that <italic>oxtr<sup>(</sup></italic><sup>-/-)</sup> individuals exhibit a deficit in acquisition and retention of social recognition irrespective of the social environment (<italic>oxtr<sup>(</sup></italic><sup>-/-)</sup> or <italic>oxtr<sup>(</sup></italic><sup>+/+)</sup>) in which they were raised (F<sub>1,44</sub> = 7.600, p=0.008; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Thus, in contrast to social motivation, social memory seems to rely on the individual’s genotype. This result is in accordance with a recent study from our lab (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ribeiro et al., 2020</xref>) that has shown a deficit in one-trial recognition memory of both conspecifics and objects in <italic>oxt<sup>(</sup></italic><sup>-/-)</sup> fish, suggesting that this deficit is not specific to the social domain but is rather a general domain cognitive deficit.</p><p>Given that social behavior of zebrafish mainly occurs in the context of shoaling we have also investigated two shoaling behavior parameters: social integration and social influence. Social integration assesses how well the focal individual integrates in the social group (aka shoal), and is measured by its average distance to the centroid of the shoal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G,H</xref>). A G<sub>i</sub>xG<sub>s</sub> interaction was found for social integration, where <italic>oxtr<sup>(</sup></italic><sup>-/-)</sup> individuals raised in <italic>oxtr<sup>(</sup></italic><sup>-/-)</sup> shoals exhibit a significantly lower social integration than <italic>oxtr<sup>(</sup></italic><sup>-/-)</sup> individuals raised in <italic>oxtr<sup>(</sup></italic><sup>+/+)</sup> shoals; in contrast, <italic>oxtr<sup>(</sup></italic><sup>+/+)</sup> individuals exhibit high levels of social integration irrespective of the shoal type in which they were raised (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). Social influence assesses how the focal individual affects the shoaling behavior of the remaining shoal members, by measuring the shoal dispersion as defined by the perimeter of the other shoal members (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I,J</xref>). The presence of a single WT (<italic>oxtr<sup>(</sup></italic><sup>+/+)</sup>) individual in a <italic>oxtr<sup>(</sup></italic><sup>-/-)</sup> shoal was enough to increase its dispersion, whereas the presence of a single <italic>oxtr<sup>(</sup></italic><sup>-/-)</sup> individual in a <italic>oxtr<sup>(</sup></italic><sup>+/+)</sup> shoal did not affect its dispersion (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>). In summary, we show that distinct components of social behavior are differentially affected by the genetic composition of the social environment versus the <italic>oxtr</italic> genotype of the focal individual. Social preference shows a marginally significant influence of the genotype of conspecifics. Social recognition exhibited a pure effect of the individual genotype. And clear G<sub>i</sub>xG<sub>s</sub> interactions were observed in the cases of social habituation and social integration. Social influence had a major contribution of the social environment, which is also the case, to a lesser extent, with social preference. Thus, we demonstrated that genetic variation in the social environment interacts with individual genotype during the developmental acquisition of social behavior. In other words, variation in the genotypes present in the social environment can revert particular phenotypes associated with specific genes. These results are in line with reported interactions between other aspects of the social environment and oxytocin receptor genotype in the determination of social behavior phenotypes in human populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Thompson et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Wade et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">McQuaid et al., 2013</xref>). Our results suggest that more caution is needed in the interpretation of studies using transgenic or mutant individuals that are raised in cohorts of the same genotype, and that some phenotypes observed in transgenic or mutant lines may in fact result from G<sub>i</sub>xG<sub>s</sub> interactions.</p></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent, TL (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>oxtr</italic> mutant line</td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Nunes et al., 2020</xref></td><td valign="top">ZDB-ALT-190830–1</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Commercial assay or kit</td><td valign="top">NucleoSpin Tissue</td><td valign="top">MACHEREY-NAGEL</td><td valign="top"># 740952.50</td><td valign="top">For oxtr mutant genotyping</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Sequence-based reagent</td><td valign="top">sense 5’-<named-content content-type="sequence">TGCGCGAGGAAAACTAGTT</named-content>-3’</td><td valign="top">Sigma</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">For oxtr mutant genotyping</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Sequence-based reagent</td><td valign="top">antisense 5’-<named-content content-type="sequence">AGCAGACACTCAGAATGGTCA</named-content>-3’</td><td valign="top">Sigma</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">For oxtr mutant genotyping</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, , algorithm</td><td valign="top">SPSS 25.0</td><td valign="top">SPSS</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_002865">SCR_002865</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, , algorithm</td><td valign="top">Imagej (Fiji)</td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref></td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_003070">SCR_003070</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, , algorithm</td><td valign="top">Ethovision XT 11.5</td><td valign="top">Noldus Technology</td><td valign="top"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.noldus.com/ethovision">www.noldus.com/ethovision</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, , algorithm</td><td valign="top">GraphPad Prism version 6.0 c</td><td valign="top">GraphPad software, San Diego, California, USA</td><td valign="top"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.graphpad.com">www.graphpad.com</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Other</td><td valign="top">B and W mini surveillance camera</td><td valign="top">Henelec 300B</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Acquisition rate of 30 fps</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Other</td><td valign="top">Webcameras</td><td valign="top">Logitech HD C525</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Acquisition rate of 30 fps</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s3-1"><title>Zebrafish lines and maintenance</title><p>Zebrafish were raised and bred according to standard protocols and all experimental procedures were approved by the host institution, Instituto Gulbenkian de Ciência, and by the National Veterinary Authority (DGAV, Portugal; permit number 0421/000/000/2013).

The design is perfectly aligned to the question from the choice of the animal used to the conditions, genotypes and behavioral assays. The results are intrinsically interesting and also provide a critical proof of principle that will enable a myriad of future follow up investigations.</p><p>My major comments are analytical and rhetorical. The only experimental question I have is what are the N-s? Please explicitly state how many fish were studied in each condition.</p><p>I disagree with the terminology used. Eg in the Abstract: the social environment, which is composed of conspecifics genotypes, NO, clearly the social environment is far more than the genotypes of those around an individual. And the issue is not really genetics vs environment. It is Genetics-self/individual vs Genetics-shoal. The environment, even the &quot;social&quot; environment, comprises far more than a fish's genetics: its age, reproductive status, nutritional/stress state and so on. In the Introduction, the authors say that previous works &quot;have ignored the potential contribution of the environment to the behavioral phenotype studied.&quot; --This is not true. There is a large literature on how various forms of stress, occurring neonatally or at other times in the life cycle, interact with genotype. This example highlights the need to change the &quot;environment&quot; rhetoric used. It is, as the authors say: the genotypic composition of the social environment (Abstract). [Here I would only add the conspecific social environment as there are other species in an individual's natural environment.]</p><p>P=0.058 -&gt; This P value is used in line Results and Discussion section to say there was no significant effect of either genotype, environment or GxEs interaction on social preference. This appears to be an overstated adherence to p&lt;0.05 as meaningful. Is there a difference?</p><p>(SP = Time near shoal/ [Time near shoal + Time near empty]) -&gt; why not just use Time near shoal? What is left out here is the time a fish spends in the middle of the middle chamber. A fish that spends 1 minite and one that spends 9 minutes next to the shoal would both be seen as low social preference if they spent no time next to the empty tank but these two fish would appear to differ. Additionally, the heat plot in Figure 1B in particular suggests that the proximity criterion is imposed upon the data arbitrarily and does not reflect the distribution of the fish's location. I suspect that a better metric could be devised in short order. Finally, it was unclear to me whether a similar criterion of proximity was used for the other metrics but if so, the same comment goes for them as for social preference.</p><p>The results would be far more accessible if the metrics were described in the text. One of the lovely features of <italic>eLife</italic> is that length is not an issue. Take the space you need to tell your story and no more is the guide rather than an arbitrary number of words. So please explain the metrics in the Results section. Even the explanations that are present could be expanded to great effect. For example, social preference is tendency to be near other fish rather than empty water (other choices for the non-preferred tank could conceivably be objects, a group of fewer fish, a single fish and so on). And while the metrics of habituation and individual recognition are clear (from the methods section), a word about the meaning of these metrics would be helpful. In other words, give the reader a reason to think that the metrics are important rather than simply measurable and therefore useful.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This Short Report describes an elegantly designed experiment to show that the genotype of the rearing environment is important for behavior phenotypes of knockout animals in adulthood. They make the important point that the genotype of the rearing environment can influence behavioral phenotypes of knockout animals and cautions the scientific community to think about the genetic environment in which their knockouts are being raised, which will become even more important as more and more labs use knockout technologies in their animal of choice. Overall, I think this simple study is an important contribution to the field and have no major concerns.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>This is a brilliantly written, concise, logical and easy to follow paper in which the authors describe significant findings demonstrating GxE interaction in social behavior in zebrafish. The experiments are well described, well conducted, the results are well documented, illustrated, and are significant and important. The interpretation of the results is correct, and in addition to specifically for zebrafish social behavior research they also send a crucial message to all readers who study genetic effects on behavior.</p><p>1) Introduction.</p><p>Exactly because of the generality of the message, it'd be nice if the authors could expand their introduction/discussion and cite studies on zebrafish social behavior (e.g. Noam Miller had a series of experiments), genotype x environment interaction (with mice as well as with other fish species), as well as on the interpretation of studies using genetic manipulation (e.g. knock out). This broader intro would place the current study in the right context and would also correct the somewhat haphazard way the authors picked some studies to cite.</p><p>2) Materials and methods section.</p><p>Habituation score is not described for the social recognition test.</p><p>Shoaling behavior was recorded from a side-view camera, yet Figure 1G and I are depicting the fish from top view. Also, most shoaling studies using live shoal monitoring indeed monitor shoal cohesion, shoaling behavior with overhead cameras because shoal dispersion is better quantified in this two-dimensional plane, as opposed to from the side. One reason for this is that the relative distance of the fish to the top or to the bottom is more of a measure of fear/anxiety and less so of shoaling/social behavioral responses in laboratory tanks and in natural habitats with relatively shallow waters. Why was the side-view chosen?</p><p>Data analysis was conducted using ANOVA followed by Tukey's multiple range post-hoc tests. These are standard and accepted tests, but I note that ANOVA is known to be underpowered for detecting significance of interaction between its main factors. In fact, Wahlsten, (1990) demonstrated this specifically in the context of genotype x environment interaction. I draw the authors' attention to this because in their stat table, for example, they report G x E as p = 0.088 for social group dispersion, but find (I assume by Tukey) a clear indication of G x E interaction. It would be important for the reader to know the logic of how the authors proceeded from ANOVA to Tukey and how these seemingly conflicting stat findings are interpreted. That is, please cite the Wahlsten, 1990 paper and state what I mentioned above.</p><p>3) interpretation.</p><p>It is possible that the mutants do not recognize shoal-mates as conspecifics or do not have the ability to perceive and/or process finer social signals, hence the reduced discrimination score. There may be several other possible explanations too. Such possibilities of interpretive ideas/working hypotheses should be offered as they would help think about future studies for the analysis of behavioral as well as neurobiological mechanisms underlying the mutation induced changes in particular and the oxytocin-system in general.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #4</italic></p><p>The authors present an interesting paper that supports evidence for indirect genetics effects on social behaviour. They exploit the use of a zebrafish mutant for oxytocin receptor to understand if the social environment can modify the phenotypical response of the mutant in a plethora of different social behaviour assays.</p><p>The results of this paper have potentially a wide impact on the way social behavioural paradims are planned and executed. Therefore, the results need to be strong and heavily validated. I feel some controls and analysis could be added to support the main point. Below are my concerns about the paper:</p><p>1) Figure 1B and E</p><p>- I could not find on the legend what the heat map represents. Is it from a single fish? What type of fish and for how long?</p><p>2) Results Figure 1C.</p><p>- The social preference of w/t and OtxR fish raised with OtxR mutants is reduced. This is an important finding and it is not discussed in the paper. It seems that the social environment in both fish reduces sociality.</p><p>- The authors do not specify in the text if some of the fish used as social cue have been raised together with the focal fish.</p><p>- The authors identify mutated or w/t fish by genotyping the fish prior the experiments. How much time do the fish have to recover from the genotyping before the experiment, and are the fish selected for testing left in single tanks during this period of time?</p><p>3) Results Figure 1D.</p><p>- W/t fish seem to maintain similar habituation score when raised with w/t or OtxR mutants. In contrast, OtxR mutants seems to pay less attention to the social cue when exposed for the second time. This could be due to the fact that OtxR fish have a reduced interest for the social cue, however, other parameters could also be responsible for this. It is possible that the OtxR fish show a reduction of exploration to the chamber that is not specific to the social cue? Have the authors tested this possibility?</p><p>- Are the tested fish exposed to the exact same group of social cue fish after 24hours?</p><p>- The authors should analyse how w/t vs OtxR social cue interact differently with the test fish. This could provide an explanation for the difference seen in the graph results.</p><p>4) Results Figure G-J</p><p>- The authors say in the methods that they use tags to identify the tested fish. When was this tag introduced? The authors need to describe in detail what these tags are.</p><p>- My major concern is that the presence of a tag on a fish could also be the cause of the different behavioural phenotype seen. This could be resolved by using one of the several available tracking systems that allow to identify individual fish with high accuracy (Yun-Xiang et al., 2018, Romero-Ferrero et al., 2019).</p><p>- The authors in the methods write that a camera from the side was used to record the experiments. If this is the case, the schematics in Figure 1G and I should show fish from the side.</p><p>- &quot;Two components of shoaling behaviour were analysed in time bins of 8 seconds&quot;. What is the frequency of recording of the experiments? Did the authors saw a difference over time?</p><p>Results and Discussion section: &quot;In other words, the social environment can revert phenotypes associated with specific genes&quot;. This sentence is too strong since only few of the behaviours described in the paper seem to be modified by the social environment.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.56973.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The reviewers were excited about this clean study showing that the phenotypic expression of a genotype depends on the genotype of the individuals in the surrounding group as well as an individual's own genotype.

However, if one uses the time near the shoal without taking in consideration the time near the empty tank we are not ruling out other physical factors of the empty tank in the attraction expressed by the focal fish towards the shoal that is presented inside a side compartment of the tank. For this reason, preference scores, such as the one we have used, are commonly used in the field, and are needed to assess the relative attraction towards the shoal after removing any putative effects of attraction towards an empty tank/ tank wall (e.g. thigmotaxis).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Additionally, the heat plot in 1B in particular suggests that the proximity criterion is imposed upon the data arbitrarily and does not reflect the distribution of the fish's location.

As a result we have changed Figure 1F where there was an effect of genotype but not of the interaction, and we kept the post-hoc analysis in Figure 1J, where there was a marginally significant G<sub>i</sub>xG<sub>s</sub> interaction (p=0.088). Moreover, we have now also included the partial eta squared in the revised Table 1 and the marginally significant G<sub>i</sub>xG<sub>s</sub> interaction reported shows a moderate partial η<sup>2</sup> of 0.065.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) interpretation.</p><p>It is possible that the mutants do not recognize shoal-mates as conspecifics or do not have the ability to perceive and/or process finer social signals, hence the reduced discrimination score. There may be several other possible explanations too. Such possibilities of interpretive ideas/working hypotheses should be offered as they would help think about future studies for the analysis of behavioral as well as neurobiological mechanisms underlying the mutation induced changes in particular and the oxytocin-system in general.</p></disp-quote><p>In this paper we aim to draw attention to potential G<sub>i</sub>xG<sub>s</sub> effects in GMO animals used in behavioral neuroscience, and we used the oxt-receptor (<italic>oxtr</italic>) mutant as a case study. Thus, in the writing of the paper we are more focused on establishing a proof of concept rather than providing detailed tentative hypothesis for the observed results. Nevertheless, regarding the genotypic effect observed in <italic>oxtr</italic><sup>-/-</sup> fish, it has already been reported in another recent study from our lab (Ribeiro et al., 2020), where we have shown that this deficit is also present for object recognition, hence suggesting a general recognition memory deficit rather than a specific deficit in the social domain. We have added this information to the revised text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #4</p><p>The authors present an interesting paper that supports evidence for indirect genetics effects on social behaviour. They exploit the use of a zebrafish mutant for oxytocin receptor to understand if the social environment can modify the phenotypical response of the mutant in a plethora of different social behaviour assays.</p><p>The results of this paper have potentially a wide impact on the way social behavioural paradims are planned and executed. Therefore, the results need to be strong and heavily validated.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the commentaries.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I feel some controls and analysis could be added to support the main point. Below are my concerns about the paper:</p><p>1) Figure 1B and E</p><p>- I could not find on the legend what the heat map represents. Is it from a single fish? What type of fish and for how long?</p></disp-quote><p>The heat map is from a single representative WT focal fish raised in a wild-type social environment during a 10minute trial in both social preference (1B) and social recognition (1E). We have now included this information in the figure legend.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Results Figure 1C.</p><p>- The social preference of w/t and OtxR fish raised with OtxR mutants is reduced. This is an important finding and it is not discussed in the paper. It seems that the social environment in both fish reduces sociality.</p></disp-quote><p>As mentioned above by referee 1, there is a marginally significant main environment effect on social preference (p=0.058). We have now highlighted this finding in the last paragraph of the Results section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- The authors do not specify in the text if some of the fish used as social cue have been raised together with the focal fish.</p></disp-quote><p>Fish used as social cue were always unfamiliar fish which were not raised together with the focal fish. This is applicable for both Social Preference and first part of the social recognition test. We have now included this information in the subsection “Social preference and social habituation”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- The authors identify mutated or w/t fish by genotyping the fish prior the experiments. How much time do the fish have to recover from the genotyping before the experiment, and are the fish selected for testing left in single tanks during this period of time?</p></disp-quote><p>Fish were genotyped by fin cliping one-week prior to the experiments, to allow them to recover before being tested. During this period of time, the fish selected for testing were always together with their group members, which was possible because all members of the group were fin clipped at specific fin locations. To make it clear, we have now included this information in the subsection “Genotyping”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Results Figure 1D.</p><p>- W/t fish seem to maintain similar habituation score when raised with w/t or OtxR mutants. In contrast, OtxR mutants seems to pay less attention to the social cue when exposed for the second time. This could be due to the fact that OtxR fish have a reduced interest for the social cue, however, other parameters could also be responsible for this. It is possible that the OtxR fish show a reduction of exploration to the chamber that is not specific to the social cue? Have the authors tested this possibility?</p></disp-quote><p>We have also computed stimuli exploratory scores (stimuli exploratory score = (T shoal + T empty) / T total). As can be observed in the graphs bellow, there were no differences in stimuli exploratory score between the different groups in the two tests performed for social preference (Test 1- genotype: p=0.206, partial η<sup>2</sup> 0.036; environment: p=0.992, partial η<sup>2</sup> 0.000; G<sub>i</sub>xG<sub>s</sub> interaction: p=0.867, partial η<sup>2</sup> 0.001; Test 2- genotype: p=0.802, partial η<sup>2</sup> 0.001; environment: p=0.336, partial η<sup>2</sup> 0.021; G<sub>i</sub>xG<sub>s</sub> interaction: p=0.686, partial η<sup>2</sup> 0.004).</p><fig id="sa2fig5"><label>Author response image 5.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-56973-resp-fig5-v1.tif"/></fig><p>Furthermore, as shown in the following graphs, there are no differences in mean speed of the different groups during the two tests of social preference performed (Test 1- genotype: p=0.794, partial η<sup>2</sup> 0.002; environment: p=0.492, partial η<sup>2</sup> 0.011; G<sub>i</sub>xG<sub>s</sub> interaction: p=0.703, partial η<sup>2</sup> 0.003; Test 2- genotype: p=0.812, partial η<sup>2</sup> 0.001; environment: p=0.516, partial η<sup>2</sup> 0.010; G<sub>i</sub>xG<sub>s</sub> interaction: p=0.202, partial η<sup>2</sup> 0.037).</p><fig id="sa2fig6"><label>Author response image 6.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-56973-resp-fig6-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Are the tested fish exposed to the exact same group of social cue fish after 24hours?</p></disp-quote><p>After 24 hours, fish were exposed to a different shoal of conspecifics in the same behavioral setup.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- The authors should analyse how w/t vs OtxR social cue interact differently with the test fish.

The following fin clips were performed within each group:</p><p>Fish 1- Bottom caudal fin</p><p>Fish 2- Top caudal fin</p><p>Fish 3- Bottom and Top caudal fin</p><p>Fish 4- Bottom caudal and anal fin</p><p>Fish 5- Top caudal and anal fin</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- My major concern is that the presence of a tag on a fish could also be the cause of the different behavioural phenotype seen. This could be resolved by using one of the several available tracking systems that allow to identify individual fish with high accuracy (Yun-Xiang et al., 2018, Romero-Ferrero et al., 2019).</p></disp-quote><p>We believe that the fin clipping was not the cause of the different behavioral phenotypes observed since: (1) all fish from the group were fin clipped at different fin locations to allow their identification; (2) the fin clip of the focal fish was not always in the same position; and (3) fish were allowed one-week recovery before being tested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- The authors in the methods write that a camera from the side was used to record the experiments.
