of other plants. How this type of plant-soil feedback affects agricultural productivity and food quality in the field in the context of crop rotations is unknown. Here, we assessed the performance, yield and food quality of three winter wheat varieties growing in field plots whose soils had been conditioned by either wild type or benzoxazinoid-deficient <italic>bx1</italic> maize mutant plants. Following maize cultivation, we detected benzoxazinoid-dependent chemical and microbial fingerprints in the soil. The benzoxazinoid fingerprint was still visible during wheat growth, but the microbial fingerprint was no longer detected. Wheat emergence, tillering, growth, and biomass increased in wild type conditioned soils compared to <italic>bx1</italic> mutant conditioned soils. Weed cover was similar between soil conditioning treatments, but insect herbivore abundance decreased in benzoxazinoid-conditioned soils. Wheat yield was increased by over 4% without a reduction in grain quality in benzoxazinoid-conditioned soils. This improvement was directly associated with increased germination and tillering. Taken together, our experiments provide evidence that soil conditioning by plant secondary metabolite producing plants can increase yield via plant-soil feedbacks under agronomically realistic conditions. If this phenomenon holds true across different soils and environments, optimizing root exudation chemistry could be a powerful, genetically tractable strategy to enhance crop yields without additional inputs.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Plant-soil feedback</kwd><kwd>Soil legacy</kwd><kwd>Crop rotation</kwd><kwd>Secondary metabolites</kwd><kwd>Plant-insect interactions</kwd><kwd>Kernel quality</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Wheat</kwd><kwd>Maize</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009068</institution-id><institution>University of Bern</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Interfaculty Research Collaboration &quot;One Health&quot;</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schlaeppi</surname><given-names>Klaus</given-names></name><name><surname>Erb</surname><given-names>Matthias</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A 2-year field experiment reveals that plant secondary metabolites can be harnessed to increase crop productivity through plant-soil feedbacks under agronomically realistic conditions.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Plants alter the soil they live in, and thereby modulate the growth and defense status of other plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bever et al., 1997</xref>). These so-called plant-soil feedbacks can influence plant community composition and ecosystem functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bennett et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Teste et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mariotte et al., 2018</xref>). They have also been used for centuries in crop rotation schemes to reduce pest, weed and disease pressure and ultimately improve crop yields (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">White, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">van der Putten et al., 2013</xref>). So far, however, proximate mechanistic work on plant-soil feedbacks has rarely been applied to improve crop rotations. Thus, the benefits of this research for the engineering of crop rotations for ecological and sustainable agriculture remain limited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mariotte et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Plant-soil feedbacks can act on a variety of plant traits. Reductions in germination through allelochemicals for instance are common and can be attributed to either direct toxicity or delayed germination resulting from biochemical recognition by the seeds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tawaha and Turk, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Renne et al., 2014</xref>). Changes in defense expression leading to differences in herbivore performance and preference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pineda et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kos et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hu et al., 2018b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pineda et al., 2020</xref>) and alterations in susceptibility to soil pathogens have also been observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ma et al., 2017</xref>). Finally, changes in hormonal balance have been linked to effects on plant growth and biomass accumulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pieterse et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hu et al., 2018a</xref>). The response to plant-soil feedbacks can strongly depend on environmental conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Smith‐Ramesh et al., 2017</xref>), and is often species- and variety-specific, thus requiring detailed investigations of defined plant genotypes under realistic environmental conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">van der Putten et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wagg et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hu et al., 2018b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cadot et al., 2021a</xref>). The diversity of plant traits that can be affected call for broad phenotyping efforts that take into account ecologically and economically relevant parameters.</p><p>Plants can influence different soil parameters which may then lead to feedback effects. This includes nutrient availability and chemical soil properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bennett and Klironomos, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Schandry and Becker, 2020</xref>). Positive feedbacks in agriculture are often attributed to increased soil fertility, water retention, and improved pest control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bennett et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tamburini et al., 2020</xref>). In recent years, changes in root microbial communities have received substantial attention as drivers of plant-soil feedbacks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bever et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Benitez et al., 2021</xref>). Various plant health benefits have been associated to the rhizosphere microbiome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Berendsen et al., 2012</xref>) and plant-soil feedbacks represent a promising way to harness these positive effects, including growth promotion and insect resistance in agricultural settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hu et al., 2018b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pineda et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>How do plants alter soil microbial communities? Although multiple mechanisms are likely at play, the release of small molecular weight compounds, including primary and secondary metabolites, is emerging as a major determinant of microbial community composition in the rhizosphere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pang et al., 2021</xref>). Flavones, coumarins, triterpenes, and benzoxazinoid secondary metabolites are known to structure the rhizosphere microbiota (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hu et al., 2018b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Stringlis et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Huang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Voges et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yu et al., 2021</xref>). Flavones and benzoxazinoids have recently been shown to modulate plant-soil feedbacks via changes in microbial communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hu et al., 2018b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yu et al., 2021</xref>). If and how secondary metabolites can alter plant performance via plant-soil feedbacks under realistic field conditions, however, remains unclear.</p><p>Benzoxazinoids are a class of indole-derived secondary metabolites that are produced and released in high quantities by important food crops such as maize and wheat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Frey et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hu et al., 2018b</xref>). Multiple functions of benzoxazinoids have been described, ranging from defense to nutrient uptake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Niemeyer, 2009</xref>). Soil conditioning by benzoxazinoids can feed back on growth and defense of maize and wheat, where the strength and direction of the feedback depend on the plant genotype and soil characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hu et al., 2018b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cadot et al., 2021a</xref>). Benzoxazinoids can shape root microbial communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hu et al., 2018b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Cotton et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kudjordjie et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cadot et al., 2021b</xref>), chelate iron in the soil and possibly reduce the performance of non-benzoxazinoid producing plants via allelopathic effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bigler et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Niemeyer, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hu et al., 2018a</xref>). Thus, they may influence crop rotations and yields through a variety of plant-soil feedback mechanisms.</p><p>To test whether benzoxazinoids can influence crop yields in a rotation scheme, we investigated how maize benzoxazinoids affect weed and pest pressure, germination, growth, yield, and food quality of wheat plants in the field. Maize and wheat are among the most important crops in global food production and are commonly cultivated in sequence in rotation schemes. In a 2-year field experiment involving wild type and benzoxazinoid-deficient <italic>bx1</italic> mutant maize plants, we first evaluated the effects of benzoxazinoid soil conditioning on soil chemistry and microbial communities. In the following season, we planted three wheat varieties into the same field and quantified a wide variety of agronomically important traits, including growth, weed cover, insect damage, yield and yield quality. Through this experiment, we demonstrate that root exudation of secondary metabolites can be linked directly to improved food production under an agronomically realistic crop rotation scenario.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Benzoxazinoid soil conditioning results in persistent chemical fingerprints</title><p>To test the hypothesis that maize benzoxazinoids modulate the performance of wheat in a crop rotation scheme, we grew wild type W22 and benzoxazinoid-deficient <italic>bx1</italic> mutant maize plants (in a W22 background) in the field.

No significant differences were found between soils cultivated with wild type or <italic>bx1</italic> mutant plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>).</p><p>We then sowed two different wheat varieties (Claro and Fiorina) into the field, forming strips that went across the different maize strips, resulting in a checkerboard pattern with 20 plots per wheat variety with a size of 6 * 6 m where half of the plots were previously cultivated with wild type and the other half with <italic>bx1</italic> mutant maize (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). An additional variety (Sailor) was sown for seed multiplication adjacent to the two other varieties on the same field by a seed company. While Claro and Fiorina were managed without plant protection products, Sailor was treated with herbicides. As Sailor was sown within the premises of our conditioning experiment, we took the opportunity to also measure a subset of performance traits in this variety.</p><p>To test if the chemical fingerprint persisted further as wheat grew in soil, we analyzed the soil benzoxazinoids again during wheat growth. As benzoxazinoids are also produced by wheat, the measurements likely represent both old maize and newly wheat produced metabolites. The previous differences in benzoxazinoid levels of HDMBOA-Glc, HMBOA, and MBOA were not detected any more at this point, and DIMBOA-Glc was no longer detected at all (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). However, AMPO levels were still significantly and consistently higher in plots conditioned with wild type maize across all three wheat varieties. Taken together, these results show that modulating benzoxazinoid production results in a persistent soil chemical fingerprint that is still present in the next crop generation, even if the next crop also produces benzoxazinoids.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Benzoxazinoid soil conditioning transiently structures rhizosphere microbial communities</title><p>To investigate if differences in benzoxazinoid soil conditioning affected the bacterial and fungal communities, we analyzed soil, rhizosphere, and root samples by profiling the bacterial 16 S rRNA gene and the ITS1 region of the ribosomal operon for fungi.

Whether this phenomenon is also relevant in the field, and whether it can be exploited to improve crop productivity, is unknown. Here, we demonstrate that maize plants releasing benzoxazinoids can improve plant growth and crop yield via plant-soil feedbacks under agronomically realistic conditions. Below, we discuss the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon as well as its potential to improve sustainable food production.</p><p>Translating plant-soil feedback mechanisms to crop resistance and productivity has been proposed as a promising approach in sustainable agriculture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mariotte et al., 2018</xref>). Plant secondary metabolites and their degradation products are known to suppress the growth of other plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Schandry and Becker, 2020</xref>) and improve herbivore and pathogen resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Niemeyer, 2009</xref>). Less is known about their potential to influence seedling establishment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lamichhane et al., 2018</xref>), yield quantity and yield quality in the field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cadot et al., 2021a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pang et al., 2021</xref>). We found that benzoxazinoid soil conditioning by the preceding crop increased subsequent wheat emergence, tillering and plant performance in the field, resulting in higher plant biomass and kernel yield. Because weed cover was unaffected, and increased insect infestation did not result in increased leave damage, we conclude that the positive effects on yield were the result of directly improved germination and tillering rather than changes in plant competition or pest damage. Interestingly, the observed increase in biomass is different from what was observed in an earlier greenhouse study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cadot et al., 2021a</xref>). This discrepancy is partially explained by the fact that the greenhouse study investigated individual plant performance and did thus not take into account germination effects. Clearly, agriculturally relevant field experiments are useful and necessary to quantify the costs and benefits of plant-soil feedbacks for sustainable agriculture.</p><p>In crop rotations the identity of the preceding crop is known to affect growth, tiller density, yield, and kernel protein content of wheat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anderson, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rieger et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sieling and Christen, 2015</xref>). Our work expands this knowledge by demonstrating that the release of chemicals by the preceding crop is sufficient to enhance overall crop yield through enhanced germination and tillering. Although higher plant densities are often associated with lower grain quality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bastos et al., 2020</xref>), we found that the yield increase did not affect physical parameters, grain micronutrient composition, grain quality, and baking quality. The increase in yield of 4–5% is equivalent to more than two years of breeding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Le Gouis et al., 2020</xref>), and represents a true advantage because quality remained constant without additional agricultural inputs. Benzoxazinoid exudation and responsiveness to benzoxazinoid soil conditioning are thus promising targets for future breeding efforts. Future crop rotations could be designed using varieties that are optimized for such traits. One can for instance envisage a scenario where high benzoxazinoid maize hybrids are selected specifically to precede highly responsive wheat cultivars. Future field experiments will have to evaluate how other crops respond to benzoxazinoid conditioning in the field and how generalizable the obtained results are across different years and locations. Furthermore, a better understanding of the genetic basis of benzoxazinoid exudation will be helpful to boost the release of benzoxazinoids into the soil. Such work will help to further unlock the potential of plant-soil feedbacks for the much needed sustainable intensification of agriculture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hunter et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mariotte et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Plant-soil feedbacks can be triggered by different mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bennett and Klironomos, 2019</xref>): the first plant generation changes soil chemistry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Schandry and Becker, 2020</xref>), root-associated microbiota (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bever et al., 2012</xref>) or their interaction, with changes in chemistry mediating changes in microbiota (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hu et al., 2018b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yu et al., 2021</xref>). The persistence of chemical and microbiological changes is seen as a key factor in this context. It has been proposed that chemical changes may be more short lived than microbial changes, as plant secondary metabolites can be degraded rapidly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bennett and Klironomos, 2019</xref>). In line with previous studies, we found benzoxazinoids alter the composition of root-associated microbes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hu et al., 2018b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Cotton et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kudjordjie et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cadot et al., 2021b</xref>). However, these effects disappeared by the end of the vegetative growth of the next crop. By contrast, the benzoxazinoid chemical fingerprint persisted across both cultivation periods. AMPO, a microbial degradation product with a half life of months (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Macías et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Niemeyer, 2009</xref>), was found in higher concentrations in benzoxazinoid conditioned soils of all three wheat varieties. Thus, we conclude that the benzoxazinoid chemical fingerprint is more long-lived that the change in the microbial fingerprint. Microbial community changes may still have contributed to plant-soil feedback effects, as many of the late phenotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) were explained by initial differences in germination and tillering, where transient microbiome effects could still have been stronger. More research is needed to disentangle the relative importance of chemical and microbial fingerprints which will aid to optimize the design of agroecologically smart crop rotations.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This study presents a proof of concept for the utilization of plant root exuded metabolites to increase agricultural yield without additional external inputs.

The wild type maize inbred line W22 and the benzoxazinoid-deficient <italic>bx1</italic> transposon knockout mutant (gene identifier GRMZM2G085381; Ds, B.W06.0775) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tzin et al., 2015</xref>) were kindly provided by Georg Jander (Cornell University, Ithaca, NY; USA). The inbred lines were surrounded by a buffer zone of the hybrid maize variety Gottardo. In the feedback phase the wheat varieties CH Claro (referred to as Claro), Fiorina, and Sailor were grown. All three wheat varieties were provided by Saatzucht Düdingen (Düdingen; Switzerland) and are commonly cultivated in Switzerland (recommended varieties by Agroscope). Claro is an obligate winter wheat, Fiorina can be cultivated as winter or spring wheat, and Sailor is a common forage winter wheat variety.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Experimental setup</title><p>The conditioning phase indicates the first season where the field was cultivated with wild type and <italic>bx1</italic> mutant maize to condition the soil with or without benzoxazinoids. ‘Benzoxazinoid soil conditioning’ refers to the process of benzoxazinoid exudation into the surrounding soil and the resulting changes in the soil (e.g. microbial community composition). In the second season, that is the feedback phase, wheat was grown to survey the effects of previous benzoxazinoid soil conditioning on wheat performance. To test for genotype-specific responses, we investigated two wheat varieties Claro and Fiorina. In addition, the seed company Saatzucht Düdingen has grown a third wheat variety (Sailor) adjacent to our two wheat varieties, and we were kindly allowed to investigate a subset of phenotypes for that variety as well. Therefore, we had three wheat varieties to survey during growth, but could not obtain data on yield and kernel quality for Sailor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). At the end of the conditioning phase, maize biomass, belowground microbiota and soil parameters, including benzoxazinoids, were measured. In the feedback phase we determined wheat emergence, growth, and weed and insect infestation. Soil benzoxazinoids and microbiota were analyzed again during wheat growth. At the end of the feedback phase kernel quantity and quality were evaluated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). For detailed methods see below.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Field specifications</title><p>The experiment was carried out in 2019 and 2020 on a field at the Agroscope research station in Posieux, Switzerland (parcel 2.3, 46°46′23.09″N 7°06′22.95″E). The soil was classified as a sandy loam. The cropping history of this field was a fodder meadow (mixture of red clover and Italian ryegrass; 2018), winter barley (2017), triticale and alfalfa (field divided, 2016), maize and alfalfa (field divided, 2015), alfalfa and maize (field divided, 2014), and alfalfa (2012–2013). The crops were managed according to Swiss conventional agricultural practices by the field team of Agroscope and the education farm of the Agricultural competence center in Grangeneuve, nearby Posieux. There was a long-lasting drought period in spring 2020 (feedback phase).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Maize conditioning phase</title><p>Wild type and <italic>bx1</italic> inbred lines were alternately sown in 5 strips of 12 rows each (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Distance between maize rows was 75 cm, distance between plants within a row was 15 cm. The inbred lines were surrounded by a minimum of 18 rows of hybrid maize. Before sowing, the soil was fertilized with manure (40 m<sup>3</sup>/ha), ploughed, and harrowed. Weeds were once treated with herbicide (Equip Power 1.5 l/ha). During plant growth, maize was fertilized twice, firstly with ammonium nitrate supplemented with sulfur 100 kg/ha (25% N, 5% Mg, 8.5% S) and secondly with urea 180 kg/ha (46% N). Maize was harvested and silaged after 22 weeks. One week before harvest, 4 plants per maize strip were randomly selected for phenotyping resulting in 20 replicates per genotype (wild type and <italic>bx1</italic>). The aboveground biomass was harvested, dried at 80 °C and weighed. For half of the samples (n=10), soil cores of 20 x 20 x 20 cm containing the root system were excavated and used for analysis of benzoxazinoid concentrations, microbiomes, and further soil parameters as described below.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Overview wheat feedback phase</title><p>The wheat varieties were sown one week after maize harvest. Claro and Fiorina were sown in two alternating strips, each perpendicular to the orientation of the maize rows (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Sailor was sown in the same orientation as the maize. Distance between wheat rows was 12.5 cm. Prior to sowing the soil was harrowed. During plant growth, wheat was fertilized twice, first with 50 kg N/ha of urea-ammonium nitrate solution (UAN; 39 % N) combined with 120 kg/ha Kiserite (15% Mg, 20% S) and second with 55 kg N/ha of UAN solution (39 % N). No plant protection products were applied to Claro and Fiorina, whereas the field of Sailor was treated with a herbicide against weeds. Four weeks after sowing, at wheat emergence, soil samples were taken for benzoxazinoid analysis. With a soil sampler, 10 soil cores per plot (17 mm diameter, 20 cm deep) were taken and combined to one sample (n=10 per soil conditioning). Germination, plant growth, and insect infestation were phenotyped as described below. During wheat growth, at the end of the vegetative phase, soil cores (7x7 cm wide, 12 cm deep) were taken below three randomly selected wheat plants per plot and pooled for benzoxazinoid and microbiome analysis (n=10 per treatment combination). After 41 weeks of growth, the wheat was harvested (see below).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Phenotyping feedback phase</title><p>To survey benzoxazinoid-dependent plant-soil feedbacks on wheat growth, we measured various parameters. Phenotyping was carried out on all subplots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), resulting in 20 replicates for each combination of soil conditioning status (wild type, <italic>bx1</italic>) and wheat variety (Claro, Fiorina, Sailor). Weed cover estimation, determination of insect damage, and harvesting was done on plot level, resulting in 10 replicates for each treatment combination.</p><p>Emerged seedlings were counted on 1.5 m of a randomly selected wheat row within each subplot one month after the wheat was sown. Seedling emergence per m<sup>2</sup> was calculated. At the end of tillering, we measured chlorophyll content with a SPADE-502 chlorophyll meter (Konica Minolta, Tokyo; Japan). Chlorophyll was determined in the middle of the youngest fully expanded leaf of 20 randomly selected plants per subplot and the mean value was recorded. During stem elongation, weed abundance was surveyed by estimating percentage weed cover per plot. At the end of the vegetative growth stage plant height of 10 randomly selected plants per subplot was measured and averaged for analysis. In addition, biomass accumulation was measured, by harvesting wheat plants along 1 m of a randomly selected row per subplot. Fresh biomass was weighed before plant material was dried at 80 °C until constant weight, dry biomass was determined, and plant water content was calculated.</p><p>Infestation by the cereal leaf beetle (<italic>Oulema melanopus</italic>) was surveyed at the end of stem elongation. Along 9 m of a row within a subplot all larvae were counted and infestation per m<sup>2</sup> was calculated. To determine the total larval damage on the leaves, 10 flag leaves were sampled per plot before the leaves started to wilt. Leaves were transported to the laboratory in a wettened plastic bag stored in a cooled container. Leaves were then scanned and the consumed area per leaf was determined using the R packages <italic>EBImage</italic> and <italic>pliman</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pau et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Olivoto, 2021</xref>). In addition, at the end of the vegetative phase five flag leaves of five plants per plot were randomly selected, wrapped in aluminum foil and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen for later determination of phytohormone levels (see below).</p><p>Once the kernels were ripe, total biomass accumulation was determined by harvesting wheat plants along 1 m of a randomly selected row per subplot. Plant material was dried at 80 °C before measuring biomass. To calculate tiller density and weight per tiller, the number of tillers in the dried material were counted. A subsample of five randomly selected heads were threshed with a laboratory thresher (LT-15, Haldrup GmbH, Ilshofen; Germany), and kernels were counted and weighed. Next, we randomly selected five plant per subplot and counted the number of tillers per plant, mean tiller number per plant was taken for statistical analysis.</p><p>At the end of the feedback phase, we harvested the experiment plots with a compact plot combine harvester (Zürn 110, Zürn GmbH, Schöntal-Westernhausen; Germany). Yield was determined based on a 9 m<sup>2</sup> area in the center of the plots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) and kernel weight per plot was determined. A subset of these kernels was taken for analyzing kernel quality and micronutrient composition (see below).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Benzoxazinoid analysis</title><p>At the end of maize growth, at wheat emergence and during wheat growth soils were sampled as described above and benzoxazinoids and break down products were analyzed. Each soil sample was processed with a test sieve (5 mm mesh size), then 25 mL of soil was transferred into a 50 mL centrifuge tube and homogenized in 25 mL acidified MeOH/H2O (70:30 v/v; 0.1% formic acid). For extraction, the suspension was incubated for 30 minutes at room temperature on a rotary shaker, followed by a centrifugation step (5 min, 2000 <italic>g</italic>) to sediment the soil. The supernatant was passed through a filter paper (Grade 1; Size: 185 mm; Whatman, GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Chicago, IL; United States), 1 mL of the flow through was transferred into a 1.5 mL centrifuge tube, centrifuged (10 min, 19,000 <italic>g</italic>, 4 °C), and the supernatant was sterile filtered (Target2TM, Regenerated Cellulose Syringe Filters. Pore size: 0.45 µm; Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA; United States) into a HPLC glass tube for further analysis.</p><p>To obtain detectable concentrations of benzoxazinoids at wheat emergence and during wheat growth, the samples needed to be concentrated before the second centrifugation step 20 and 10 times, respectively. To obtain that, 20 mL or 10 mL of each sample was completely evaporated at 45 °C (CentriVap, Labconco, Kansas City, MO; USA) and the pellet was resuspended in 1 mL of acidified MeOH/ H2O (70:30 v/v; 0.1% formic acid).</p><p>The benzoxazinoid analysis was performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Robert et al., 2017</xref>). Briefly, an Acquity UHPLC system coupled to a G2-XS QTOF mass spectrometer equipped with an electrospray source and piloted by the software MassLynx 4.1 (Waters AG, Baden-Dättwil; Switzerland) was used. Gradient elution was performed on an Acquity BEH C18 column (2.1x50 mm i.d., 1.7 mm particle size) at 90–70% A over 3 min, 70–60% A over 1 min, 40–100% B over 1 min, holding at 100% B for 2.5 min, holding at 90% A for 1.5 min where A=0.1% formic acid/water and B=0.1% formic acid/acetonitrile. The ﬂow rate was 0.4 mL/min. The temperature of the column was maintained at 40 °C, and the injection volume was 1 μL. The QTOF MS was operated in positive mode. The data were acquired over an m/z range of 50–1200 with scans of 0.15 s at a collision energy of 4 V and 0.2 s with a collision energy ramp from 10 to 40 V. The capillary and cone voltages were set to 2 kV and 20 V, respectively. The source temperature was maintained at 140 °C, the desolvation was 400 °C at 1000 L/hr and cone gas ﬂow was 50 L/hr. Accurate mass measurements (&lt;2 ppm) were obtained by infusing a solution of leucin encephalin at 200 ng/mL and a ﬂow rate of 10 mL/min through the Lock Spray probe. Absolute quantities were determined through standard curves of pure compounds. For that MBOA (6-methoxy-benzoxazolin-2(3 H)-one) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Chemie GmbH (Buchs; Switzerland). DIMBOA-Glc (2-O-β-D-glucopyranosyl-2,4-dihydroxy-7-methoxy-2H-1,4-benzoxazin-3(4 H)-one) and HDMBOA-Glc (2-O-β-D-glucopyranosyl-2-hydroxy-4,7-dimethoxy-2H-1,4-benzoxazin-3(4 H)-one) were isolated from maize plants in our laboratory. DIMBOA (2,4-dihydroxy-7-methoxy-2H-1,4-benzoxazin-3(4 H)-one), HMBOA (2-hydroxy-7-methoxy-2H-1,4-benzoxazin-3(4 H)-one), and AMPO (2-amino-7-methoxy-3H-phenoxazin-3-one) were synthesized in our laboratory.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Soil analysis</title><p>A subsample of the soil of each root system excavated at the end of maize growth (see above), was taken and pooled to obtain 4 representative samples of the field per genotype. Soil parameters were then analyzed by LBU Laboratories (Eric Schweizer AG, Thun; Switzerland). Water (H<sub>2</sub>O), ammonium acetate EDTA (AAE), and carbon dioxide saturated water (CO<sub>2</sub>) extractions were performed for different nutrients. H<sub>2</sub>O extracts serve as a proxy for plant available nutrients, AAE extracts for nutrients available through plant chelation mechanisms and CO<sub>2</sub> extracts are a common extraction procedure for magnesium, phosphorus, and potassium (similar to H<sub>2</sub>O extracts).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Phytohormones analysis</title><p>Concentrations of salicylic acid (SA), oxophytodienoic acid (OPDA), jasmonic acid (JA), jasmonic acid-isoleucine (JA-Ile) and abscicic acid (ABA) were determined by UHPLC-MS/MS. First, wheat leaf samples were ground to a fine powder under constant cooling with liquid nitrogen. An aliquot of 100 mg (±20%) was taken and the exact weight was noted for the final determination of hormone concentration. Next, phytohormones were extracted as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Glauser et al., 2014</xref> with minor adjustments: 10 µL of labelled internal standards (d5-JA, d6-ABA, d6-SA, and 13C6-JA-Ile, 100 ng/mL in water) were added to the samples and hormones were extracted in ethylacetate/formic acid (99.5:0.5, v/v), the samples were centrifuged and evaporated to dryness, and finally resuspended in 200 µL of MeOH 50% for analysis. Two µL of extract were injected in an Acquity UPLC (Waters AG, Baden-Dättwil; Switzerland) coupled to a QTRAP 6500, (Sciex, Framingham, MA; USA). Analyst v.1.7.1 was used to control the instrument and for data processing. Each phytohormone peak was normalized to that of its corresponding labelled form except that of OPDA which was normalized to that of 13C6-JA-Ile.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Kernel analysis</title><p>For morphological analysis of kernels, a subsample of 25 mL of kernels was taken. Volume weight, thousand kernel weight (TKW), kernel surface area, kernel length, and kernel width were determined by means of a microbalance and a MARVIN kernel analyzer (GTA Sensorik GmbH, Neubrandenburg; Germany). A subset of kernels was milled for further analysis. To test flour quality, we determined the falling number (according to ICC standard method 107/1), Zeleny index (according to ICC standard method 116/1) and protein content, which was evaluated by near-infrared reflectance spectroscopy (NIRS) using a NIRFlex N-500 (Büchi Labortechnik AG, Flawil; Switzerland). We further tested dough quality using a micro-doughLAB farinograph (model 1800, Perten Instruments, PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA; USA). Dough stability (min), dough softening (Farinograph Units, FU), and water absorption capacity of the flour (%) during kneading were analyzed according to the manufacturer’s protocol.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Kernel micronutrient analysis</title><p>We analyzed total element concentrations for 21 elements as grain micronutrients. Forty g of kernels per plot were ground to fine powder using a cutting mill (Pulverisette, Fritsch, Idar-Oberstein; Germany). Element extraction and analysis was performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cadot et al., 2021b</xref>), with small adjustments: An aliquot of 250 mg grain powder was extracted in 4 ml of concentrated HNO<sub>3</sub> (35%) overnight and 2 mL of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (30%) was added. Samples were vortexed for 5 s before microwave extraction at 95 °C for 30 min. Before analysis, tubes were filled to 50 mL with HNO<sub>3</sub> (1%) and centrifuged (5 min at 2500 rpm) to remove remaining particles. Elements in the extracts were quantified with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS, 7700 x, Agilent, Santa Clara, CA; USA).</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Microbiota profiling</title><p>The sampling of the soil cores on the field was describe above. To prepare the soil samples, the root system was removed from the soil core, subsequently the soil was sieved through a test sieve (mesh size 5 mm). Root and rhizosphere samples were prepared as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hu et al., 2018b</xref>), with minor modifications: Root segments corresponding to –5 to –10 cm below soil level were harvested and large soil particles were removed, before washing the roots twice in a 50 mL centrifuge tube with 25 mL of sterile ddH<sub>2</sub>0, by vigorously shaking the tube 10 times. The wash fractions were combined, centrifuged (5 min at 3000 <italic>g</italic>) and the resulting pellet was frozen at –80 °C for further processing (rhizosphere sample). The washed roots were freeze-dried for 72 h and subsequently milled to fine powder using a Ball Mill (Retsch GmBH, Haan; Germany) for 30 s at 30 Hz with one 1 cm steel ball.</p><p>For DNA extraction, a subsample of 200 mg soil and rhizosphere, and 20 mg of root powder was taken. DNA from all compartments were extracted using the FastDNA SPIN Kit for Soil (MP Biomedicals LLC, Solon, OH; USA) following the manufacturer instruction. In brief, after adding 978 µL of sodium phosphate buffer and 122 µL of MT buffer to each aliquot, the samples were homogenized with a Retsch Mixer Mill during 40 s at 25 Hz. Following 10 min of centrifugation, 250 µL of PPS was added to the supernatant. After mixing ten times by inversion, samples were centrifuged for 5 min. The supernatant was mixed by inversion with 1 mL of binding matrix suspension, transferred to a SPIN filter and then centrifuged for 1 min. The binding matrix was washed with 500 µL of SEWS-M and a total of 3 min of centrifugation was performed. The matrix was air-dried for 5 min, and the binding matrix was resuspended with 100 µL of DNAse/Pyrogen-Free water. After incubating 5 min, DNA was eluted by centrifuging for 1 min. Extraction was performed at room temperature and all centrifugation steps were done with 14,000 <italic>g</italic>. After that step, the DNA was distributed into 96-well plates in a random and equal manner.

Microbiota of root, rhizosphere and soil compartments were analyzed separately for maize samples (conditioning phase) and wheat samples (feedback phase). The variation between sequencing runs was taken into account in all models. We rarefied the data (100 x; depth: bacteria: 8000, fungi: 1’200), because this normalization technique efficiently mitigates artifacts of different sampling depths between sample groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Weiss et al., 2017</xref>).

Statistical assumptions such as normal distribution and homoscedasticity of error variance were inspected visually from diagnostic quantile-quantile and residual plots. To account for our experimental design and avoid potential pseudo-replication, we included the maize strips as a random blocking factor. To accomplish this, we fitted a linear mixed-effects model using the <italic>lme</italic>() function from the <italic>nlme</italic> package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pinheiro et al., 2021</xref>). This function further allowed us to account for unequal variance among treatment groups, if necessary. Possible correlations of the response variables with the position on the field were tested, and, if significant, the position on the field was factored into the model to account for otherwise unexplained variation. For linear models in the feedback phase, we tested for soil conditioning effects within each wheat variety by comparing estimated marginal means (EMMs; <italic>emmeans</italic> package) and reporting false discovery rate (FDR) corrected <italic>p</italic> values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lenth, 2022</xref>).

feedbacks in agriculture. The authors use a large-scale agricultural field experiment to demonstrate the role of root-emitted secondary metabolites in enhancing the yield of the next crop. By using a benzoxazinoid-deficient maize genotype, the authors provide compelling evidence that biomass production and grain yield of several wheat varieties can be increased when grown in soil conditioned by maize plants able to release benzoxazinoids.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.84988.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Rasmann</surname><given-names>Sergio</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/00vasag41</institution-id><institution>University of Neuchâtel</institution></institution-wrap><country>Switzerland</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Delory</surname><given-names>Benjamin</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/02w2y2t16</institution-id><institution>Leuphana University Lüneburg</institution></institution-wrap><country>Germany</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Kaplan</surname><given-names>Ian</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/05p8z3f47</institution-id><institution>Purdue University</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: (i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2022.11.09.515047">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.11.09.515047v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; (ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below. We also include an acceptance summary that explains what the editors found interesting or important about the work.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Plant secondary metabolite-dependent plant-soil feedbacks can improve crop yield in the field&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Meredith Schuman as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in the review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Benjamin Delory (Reviewer #1); Ian Kaplan (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Please consider the detailed comments provided by the reviewers for clarifying several parts of the material and methods and elsewhere in the text.</p><p>2) Please, take into consideration re-analysing part of your data to consider the specifics of your experimental design. From either mine or the reviewers' understanding, you have here a split-plot design, which would thus require taking at least into account the strips of your field experiment as a random blocking factor in the analysis, to avoid potential pseudo-replication.</p><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>L24-25. I don't know what these two sentences mean (&quot;Weed cover…across varieties&quot;). In comparison to what? It's unclear as written.</p><p>L39. It's a little unclear what you mean by &quot;mechanistic work&quot; in this context.</p><p>Also, it could be useful, either here or elsewhere, to differentiate proximate vs. ultimate mechanisms. This study is aiming at proximate mechanisms, but there has been work on ultimate mechanisms underlying plant-soil feedbacks in crop rotation. See, for example:</p><p>I Kaplan, NA Bokulich, JG Caporaso, LS Enders, W Ghanem, … et al. 2020. Phylogenetic farming: Can evolutionary history predict crop rotation via the soil microbiome?</p><p>Evolutionary Applications 13 (8), 1984-1999</p><p>L48. This is an awkward expression: &quot;genetically defined conditions&quot;.</p><p>L70. Positive or negative feedbacks?</p><p>L90. Can you clarify what a &quot;strong reduction&quot; means in more quantitative terms? Does bx1 produce zero? Or only trace amounts? Compared to the wild-type what sort of overall reduction is occurring?</p><p>L93-94. I understand after looking at Figure S1, but this is not described very well. I don't think people will know what this means: &quot;Wild type and bx1 mutant plants were alternatingly sown in 5 strips&quot;. It was 10 strips, not 5 strips. It's not intuitive that you're saying that you had 5 strips of each variety (10 total) that were alternated with one another spatially across the field. Try to reword for clarity.</p><p>L106-109. Can you explain this better? I still don't follow why you found the reverse effect here.</p><p>L116-117. I don't know what you mean by &quot;for multiplication&quot; and &quot;by a third party&quot;. Try to reword for clarity.</p><p>L143. Unclear what you mean by &quot;compartments&quot;. I'm guessing this is talking about soil vs. rhizosphere vs. root, but not obvious.</p><p>L212. It looks like you're organizing the sections chronologically through the growth cycle, but it might make more sense to bump back the wheat emergence/growth section so it's combined here. In my mind, all the plant performance data, early- and late-season, are closely aligned and having weeds/insects split it up disrupts the flow a bit.</p><p>L261. Can you comment somewhere in here on how your wheat yields compare with commercially reported yields in Switzerland? Those data must be known and easily accessible.

Please find our response below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Please, take into consideration re-analysing part of your data to consider the specifics of your experimental design. From either mine or the reviewers' understanding, you have here a split-plot design, which would thus require taking at least into account the strips of your field experiment as a random blocking factor in the analysis, to avoid potential pseudo-replication.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for pointing out how we can improve our statistical analysis. We reanalyzed our data and updated the figures and the main text of the manuscript accordingly. The analysis was modified as described in the methods section:</p><p>“To account for our experimental design and avoid potential pseudo-replication, we included the maize strips as a random blocking factor. To accomplish this, we fitted a linear mixed-effects model using the <italic>lme()</italic> function from the <italic>nlme</italic> package (Pinheiro et al., 2021). This function further allowed us to account for unequal variance among treatment groups, if necessary.”</p><p>Conclusions remain unaffected, with the exception of the plant damage effect, which moved from a “statistically significant” effect in one variety to a tendency. The manuscript was adjusted accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>L24-25. I don't know what these two sentences mean (&quot;Weed cover…across varieties&quot;). In comparison to what? It's unclear as written.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for pointing this out. The two sentences refer to comparisons between soil conditioning treatments as described in the previous sentence. We have now clarified this aspect.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>L39. It's a little unclear what you mean by &quot;mechanistic work&quot; in this context.</p><p>Also, it could be useful, either here or elsewhere, to differentiate proximate vs. ultimate mechanisms. This study is aiming at proximate mechanisms, but there has been work on ultimate mechanisms underlying plant-soil feedbacks in crop rotation. See, for example:</p><p>I Kaplan, NA Bokulich, JG Caporaso, LS Enders, W Ghanem, … et al. 2020. Phylogenetic farming: Can evolutionary history predict crop rotation via the soil microbiome?</p><p>Evolutionary Applications 13 (8), 1984-1999</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you. We now specify that we refer to proximate mechanisms.</p><p>“So far however, proximate mechanistic work on plant-soil feedbacks has rarely been applied to improve crop rotations.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>L48. This is an awkward expression: &quot;genetically defined conditions&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>We have rewritten this sentence.</p><p>“The response to plant-soil feedbacks can strongly depend on environmental conditions (Smith‐Ramesh and Reynolds, 2017), and is often species- and variety-specific, thus requiring detailed investigations of defined plant genotypes under realistic environmental conditions (van der Putten et al., 2013; Wagg et al., 2015; Hu et al., 2018b; Cadot et al., 2021a).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>L70. Positive or negative feedbacks?</p></disp-quote><p>We now provide more information.</p><p>“Soil conditioning by benzoxazinoids can feed back on growth and defense of maize and wheat, where the strength and direction of the feedback depend on the plant genotype and soil characteristics (Hu et al., 2018b; Cadot et al., 2021a).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>L90. Can you clarify what a &quot;strong reduction&quot; means in more quantitative terms? Does bx1 produce zero? Or only trace amounts? Compared to the wild-type what sort of overall reduction is occurring?</p></disp-quote><p>Given the limits of detection, the reduction of the highly emitted compounds (e.g. HDMBOA-Glc) is at least 100-fold. We included this information in the revised manuscript.</p><p>“Most benzoxazinoids were below the limit of detection in the soils planted with <italic>bx1</italic> mutant plants, indicating that concentrations of the highly emitted compounds (e.g. HDMBOA-Glc) were more than 100 times lower in <italic>bx1</italic> mutant compared to wild type conditioned soil.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>L93-94. I understand after looking at Figure S1, but this is not described very well. I don't think people will know what this means: &quot;Wild type and bx1 mutant plants were alternatingly sown in 5 strips&quot;. It was 10 strips, not 5 strips. It's not intuitive that you're saying that you had 5 strips of each variety (10 total) that were alternated with one another spatially across the field. Try to reword for clarity.</p></disp-quote><p>We did reword this part for clarity.</p><p>“Wild type and <italic>bx1</italic> mutant plants were sown separately in 10 strips. The strips themselves were arranged in an alternating pattern, with a strip containing wild type plants followed by a strip containing <italic>bx1</italic> mutant plants, and so on (Figure S1). Each strip consisted of 12 rows of maize of one genotype.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>L106-109. Can you explain this better? I still don't follow why you found the reverse effect here.</p></disp-quote><p>We reformulated this sentence to clarify.</p><p>“Only trace levels of the two glycosylated benzoxazinoids, DIMBOA-Glc and HDMBOA-Glc were found, and their concentrations were higher in <italic>bx1</italic> mutant conditioned soils. As benzoxazinoids are released as glycosides and deglycosylated in the soil, this result is indicative of faster deglycosylation in wild type conditioned soils.”</p><p>We also included the following to clarify why we found benzoxazinoids in <italic>bx1</italic> mutant conditioned soil.</p><p>“Most benzoxazinoids were 3- to 800-fold less abundant than at the end of maize cultivation (Figure 1B). We therefore concentrated the samples prior to analysis, resulting in the detection of traces of benzoxazinoids also in <italic>bx1</italic> mutant conditioned soils.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>L116-117. I don't know what you mean by &quot;for multiplication&quot; and &quot;by a third party&quot;. Try to reword for clarity.</p></disp-quote><p>We have rewritten this sentence.</p><p>“An additional variety (Sailor) was sown for seed multiplication adjacent to the two other varieties on the same field by a seed company.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>L143. Unclear what you mean by &quot;compartments&quot;. I'm guessing this is talking about soil vs. rhizosphere vs. root, but not obvious.</p></disp-quote><p>We specified what we mean by compartments.</p><p>“At maize harvest, the biggest taxonomic differences at the phylum level were found between the three compartments: root, rhizosphere, and soil (Figure S3).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>L212. It looks like you're organizing the sections chronologically through the growth cycle, but it might make more sense to bump back the wheat emergence/growth section so it's combined here. In my mind, all the plant performance data, early- and late-season, are closely aligned and having weeds/insects split it up disrupts the flow a bit.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for this input. After discussion among authors, we have decided to maintain the chronological order.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>L261. Can you comment somewhere in here on how your wheat yields compare with commercially reported yields in Switzerland? Those data must be known and easily accessible. It would just be helpful to know what your wheat yield increases mean compared to grower fields.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you. We added this information.</p><p>“Yield in both Claro and Fiorina was increased by 4-5 % on benzoxazinoid conditioned soils (Figure 6A); productivity of both varieties fell within the expected range of top-yielding winter wheat varieties in Switzerland (variety testing Agroscope).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>L288-289.
