cells (SCs), thereby forming and maintaining the myelin sheath around peripheral axons (Grove et al., 2017). Here we show that YAP/TAZ are required for mature SCs to restore peripheral myelination, but not to proliferate, after nerve injury. We find that YAP/TAZ dramatically disappear from SCs of adult mice concurrent with axon degeneration after nerve injury. They reappear in SCs only if axons regenerate. YAP/TAZ ablation does not impair SC proliferation or transdifferentiation into growth promoting repair SCs. SCs lacking YAP/TAZ, however, fail to upregulate myelin-associated genes and completely fail to remyelinate regenerated axons. We also show that both YAP and TAZ are redundantly required for optimal remyelination. These findings suggest that axons regulate transcriptional activity of YAP/TAZ in adult SCs and that YAP/TAZ are essential for functional regeneration of peripheral nerve.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Schwann cell</kwd><kwd>myelination</kwd><kwd>peripheral nerve regeneration</kwd><kwd>Yap</kwd><kwd>Taz</kwd><kwd>Krox20</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS105796</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Son</surname><given-names>Young-Jin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100011781</institution-id><institution>Shriners Hospitals for Children</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Research award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Son</surname><given-names>Young-Jin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>YAP and TAZ, potent concoproteins and therapeutic targets in cancer therapy, are essential for Schwann cells to support peripheral nerve regeneration.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>YAP (Yes-associated protein) and TAZ (Transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif), are paralogous transcription coactivators, chiefly known as potent stimulators of cellular proliferation in diverse developing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">von Gise et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Xin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cotton et al., 2017</xref>) and neoplastic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Yu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zanconato et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Moon et al., 2018</xref>) tissues. Consistent with this role, we and others have recently shown that YAP/TAZ promote vigorous proliferation of immature Schwann cells (SC) in developing peripheral nerves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Poitelon et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Deng et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Grove et al., 2017</xref>), and that overexpression of YAP/TAZ promotes abnormally excessive proliferation of mature SCs in adult peripheral nerves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mindos et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wu et al., 2018</xref>). Unexpectedly, several groups demonstrated that YAP or YAP/TAZ promote differentiation of developing SCs by upregulating myelin-associated genes, thereby mediating developmental myelination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fernando et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lopez-Anido et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Poitelon et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Deng et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Grove et al., 2017</xref>). Our group additionally showed that YAP/TAZ are selectively expressed in differentiated myelin-forming SCs, and that they are required for maintenance of the myelin sheath in adult nerves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Grove et al., 2017</xref>). In many systems, YAP/TAZ shift to the cytoplasm concomitant with differentiation of developing cells, and the nuclear exclusion of YAP/TAZ is believed to be required for homeostatic maintenance of mature cells or tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Varelas, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wang et al., 2018</xref>). We were therefore intrigued to find that YAP/TAZ are nuclear and transcriptionally active in mature SCs maintaining peripheral myelination.</p><p>Building on these findings in developing and intact adult nerves, we now report on the role of YAP/TAZ in the regenerating nerve, in which SCs both proliferate and differentiate, as in developing peripheral nerve. Following traumatic nerve injury, SCs in axotomized nerve rapidly dedifferentiate and proliferate as they convert to regeneration promoting ‘repair’ SCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jessen and Mirsky, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Tricaud and Park, 2017</xref>). When repair SCs regain axon contacts, they re-differentiate to myelin-forming SCs, thereby restoring motor and sensory functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fex Svennigsen and Dahlin, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Stassart et al., 2013</xref>). Strikingly, we found that YAP/TAZ disappear from denervated SCs but reappear in SCs as axons regenerate. Consistent with these observations, we found that YAP/TAZ are dispensable for SC proliferation after injury but required for remyelination of regenerated axons. These findings extend the role of YAP/TAZ to functional regeneration of injured nerves and suggest that SCs are dependent on axons for their transcriptional activity of YAP/TAZ.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>YAP/TAZ expression in Schwann cells is axon-dependent</title><p>Transcriptional regulation of SC proliferation and differentiation by YAP/TAZ depends on their nuclear localization. Nuclear YAP/TAZ in SCs of adult mice promote myelin gene expression, essentially maintaining peripheral nerve myelination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Grove et al., 2017</xref>). As the first step to determine the roles of YAP/TAZ in nerve repair, we examined spatiotemporal expression patterns of YAP/TAZ in adult mice after sciatic nerve crush injury (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The nerve crush model evokes active axon degeneration in the distal nerve stump, while permitting new axons from the proximal nerve stump to regenerate through the crushed site within 1–2 days post injury (dpi) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kang and Lichtman, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Frendo et al., 2019</xref>). New axons then keep regenerating within the basal lamina tubes filled with SCs and their processes, at the speed of 1–4 mm/day, although the debris of degenerating axons and myelin is not yet completely removed. We killed these mice 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, and 24 dpi and immunostained proximal and distal nerve stumps of ~5 mm in length with an antibody specific for both YAP and TAZ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; at 12 dpi). At one dpi when distal axons remained largely intact, nuclear expression of YAP/TAZ in associated SCs was unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; 1D-dstl). Strikingly, at three dpi when axon degeneration was robust and SCs lost axon contacts, YAP/TAZ were almost undetectable in SC nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; 3D-dstl). Thus, SCs lose nuclear expression of YAP/TAZ as associated axons degenerate.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Loss and recovery of YAP/TAZ in Schwann cells after sciatic nerve crush.</title><p>YAP/TAZ expression in crushed sciatic nerves of adult mice, shown by IHC (<bold>A, B</bold>) and Western blotting (<bold>C</bold>).

These observations suggest that YAP/TAZ are selectively upregulated in SCs associated with regenerating axons that have become large enough to be myelinated. Consistent with this notion, YAP/TAZ are expressed in myelinating, but not in non-myelinating, SCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Grove et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Western blotting also revealed marked reduction of YAP and TAZ levels at 3 dpi, followed by rapid upregulation of TAZ levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata2">Figure 1—source data 2</xref>). Notably, YAP levels remained low in nerve lysates at 12 dpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). As cells other than SCs can affect overall YAP levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gaudet et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Stierli et al., 2018</xref>), we next examined expression of YAP in SCs of crushed nerves by immunohistochemistry (IHC). We first verified that an antibody specifically recognized YAP, but not TAZ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). YAP is upregulated in many SC nuclei at 6 dpi and continues to be observed at 24 dpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>), demonstrating that YAP is also upregulated in SCs concomitant with axon regeneration.</p><p>The dramatic down- and upregulation of YAP/TAZ concurrent with axon degeneration and regeneration, respectively, suggest that SCs are dependent on axons for YAP/TAZ nuclear expression. To test further whether axons regulate YAP/TAZ expression in mature SCs, we next investigated if denervated SCs are capable of upregulating YAP/TAZ in the absence of regenerating axons. We used a nerve transection injury model in which we completely cut one sciatic nerve and tied both ends of the transected nerve to prevent axon regeneration from proximal to distal nerve stumps. We examined these mice at 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, and 24 dpi.

Our observation that YAP/TAZ disappear in SCs by 3 days after axotomy raises the interesting possibility that YAP/TAZ are not involved in injury-elicited SC proliferation. Alternatively, levels of YAP/TAZ that are too low to be detected by IHC may be sufficient to promote transcription of the genes activating SC proliferation. To test these possibilities, we used an inducible knockout mouse (<italic>Plp1-creERT2; Yap<sup>fl/fl</sup>; Taz<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic>, hereafter Yap/Taz iDKO) to inactivate YAP/TAZ selectively in SCs after nerve injury. We induced recombination at 6 weeks of age, completely transected and tied the sciatic nerve in one leg, killed the mice 5 days later when SCs actively proliferate, and compared SC proliferation in intact and transected nerves of WT and iDKO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, n = 3 mice per genotype).

It remains controversial, however, how YAP/TAZ loss results in complete amyelination of developing nerves and whether YAP/TAZ also play a role in myelin maintenance of adult nerves. Indeed, Poitelon et al., attributed developmental amyelination to the inability of immature SCs lacking YAP/TAZ to wrap around developing axons, a process called radial sorting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Feltri et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Poitelon et al., 2016</xref>). In contrast, Grove et al. and Deng et al. attributed the myelination failure primarily to the inability of SCs to differentiate into myelinating SCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Deng et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Grove et al., 2017</xref>). Deng et al., however, disagreed with our view about the role of YAP/TAZ in myelin maintenance of adult nerves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Deng et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Grove et al., 2017</xref>). These disagreements motivated the present study, which investigated YAP/TAZ expression in adult SCs after nerve injury and their contribution to nerve regeneration. We found that YAP/TAZ dramatically disappear and reappear in SCs after nerve injury, and this loss and recovery of YAP/TAZ in SCs are spatiotemporally correlated with degeneration and regeneration of axons. We also found that SCs lacking YAP/TAZ proliferate and wrap around regenerated axons normally, but then fail to remyelinate them. These findings have several important implications for YAP/TAZ function in mature SCs.</p><p>Using antibodies specifically immunolabeling YAP or YAP/TAZ, we found dramatic down- and upregulation of both nuclear and cytoplasmic YAP/TAZ in SCs after nerve injury. Immunohistochemical identification of SC-selective YAP/TAZ was essential for detecting spatiotemporal regulation of YAP/TAZ. Indeed, we were only able to detect YAP/TAZ downregulation on Western blots when we used lysates prepared from nerves extensively perfused with saline, and from which the epi- and perineurium had been carefully removed. This procedure probably succeeded because it minimized the amount of YAP/TAZ present in cells other than SCs. Careful attention to YAP/TAZ expression in cells other than SCs will help to resolve inconsistencies in earlier studies of YAP/TAZ expression in peripheral nerve.</p><p>YAP/TAZ are located in the nuclei of developing SCs, where they promote proliferation and differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Poitelon et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Deng et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Grove et al., 2017</xref>). They are also nuclear in adult SCs that maintain the myelin sheath (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Grove et al., 2017</xref>) and that proliferate abnormally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wu et al., 2018</xref>). It was therefore particularly intriguing to find that YAP/TAZ become undetectable in denervated SCs and that SCs lacking YAP/TAZ proliferate normally. YAP/TAZ disappeared from SCs, upon axon degeneration in both crushed and transected nerves. They reappeared in SCs in crushed nerve concomitant with regenerating axons, but not in transected nerve lacking axons, suggesting that YAP/TAZ expression in SCs is dependent on axons. It is also notable that YAP/TAZ appeared unchanged at one dpi, but had dramatically disappeared at three dpi, when axon degeneration was well underway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beirowski et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gomez-Sanchez et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jang et al., 2016</xref>) and denervated SCs had lost contact with axons. Furthermore, SCs that upregulated YAP/TAZ after three dpi were associated with regenerating axons large enough to be myelinated. These results are in consistent with our earlier findings of selective expression of YAP/TAZ in myelin-forming SCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Grove et al., 2017</xref>), implying that direct SC-axon contact probably regulate YAP/TAZ down- and upregulation after nerve injury.</p><p>We were surprised to find that SC proliferation proceeds normally in <italic>Yap/Taz</italic> iDKO nerves after injury. Proliferation of mature SCs after injury is therefore due to a YAP/TAZ-independent mechanism, in contrast to the proliferation of developing SCs, which is markedly reduced by YAP/TAZ inactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Clemence et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Grove et al., 2017</xref>). This result is consistent with the notion that the mechanism for SC proliferation during development differs from that for proliferation after injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Atanasoski et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Atanasoski et al., 2008</xref>). However, our finding does not indicate that YAP/TAZ are unable to stimulate proliferation of mature SCs. Abnormally high levels of YAP have been shown to elicit excessive SC proliferation in Merlin mutants after nerve injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mindos et al., 2017</xref>), and YAP/TAZ overexpression induced by LATS1/2 inactivation has been shown to induce tumorigenic SC proliferation in adult nerves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wu et al., 2018</xref>). These observations, together with our own, indicate that YAP/TAZ are not normally involved in injury-elicited SC proliferation, but that, if abnormally overexpressed, they can stimulate vigorous SC proliferation. It is also noteworthy that YAP/TAZ inactivation markedly reduces, but does not completely prevent, proliferation of developing SCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Deng et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Grove et al., 2017</xref>). We suggest, therefore, that YAP/TAZ are potent stimulants of SC proliferation, but not an absolute requirement.</p><p>Tumorigenic proliferation of adult SCs associated with abnormally increased YAP/TAZ levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wu et al., 2018</xref>) suggests the importance of maintaining proper levels of YAP/TAZ, but it does not explain why YAP/TAZ are almost completely lost, rather than reduced, in denervated SCs. We previously demonstrated that inducible deletion of YAP/TAZ elicits SC demyelination in adult intact nerve (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Grove et al., 2017</xref>). If YAP/TAZ indeed maintain myelination and act by promoting transcription of Krox20 and other myelin genes, then sustaining YAP/TAZ would counteract demyelination and dedifferentiation of SCs after injury. Conversely, their absence would promote downregulation of myelin genes, facilitating demyelination and formation of repair SCs. In accordance with these ideas, transcription of Krox 20 and other myelin genes remains robust in SCs up until two dpi, but is downregulated by three dpi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arthur-Farraj et al., 2017</xref>), when we observed dramatic disappearance of YAP/TAZ. This timing suggests that YAP/TAZ protein downregulation leads to Krox 20 mRNA downregulation, suppressing expression of myelin proteins in de-differentiating Schwann cells. Complete loss of both nuclear and cytoplasmic YAP/TAZ could therefore imply that active regulatory mechanisms completely inactivate YAP/TAZ after injury. In support of this notion, in mutant mice lacking Merlin, YAP is abnormally upregulated in SCs after nerve injury, impairing SC de-differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mindos et al., 2017</xref>). This YAP upregulation suggests that one role of Merlin is to downregulate YAP in SCs and that YAP/TAZ expression in SCs is likely under active, presumably axon-dependent, regulation in both intact and injured mature nerves. This postulation of axon-dependent regulation of YAP/TAZ emphasizes that YAP/TAZ play a passive role in Wallerian degeneration, predicting that SCs do not require YAP/TAZ to dedifferentiate, proliferate, or transdifferentiate to repair SCs. Indeed, we found that these processes proceed normally in <italic>Yap/Taz</italic> iDKO mice. iDKO SCs are capable of wrapping around large diameter single axons but fail to initiate remyelination, which recapitulates the developmental phenotype of these mutant mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Deng et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Grove et al., 2017</xref>). For at least two reasons remyelination failure is highly unlikely to be due to poor physiological conditions of iDKO mice that die ~14 days after injury. First, axons regenerate normally in iDKO, which is unlikely if SCs are selectively vulnerable to poor physiological condition. Furthermore, iDKO SCs proliferate and trans-differentiate to repair-SCs normally. iDKO SCs also downregulate c-Jun to prepare for remyelination, whereas they maintain a higher level of Oct six than WT SCs, consistent with the failure of iDKO SCs to upregulate Krox 20 and MBP. Second, iDKO SCs wrap around individual axons, but fail to myelinate them, indicating that they proceed to the promyelination stage but no further. Therefore, one would have to postulate that the poor physiological condition of iDKO mice has a very specific effect on a particular remyelination stage, which we find unlikely.</p><p>iDKO SCs fail to upregulate Krox 20. Krox 20 is widely accepted as the key transcription factor promoting peripheral myelination. This is largely believed to be the case after injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brügger et al., 2017</xref>), although its role in remyelination has never been explicitly demonstrated. Other pathways can also promote upregulation of certain myelin proteins and lipids independently of Krox 20 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Domènech-Estévez et al., 2016</xref>), and numerous other factors, both positive and negative regulators, mediate peripheral myelination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jessen and Mirsky, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Herbert and Monk, 2017</xref>). Therefore, it is conceivable that the lack of Krox 20 in iDKO is a consequence rather than a cause of impaired remyelination. However, several considerations make it highly unlikely. First, we and others demonstrated that YAP/TAZ-TEAD1 complex directly binds to the cis-acting regulatory sequence of Krox 20 designated as the Myelinating Schwann cell Element (MSE) to upregulate Krox 20 during developmental myelination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lopez-Anido et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Grove et al., 2017</xref>). Second, we showed that YAP/TAZ-TEAD1 also bind to Krox 20 MSE in adult nerve, suggesting direct regulation of Krox 20 by YAP/TAZ in mature SCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Grove et al., 2017</xref>). Third, Oct 6, which induces upregulation of Krox 20, together with other TFs, is upregulated in iDKO after nerve injury, as in WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9G</xref>). This finding suggests that remyelination in iDKO is blocked at the step of Krox 20 upregulation. Indeed, we and others have shown that iDKO SCs are arrested at the promyelination stage during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Deng et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Grove et al., 2017</xref>), and we found that, similarly after nerve injury, iDKO SCs proceed to the promyelination stage but fail to upregulate Krox 20 and initiate myelin formation.</p><p>YAP upregulation in SCs lacking Merlin has recently been reported to decrease the regeneration-promoting ability of repair SCs, which prevents axon regeneration in Merlin mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mindos et al., 2017</xref>). This study implicates YAP as an inhibitor of axon regeneration. Our study suggests that this inhibition is dose- and context-dependent. We observed that repair SCs rapidly upregulate both YAP and TAZ as axons regenerate and that expression persists as regeneration continues. We also found that axon regeneration is as robust in <italic>Taz</italic> iKO and <italic>Yap/Taz</italic> iDKO as in WT, but not noticeably enhanced. Given that YAP is not compensatorily upregulated in <italic>Taz</italic> iKO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>), these results suggest that at least normal levels of YAP do not prevent axon regeneration. However, overly robust upregulation of YAP, presumably as in Merlin mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mindos et al., 2017</xref>), may severely compromise axon regeneration because excessive levels of YAP/TAZ alter the growth-promoting ability of SCs and/or cause their tumorigenic proliferation.</p><p>The present study, together with earlier work, strongly suggests that the levels of YAP/TAZ may be a critical determinant of their function in adult SCs. Optimal levels of YAP/TAZ promote myelin formation, maintenance and remyelination, whereas their absence promotes demyelination. In contrast, overly excessive levels of YAP/TAZ promote SC proliferation. Additional efforts to confirm this notion and to understand the presumably axon-dependent mechanisms that tightly regulate nuclear levels, thus transcriptional activity, of YAP/TAZ in SCs may generate new strategies for peripheral nerve repair.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources

Using an ImageJ G-ratio calculator plug-in, G ratios for each genotype were calculated in two different ways: (1) All single large axons were counted, whether or not they were myelinated; (2) Only myelinated axons were counted.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Data analysis</title><p>In each experiment, data collection and analysis were performed identically, regardless of mouse genotype. Data are presented as mean + / - SD. Statistical analysis was done using the two-sample Mann-Whitney test for two-group comparisons and analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Tukey’s test for multiple comparisons, according to the number of samples and the analysis of mice at multiple ages. Sample sizes were similar to those employed in the field and are indicated in the main text, methods or figure legends. A p-value of 0.05 or less was considered statistically significant.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Alan Tessler and members of the Son laboratory for critical reading of the manuscript.

authors' previous work examines the effects of transcriptional activity of YAP/TAZ in Schwann cell response to peripheral nerve injury. Using in vivo analyses of mutant mice, the authors show that YAP/TAZ function is not essential for Schwann cell proliferation and transdifferentiation into repair cells but is required for remyelination. This comprehensive work advances our understanding of regeneration of peripheral nervous system.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Axon-dependent expression of YAP/TAZ mediates Schwann cell remyelination but not proliferation after nerve injury&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Anna Akhmanova as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Michael Wehr (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The reviewers liked your work, in which you sought to determine the role of YAP/TAZ after nerve injury. This work is a follow-up of an earlier paper in which the team had assessed the role of these transcription factors in developing Schwann cells and myelination.</p><p>While YAP/TAZ deletion in Schwann cells does not affect Schwann cells trans-differentiation into repair Schwann cells (nor axonal regeneration) following PNS injury, the authors show here that YAP and TAZ control the extent of remyelination after injury. YAP and TAZ disappear in denervated Schwann cells, but re-appear in these cells when axons regenerate. In addition, the authors report an effect on Krox 20 expression in mutant mice but not of several other factors, such as c-jun, p75NTR, Oct6. Mutant nerves fail to form basal lamina bundles during regeneration. The findings are interesting and potentially significant to the field of PNS injury</p><p>The work has been thoroughly performed and the data presented support the overall assessment. Nevertheless, there are a number of issues that need to be addressed.</p><p>Major points:</p><p>1) Figure 1</p><p>Figure 1B: It is not clear whether denervation results in loss of YAP/TAZ expression or prevents the nuclear localization (thus, the transcriptionally activity) in Schwann cells. If it is the latter, YAP/TAZ is expected to translocate to the cytoplasm following injury, which does not seem to be the case. Accordingly, the authors state that both nuclear and cytoplasmic YAP/TAZ are down regulated in Schwann cells. However, the sentence &quot;SCs are critically dependent on axons for the transcriptional activity of YAP/TAZ&quot; could be misleading and should be rephrased.</p><p>Figure 1D: the authors mention that YAP is weakly expressed 24dpi, nevertheless the extent of expression is comparable to that observed at 6dpi. Please rephrase as this assay is not quantitative.</p><p>Figure 1 E and F show that disappearance and re-appearance of YAP/TAZ correlates with the timing of axonal degeneration and regeneration, respectively. However, the authors do not show that YAP/TAZ expression depends on the axon. To make the claim, one should look for direct evidence and causality.</p><p>2) The conclusion that YAP expression critically depends on axons (subsection “YAP/TAZ expression in Schwann cells is axon-dependent”) appears too strong as at 6dpi axons are starting to regenerate. This concept is also extensively presented in the Discussion where it is claimed that YAP nuclear expression &quot;is highly dependent on axons&quot; (Discussion paragraph three). While this is likely true 24 dpi, at 6 dpi the axons are still (actively) degenerating.</p><p>3) One of the main observations in iDKO is the defect in basal lamina (BL) tube formation. Can one exclude that this defect is due to a different deposition of BL components between WT and iDKO mice? Can the authors perform a western blotting analyses to determine its composition?.</p><p>4) The reduction in Krox 20 expression could alternatively be a consequence rather than the cause of impaired remyelination. Please discuss and soften conclusions.</p><p>5) In their discussion the authors posit that the disappearance of YAP/TAZ from denervated nerves provides support for a role in myelin maintenance, unfortunately without data corroborating this. It is also possible that YAP/TAZ dowregulation is merely due to the ongoing de-differentiation occurring in injured Schwann cells, which is an essential pre-requisite to acquire a repair phenotype (Discussion paragraph one).</p><p>6) Based on the lack of expression of YAP/TAZ at 3dpi, one cannot conclude SC-axon interactions are essential to maintain YAP/TAZ expression in adult SCs. Denervated Schwann cells have a completely different phenotype from those observed in adult nerves (Discussion paragraph three).</p><p>7) In Discussion paragraph four, the authors propose that &quot;YAP/TAZ powerfully stimulate developing and adult SCs to proliferate at all stages&quot;. This conclusion is not directly supported by data. The authors point out that in a recent study (Mindos et al., 2017) YAP and TAZ are critically regulated by Merlin in Schwann cells (SCs), and inactivation of Merlin leads to higher levels of YAP and TAZ preventing axon regeneration and remyelination. However, it remains unclear how YAP (in Taz iKO nerves) can myelinate regenerated axons. Would removal of Merlin in Taz iKO nerves also prevent myelination? An experiment that identifies these mechanisms would help.</p><p>8) The authors should check the statistics they applied. A t-test assumes that samples are normally distributed. This is not likely the case for 3 replicates. Use the Mann-Whitney test as alternative. Western blots should also be quantified and for all quantifications (imaging, Western blotting) individual data points should be shown.</p><p>9) Figure 4: Does the loss of YAP/TAZ result in a delay of axonal re-generation? Mindos et al., 2017, had shown in mice hat regenerating axons could reach up to 13-14 mm distal to the injury site within 7 days of nerve crush. The present study accessed regeneration 12-14 days after injury but only within the 5-10 mm distal region, a paradigm unlikely to detect a delay in axonal regeneration if present. To address this issue, regeneration should be analyzed earlier and ideally along its time course.</p><p>10) Similarly Figures 6, 7: Nerve regeneration/remyelination was accessed 12-13 dpi, a couple of days before death of the mice is expected. As stated in subsection “SCs lacking YAP/TAZ convert to repair SCs and support axon regeneration”, iDKO mice die about 14 days after tamoxifen injection (also stated in Grove et al., 2017). At the time point analyzed, even uninjured iDKO mice exhibit clear PNS nerve defects (shivering, decrease in nerve conduction velocity, demyelination etc) as well as ataxia and impaired breathing (Grove et al., 2017). This complicates interpretation of the data on remyelination as the failure to re-build myelin could be due to a secondary effect stemming from the poor physiological condition of the mice. To prove that the remyelination failure is indeed due to the loss of YAP/TAZ, one would like to see a rescue experiment that restores the YAP/TAZ function in the iDKO Schwann cells. Unless such experiments are provided, the conclusion and discussion must be carefully rephrased.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Axon-dependent expression of YAP/TAZ mediates Schwann cell remyelination but not proliferation after nerve injury&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Anna Akhmanova (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below.

Nevertheless, the authors have not performed the requested additional experiments, which are instead argued in the rebuttal letter.</p><p>While it is clear from the presented data that p-YAP relocalizes in cytoplasm (Figure 2D), in Figure 1B the authors show and state that &quot; the dramatic down- and up- regulation of YAP/TAZ concurrent with axon degeneration and regeneration, respectively, suggest that SCs are dependent on axons from YAP/TAZ nuclear localization&quot;. Given the experimental data it would be more correct talking about expression rather than localization. The latter indeed assumes a shuttle between in an out of the nucleus, which is valid for p-YAP and also in that case only partially.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>Grove et al. provide a detailed point-to-point response that satisfactorily discusses all issues raised.</p><p>However, this reviewer still has the following concerns related to the quantification of WB data (see below). Once clarified, the manuscript can be granted for publication.</p><p>Figure 1C, Figure 1—figure supplement 2:</p><p>For the quantification, 4 data points are shown per condition. Supplemental data show 2 uncropped blots that are 2 different exposures from the very same gel as presented in 1C (as the authors also specify). However, 3 independently performed blots that should show independently processed samples and were used for the quantification are not available. The authors need to provide the correct source data. Also note that Figure 1—figure supplement 2 contains a staining of nerve fibers, but no WB data.</p><p>Figure 4—figure supplement 1 and 2:</p><p>The quantification implicates two blots that were quantified.

Again, the authors need to provide the correct source data for all blots quantified.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>This is a revised manuscript which investigates the role of YAP/TAZ in mediating Schwann cell response to injury and PNS regeneration. The authors have addressed reviewers concerns sufficiently, by either conducting additional experiments or in writing. Overall, data from the study are solid and the findings are potentially significant to the field of PNS injury and regeneration. I only have one concern, which can be addressed in writing by the authors.</p><p>Figure 1 and Figure 1—figure supplement 1 (paragraph four subsection “YAP/TAZ expression in Schwann cells is axon-dependent”). I am still confused about the discrepancy between the WB and IHC results on YAP expression in denervated nerves. When detected WB, YAP expression continues to decrease after nerve crush and does not recover, whereas when assessed by IHC, YAP expression returns at 6 and 12D. The authors claim that the WB result reflects YAP expression in other cell types (I have to say, I do not agree with the explanation). However, they also make a point in the Discussion that WB was done using lysates prepared from nerves that had been de-sheathed (epi- and perineurium removed) to ensure enrichment of SC-derived proteins.</p><p>Since most of the YAP is nuclear at 6 and 12D, shown by the IHC, is it possible that the lysis buffer used for WB does not recover nuclear YAP in the Schwann cells, thus the WB only reflects the cytoplasmic YAP?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.50138.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Major points:</p><p>1) Figure 1</p><p>Figure 1B: It is not clear whether denervation results in loss of YAP/TAZ expression or prevents the nuclear localization (thus, the transcriptionally activity) in Schwann cells.

This data are additional evidence that axons are necessary for the recovery of cytoplasmic expression of YAP/TAZ in SCs. We have also amended our statements on axon-dependence of YAP/TAZ expression.</p><p>Figure 1—figure supplement 1D (now Figure 1—figure supplement 1B): We have removed the confusing statement and just mention here that “YAP is upregulated in many SC nuclei at or after 6 dpi…”.</p><p>Figure 1E and F (now Figure 1B and C): Please note that we do NOT claim that SCs depend on “axon contact” for YAP/TAZ expression. We believe that this is likely to be the case (see below #2 and #6 responses) but we agree with the reviewer that only correlative data support it. We claim that they depend on “axons” (i.e., presence of axons implicating neural regulation) mainly based on the nerve transection experiment (previous Figure 1B and C, now Figure 2). Whereas crushing nerve permits regeneration of axons into the distal nerve stump, completely cutting and tying nerve (as we did in the nerve transection experiment) prevents axons from regenerating into distal nerve stump. As the distal stump of transected/tied nerves will not have axons, comparing protein expression in crushed versus transected/tied nerve has been used to examine axonal dependence or neural regulation in vivo. Our finding that YAP/TAZ disappear in SCs upon axon degeneration in both crushed and transected nerves, that they reappear in crushed nerve concomitant with regenerating axons, but not in transected nerve lacking axons therefore provides strong evidence for the dependence of YAP/TAZ expression in SCs on axons. Whether this neural regulation is via direct axon-SC contact or releasable factors or is mediated by another cell type awaits additional study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The conclusion that YAP expression critically depends on axons (subsection “YAP/TAZ expression in Schwann cells is axon-dependent”) appears too strong as at 6dpi axons are starting to regenerate. This concept is also extensively presented in the Discussion where it is claimed that YAP nuclear expression &quot;is highly dependent on axons&quot; (Discussion paragraph three). While this is likely true 24 dpi, at 6 dpi the axons are still (actively) degenerating.</p></disp-quote><p>It is true that axon degeneration can be active at 6 dpi or even later. It is also important to note that, in the nerve crush injury model, new axons form and penetrate the crush site within 1-2 days after injury and extend further along the distal nerve stump. As shown in the newly provided Figure 6 and in many other studies, regenerating axons can reach up to ~4 mm distal to the crush site at 3 dpi. These axons then keep regenerating within the basal lamina (BL) tubes at the speed of 1-4 mm/day, although the debris of degenerating axons and myelin are not yet completely removed. We observed regenerating axons at 3 dpi (e.g., Figure 1B; zoomed area of 3D-dstl) but many more (and thicker, large-diameter) axons at 6 dpi which made contacts with SCs (Figure 1B; zoomed area of 6D-dstl). These data therefore support our conclusion and further suggest that regenerating axons upregulate YAP/TAZ in SCs. However, we agree with the reviewer that our statements were too strong, and we have modulated the sentences.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) One of the main observations in iDKO is the defect in basal lamina (BL) tube formation. Can one exclude that this defect is due to a different deposition of BL components between WT and iDKO mice? Can the authors perform a western blotting analyses to determine its composition?.</p></disp-quote><p>We assume that the reviewer meant failed remyelination by “…defect in BL formation…”, and that s/he wondered if failed remyelination in iDKO could be due to defective signaling from BL evoked by the loss of YAP/TAZ in SCs. First, it is our understanding that BL is important but axons and SCs also provide essential components for optimal remyelination. The complete, rather than partial or delayed, loss of remyelination that we observed in iDKO is therefore likely to be due to inability of SCs in iDKO to coordinate signals from axons and SCs, as well as those from BL. Second, we consider it unlikely that substantial changes can be made in BL tubes in adult iDKO mice, as they are already established and completely normal before tamoxifen injection. Considering the marked structural and molecular stability of BL tubes in mature nerves, we anticipate modest if any changes in BL composition during the relatively short time between tamoxifen injection and terminal end points. In support of this notion, axons regenerate normally within BL tubes in iDKO (Figure 5). Axon regeneration should have been attenuated if there were substantial changes in BL associated growth-promoting molecules such as laminin. Laminin is a main BL component also known to promote myelination. Thus, we believe it reasonable to predict that SCs fail to remyelinate although a substantial amount of laminin is present in BL of iDKO.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The reduction in Krox 20 expression could alternatively be a consequence rather than the cause of impaired remyelination. Please discuss and soften conclusions.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the comment and have amended our statements and discussed as suggested. Krox 20 is widely accepted as the key transcription factor (TF) promoting peripheral myelination. This is largely believed to be the case after injury, although its role in remyelination has never been explicitly demonstrated. Other pathways can also promote upregulation of certain myelin proteins and lipids independently of Krox 20, and numerous other factors, both positive and negative regulators, mediate peripheral myelination. Therefore, it is conceivable that the lack of Krox 20 in iDKO is a consequence rather than a cause of impaired myelination. However, several considerations make it highly unlikely. First, we and others have shown that YAP/TAZ-TEAD1 complex directly binds to the cis-acting regulatory sequence of Krox 20 (i.e., MSE) to upregulate Krox 20 during developmental myelination. Second, we showed that YAP/TAZ-TEAD1 also bind to Krox 20 MSE in mature nerve, suggesting direct regulation of Krox 20 by YAP/TAZ in mature SCs. Third, Oct 6, which induces upregulation of Krox 20, together with other TFs, is upregulated in iDKO after nerve injury, as in WT (Figure 4H, 9G). This finding suggests that remyelination in iDKO is blocked at the step of Krox 20 upregulation. Indeed, we and others have shown that iDKO SCs are arrested at the promyelination stage during development, and similarly after nerve injury, we found that iDKO SCs are capable of wrapping around individual axons but fail to upregulate Krox 20 and initiate myelin formation (Figure 5E, 7E).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) In their discussion the authors posit that the disappearance of YAP/TAZ from denervated nerves provides support for a role in myelin maintenance, unfortunately without data corroborating this. It is also possible that YAP/TAZ dowregulation is merely due to the ongoing de-differentiation occurring in injured Schwann cells, which is an essential pre-requisite to acquire a repair phenotype (Discussion paragraph one).</p></disp-quote><p>We reduced and clarified our discussion of the “implication” of the present remyelination study for the role of YAP/TAZ in myelin maintenance. Due to conflicting reports among different groups, it remains controversial whether YAP/TAZ are crucial also for maintaining myelin in mature nerve. This is a very important issue in the field, and intimately associated with demyelination and remyelination of mature nerve after injury. Therefore, we believe that our discussion of the “implication” of the present study is sufficiently justified and does not require direct supporting data. We also discuss prior studies that support the notion that YAP/TAZ downregulation may be actively regulated, rather than passive due to ongoing de-differentiation. These findings include that Krox 20 mRNA is not downregulated until 3 days after injury (Arthur-Farraj et al., 2017), when we observed YAP/TAZ protein downregulation. This timing suggests that YAP/TAZ protein downregulation leads to Krox 20 mRNA downregulation, suppressing expression of myelin proteins in de-differentiating SCs. Complete loss of both nuclear and cytoplasmic YAP/TAZ could therefore implicate possible presence of active regulatory mechanisms that completely inactivate YAP/TAZ after injury. In support of this notion, in mutant mice lacking Merlin, YAP is abnormally upregulated in SCs after nerve injury, impairing SC de-differentiation (Mindos et al., 2017). This YAP upregulation suggests that one role of Merlin is to downregulate YAP in SCs after injury and that YAP/TAZ expression in SCs is likely under active regulation in both intact and injured mature nerves.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Based on the lack of expression of YAP/TAZ at 3dpi, one cannot conclude SC-axon interactions are essential to maintain YAP/TAZ expression in adult SCs. Denervated Schwann cells have a completely different phenotype from those observed in adult nerves (Discussion paragraph three).</p></disp-quote><p>Here again we meant to discuss the implications of the remyelination data for myelin maintenance, not as a conclusion. We have now softened and clarified the statement so that readers do not misinterpret us. As mentioned in our response to #2 comment, we claim that SCs depend on axons for YAP/TAZ expression after injury. We now provide images of an enlarged area of crushed and transected/tied nerves (Figure 1B, Figure 2B, 2C, 2D) to better demonstrate that loss and recovery of YAP/TAP expression in SCs are spatiotemporally correlated with loss and recovery of SC-axon contact. It is particularly interesting that a few thin axons make contacts with SCs as early as 3 dpi but that YAP/TAZ are not upregulated, whereas there is obvious upregulation at 6 dpi when many of these axons become thicker (i.e., &gt;1um or large enough to be myelinated). These observations are consistent with our earlier finding that YAP/TAZ are expressed only in myelinating, but not in non-myelinating, SCs (Grove et al., 2017), and further support the notion that the absence and presence of axons determine YAP/TAZ down- and upregulation in SCs after injury, respectively. We believe that this additional data further justify our suggestion in the discussion that the same mechanism may maintain YAP/TAZ expression in adult SCs in intact nerve.</p><p>It is also noteworthy that, despite drastic phenotype differences, both innervated and denervated SCs and their processes reside within basal lamina (BL) tubes. It is also well established that axons degenerate and regenerate within BL tubes, losing or regaining contacts with SCs and SC processes that tightly fill the BL tubes and comprise the bands of Büngner. Therefore, although the confocal microscopy that we used in the present study does not provide sufficient resolution to demonstrate direct cell-cell contact between SCs and the fluorescently labeled axons, the presence of axons closely adjacent to the SC nuclei of interest strongly suggests that these SCs have made direct contact with axons.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) In Discussion paragraph four, the authors propose that &quot;YAP/TAZ powerfully stimulate developing and adult SCs to proliferate at all stages&quot;. This conclusion is not directly supported by data. The authors point out that in a recent study (Mindos et al., 2017) YAP and TAZ are critically regulated by Merlin in Schwann cells (SCs), and inactivation of Merlin leads to higher levels of YAP and TAZ preventing axon regeneration and remyelination. However, it remains unclear how YAP (in Taz iKO nerves) can myelinate regenerated axons. Would removal of Merlin in Taz iKO nerves also prevent myelination? An experiment that identifies these mechanisms would help.</p></disp-quote><p>We found that SCs do not require YAP/TAZ to proliferate after nerve injury. This finding was quite unexpected because YAP/TAZ are crucial for the proliferation of developing SCs (Grove et al., 2017). In our discussion of this interesting finding, we suggested that the finding was unlikely to indicate that YAP/TAZ are unable to stimulate proliferation of “mature” SCs, which was what we meant by our statement that <italic>&quot;</italic>YAP/TAZ…stimulate…adult SCs to proliferate…&quot;. We referred to two recent publications from other groups which support the statement, and which reported increased proliferation of mature SCs in response to abnormally high activation of YAP in injured nerve in the absence of Merlin (Mindos et al., 2017) or of YAP/TAZ in intact nerve in the absence of LATS1/2 (Wu et al., 2018). We think that these reports provide sufficient rationale for our statement and discussion.</p><p>It is worth noting that both reports found increased YAP-, or YAP/TAZ-dependent SC proliferation when the upstream regulators of YAP/TAZ (Merlin, LATS1/2) were experimentally dysregulated, whereas we observed YAP/TAZ-independent proliferation of SCs when these signals are intact and properly regulating spatiotemporal expression of YAP/TAZ after injury. As we mentioned in #5 response, we postulate that active regulatory mechanism(s) remove YAT/TAZ from SCs to help dedifferentiation upon axon degeneration after injury, and then upregulate them upon axon regeneration to induce remyelination. We also postulate that the regulatory mechanism(s) prevent redifferentiating SCs that contact large regenerating axons from excessively upregulating YAP/TAZ, because excessive activation of YAP/TAZ may stimulate SC proliferation rather than differentiation, as in Merlin- or LATS1/2-null mutants.</p><p>Consistent with this notion, we also found that YAP expression remains at a normal level in Taz iKO and that YAP alone promote myelination in the absence of TAZ, although YAP and TAZ together induce more efficient remyelination. We are quite confident to conclude that YAP and TAZ are functionally redundant in remyelination. We do not know why the reviewer questions our conclusion, but speculate that it is related to the report of Mindos et al., 2017. These investigators examined nerve injury in the absence of Merlin and raised the possibility that YAP and TAZ may have different functions, which contradicts our conclusion. This report also included some other discrepancies with our observations, such as TAZ expression in denervated SCs. We are very interested to know if Merlin indeed regulates YAP and TAZ expression differently, the mechanisms by which Merlin regulates YAP/TAZ, and how its loss impacts spatiotemporal expression and thus the activity of YAP/TAZ. This information will be of great interest, but, in our opinion, generation and in-depth analysis of Merlin and Taz double mutants are beyond the scope of the present work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) The authors should check the statistics they applied. A t-test assumes that samples are normally distributed. This is not likely the case for 3 replicates. Use the Mann-Whitney test as alternative. Western blots should also be quantified and for all quantifications (imaging, Western blotting) individual data points should be shown.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, we used the Mann-Whitney U test, quantified additional Western blots (Figure 4—figure supplement 1, Figure 8A) and indicate individual data points on all graphs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) Figure 4: Does the loss of YAP/TAZ result in a delay of axonal re-generation? Mindos et al., 2017, had shown in mice hat regenerating axons could reach up to 13-14 mm distal to the injury site within 7 days of nerve crush. The present study accessed regeneration 12-14 days after injury but only within the 5-10 mm distal region, a paradigm unlikely to detect a delay in axonal regeneration if present. To address this issue, regeneration should be analyzed earlier and ideally along its time course.</p></disp-quote><p>As requested, we analyzed an earlier phase of regeneration by selectively labeling regenerating axons at 3 days after injury, and the result is presented in the new Figure 6. We observed similar numbers of axons that penetrated the injured site and reached ~4mm distal to the crushed site in YAP/TAZ iDKO, as in WT mice. Thus, it is highly unlikely that regeneration is delayed in the absence of YAP/TAZ. We chose 3 days after injury to assess the onset and early phase of regeneration when axotomized distal axons are actively degenerating. In rodents axons regenerate along the distal stump at a speed of up to 4mm/day, and even the most distal muscles are reinnervated in less than 12 days in mice. We believe, therefore, that if we were to find a difference of 1-2 millimeters in how far the longest axons regenerate at times later than 3 dpi in YAP/TAZ iDKO and WT mice, that this difference would not reliably indicate poor regeneration.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) Similarly Figures 6, 7: Nerve regeneration/remyelination was accessed 12-13 dpi, a couple of days before death of the mice is expected. As stated in subsection “SCs lacking YAP/TAZ convert to repair SCs and support axon regeneration”, iDKO mice die about 14 days after tamoxifen injection (also stated in Grove et al., 2017). At the time point analyzed, even uninjured iDKO mice exhibit clear PNS nerve defects (shivering, decrease in nerve conduction velocity, demyelination etc) as well as ataxia and impaired breathing (Grove et al., 2017). This complicates interpretation of the data on remyelination as the failure to re-build myelin could be due to a secondary effect stemming from the poor physiological condition of the mice. To prove that the remyelination failure is indeed due to the loss of YAP/TAZ, one would like to see a rescue experiment that restores the YAP/TAZ function in the iDKO Schwann cells. Unless such experiments are provided, the conclusion and discussion must be carefully rephrased.</p></disp-quote><p>We now discuss why we consider it highly unlikely that the remyelination failure is due to poor physiological condition of the iDKO mice. First, axons regenerate normally in iDKO, which is unlikely if SCs are selectively vulnerable to poor physiological condition. Furthermore, iDKO SCs proliferate and trans-differentiate to repair-SCs normally. iDKO SCs also downregulate c-Jun to prepare for remyelination, whereas they maintain a higher level of Oct 6 than WT SCs, consistent with the failure of iDKO SCs to upregulate Krox 20 and MBP. Second, iDKO SCs wrap around individual axons, but fail to myelinate them, indicating that they proceed to the promyelination stage but no further. Therefore, one would have to postulate that the poor physiological condition of iDKO mice has a very specific effect on a particular remyelination stage, which we find unlikely.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>The revised version of the manuscript has significantly improved as compared to the original study.

The authors have addressed reviewers concerns sufficiently, by either conducting additional experiments or in writing. Overall, data from the study is solid and the findings are potentially significant to the field of PNS injury and regeneration. I only have one concern, which can be addressed in writing by the authors.</p><p>Figure 1 and Figure 1—figure supplement 1 (paragraph four subsection “YAP/TAZ expression in Schwann cells is axon-dependent”). I am still confused about the discrepancy between the WB and IHC results on YAP expression in denervated nerves. When detected WB, YAP expression continues to decrease after nerve crush and does not recover, whereas when assessed by IHC, YAP expression returns at 6 and 12D. The authors claim that the WB result reflects YAP expression in other cell types (I have to say, I do not agree with the explanation). However, they also make a point in the Discussion that WB was done using lysates prepared from nerves that had been de-sheathed (epi- and perineurium removed) to ensure enrichment of SC-derived proteins.</p><p>Since most of the YAP is nuclear at 6 and 12D, shown by the IHC, is it possible that the lysis buffer used for WB does not recover nuclear YAP in the Schwann cells, thus the WB only reflects the cytoplasmic YAP?</p></disp-quote><p>For all WBs, sciatic nerves were lysed in RIPA buffer, which is a stringent buffer. Nevertheless, for all antibodies used in WBs, we performed pilot experiments where the sciatic nerve pellet left over after RIPA extraction was dissolved in 3xSDS-PAGE loading buffer (this buffer contains 6% SDS). An equal fraction of the pellet and lysate was run on SDS-PAGE to ensure that all of the protein under study was in the lysate fraction, which was the case with YAP and TAZ. Hence, we are confident that all of the nuclear and cytoplasmic YAP in Schwann cells was in the lysate used for WBs.</p><p>IHC revealed numerous SCs exhibiting YAP apparently in their nuclei at 6D or later. However, quantitative analysis was difficult to perform with the sole antibody that specifically recognized YAP (but not TAZ) in IHC. Accordingly, we claim that YAP is upregulated in SCs, but we do not intend to imply that its levels return to normal in SCs. It was indeed our impression that YAP staining intensity may remain weak possibly in quite many SCs even at 24D. We will be interested to explore this possibility, when additional antibodies of high quality are available for YAP or TAZ specific IHC.</p></body></sub-article></article>
