with histones. While the four eukaryotic histones wrap ~147 DNA base pairs into nucleosomes, archaeal histones form ‘nucleosome-like’ complexes that continuously wind between 60 and 500 base pairs of DNA (‘archaeasomes’), suggested by crystal contacts and analysis of cellular chromatin. Solution structures of large archaeasomes (&gt;90 DNA base pairs) have never been directly observed. Here, we utilize molecular dynamics simulations, analytical ultracentrifugation, and cryoEM to structurally characterize the solution state of archaeasomes on longer DNA. Simulations reveal dynamics of increased accessibility without disruption of DNA-binding or tetramerization interfaces. Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentration influences compaction, and cryoEM densities illustrate that DNA is wrapped in consecutive substates arranged 90<sup>o</sup> out-of-plane with one another. Without ATP-dependent remodelers, archaea may leverage these inherent dynamics to balance chromatin packing and accessibility.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>All animals, plants and fungi belong to a group of living organisms called eukaryotes. The two other groups are bacteria and archaea, which include unicellular, microscopic organisms. All three groups have genes, which are typically stored on long strands of DNA. Eukaryotes have so much DNA that they use proteins called histones to help package and organize it inside each cell. Archaea also have simplified histones that help store their DNA, and studying these proteins could reveal how eukaryotic histones first evolved.</p><p>In eukaryotes, groups of eight histones form a short cylinder that organizes a small section of DNA into a structure called a nucleosome. Each cell needs hundreds of thousands of nucleosomes to arrange its DNA. Eukaryotic cells also contain other proteins that release pieces of DNA from histones so that their genetic information can be used. The histones in Archaea don’t form discrete nucleosomes, instead, they coil DNA into ‘slinky-like’ shapes. It’s still unclear how DNA packing in archaea works and how it differs from eukaryotes.</p><p>Bowerman, Wereszczynski and Luger used computer simulations, biochemistry and cryo-electron microscopy to study the histones from archaea. The archaeal ‘slinky-like’ histone structures are more flexible than nucleosomes, and can open and close like clamshells. This flexibility allows the information in the genomes of Archaea to be easily accessed, so, unlike in eukaryotes, archaeal cells may not need other proteins to release the DNA from the histones.</p><p>The ability to package DNA allows cells to contain many more genes, so evolving histones was a vital step in the evolution of eukaryotic life, including the appearance of animals. Archaeal histones may reflect early versions of histones in eukaryotes, and can be used to understand how DNA packing has evolved. Furthermore, a greater understanding of Archaea may help better explain their role in health and global ecosystems, and allow their use in industrial applications.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>nucleosome</kwd><kwd>histone</kwd><kwd>archaea</kwd><kwd>molecular dynamics</kwd><kwd>cryo-EM</kwd><kwd>AUC</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1552743</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wereszczynski</surname><given-names>Jeff</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35GM119647</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wereszczynski</surname><given-names>Jeff</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Luger</surname><given-names>Karolin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F32GM137496</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bowerman</surname><given-names>Samuel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Archaeal histones compact DNA into nucleosome-like particles of varying sizes that contort sporadically and reorient DNA wrapping.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Eukaryotic genomes are orders of magnitude larger and more complex than those of archaea or bacteria. They manage their massive genomes through a hierarchical packaging scheme that utilizes histones to form nucleosomes, a complex that contains two H2A-H2B histone heterodimers flanking a central (H3-H4)<sub>2</sub> heterotetramer and stably wraps ~147 base pairs of DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Luger et al., 1997</xref>). While all eukaryotes invariably contain histones, genes encoding putative ‘minimalist’ histone proteins have been identified in most archaea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Henneman et al., 2018</xref>), but so far not in bacteria. While still a subject of debate, the presence of histones in the two domains of life has supported theories that eukaryotes evolved directly from an archaeon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Heinicke et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Malik and Henikoff, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brunk and Martin, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Watson, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Eme et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Spang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sandman and Reeve, 2006</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Comparison of the eukaryotic nucleosome and Arc120, an archaeasome model system containing 120 base pairs of DNA and four histone dimers.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The eukaryotic nucleosome (PDB 1AOI) containing two copies of H3, H4, H2A, and H2B (blue, green, gold, and red, respectively) arranged as H2A-H2B dimers flanking the (H3–H4)<sub>2</sub> tetramer and binding 147 base pairs of DNA (gray and light blue).

In both archaea and eukaryotes, histones have a preference for occupying particular sites in the genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ammar et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nalabothula et al., 2013</xref>). Eukaryotic histones utilize highly disordered cationic N-terminal tails to regulate gene transcription and chromosome compaction via post-translational modifications (PTMs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Luger and Richmond, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Musselman et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bowman and Poirier, 2015</xref>), whereas most archaeal histones do not contain tail sequences, with the exception of some sequences found within the Asgard clade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Henneman et al., 2018</xref>). Additionally, histones in eukaryotes have evolved histone fold ‘extensions’, unique secondary structure elements that define the outer surface of the nucleosome as well as stabilize the histone core and the final turn of nucleosomal DNA. No such diversification has yet been identified in any of the archaeal histones.</p><p>Recently, we determined the crystal structure of <italic>Methanothermus fervidus</italic> histone HMfB bound to ~90 base pairs of DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mattiroli et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bhattacharyya et al., 2018</xref>). HMfB is a typical representative of most archaeal histones, as it contains no tails and no histone fold extensions, and it exists as either a homodimer or heterodimer with the closely related HMfA histone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sandman et al., 1994</xref>). Nevertheless, striking similarities to the eukaryotic nucleosome were observed, including a superhelical DNA path around a histone core that is nearly identical to that in nucleosomes, promoted by conserved DNA contacts with histones, and by dimer-dimer interactions through ‘four-helix bundles’ of α-helices. However, unlike nucleosomes, which are defined octameric particles that arrange as 10 nm ‘beads on a string’ on long DNA fragments, crystal contacts in the archaeal system promote an extended superhelical winding of DNA around a histone core that consists of more than the canonical four histone dimers. This arrangement, which is consistent with in vivo footprinting results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mattiroli et al., 2017</xref>), places the L1 loops of every <italic>n<sup>th</sup></italic> and <italic>(n+3)<sup>th</sup></italic> dimer in close proximity to one another (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). The importance of the L1-L1 interaction in stabilizing this arrangement in vitro and in vivo was established by substituting the highly conserved G17 residue with bulkier amino acids (e.g. G17D), resulting in transcription regulation defects.</p><p>Here, we show that archaeal histones, when assembled on long segments of DNA (&gt;200 base pairs), experience disparate solution dynamics compared to eukaryotic nucleosomes, and we present cryo-EM structures of two classes of particles arranged on a 207 base pair DNA fragment with deflections of the wrapping pathway. Despite many nucleosome-like properties, we refer to these constructs as ‘archaeasomes’, rather than ‘archaeal nucleosomes’, because of their inherent differences in higher order structures and solution behaviors, including the ability to form histone cores with more than four dimers. We classify archaeasomes by the length of bound DNA (i.e. shorthand of ‘Arc120’ for ‘archaeasome with 120 base pairs of DNA’). We use molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to show that archaeasomes can expand, like the stretching of a ‘slinky’, to increase overall accessibility without sacrificing histone-histone or histone-DNA interactions. Simulations also reinforce the importance of L1-L1 histone stacking interactions in regulating this dynamic equilibrium. Sedimentation velocity analytical ultracentrifugation (SV-AUC) and cryoEM highlight two distinct accessibility dynamics at play in archaeasome systems, and cryoEM analysis identifies archaeasomal states that continually wrap DNA but deflect the wrapping pathway 90<sup>o</sup> out-of-plane. The intrinsic dynamic behavior of archaeasome slinkies stands in contrast to eukaryotic nucleosomes, which are compact and highly stable and require modifications and elaborate machinery to efficiently regulate chromatin accessibility, whereas archaea may utilize this inherent stochastic behavior in order to access their DNA.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Archaeasomes are highly dynamic but maintain robust dimer-dimer and dimer-DNA interactions in simulations</title><p>We applied molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to model the stability and solution dynamics of archaeasomes assembled on DNA of increasing lengths.

Nevertheless, the Arc90 system experienced a high degree of global dynamics. RMSD calculations of backbone atom positions showed a maximum deviation of ~6 Å from the initial Arc90 coordinates, with trough-to-peak heights of ~4 Å throughout the time course (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>). RMSF calculations identify regions of highest flexibility where the DNA binds to the terminal dimers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), and visual inspection of Arc90 trajectories revealed that the system samples a ‘clamshell’ motion, where terminal dimers and associated DNA fluctuate to create ‘closed’ and ‘open’ accessibility states (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video4">Videos 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video5">5</xref>). The equilibrium between closed and open forms was quantitated by measuring the center-of-mass distance between each DNA end and the neighboring superhelical turn of DNA, where separations of ~16 Å and ~30 Å are indicative of closed and open states, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Over the clamshell motion, the four-helix bundle interfaces that bind consecutive dimers to one another was maintained, and only small rearrangements of the local contact network were observed.

However, this may be an artifact of molecular mechanics forcefields, which are additive and thereby affected by the total number of interactions in a system. When MM-GBSA values were normalized to the number of dimers in each system, there was no net change in DNA binding ability as a function of archaeosome size. Additionally, the G17D point mutation slightly reduced the dimer-DNA interaction strength, but this difference was not statistically significant when compared to the wild-type Arc120 system (p-value of 0.157). These data, in conjunction with maintained four-helix bundle interactions, show that archaeasomes can sample open and accessible conformations without histone dissociation. Thus, the loss of the 30 base pair ladder pattern in MNase digestion of chromatin isolated from cells carrying the G17D mutation as their only source of histones may be due to increased archaeasome dynamics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), rather than frequent histone dissociation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mattiroli et al., 2017</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>MM-GBSA calculations for DNA binding strength, both as raw values and normalized to the number of dimers in each system.</title><p>All values are given in kcal/mol, and results are intended to be interpreted comparatively, rather than as absolute values.

SV-AUC and cryoEM both show that the archaeasome, containing more than the characteristic four histone fold dimers observed in nucleosomes, is inherently dynamic and exists in a variety of open states while maintaining DNA-histone interactions. Archaeasomes can be stabilized with divalent cations. In apparent absence of archaeal ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling factors (large machines that regulate chromatin access in eukaryotes), this architecture provides an alternative mechanism for compacting chromatin and maintaining genome accessibility.</p><p>Our cryoEM structures show that archaeosomes are metastable and extended in the absence of divalent cations. Even in the presence of 5 mM Mg<sup>2+</sup>, archaeasomes exhibit at least two configurations. Indeed, our structures contain a maximum of four to five histone dimers arranged in a continuous helical ramp. Beyond that, the helical histone ramp is disrupted at the four-helix bundle interface by an outward rotation of the remaining two to three histone dimers and attached DNA. The existence of these structures in solution is supported by analysis of the hydrodynamic parameters of archaeosomes obtained from SV-AUC. Extending this arrangement to even longer DNA, one could picture particles that wrap anywhere from ~90 to~150 base pairs (using three to five histone fold dimers) arranged at ~90 degree angles with respect to each other, connected by minimal linker DNA. This arrangement may leave the major groove of the connecting DNA susceptible to nuclear factors, such as micrococcal nuclease or transcription factors, and explains the ~30 bp MNase digestion ladder observed in native archaeal chromatin.</p><p>Consistent with this interpretation, molecular dynamics simulations of Arc90 assemblies (with three histone fold dimers) displayed dynamic breathing at terminal sites of the complex, while histone-histone and histone-DNA contacts are maintained. Models constructed from repeats of this conformation agree with particle conformations extracted from SV-AUC hydrodynamic parameters, as well as direct images and two-dimensional class averages from cryoEM data gathered in the absence of Mg<sup>2+</sup>. There, multiple turns of DNA, fully saturated with histones, were observed but with considerable flexibility and distance between neighboring gyres. In contrast, Arc120 and Arc180 simulations (containing four and five histone dimers, respectively) did not exhibit this degree of dynamic behavior. However, these simulations may have been artificially biased for the closed configuration, because the starting structures had intact L1-L1 interactions. Separation of these contacts may require more than several hundred nanoseconds of computational sampling, and simulations of the Arc120-G17D system indeed show appreciable separation between DNA turns by weakening this interface while maintaining four-helix bundle interactions.</p><p>In eukaryotes, chromatin structure can be further modulated by the incorporation of histone variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bönisch and Hake, 2012</xref>). While in vivo studies have identified disparate roles of variant histones in archaea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Čuboňováa et al., 2012</xref>), very little is known about the structural modifications that they invoke. In a recent study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Stevens et al., 2020</xref>, molecular dynamics trajectories showed that substituting major type histones in <italic>Methanosphaera stadtmanae</italic> with a ‘capstone’ paralog, a histone variant with sequence modifications at the four-helix bundle, disrupts the tetramer interface and separates histone dimers on a continuous DNA fragment, thereby limiting archaeasome size. In the context of the capstone model, our EM-derived structures suggest that destabilizing the four-helix bundle interface may yield a subtle increase in DNA accessibility through increased exposure of the major groove, and without the need to fully displace the archaeasome subunit. As we have shown, this dynamic behavior is already sampled by major-type archaeal histones deposited on a continuous DNA fragment, and substitution of terminal histones with capstone-containing dimers will further bias the assembly toward the open configuration. In this way, lengths of DNA that would typically contain a single archaeasome unit of considerable length would instead be segmented in to several sub-archaeasomes configured in repeat perpendicular arrangements that modestly expose bridging DNA segments. Additionally, high rigidity in certain DNA sequences may inherently poise these segments as linker sequences, and the frequency of these less flexible regions would similarly influence the number of 90<sup>o</sup>-oriented subunits present along the genome.</p><p>Our SV-AUC traces show that Arc207 assemblies exhibit no signs of self-association upon the addition of up to 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, unlike eukaryotic nucleosomes and nucleosome arrays, where this favors extensive inter-nucleosome and inter-array interactions and aggregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Schwarz et al., 1996</xref>). Instead, these conditions bias individual archaeasomes toward more compact states without promoting inter-archaeasome interactions. Interestingly, estimates of Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentration within <italic>T. kodakarensis</italic> cells have been quoted at ~120 mM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nagata et al., 2017</xref>), much higher than measurements of Mg<sup>2+</sup> in mammalian nuclei (16–18 mM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Romani, 2013</xref>). Per dimer, archaeal histones provide weaker electrostatic screening of DNA than eukaryotic histones, due to their relatively lower isoelectric points (pI of ~8 vs~11), and the greater overall negative charge of archaeasomes may encourage rapid sequestering of any free Mg<sup>2+</sup> ions in the cell. This would induce a gradient-based mechanism for rapid and excessive uptake of cations to prevent chromatin compaction from monopolizing the Mg<sup>2+</sup> necessary for enzyme action. On the other hand, the ability of <italic>T. kodakarensis</italic> archaeasomes to compact but not aggregate as a result of elevated Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentration may be a direct result of evolving in high-salt environments, as regulating between internal and external concentrations may have been more energetically demanding than simply adapting their chromatin structure. More specific measures of local Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentration in archaeal chromatin may help differentiate these two mechanisms.</p><p>Archaeal histones were successfully expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic> cells and were found to coat bacterial DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rojec et al., 2019</xref>). Surprisingly, this resulted in only minor perturbations of cell growth, despite <italic>E. coli</italic> lacking the evolutionary machinery to handle histones. Furthermore, in vitro assays have shown that transcription through archaeasomes is slowed but not altogether stopped (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Xie and Reeve, 2004</xref>). In eukaryotes, navigation of polymerases through chromatin is assisted by histone chaperones and ATP-dependent remodeling factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hammond et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Clapier et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Markert and Luger, 2021</xref>), but no known homologs to these complexes have been identified as yet in archaea. In absence of remodelers, the inherent dynamics of archaeasome-based chromatin may thereby allow limited access to chromatin by the sporadic (and possibly stochastic) appearance of near-zero linker DNA and Arc60 or Arc90 substates. On the other hand, it is possible that sequences encoding chromatin remodelers are yet to be found. On a related note, the ‘SMC-like’ coalescin proteins was recently identified in the histone-less <italic>Sulfolobus</italic> archaea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Takemata and Bell, 2021</xref>), and the access of these yet unidentified ‘hidden agents’ would similarly be tuned by the dynamics of the archaeasome. The degree to which DNA rigidity, variant histones, or unknown histone- and DNA-binding proteins regulate chromatin accessibility is an exciting future area of research’.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Molecular dynamics simulations</title><p>Archaeasome systems of varying sizes were constructed from the crystal structure containing ~90 bp of DNA bound to histone HMfB (PDB 5T5K). Systems containing ~90 base pairs of DNA and three histone dimers (Arc90), ~120 base pairs of DNA and four histone dimers (Arc120), and ~180 base pairs of DNA and six histone dimers (Arc180) were created as prescribed by the crystal lattice. The Arc90 system is intended to represent the ‘fundamental unit’ of archaeasome-based chromatin, as it is the crystallographic unit of the solved structure as well as the smallest DNA protection footprint observed by MNase digestion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mattiroli et al., 2017</xref>). The Arc120 and Arc180 complexes provide systems in which to study the contribution of stacking histone-histone interactions, as well as the wrapping of additional DNA superhelical turns, in stabilizing or destabilizing the proposed archaeasome. Additionally, an Arc120 system with the G17D mutation was also generated (Arc120-G17D), in analogy to the destabilizing G17D mutation that was previously studied in vivo. The overhanging DNA bases that formed crystallographic contacts were removed in our simulations. Each system was neutralized and solvated in a TIP3P box of 100 mM NaCl (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jorgensen et al., 1983</xref>), and masses were repartitioned from heavy atoms to covalently bonded hydrogen atoms to allow for the use of a four fs timestep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hopkins et al., 2015</xref>). Parameters for protein atoms were taken from the Amber FF14SB forcefield (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Maier et al., 2015</xref>), DNA parameters were taken from the Amber bsc1 forcefield (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ivani et al., 2016</xref>), and ions were parameterized according to the modifications of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Joung and Cheatham, 2008</xref>.</p><p>Systems were then energy minimized for 5000 steps while constraining solute heavy atoms with a 10 kcal/mol/Å<sup>2</sup> harmonic potential, followed by 5000 steps without restraints. After energy minimization, three independent simulations of each system were conducted according to the following protocol: simulations were heated from 10 K to 300 K over the course of 50 ps in the NVT ensemble with heavy atom restraints applied, system densities were equilibrated and positional restraints were slowly released over the course of 200 ps in the NPT ensemble (target pressure of 1 atm), and simulations were extended for 300 ns without positional restraints in the NPT ensemble. During these production simulations, terminal base pair fraying was removed from the simulation by reinforcing hydrogen bonding in the terminal base pairs. No restraints were applied when participating atoms were within 3.5 Å of one another, but a harmonic potential was applied when participating atoms spread beyond this cutoff (force constant = 5.0 kcal/mol/Å<sup>2</sup>). Minimization and MD simulations were conducted in the pmemd engine (v18), with CUDA acceleration utilized for the simulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Salomon-Ferrer et al., 2013</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Simulation analysis</title><p>System equilibration was monitored through RMSD calculations of backbone atom positions, and local flexibility was measured via the root mean-squared fluctuation (RMSF) of the backbone.

Archaeasome complexes (Arc207) were formed by mixing 207 bp DNA with HTkA histones at a 1:7 molar ratio of DNA to histone dimer in a buffer containing 100 mM KCl and 50 mM Tris (pH 8.0) and incubated for 20 min at room temperature. Samples were then dialyzed in buffers containing 0, 2, 5, 7, or 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> at a volume ratio of 1:1000 two times, first for 2 hr and then overnight, as preparation for subsequent measurements. As histone stocks are suspended in high glycerol, the dialysis process simultaneously served to effectively remove glycerol.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>SV-AUC</title><p>Sedimentation velocity analytical ultracentifugation (SV-AUC) measurements were conducted in absorbance mode (λ = 260 nm).

Partial specific volumes of the samples were determined using UltraScan3 (v4.0) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Demeler, 2005</xref>). Time and radially invariant noises were subtracted through two-dimensional sediment analysis (2DSA), and the final 2DSA model parameters were used to initialize genetic algorithm and Monte Carlo analyses. Sedimentation coefficients were determined using van Holde-Weischet analysis (in Svedberg units, corrected to solvent conditions of water at 20°C), and molecular weights and frictional ratios (f/f<sub>o</sub> - the degree of elongation/flexibility in comparison to ideal spherical particles) were determined from genetic algorithm analysis of SV-AUC traces. Theoretical f/f<sub>o</sub> values for modeled structures were derived using the SoMo plugin of UltraScan, where bead models were created through the ‘SoMo Overlap’ scheme and hydrodynamics were calculated with the ZENO algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brookes et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Douglas et al., 1994</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>CryoEM grid preparation and collection</title><p>After overnight dialysis (100 mM KCl, 50 mM Tris pH 8, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>), Arc207 samples were concentrated to 0.9 mg of DNA per mL, and 4 µL of sample was deposited onto glow-discharged grids (40 mA for 45 s). Samples were screened on copper Cflat (1.2/1.3) grids, and formaldehyde-cleaned Quantifoil (2/2) grids were used for final data collection in order to increase image acquisition speed through a ‘2 × 2’ collection scheme, where a single defocus level is used for a cluster of four grid holes. Each grid was manually plunge frozen in liquid ethane and stored in liquid nitrogen.

In total, 1,879,294 particles were predicted by crYOLO and extracted from the motion-corrected (non-denoised) micrographs using Relion and imported to CryoSparc (v2.12.4) for two-dimesional (2D) classification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Punjani et al., 2017</xref>). 2D classes were manually filtered to remove particles containing primarily noise or interactions with overlapping neighbor particles. Subsequent 2D classifications showed two predominant particle types: the ‘Class I’ archaeasome state characterized by tightly wound DNA, and the ‘Class II’ archaeasome state showing nucleosome-like DNA arrangements with distinct out-of-plane densities, forming ‘base’ and ‘lid’ subunits. These classes were then separated from one another for three-dimensional (3D) classification and refinement by CryoSparc. Class I density was refined through Bayesian Polishing of the contributing particles in Relion, but the Class II density saw no benefit from polishing and the CryoSparc-derived density is reported. Reconstructed volumes were deposited to the Electron Microscopy Data Bank (EMD-23403, EMD-23404).

This rigorous biophysical study provides important new insights into archaeal genome biology and will no doubt be of interest to the archaeal research community as well as the chromatin biology field in general.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Archaeal chromatin 'slinkies' are inherently dynamic complexes with deflected DNA wrapping pathways&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, including Sebastian Deindl as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Cynthia Wolberger as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Yamini Dalal (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential Revisions:</p><p>This is a very strong manuscript. Please consider the reviewers' recommendations and suggestions below by making the appropriate textual changes. No additional experiments are required.</p><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>It is not completely clear why the authors chose histones from <italic>Thermococcuskodakarensis</italic> for the experimental part of the work, while the previously published crystal structure and the simulations presented in this study used histones from <italic>Methanothermus fervidus</italic>. Can the authors comment more on this choice? Are the histones from one species are easier to express and purify than those from the other species? The text would benefit from a brief explanation, although this is not a concern for the validity of the study, given the high degree of sequence identity between these histones.</p><p>&quot;consistent with a systemic error&quot;</p><p>Do the authors mean &quot;systematic&quot; (as opposed to random) error?</p><p>In Table 2, is there a 95% confidence interval to report for sedimentation coefficients? If not, can the authors explain why?</p><p>&quot;A total of 1,879,294 particles were identified and classified according to a neural network trained on manual particle selections&quot;</p><p>This statement is a bit unclear. Is it particle picking that was performed using a neural network (crYOLO, as the Materials and methods section indicates), or is it the selection of good 2D class averages (which is also possible, using the program Cindirella from the same authors who make crYOLO)? If the former, I suggest mentioning the neural network before the classification procedure; this sentence as written now could be understood as if a neural network was used to select good 2D class averages (which is not what the Materials and methods section explains).</p><p>&quot;Refinement of these densities yielded maps at 9.5 Å and 11.5 Å resolution for the closed and open forms, respectively (Figure 6E, F).&quot;</p><p>There is no panel F in Figure 6. Earlier references to Figure 6 in the same paragraph also seem to be off by one panel.</p><p>&quot;Even though Arc207 (207 base pairs of DNA bound to 7 histone dimers) were deposited on the grid, our refined density of the closed state describes only 150 base pairs of DNA and 5 histone dimers&quot;</p><p>Is it possible that what the authors call the closed conformation is in fact the &quot;base&quot; of an open conformation, and that this reconstruction was obtained from truly open particles in which the &quot;lid&quot; was more dynamic and therefore not resolved? This would explain the missing molecular weight in this reconstruction. This possibility does not change the main conclusion that archaeasomes are dynamic, but it could change the way the 90 degrees open state is seen: it could correspond to an intermediate between the fully open and fully closed conformations, with the &quot;lid&quot; resolved because it is more stable than in the majority of the particles, that are fully open states in which the &quot;lid&quot; cannot be resolved, and the dataset may not contain many (any?) truly closed particles (which one would expect to yield a reconstruction showing all 207 base pairs of DNA and 7 copies of the histone dimer). The authors should comment on this.</p><p>&quot;Close inspection of the &quot;closed state&quot; two-dimensional classes indeed shows additional out-of-plane density that is consistent with the missing two dimers and ~60 base pairs of DNA, albeit at low contrast relative to background (Figure 7C)&quot;</p><p>There is no Figure 7. This statement likely refers to Figure 6C.</p><p>&quot;Archaeasome compaction can be stabilized with divalent cations. In absence of archaeal ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling factors (large machines that regulate chromatin access in eukaryotes), this architecture provides an alternative mechanism for compacting chromatin and adjusting genome accessibility&quot;</p><p>There are several examples of regulatory mechanisms for chromatin remodeling in eukaryotes that involve domains which bind to specific histone post-translational modifications as a way to target remodeling activity, making it a mostly deterministic process (presence of a PTM causes recruitment of a remodeler). It is difficult to envision that any regulation mechanism in archaea could emerge from random conformational changes in their chromatin only. Is it definitely established from whole-genome sequencing that archaea do not have chromatin remodelers? Or could they have them, but these proteins have yet to be identified? Could the compaction induced by divalent cations be the main regulatory mechanism in vivo? (in which case membrane ion channels would also indirectly act as chromatin remodelers on a genome-wide scale by regulating intracellular concentrations of these ions?). The authors should consider discussing these points to enrich the Discussion section and potentially strengthen the connection between the their biophysical results and archaeal genome biology.</p><p>Materials and methods section, cryoEM grid preparation</p><p>The glow discharge conditions should be indicated.</p><p>&quot;a Gatan K3 camera at 29,000x magnification in non-super resolution mode&quot;</p><p>This mode can be called &quot;counting mode&quot;.</p><p>&quot;dosage rate of ~1 e/Å, and 50 frames per micrograph stack&quot;</p><p>The dose rate's unit is e/Å2/s, unless the authors are referring to the dose per frame (in which case it should be clarified). In addition, the total dose accumulated over the entire exposure time should be indicated.</p><p>When first mentioning the Widom 601 sequence, the authors should cite (Lowary and Widom, 1998).</p><p>&quot;Gel shift assays showed that full complex saturation occurs when DNA and histones are mixed at the previously reported stoichiometric limit&quot;</p><p>This statement should cite an adequate reference.</p><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>It would be nice if they could include the rationale to study dimer-dimer and dimer-DNA interactions by MD using 90 bp, 120 bp and 180 bp.</p><p>A MNase ladder is mentioned, but no citation or figure is referenced, please add the MNase ladder.</p><p>The authors very nicely show that Mg<sup>2+</sup> does not impact archaeasome oligomerization, how does salt concentration impact oligomerization?</p><p>The authors mention that particles that interacted with neighboring particles were not used in the analysis. We are curious whether these particles would more closely resemble what would happen in cells where this is higher density (one presumes) of chromatin?</p><p>What was the distribution of the angle of the open conformation found for the archaeasome?</p><p>It would be interesting and timely if the authors could discuss their results in light of the recent publication of the archaea genome organization by Takemata and Bell, 2020.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.65587.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential Revisions:</p><p>This is a very strong manuscript.

This would explain the missing molecular weight in this reconstruction. This possibility does not change the main conclusion that archaeasomes are dynamic, but it could change the way the 90 degrees open state is seen: it could correspond to an intermediate between the fully open and fully closed conformations, with the &quot;lid&quot; resolved because it is more stable than in the majority of the particles, that are fully open states in which the &quot;lid&quot; cannot be resolved, and the dataset may not contain many (any?) truly closed particles (which one would expect to yield a reconstruction showing all 207 base pairs of DNA and 7 copies of the histone dimer). The authors should comment on this.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for bringing this up. We agree that the description of “closed” vs “open” states in our Arc207 dataset is a somewhat misleading description of the structure, as the “closed” structure is indeed a 5-mer “base” with an unresolved “lid”. Our 2D classification supports this notion – Figure 6B shows a faint density that is consistent with two dimers and DNA in the side-view classes. Unfortunately, neither additional 2D classifications nor expanding the number of requested classes (all done in the past two weeks) allowed better resolution of this faint density. However, additional 3D classifications allowed us to resolve more density. While the quality of this density is quite poor, due to a drastically reduced particle count, its presence supports the conclusion that the same deflected wrapping pathway consists for both states. To illustrate this, an additional supplemental video (Video 10) and supplemental figure (Figure 6—figure supplement 2) have been added to the manuscript. We have also modified the manuscript to no longer refer to “open” and “closed” conformations, but rather use the neutral terms “Class I” and “Class II” for the former closed and open forms</p><p>“A total of 1,879,294 particles were identified according to a neural network trained on manual particle selections and then classified. The two-dimensional classes of this dataset identifies two different populations of Arc207: one in which the classical “nucleosome-like” fold is observed (Figure 6B), and another in which two perpendicular DNA wrappings are clearly observed (Figure 6C).”</p><p>“To confirm that the structures described by the EM densities also exist in solution, and to correlate these findings with our SV-AUC analyses of particle compaction, we utilized the SoMo plugin of UltraScan to calculate sedimentation properties from our derived models. For the fully resolved Arc207 model, with the Arc90 “lid” bending ~90<sup>o</sup> from the Arc120 “core”, we calculate a frictional ratio of 1.53, in close agreement with the 1.55 value extracted from the experimental traces. For the particles that can be fit with five histone dimers and 150 bp DNA (Class I), we surmised that the remaining 60 base pairs of DNA (and two histone dimers) extend from the observed density but assume variable orientations with respect to the main particle resulting in very weak density. Close inspection of the two-dimensional classes in this category indeed shows additional out-of-plane density that is consistent with the missing two dimers and ~60 base pairs of DNA, albeit at low contrast relative to background (Figure 6B). Further three-dimensional classifications of the 9.5 Å density reduced the overall resolution but yielded indications of the missing volume, albeit at low fidelity (Figure 6—figure supplement 2 ). To further model this particle, we extended the Arc150 structure with an additional Arc60 subunit positioned 90<sup>o</sup> out-of-plane, similar to the model derived for the fully observed Arc207 density. This model predicted a similar value for the frictional coefficient of 1.50. In contrast, models with continuous wrapping and no deflections in the DNA pathway (as observed in the crystal structure, but not populated significantly in the cryo EM images) yield a frictional coefficient of 1.36. These data together show that archaeasomes on an extended DNA fragment can be viewed as a distribution of archaeasome subunits that can open up to a ~90<sup>o</sup> angle between them.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>&quot;Close inspection of the &quot;closed state&quot; two-dimensional classes indeed shows additional out-of-plane density that is consistent with the missing two dimers and ~60 base pairs of DNA, albeit at low contrast relative to background (Figure 7C)&quot;</p><p>There is no Figure 7.

In absence of archaeal ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling factors (large machines that regulate chromatin access in eukaryotes), this architecture provides an alternative mechanism for compacting chromatin and adjusting genome accessibility&quot;</p><p>There are several examples of regulatory mechanisms for chromatin remodeling in eukaryotes that involve domains which bind to specific histone post-translational modifications as a way to target remodeling activity, making it a mostly deterministic process (presence of a PTM causes recruitment of a remodeler). It is difficult to envision that any regulation mechanism in archaea could emerge from random conformational changes in their chromatin only. Is it definitely established from whole-genome sequencing that archaea do not have chromatin remodelers? Or could they have them, but these proteins have yet to be identified? Could the compaction induced by divalent cations be the main regulatory mechanism in vivo? (in which case membrane ion channels would also indirectly act as chromatin remodelers on a genome-wide scale by regulating intracellular concentrations of these ions?). The authors should consider discussing these points to enrich the Discussion section and potentially strengthen the connection between the their biophysical results and archaeal genome biology.</p></disp-quote><p>To date, there has not been conclusive evidence that archaeal histones are post-translationallly modified to any significant extent, and furthermore there are no histone tails to be modified. It is quite possible that the absence of ATP-dependent remodelers in archaea may be due to unsampled sequences or limited homology to eukaryotic machinery. We have modified our closing paragraph to expand this conversation. Regarding membrane pumps working as “indirect remodelers”, this is altogether possible, but we are afraid to “over-reach” in the discussion if we bring this up, as it is not known that Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentrations vary in archaea. However, we hope that our findings here might encourage cell biologists to investigate Mg<sup>2+</sup>-regulation within <italic>T. kodakarensis</italic> and other archaea. We modified the text as follows:</p><p>“In eukaryotes, navigation of polymerases through chromatin is assisted by histone chaperones and ATP-dependent remodeling factors (33–35), but no known homologs to these complexes have been identified as yet in archaea. In the absence of remodelers, the inherent dynamics of archaeasome-based chromatin may thereby allow limited access to chromatin by the sporadic (and possibly stochastic) appearance of near-zero linker DNA and Arc60 or Arc90 substates. On the other hand, it is altogether possible that genes encoding chromatin remodelers are yet to be found. Genes relevant to chromatin organization continue to be identified in archaea, such as the “SMC-like” coalescin in the histone-less archaeon <italic>Sulfolobus</italic> (36), and the access of these yet unindentified “hidden agents” would similarly be tuned by the dynamics of the archaeasome. The degree to which DNA rigidity, variant histones, or unknown histone- and DNA-binding proteins regulate chromatin accessibility is an exciting future area of research.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Materials and methods section, cryoEM grid preparation</p><p>The glow discharge conditions should be indicated.</p></disp-quote><p>These have been updated in the Materials and methods section (40 mA for 45 seconds).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>&quot;a Gatan K3 camera at 29,000x magnification in non-super resolution mode&quot;</p><p>This mode can be called &quot;counting mode&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>We have altered our text to refer to this as “counting mode”, as suggested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>&quot;dosage rate of ~1 e/Å, and 50 frames per micrograph stack&quot;</p><p>The dose rate's unit is e/Å2/s, unless the authors are referring to the dose per frame (in which case it should be clarified).

As for the choice of 120 bp and 180 bp, these systems provide two different data points, in terms of archaeasome size (and number of L1-L1 interactions, consequently). In theory, we could have simulated archaeasomes of a varying number of sizes, even beyond 200 bp. However, the efficiency of an MD simulation scales non-linearly with the total number of atoms, and we believe that the additional computational time required to simulate larger systems would not provide any further information than what would be provided by our Arc180 system with multiple L1-stacking interactions. We have updated our Materials and methods section in an attempt to concisely explain these system choices:</p><p>“The Arc90 system represents the “fundamental unit” of archaeasome-based chromatin, as it is the crystallographic unit of the solved structure as well as the smallest DNA protection footprint observed by MNase digestion (17).

Our identification of a similar 90<sup>o</sup> out-of-plane density classified deep within what we now refer to as “Class I” suggest that they may exhibit appreciable dynamics (as shown by the largely smeared electron density), potentially depending on the relative sizes of the attached archaeasome subunits, but we unfortunately cannot (as of yet) state the range of angles available between them without overinterpreting the statistical power of our data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It would be interesting and timely if the authors could discuss their results in light of the recent publication of the archaea genome organization by Takemata and Bell, 2020.</p></disp-quote><p>The concept of chromosome compartmentalization is indeed an intriguing one.

While the sequence of the “coalescin” protein that they have characterized is present with high identity in many different branches in archaea (determined via a blast alignment that we conducted), the generality of this compartmentalization is not well understood outside of Sulfolobus. As a result, we cannot conclusively extrapolate the roles or restrictions of archaeasomes in the context of this compartmentalization, as it has not yet been reported in <italic>T. kodakarensis</italic> or other similar archaeons.
