system is a robust genome editing technology that works in human cells, animals and plants based on the RNA-programmed DNA cleaving activity of the Cas9 enzyme. Building on previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Jinek et al., 2013</xref>), we show here that new genetic information can be introduced site-specifically and with high efficiency by homology-directed repair (HDR) of Cas9-induced site-specific double-strand DNA breaks using timed delivery of Cas9-guide RNA ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes. Cas9 RNP-mediated HDR in HEK293T, human primary neonatal fibroblast and human embryonic stem cells was increased dramatically relative to experiments in unsynchronized cells, with rates of HDR up to 38% observed in HEK293T cells. Sequencing of on- and potential off-target sites showed that editing occurred with high fidelity, while cell mortality was minimized. This approach provides a simple and highly effective strategy for enhancing site-specific genome engineering in both transformed and primary human cells.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.04766.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04766.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>CRISPR/Cas9</kwd><kwd>genome engineering</kwd><kwd>homologous recombination</kwd><kwd>cell cycle synchronization</kwd><kwd>nocodazole</kwd><kwd>non-homologous end joining</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001021</institution-id><institution>Damon Runyon Cancer Research Foundation (Damon Runyon)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DRG2176-13</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lin</surname><given-names>Steven</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004337</institution-id><institution>Roche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Postdoctoral Fellowship, RPF311</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Staahl</surname><given-names>Brett T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Building on previous work (Jinek et al., 2013), we report a simple and robust system to achieve high fidelity and high efficiency (30% of homologous recombination) genome engineering by homology-directed repair pathway in human cells using cell cycle synchronization and timed delivery of Cas9 ribonucleoprotein complexes.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The CRISPR-associated enzyme Cas9 enables site-specific genome engineering by introducing double-strand breaks (DSB) at guide RNA-specified chromosomal loci of interest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cong et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Jinek et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Mali et al., 2013a</xref>). Cells repair DSBs using the non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) or homology-directed repair (HDR) pathways. The NHEJ pathway generates variable insertions or deletions (indels) at the DSB, while HDR employs homologous donor DNA sequences from sister chromatids, homologous chromosomes or exogenous DNA molecules to produce precise insertions, deletions or base substitutions at a DSB site or between two DSBs. Such precise modifications are desired for targeted genome engineering.</p><p>Although cells have differing abilities to repair DSBs using NHEJ or HDR, the phase of the cell cycle largely governs the choice of pathway. NHEJ dominates DNA repair during G1, S and G2 phases, whereas HDR is restricted to late S and G2 phases when DNA replication is completed and sister chromatids are available to serve as repair templates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Heyer et al., 2010</xref>). Impediments to HDR include competition with NHEJ in S and G2 phases and specific down-regulation of HDR at M phase and early G1 to prevent telomere fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Orthwein et al., 2014</xref>). Although chemical or genetic interruption of the NHEJ pathway can favor HDR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Shrivastav et al., 2008</xref>), such manipulations can be difficult to employ, harmful to cells or both. Consequently, high cleavage activity of programmable nucleases does not necessarily correlate with efficient HDR-induced genome editing.</p><p>Here we report a simple and robust approach that advances our previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Jinek et al., 2013</xref>) to enhance HDR efficiency in human cells. This strategy combines well-established cell cycle synchronization techniques with direct nucleofection of pre-assembled Cas9 ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes to achieve controlled nuclease action at the phase of the cell cycle best for HDR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). HEK293T, human primary neonatal fibroblast and H9 human embryonic stem cells demonstrated robust HDR-mediated genome editing at levels up to 38% with no detected off-target editing. These results establish a superior approach to Cas9-mediated human genome engineering that enables efficient mutation, repair and tagging of endogenous loci in a rapid and predictable manner.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04766.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The effect of cell cycle synchronization on total editing and homology-directed repair frequencies in HEK293T cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Experimental schematic of timed delivery of Cas9-guide RNA ribonucleoprotein (RNP) into human cells for genome editing.

Immediately after release we prepared 30-μl nucleofection reactions containing 2 × 10<sup>5</sup> cells, Cas9 RNP with sgRNA targeting EMX1 gene and a 183-nucleotide single-stranded oligonucleotide DNA (ssODNA) HDR template (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). After 24 hr, cells were analyzed for HDR (specifically, exogenous donor template mediated HDR) or total editing (TE, defined as the sum of all NHEJ and HDR events that give rise to indels) at the Cas9 cleavage site within EMX1, showing that both aphidicolin and nocodazole led to pronounced increases in Cas9-mediated editing frequencies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,E</xref>). The enhancement is more evident at lower Cas9 RNP concentration (30 ρmol), improving HDR rates from ∼9% in unsynchronized cells to ∼14% with aphidicolin and ∼20% with nocodazole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). The highest HDR frequency achieved was 31% with nocodazole synchronization and 100 ρmol of Cas9 RNP. Importantly, 1 day after nocodazole release the synchronized cells were cycling like unsynchronized controls and appeared morphologically normal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>).</p><p>Next we determined systematically the dosage effect of Cas9 RNPs and HDR templates on HDR efficiency in control and nocodazole synchronized cells. At the EMX1 locus, we tested three concentrations of Cas9 RNP (10, 30 and 100 ρmol) in combination with three concentrations of HDR template (50, 100 and 200 ρmol in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). The overall frequencies of TE and HDR increased proportionally with increasing Cas9 RNP concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Synchronization increased the TE frequency twofold at 10 ρmol and 1.5-fold at 30 ρmol Cas9 RNP, but the enhancement diminished at 100 ρmol. The HDR frequency also increased dramatically with synchronization, especially at lower concentrations of Cas9 RNP, from undetectable to 9–15% at 10 ρmol of Cas9 RNP, and from 6–12% to 22–28% at 30 ρmol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). These results demonstrate that timed delivery of Cas9 RNP into M-phase synchronized HEK293T cells enhances HDR by several fold above the levels observed without synchronization.<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04766.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>The enhancement of TE and HDR at the EMX1, DYRK1 and CXCR4 loci by nocodazole synchronization in HEK293T cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The effect of nocodazole on the TE and HDR frequencies at EMX1 locus.

We assayed two ssODNA HDR templates spanning the same sequence but with different orientations: one identical to the target strand sequence (+strand) and the other its complement (−strand) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Both of these templates yielded comparable levels of HDR. Strikingly, nocodazole synchronization enhanced the TE frequencies more than twofold and HDR frequencies over sixfold at all doses of Cas9 RNP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Moreover, nocodazole synchronization reduced the requirement for high Cas9 RNP concentrations, producing 5–6% HDR at 10 ρmol of Cas9; 10-fold more Cas9 RNP was required to achieve the same HDR frequency in unsynchronized cells.</p><p>We also programmed Cas9 RNPs to target the CXCR4 gene, a chemokine receptor implicated in HIV entry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Feng et al., 1996</xref>) and cancer metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Murphy, 2001</xref>). The HDR template used in these experiments was a ssODNA oriented complementary (−strand) to the target strand, containing HindIII and BamHI restriction sites flanked by 90 nt homology arms. The enhancement in TE and HDR frequencies at CXCR4 was comparable to those observed for the DYRK1 target site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). The most significant increase was again observed at 10 and 30 ρmol of Cas9 RNP, yielding nearly five and twofold increases, respectively. In this case, nocodazole synchronization yielded 27% HDR at 10 ρmol of Cas9 RNP. A comparable level of HDR in the unsynchronized cells would require 100 ρmol of RNP. Collectively, the results from EMX1, DYRK1 and CXCR4 loci demonstrate that nocodazole synchronization is a highly effective and broadly applicable method to enhance the TE and HDR frequencies in HEK293T cells.</p><p>Off-target editing increases with increasing nucleic acid-based delivery of Cas9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Fu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Hsu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Pattanayak et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Mali et al., 2013b</xref>). We reasoned that the short-lived Cas9 RNP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kim et al., 2014</xref>) and timed delivery would minimize off-target editing and that potential toxicity might be minimized by using lower RNP amounts. We compared the TE and HDR frequencies at the EMX1 and DYRK1 target loci to those occurring at the top two predicted off-target loci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Hsu et al., 2013</xref>) respectively by deep sequencing a representative biological replicate experiment from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>. Importantly, no off-target editing was detected above background levels under all conditions, and increasing RNP dosage had no effect on off-target editing. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>, the TE (indels/total reads) and HDR (HDR/total reads) frequencies at EMX1 and DYRK1 increased with RNP dosage in both cell conditions. Most importantly, there was no detectable HDR at the off-target loci. Overall, the TE and HDR frequencies detected by deep sequencing were comparable to our previous gel densitometry results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>). The deep sequencing analysis also allowed us to determine the ratio of Cas9-induced DSBs being repaired by the NHEJ vs HDR pathway (HDR/TE reads). Although nocodazole synchronization increased the HDR/TE ratio by twofold at the EMX1 locus and fivefold at the DYRK1 locus, this ratio reached a maximum value of ∼33% across all RNP doses, suggesting that the maximum capacity of the HDR machinery in HEK293T cells is to repair ∼33% of DSBs. A panel of representative indels is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>.</p><p>To examine the length of HDR template homology sequences required for Cas9-mediated HDR, we tested four single-stranded and two double-stranded HDR templates for EMX1 bearing homology arms ranging from 30 to 250 nt in length (template 2–7 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). To avoid signal saturation and better distinguish the HDR frequencies of different templates, we reduced the Cas9 RNP and HDR template concentrations to 30 ρmol and 50 ρmol, respectively. As observed previously, nocodazole synchronization produced higher HDR frequencies than observed in the unsynchronized cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). In addition to the unsynchronized and nocodazole synchronized conditions, we included a third condition in which aphidicolin, an S-phase blocker, was added to the nocodazole synchronized cells immediately after nucleofection. We hypothesized that the aphidicolin-blocked cells would show reduced HDR frequency due to the inability to enter S phase where HDR is thought to be most active. As expected, the aphidicolin block significantly reduced the HDR frequency, supporting the conclusion that cells need to proceed through S phase, and possibly G2 as well, for highly efficient HDR.<fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04766.006</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Systematic investigation of DNA templates for efficient HDR at the EMX1 locus in HEK293T cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Segment of human EMX1 exon 3 shows the 20 nt target sequence (highlighted in blue), the TGG PAM region (in red) and the Cas9 cleavage site at three bases upstream from PAM.

In addition the unsynchronized and nocodazole synchronized conditions, the cells were synchronized with nocodazole prior to nucleofection, and immediately post nucleofection, a single dose of aphidicolin (2 μg/ml) was added to the growth media to prevent the transfected cells from proceeding into the S phase. The purpose was to test whether blocking passage through S phase reduces HDR efficiency, since the HDR pathway is thought to be most active during S phase. This one-time addition of aphidicolin is labeled as ‘Aph block’ in the third panel, as opposed to the standard aphidicolin synchronization procedure used elsewhere in the manuscript. Thirty ρmol of Cas9 RNP and 50 ρmol of HDR template were used in the nucleofection reaction; the control reaction (C) contained no HDR template. The mean % HDR and standard deviation (error bar) was determined by HindIII digestion from three experiments. Representative gels from PCR and HDR analyses are shown for each cell condition. Templates 6 and 7 produced unusual banding patterns, making quantitation of DNA bands less accurate (labeled by asterisk).</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.04766.006">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04766.006</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-04766-fig3-v2.tif"/></fig></p><p>DNA molecules with at least 60 nt of sequence homology flanking the Cas9 cleavage site were sufficient for highly efficient HDR of ∼19% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Further extension of the homology arms to 90 nt increased the HDR frequency only slightly (∼20–23%). Both (+) and (−) template orientations were similarly effective, as also observed in the DYRK1 experiment. When double-stranded templates 6 and 7 were used, HDR frequencies were reduced to 7%. Moreover, unusual banding patterns in the HindIII HDR assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) implied the presence of a concatemerized HDR template or non-specific recombination products, at least with short sequences as employed here.</p><p>To expand our findings on the cell cycle synchronization method to other cell types, we targeted the EMX1 gene in human primary neonatal fibroblasts (neoFB) and H9 human embryonic stem (hES) cells. These cell types are challenging to transfect and typically show low levels of homologous recombination. To determine the cell cycle phase that is optimal for HDR in neoFB cells, we used the same six chemical inhibitors to synchronize neoFB cells at G1, S and M phases of the cell cycle, followed by release prior to nucleofection with Cas9 RNP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Cell cycle synchronization was confirmed by FACS analysis, and cells in all conditions appeared morphologically normal. Aphidicolin-synchronized cells progressed normally through the cell cycle following release from cell cycle block (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). In contrast to HEK293T cells, enhancement in TE and HDR frequencies was observed with aphidicolin and thymidine treatments, which synchronize the cells at S phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). The TE frequencies were 17% and 13% with aphidicolin and thymidine respectively, as opposed to 5% in the unsynchronized condition. However, HDR frequency was very low across all conditions and was not detected in the unsynchronized cells. With aphidicolin synchronization, 0.6% and 1.3% HDR were detected at 30 and 100 ρmol Cas9 RNP respectively.<fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04766.007</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>The enhancement of TE and HDR frequencies at the EMX1 locus by cell cycle synchronization in human primary neonatal fibroblast and embryonic stem cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Screening of cell cycle inhibitors for enhancement of TE and HDR frequencies in human primary neonatal fibroblast cells.

Previous reports have shown ∼20% NHEJ with transfection of Cas9 RNPs but didn't analyze HDR rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kim et al., 2014</xref>). Also, HDR frequencies are low with nucleic acid-based delivery of Cas9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Hsu et al., 2013</xref>). Screening of chemical inhibitors showed that only nocodazole synchronization enhanced TE frequencies in hES cells to 9% at 30 ρmol and 28–31% at 100 ρmol Cas9 RNP; however, we did not detect HDR with the HDR template (−) sense strand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). In light of these observations, we modified a protocol from Pauklin et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Pauklin and Vallier, 2013</xref>), in which the cells were treated with nocodazole for 16 hr, washed to remove the drug, and then treated with aphidicolin for 3 hr before nucleofection. Using this approach, we detected ∼2% of HDR at 100 ρmol Cas9 RNP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Cell synchronization was confirmed by FACS analysis. 3 days after release from cell cycle synchronization the hES cell cycle behavior was indistinguishable from unsynchronized control cultures, with no apparent changes in colony morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>); all colonies expressed high levels of alkaline phosphatase, a marker for pluripotency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). ROCK apoptosis inhibitor (10 μM) was required for survival of synchronized H9 ESCs after release when cultured at low density but not when cultured at high density. These results suggest that different cell types will have distinct requirements for synchronization to enhance Cas9 RNP-induced DNA repair. Also, it may be possible to find conditions that will enable even higher levels of HDR in neoFB and hES cells using Cas9 RNP delivery.</p></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Here we report a simple and robust system to enhance genome engineering by HDR in human cells using cell cycle synchronization and timed delivery of Cas9 ribonucleoprotein complexes. Advantages of this approach include no detectable off-target editing, timed introduction of pre-assembled editing complexes into cells and simultaneous transfection of multiple Cas9 RNPs and donor DNAs. In addition, Cas9 RNP-mediated editing begins within 4 hr of delivery and is largely completed within 24 hr due to RNP degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kim et al., 2014</xref>). Furthermore, higher cell viability has been observed following RNP transfection compared with DNA transfection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kim et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24a">Zuris et al., 2014</xref>). These features enable robust levels of on-target editing while reducing off-target effects.</p><p>Using this system, we have maximized the efficiency of HDR such that ∼33% of detected DSB repair events occur with homologous recombination of donor DNA. We chose the EMX1 target sequence to compare with published results using nucleic acid delivery, for which 10% HDR efficiency was reported in HEK293T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ran et al., 2013</xref>). Our results are also significantly higher than reported rates of HDR in synchronized HCT116 cells using Transcription Activator-Like Effector Nucleases (TALENs) and higher than typically observed using nucleic acid-based delivery of Cas9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Rivera-Torres et al., 2014</xref>). (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Hsu et al., 2013</xref>). Further increase of HDR efficiency beyond 33% will likely require manipulation of the proteins involved in the HDR or NHEJ pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Humbert et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>It is surprising that nocodazole treatment leads to higher HDR efficiency at reduced dosage of Cas9 RNPs. Nocodazole blocks cells at M phase when the DNA is fully replicated and the nuclear membrane is broken down. One explanation may be that delivery of Cas9 RNPs into a nocodazole-synchronized cell effectively targets two cells because they divide upon release. Another possibility is that once the nuclear envelope is broken down, Cas9 RNPs can gain easy access to the DNA. The resulting high HDR frequencies without off-target editing provide an important advance for generating scar-less genetic modifications, including epitope-tagged alleles, reporter genes, precise insertions and deletions and point mutations. Together these results expand the utility of CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome engineering in human cells and provide a foundation for further advances using Cas9 RNP delivery methods.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell lines and cell culture</title><p>DMEM media, non-essential amino acid, penicillin-streptomycin, E8 media, DPBS and 0.05% trypsin were purchased from Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA.

HDR frequency was calculated as either 100 x #HDR reads/(#indel reads + #non-indel reads).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Detlef Weigel (Senior editor) and 2 reviewers, whose detailed comments are attached at the bottom of this email. All three discussed their comments before we reached this decision. The following comments will help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>While an effect of the cell cycle on gene targeting has been shown before, this is the first such demonstration for the CRISPR/Cas9 system, and the overall agreement was that it is an important extension of your previous study that will be of great utility to the community at large. Before we can accept the paper for publication, we ask that you specifically address the following three major concerns:</p><p>1) Characterize in more detail the effects of the cell cycle inhibitors on HEK293T and H9 ES cells, and of nucleofection versus DNA transfection.</p><p>2) Preferably add information on other cell lines (or clearly state caveat that different optimization might be needed for each cell line, including nucleofection efficiencies).</p><p>3) Demonstrate the superiority of the method over the conventional approach by targeting additional sites in the genome.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The CRISPR/Cas9 system is by now a widely used system for site-directed genome editing. Upon site directed cleavage by an RNA-guided CRISPR/Cas9 protein a double strand break (DSB) is introduced. The DSB can be sealed either by error-prone non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) or homology-directed repair (HDR). Typically NHEJ is strongly favored in cells and thus integration of desired DNA into a given genome location by HDR is difficult to achieve. Accordingly, people have tried in the past to identify experimental parameters that can be modified to increase HDR efficiency.</p><p>The article under review is very well written and the figures are well designed and clear. However, the Results section of this article contains many numbers. Maybe the authors can identify sections where they can make general statements rather than only listing all data points. The text in its current form is hard to read due to the excessive listing of data.</p><p>The manuscript under review focused on optimization of the experimental parameters of CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing in human cells to achieve higher HDR frequencies. The authors take advantage of the fact that the ratio of HDR versus NHEJ differs in different cell cycles. They use a set of chemicals that induce arrest within defined cell cycles. As mentioned by the authors, this idea has been used before in combination with TAL-effector based nucleases (TALENs) (Rivera-Torres , 2014, PLoS ONE 9: e96483). However, it seems that TALENs work is less efficient in combination with cell-cycle arresting chemicals as CRISPR/Cas9 nucleases. The judgment of the authors seems correct. Yet, the fact remains that the conceptual idea is not novel but has been published before.</p><p>In addition to the use of cell-cycle arresting chemicals, the authors tested other experimental parameters (e.g. concentration of CRISPR/Cas9, guide RNA and length of the HDR repair template) to improve HDR efficiency. In their studies, they identify various parameters like the CRISPR/Cas9 concentration, which significantly improve HDR efficiency. They also provide data indicating that experimental conditions that improve HDR do not cause increased off-target activity. I believe that the identified experimental conditions will be of use for the huge community of scientists that want to use the CRISPR/Cas9 system for HDR in human cells. Yet, while the improvements are typically significant they remain in most cases marginal. Furthermore, the authors did not test if the used chemicals will have non-desirable side-effects (e.g. high overall mutation rate, increased cell-death frequencies, etc.). I assume the cellular consequences that are linked to the use of these chemicals are in many cases known and thus should be tested experimentally. It should be straightforward to test at least the effect on viability of treated cells. I am convinced that these studies would increase the value of the studies.</p><p>I believe the article will be of use to a broad community. Yet, the article provides no fundamental or novel mechanistical insights, and even the central idea of using cell-cycle arresting chemicals is not conceptually novel. In sum, a useful article for applied biotech but no news for fundamental biology.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The CRISPR/Cas9 system is rapidly revolutionizing the field of genome engineering, allowing researchers to manipulate both coding and non-coding genomic sequences at will in a constantly growing number of biological systems. This system creates double-strand breaks (DSBs) at target loci, which can be repaired through one of two cellular mechanisms: non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) or homology-directed repair (HDR). The ability of a cell to repair a DSB generated by Cas9 through HDR-mediated incorporation of exogenous DNA templates has recently been exploited to engineer several modifications to endogenous loci, such as novel knock-in alleles, point mutations and fluorescent tags, among others. However, the frequency of NHEJ is usually higher than HDR due to the fact that NHEJ does not require any homologous or exogenous DNA molecules to repair the DSB. Therefore, developing experimental methods that increase the frequency of HDR is important in order for this technology to fulfill its full potential in various laboratory studies as well as in clinical applications.</p><p>Lin et al. have addressed whether cell cycle synchronization might affect the relative use of these two repair pathways in an effort to define conditions that lead to more efficient HDR. The authors tested whether reversible treatment of cells with drugs reported to arrest cells in the S and late G2 cell cycle phases could increase the rate of HDR when combined with timed delivery of Cas9-sgRNA ribonucleoprotein complexes (RNPs) and various exogenous DNA templates. Using six pharmacological agents and further narrowing the list down to two (nocodazole, which is reported to block cells at late G2/M phase, and aphidicolin, which blocks cells at S phase), the authors convincingly demonstrate that these treatments, coupled with timed delivery of Cas9 RNPs and exogenous DNA templates, significantly increased the rate of HDR across two loci in two different cell types. Importantly, they also convincingly demonstrate that off-target editing is negligible using this approach.</p><p>This is a significant extension of this groups previous efforts aimed at establishing the CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing system in mammalian cells for inducing both NHEJ and HDR at specific genomic loci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Jinek et al., 2013</xref>). The ability to increase the rate of HDR through cell synchronization coupled with timed delivery of Cas9 RNPs will undoubtedly have a significant impact in the field of genome editing, particularly for applications aimed at engineering specific mutations of interest into a variety of cell types, such as human ES and iPS cells.</p><p><italic>Major comments:</italic></p><p>1) The key observation here is that cells treated and released from different chemical inhibitors of cell cycle progression undergo increased CRISPR/Cas9-mediated HDR compared to untreated cells. While this is clearly shown, the cell cycle effects that are associated with this treatment are not well characterized. Although the drugs employed are commonly used in the field, it is important to characterize them in the particular cell lines studied. The authors show cell cycle analysis in of HEK293T cells in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–figure supplement 1</xref>. However, for both nocodazole and aphidicolin treatment, the data appear to show significant 2n as well as 4n peaks. Thus, it is unclear what cell cycle phase might be associated with the increased HDR observed following release from these treatments. Regarding the experiments with H9 human ES cells, in which a combination of nocodazole and aphidicolin was used, there is no cell cycle analysis shown at all. It will be important to address both of these issues prior to publication.</p><p>2) With the exception of the experiments presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> using the H9 cells, most of the experiments were carried out with HEK293T cells, which are readily transfectable with nucleofection methods. Importantly, the rate of HDR reported was significantly lower in drug-treated H9 cells compared to drug-treated HEK293T cells. Moreover, induction of HDR in ES cells required a modification of the protocol to incorporate a 16-hour pulse of nocodazole followed by a 3-hour pulse of aphidicolin before Cas9 RNP nucleofection. One wonders how generalizable these methods will be to other cell types. Therefore, the manuscript would be strengthened with the addition of analysis of a panel of cell lines.</p><p>3) The authors should establish the baseline nucleofection efficiencies for the different cell lines tested. This will help clarify whether nucleofection efficiency many be a contributing factor in the difference seen between HEK293T cells and H9 cells.</p><p>4) It is unclear whether the other cell cycle inhibitors besides nocodazole shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–figure supplement 1</xref> were tested in ES cells. Minimally, this point should be clarified. If they were not tested, is there a reason why not?</p><p>5) Given the interest in targeting efficiencies as a function of target loci, it would be useful to extend this study to more than the two loci tested here.</p><p>6) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, the authors show that adding aphidicolin following release from a nocodazole block reduced HDR efficiency in HEK293T cells, suggesting that S-phase entry may be required for efficient HRD-mediated repair. They should show that this combined treatment actually did block S-phase entry in these experiments, especially given the odd cell cycle profiles shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–figure supplement 1</xref>. Also, how does this conclusion jibe with the increased efficiency of HDR in ES cells treated with this same combination when compared with nocodazole alone?</p><p>7) The authors argue in the Discussion that their approach of nucleofection of Cas9 RNPs leads to higher cell viability than DNA transfection-based methods. However, no data is shown to support this claim.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04766.010</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p><italic>The CRISPR/Cas9 system is by now a widely used system for site-directed genome editing.

First, we would like to emphasize that the enhancement in editing efficiency is not marginal. We chose to present the direct measure of %HDR, which is capped at 100%, instead of converting the percent readouts into percent increase. Although in some cases the enhancement may appear modest, these changes in %HDR could make a significant difference when deciding to proceed with single cell isolation to obtain homozygous clones.</p><p>Second, we now include cell cycle analysis of the HEK293T cells, fibroblasts and hES cells following release from cell cycle inhibitors in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–figure supplement 1</xref>. In all cases, synchronized cells rapidly return to a normal cell cycle. Viability of synchronized hES cells relative to unsynchronized cells when passaged and nucleofected was comparable when sub-cultured at high density, while viability was reduced when sub-cultured at low density. Survival of synchronized cells sub-cultured at low cell density required ROCK apoptosis inhibitor. Importantly, the hES colonies that formed from the synchronized cultures had no apparent changes in colony morphology; all colonies expressed high levels of alkaline phosphatase, a marker for pluripotency.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p><italic>The CRISPR/Cas9 system is rapidly revolutionizing the field of genome engineering, allowing researchers to manipulate both coding and non-coding genomic sequences at will in a constantly growing number of biological systems.

We also performed alkaline phosphatase assay to ensure the hES cells remain undifferentiated after synchronization. Regarding the HEK293T nocodazole cell cycle block, we have redone the cell cycle analysis and find that indeed the majority of cells are 4N. The same is true for primary fibroblasts and hES cells. Some 4N HEK293T cells are slipping through the M-phase checkpoint and initiating S-phase. This mitotic slippage phenomenon has been observed before in various cell lines treated with nocodazole and other anti-microtubule drugs (Riffell et al., 2009). No mitotic slippage was observed with nocodazole treatment of primary fibroblasts or the hES cells that have intact cell cycle checkpoint regulation.</p><p><italic>2) With the exception of the experiments presented in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2C</italic></xref> <italic>using the H9 cells, most of the experiments were carried out with HEK293T cells, which are readily transfectable with nucleofection methods.

We now include data for primary neonatal fibroblasts, a cell type with low transfection efficiency. In this cell type, we observed enhanced total editing and HDR with aphidicolin synchronization, in contrast to enhancement with nocodazole treatment as observed in HEK293T and hES cells. Although these findings indicate some variability according to cell type, the cell cycle synchronization procedure itself is often not generalizable across different cell types. Due to variations in physiology, growth rate and duration of cell cycle phases, one needs to determine and optimize the synchronization protocol empirically. Nonetheless, the results presented here establish the feasibility of timed delivery of Cas9 RNPs to enhance rates of site-specific genome editing by homology-directed repair.</p><p><italic>3) The authors should establish the baseline nucleofection efficiencies for the different cell lines tested.

In preliminary experiments, we tested hES cells with the six cell cycle inhibitors. The results were disappointing, with only nocodazole showing enhancement in total editing, but no HDR was detected. Therefore, we adopted a method described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Pauklin and Vallier (2013)</xref> in which hES cells were treated sequentially first with nocodazole for 16h and then pulsed with aphidicolin for 3h, prior to nucleofection. With this modification, higher levels of total editing and detectable HDR were observed.</p><p><italic>5) Given the interest in targeting efficiencies as a function of target loci, it would be useful to extend this study to more than the two loci tested here</italic>.</p><p>We now include new data showing the editing efficiency in the CXCR4 gene in HEK293T cells. Nocodazole synchronization led to markedly enhanced HDR efficiency. Similar to EMX1 and DYRK1, the most significant increase was observed for cells receiving a lower amount of Cas9 RNP. In this case, nocodazole synchronization yielded 27% HDR at 10 pmol of Cas9 RNP. A comparable level of HDR in the unsynchronized cells would require 100 pmol of RNP. Enhancement of HDR at three different loci demonstrates that this timed delivery of Cas9 RNP is a broadly applicable method in HEK293T cells.</p><p><italic>6) In</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figure 3B</italic></xref><italic>, the authors show that adding aphidicolin following release from a nocodazole block reduced HDR efficiency in HEK293T cells, suggesting that S-phase entry may be required for efficient HRD-mediated repair.

We thank the reviewer for pointing out the confusion and we have now clarified this point in the manuscript.</p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, third panel, HEK293T cells were synchronized with nocodazole prior to nucleofection. Immediately post nucleofection, one dose of aphidicolin was added to the growth media to prevent the transfected cells from proceeding into the S phase. The purpose was to reduce HDR efficiency, since the HDR pathway is thought to be most active during S phase. We labeled this one-time addition of aphidicolin “aphidicolin block” in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, as opposed to the standard aphidicolin synchronization procedure used elsewhere in the manuscript. The standard aphidicolin synchronization procedure involves treating the cells with the drug for 17h, releasing the cells for 7-8h, and then treating the cells again for another 17h. Such sequential treatment does not fit our experimental scheme, because cells were harvested 24h after nucleofection for analysis. The goal of this experiment was to demonstrate that aphidicolin reduced the HDR efficiency, instead of attempting to completely abolish the HDR. Our results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> second and third panels show that the HDR frequencies were indeed significantly reduced.</p><p>The hES cells in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> were treated differently. As described in the response above, we modified the standard one-drug synchronization procedure in the HEK293T experiments to incorporate two drugs for effective synchronization. We adopted a method described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Pauklin and Vallier (2013)</xref> in which hES cells were treated sequentially first with nocodazole for 16h and then pulsed with aphidicolin for 3h, prior to nucleofection. After nucleofection, hES cells were grown in inhibitor-free media.</p><p><italic>7) The authors argue in the Discussion that their approach of nucleofection of Cas9 RNPs leads to higher cell viability than DNA transfection-based methods. However, no data is shown to support this claim</italic>.</p><p>We have now cited two published papers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kim et al., 2014</xref>, and Zuris et al., 2014), both of which have investigated the cell viability between DNA- and RNP-based transfection methods.</p></body></sub-article></article>
