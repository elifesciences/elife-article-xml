Although the role of olfaction in host-plant seeking has been investigated in great detail in parasitoids and adult lepidopterans, the caterpillar olfactory system and its significance in tri-trophic interactions remain poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the olfactory system of <italic>Pieris brassicae</italic> caterpillars and the importance of olfactory information in the interactions among this herbivore, its host-plant <italic>Brassica oleracea</italic>, and its primary natural enemy <italic>Cotesia glomerata</italic>. To examine the role of olfaction, we utilized CRISPR/Cas9 to knockout (KO) the odorant receptor co-receptor (<italic>Orco</italic>). This KO impaired olfactory detection and primary processing in the brain. <italic>Orco</italic> KO caterpillars exhibited reduced weight and lost preference for their optimal food plants. Interestingly, the KO caterpillars also experienced reduced weight when challenged by the parasitoid <italic>C. glomerata</italic> whose ovipositor had been removed, and the mortality of the KO caterpillars under the attack of unmanipulated parasitoids increased. We then investigated the behavior of <italic>P. brassicae</italic> caterpillars in response to volatiles from plants attacked by conspecific caterpillars and volatiles from plants on which the caterpillars were themselves attacked by <italic>C. glomerata</italic>. After analyzing the volatile compounds involved in these interactions, we concluded that olfactory information enables caterpillars to locate suitable food sources more efficiently as well as to select enemy-free spaces. Our results reveal the crucial role of olfaction in caterpillar feeding and natural-enemy avoidance, highlighting the significance of chemoreceptor genes in shaping ecological interactions.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Many caterpillars are major pests in agriculture, feeding on a variety of crops. They constantly face threats from both predators and the toxic defenses of the plants they eat. While scientists have long studied how predators find their prey, much less is known about how prey – like caterpillars – manage to survive and defend themselves.</p><p>Plants have evolved various strategies to fend off insects. When attacked by herbivores, some plants release specific chemical signals known as herbivore-induced plant volatiles. These scents act as a distress call, attracting natural enemies of the herbivores, such as parasitoid wasps, which use the caterpillars for reproduction, killing the herbivores in the process.</p><p>In turn, caterpillars have evolved different defense strategies. They have a sophisticated sense of smell, which may help them detect not only the scent of host plants but also the presence of predators or other caterpillars nearby.</p><p>Despite how common and important caterpillars are in farming systems, it is still not fully understood how they choose where to feed or how they avoid being eaten. To explore this, Wang et al. studied how much caterpillars rely on their sense of smell to survive and find food.</p><p>In insects, the ability to smell relies on a group of sensory proteins, most of which need a key gene called <italic>Orco</italic> to function. Without this gene, an insect’s ability to smell is severely impaired. Wang et al. used a gene editing tool known as CRISPR/Cas9 to ‘turn off’ the <italic>Orco</italic> gene in caterpillars of the large cabbage white butterfly (<italic>Pieris brassicae</italic>), effectively disabling their sense of smell. The researchers then compared the development, survival performance, and behavioral preferences of these mutant caterpillars with normal ones.</p><p>This revealed that caterpillars without a working sense of smell gained less weight and were less successful at finding suitable food sources. They were also more likely to be killed by parasitoid wasps. Behavioral experiments showed that caterpillars with an intact <italic>Orco</italic> gene avoided plants where other caterpillars were under attack by detecting the warning signals in the air. In contrast, mutant caterpillars could not recognize these danger cues and were unable to find suitable host plants or select enemy-free spaces.</p><p>The study of Wang et al. shows that caterpillars use smell not only to find food, but also to avoid danger. These insights could help farmers develop new, environmentally friendly ways to manage pests. For example, by planting companion plants that produce specific scents, or by breeding crops that naturally repel pests, we might be able to steer caterpillars away from valuable crops without relying on chemical pesticides.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>insect larvae</kwd><kwd>natural enemy</kwd><kwd>olfaction</kwd><kwd>multitrophic interactions</kwd><kwd>Orco</kwd><kwd>host-plant selection</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004543</institution-id><institution>China Scholarship Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>China Scholarship Council grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Qi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003246</institution-id><institution>Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>016.Veni.192.116</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Haverkamp</surname><given-names>Alexander</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The sense of smell is crucial for insect larvae not only to find a suitable food source but also for finding safe spaces which are free of their natural enemies.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Chemoreception plays a critical role in the insect life cycle. For instance, insects exploit chemical cues to locate food plants, to find and select mates, to evaluate oviposition sites, and to avoid natural enemies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dicke and Grostal, 2001</xref>). Olfaction, a pivotal component of chemoreception, involves multiple processes in insects and has been extensively investigated in many species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Haverkamp et al., 2018</xref>), including its role in the interactions with conspecifics and natural enemies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kannan et al., 2022</xref>). Thus far, the study of olfaction in insects has largely centered upon imagos, the final life stage of insects. However, chemical information likely also plays an essential role in host-plant choice and natural-enemy avoidance during the immature life stage, which is especially pronounced in holometabolous insects. Nonetheless, the olfactory system in larval herbivores remains largely unexplored.</p><p>Tri-trophic interactions among plants, herbivores, and natural enemies have been widely investigated in the last few decades, and chemoreception is considered to play an important role in these systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Vet and Dicke, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Turlings and Erb, 2018</xref>). In particular, abundant research has demonstrated that olfactory information, such as plant volatiles, is crucial in the coevolution of herbivores and natural enemies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Turlings and Erb, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dicke and Baldwin, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Haverkamp and Smid, 2020</xref>). In addition to plant volatiles, chemicals emitted by the insects themselves also play an important role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Venugopal et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ebrahim et al., 2015</xref>). Under strong selection pressure from natural enemies, herbivores have developed several integrated avoidance strategies based on the detection of chemical cues. <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> fruit flies, for example, prefer to lay eggs on citrus fruits because the volatiles emitted by citrus are repellent to the endoparasitoid <italic>Leptopilina boulardi</italic>, a natural enemy of fruit fly larvae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dweck et al., 2013</xref>). Similarly, the brown planthopper <italic>Nilaparvata lugens</italic> deposits eggs on rice plants infested by the striped stem borer <italic>Chilo suppressalis</italic>, which is repellent to the egg parasitoid <italic>Anagrus nilaparvatae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hu et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Insect olfaction is dominated by two classes of olfactory receptor genes, odorant receptors (ORs) and ionotropic receptors (IRs). ORs detect the majority of volatiles in the insect habitat. In all ORs, the odorant receptor co-receptor (Orco) is required to form a functional ion channel in the membrane of the odorant receptor neurons (ORNs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sato et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wicher et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jones et al., 2005</xref>). Previous research indicates that silencing the <italic>Orco</italic> gene can lead to a severe olfaction deficiency, causing a loss of social behavior, impaired mating, and significantly reduced foraging behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Trible et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fandino et al., 2019</xref>). Previous reports have also clearly shown that adult insect behavior and neuronal development were greatly affected when <italic>Orco</italic> is knocked out (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Trible et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yan et al., 2017</xref>). Yet, potential changes in olfaction-deficient larvae remain largely unexplored, and little is known about how olfaction contributes to the co-adaptation of larvae and their natural enemies, especially in the larvae of non-model insects such as lepidopteran caterpillars.</p><p><italic>Pieris brassicae</italic> is a very common butterfly species that causes substantial agricultural production loss across Europe and the Indian subcontinent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Feltwell, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hasan and Ansari, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hasan and Shafiq Ansari, 2010</xref>). The butterflies utilize chemoreception to evaluate oviposition sites and host plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">van Loon et al., 1992a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">van Loon et al., 1992b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wang et al., 2023</xref>). The caterpillars also have a well-developed olfactory system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wang et al., 2024</xref>) and chemical communication has been demonstrated to be involved in the interaction between herbivores and their natural enemies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Stam et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dicke and Baldwin, 2010</xref>). Natural enemies such as parasitoid wasps are highly attracted to volatiles from cabbage plants infested by <italic>P. brassicae</italic> caterpillars (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mattiacci et al., 1994</xref>). <italic>P. brassicae</italic> caterpillars are thus under strong selection pressure from natural enemies, though caterpillars can defend themselves by spitting at natural enemies while being attacked (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Müller et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>To gain comprehensive insight into the role of olfaction in <italic>P. brassicae</italic>, and to understand the role of olfaction in their coevolution with natural enemies, we employed a well-established research system utilizing <italic>Brassica oleracea</italic> as host plants, <italic>P. brassicae</italic> caterpillars as herbivores and <italic>Cotesia glomerata</italic> parasitoid wasps as natural enemies. In this study, we knocked out <italic>Orco</italic> by CRISPR/Cas9 in <italic>P. brassicae</italic> to investigate how olfaction guides the host-plant choice and natural-enemy avoidance of this insect herbivore. The knockout (KO) was verified in caterpillars by staining Orco and glomeruli in larval antennae and the larval antennal center (LAC), respectively, and was further confirmed in butterflies by electrophysiological investigations. We also examined the egg-laying behavior of KO butterflies, which is the basis of establishing a homozygous KO insect colony for our subsequent studies. The development of caterpillars on cabbage plants was evaluated, and the performance of caterpillars under the threat of natural enemies was studied to investigate the ecological significance of larval olfaction in interacting with their natural enemies. The larval host-plant seeking behaviors were further evaluated to determine the importance of olfaction in locating food sources. Volatiles emitted by caterpillars and parasitoids were analyzed to identify candidate chemicals that might play a role in this interaction. Our study provides further knowledge on the olfactory system in insect herbivores and might help to clarify the ecological significance of olfaction in the interaction with their natural enemies.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>Orco</italic> KO and neuronal deficiency</title><p>To test for potential off-target regions of our sgRNAs, we searched these sequences against the <italic>P. brassicae</italic> genome to identify any such regions.

Furthermore, we did not find any developmental differences between wildtype (WT) animals and KO when caterpillars were raised on leaf discs in Petri dishes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) or in the hatching rate of fertilized WT and KO eggs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).

Infested host plants emit herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) and thereby attract natural enemies such as parasitoid wasps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mattiacci et al., 1994</xref>). While the role of adult herbivores’ olfaction in mediating these tri-trophic interactions has been investigated, the significance of caterpillar olfaction in tri-trophic interactions of plants, herbivores, and their natural enemies has remained largely underexplored. In this study, we severely impaired the olfaction of <italic>P. brassicae</italic> by knocking out <italic>Orco</italic> using CRISPR/Cas9 to investigate the ecological importance of olfaction in host-plant choice and enemy avoidance by <italic>P. brassicae</italic> larvae. The KO of olfaction was successful, as we did not find Orco proteins in the antennae of <italic>Orco</italic> KO caterpillars and showed an altered brain structure in the <italic>Orco</italic> KO caterpillars in comparison to WT caterpillars. Furthermore, the near-complete lack of response to odors by <italic>Orco</italic> KO butterfly antennae compared to WT confirms that olfaction was largely lost. Intriguingly, although mating and oviposition were significantly reduced, KO butterflies still produce some homozygous offspring. After this characterization of our mutant line, we aimed to test the role of larval olfaction in a multitrophic framework. We found that the loss of olfaction had a significant effect on the foraging behavior of the caterpillars, which exhibited a reduced growth rate and a greater vulnerability to the parasitoid wasp <italic>C. glomerata</italic>.</p><p>The perception of chemical cues is mediated by the chemosensory signal transduction in insect antennae and further processing of the information in the brain. In <italic>P. brassicae</italic> KO caterpillar antennae, no Orco protein was detected, and chemical signals can therefore not be converted into electrical signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sato et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wicher et al., 2008</xref>). Interestingly, the non-functional Orco decreased the number of glomeruli in the LAC, indicating that Orco is likely to play a role in the glomerular organization of the LAC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–I</xref>). Similar changes have been reported for adult insects of a few hymenopteran species: the ants <italic>Harpegnathos saltator</italic> and <italic>Ooceraea biroi</italic> and the honeybee <italic>Apis mellifera</italic>, where the number and total size of glomeruli decreased while the volume of individual glomeruli increased in <italic>Orco</italic> KO mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Trible et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2021</xref>). In contrast, the antennal lobe morphology of <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> was not significantly changed when <italic>Orco</italic> was knocked out (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Larsson et al., 2004</xref>). In Lepidoptera, the size and number of glomeruli in <italic>Helicoverpa armigera</italic> were found to be comparable between WT and KO adult moths without any significant difference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fan et al., 2022</xref>). However, silencing the pheromone receptor, <italic>SlitOR5</italic>, led to a decreased size of a glomerulus in the adult moth <italic>Spodoptera littoralis</italic>, and knocking out <italic>Orco</italic> also led to a reduced size of OR-related glomeruli in adult <italic>Manduca sexta</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Koutroumpa et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fandino et al., 2019</xref>). The loss of olfactory glomeruli in the caterpillar might, therefore, either indicate that the formation of glomeruli in the embryo is mediated by a different mechanism than during pupation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Oland and Tolbert, 2011</xref>), or that the loss of neuronal activity reduces axonal innervations and thereby the size of the glomeruli to an extent that they could no longer be visualized by our method. However, the mechanism of glomerular formation and the roles that olfactory genes play in this process need to be further investigated in both immature and adult insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Williams et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>The role of olfaction in the behavioral ecology of adult insects has already been studied in quite some detail, and silencing <italic>Orco</italic> has been an important tool for unraveling the importance of chemical communication in adults of various insect species. For instance, in <italic>Orco</italic> KO adults of several insect species, there was a significant reduction in the electrophysiological responses to volatile chemicals such as alcohols and esters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fandino et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sun et al., 2020</xref>). Consequently, <italic>Orco</italic> mutants exhibited notable changes in host-plant location and severely reduced fecundity due to impaired pheromone perception and mating, which also resulted in significantly reduced egg-laying behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fan et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fandino et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Liu et al., 2023</xref>). Similar to other species, <italic>Orco</italic> KO <italic>P. brassicae</italic> butterflies exhibited a loss of electrophysiological responses to most plant volatiles we tested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fan et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sun et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J, K</xref>), and the mating behavior of <italic>P. brassicae Orco</italic> KO butterflies was also disrupted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). However, we observed some differences: <italic>P. brassicae Orco</italic> KO butterflies were still able to mate to a limited degree (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Whereas <italic>Orco</italic> KO adults in some other insect species did not exhibit any mating behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fandino et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fan et al., 2022</xref>). This finding suggests that additional sensory systems beyond olfaction, such as vision, may be involved in the mating processes of this day-active butterfly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Carpenter and Sparks, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Obara et al., 2008</xref>). Interestingly, while many <italic>P. brassicae</italic> butterflies with impaired olfaction failed to mate, several KO butterflies still mated and deposited fertilized eggs when the oviposition substrate was supplied in our laboratory setting. The mated <italic>Orco</italic> KO butterflies laid a comparable number of fertilized eggs on cabbage plants to WT butterflies, which is in line with the results from different moth species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fandino et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fan et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sun et al., 2023</xref>), suggesting oviposition decisions are mostly guided by non-volatile compounds when no host-plant location is required (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">van Loon et al., 1992a</xref>). Furthermore, the hatching rate of eggs laid by mated <italic>Orco</italic> KO butterflies was similar to that of WT butterflies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>), indicating that the reduced fecundity in these insects is primarily due to impaired mating behavior and reduced mating frequency, which may result from a lack of pheromonal communication.</p><p>When directly placed on their host plant, we found that WT caterpillars gained more weight than <italic>Orco</italic> KO caterpillars (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). We speculate that olfaction is needed to evaluate plant tissues and to select different leaves or leaf parts in order to feed efficiently, even when the caterpillar is already on the plant. Secondary metabolites are often unevenly distributed even within a single leaf, and these concentration differences have been shown to influence the performance of different caterpillars (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kester et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yuan et al., 2022</xref>). It is conceivable that these localized differences in plant secondary metabolites are also detectable by the herbivore through its olfactory system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hanson and Dethier, 1973</xref>). The difference between WT and KO caterpillars was amplified in the presence of disarmed parasitoids, which were able to attack but not injure the caterpillars, indicating that KO caterpillars were more susceptible to harassment by their natural enemies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). We hypothesize that this further reduction in caterpillar weight was due to the less efficient foraging behavior of the KO caterpillars, which resulted in an extended time period in which the caterpillars were vulnerable to the harassment by the disarmed parasitoids. This harassment would then further reduce the foraging efficiency of the KO caterpillars and thereby exacerbate the effect seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>.</p><p><italic>P. brassicae</italic> caterpillars are most vulnerable to <italic>C. glomerata</italic> during the first two larval instars. Due to their reduced growth rate, KO caterpillars spent a longer time in these vulnerable stages and, therefore, in a natural setting would likely have suffered more strongly from parasitoid attack than WT caterpillars (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brodeur et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Haverkamp and Smid, 2020</xref>). In addition, caterpillars might have been avoiding plant parts with natural enemies similar to choosing infested plants without parasitoids over infested plants with parasitoids present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). This suggests that caterpillars might be able to use their olfactory system to find enemy-free spaces based on volatiles emitted by the plant or the frass and spit of conspecifics. Similarly, when the caterpillars were exposed to unmanipulated parasitoids, the KO caterpillars were more susceptible and exhibited a higher mortality rate, demonstrating again that olfaction is crucial in larvae to survive under the pressure of natural enemies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). Subsequently, we inferred that the differences in weight gain and survival rate between WT and KO caterpillars are due to different sensitivity to plant volatiles. WT caterpillars can sooner reach a body size in which they are no longer vulnerable to attack by <italic>C. glomerata</italic> by locating an available food source efficiently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brodeur et al., 1996</xref>). The higher mortality rate of KO caterpillars might, therefore, be partly due to a reduced foraging efficiency caused by the lack of olfactory information, which in turn led to an extended period in which the caterpillars were vulnerable to attack by their natural enemies. In addition, the WT caterpillars might have been better able to use olfactory cues to avoid plant parts where conspecifics are under attack by parasitoids, again reducing their mortality in comparison to KO caterpillars (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).</p><p>Searching for host plants suitable for feeding and free of natural enemies is largely accomplished via the olfactory system of herbivorous insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Carrasco et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hu et al., 2020</xref>). Without functional ORs, <italic>P. brassicae</italic> caterpillars could still discriminate plant tissues from paper discs; however, <italic>Orco</italic> KO caterpillars preferred the non-host tomato plant over their natural food plant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). We surmise that OR-mediated olfaction is required in caterpillars to locate and identify their host plants, and losing this part of their olfactory receptor repertoire would make it challenging to distinguish host from non-host plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Liu et al., 2023</xref>). Nonetheless, <italic>Orco</italic> KO caterpillars still retain ORNs expressing ionotropic receptors, which commonly detect acids and amines that have been found to elicit aversion in insect herbivores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>). Fatty acids are present at the edge of both artificially damaged and caterpillar-infested cabbage leaves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Horikoshi et al., 1997</xref>), which, in the absence of ORs detecting attractive plant compounds, may have caused avoidance behavior in the KO caterpillar to their natural host plant. Interestingly, the parasitoid <italic>C. glomerata</italic> also uses the fatty acids produced by the plant to locate <italic>Pieris</italic> caterpillars, and it has been argued that herbivores might avoid these compounds to escape from their natural enemies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Horikoshi et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>We found that WT caterpillars prefer caterpillar-infested plants free of wasps over caterpillar-infested plants with wasps, which suggests that caterpillars are able to detect certain volatiles that are derived from the interaction with caterpillars and wasps. By analyzing headspace samples of caterpillars, parasitoids, as well as the interaction of caterpillars and parasitoids, we successfully identified some chemical compounds which were already known plant volatiles, such as alcohols and aldehydes. However, we did not find any compounds that were specifically abundant in Pb-Cg or Cg. This suggests that a volatile signal serving as a ‘danger signal’ directly emitted by the wasps or caterpillars might not exist, or it might not be detectable with our methods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Alternatively, indirect cues such as the volatiles emitted from the caterpillar spit during their defensive behavior might have triggered the avoidance behavior of the WT caterpillars to infested plants with natural enemies. When we tested the most abundant compounds in a two-choice behavioral assay against a solvent control, we found that <italic>P. brassicae</italic> WT larvae showed a preference to the plant volatiles (<italic>Z</italic>)-3-hexen-1-ol and (<italic>E</italic>)-2-hexenal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), which are known HIPVs. Previous studies on other species have demonstrated that caterpillars are capable of detecting different HIPVs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Di et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">de Fouchier et al., 2018</xref>). For caterpillars, HIPVs can serve as indicators for the location of potential food plants and the presence of conspecifics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Di et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>), but they also attract natural enemies and enhance the risk of being attacked (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bernays, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ngumbi and Fadamiro, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yang et al., 2016</xref>). Most HIPVs identified in this study were found abundantly in caterpillar saliva that caterpillars spit onto parasitoids to defend against attack. In our study, caterpillars were attracted by HIPVs emitted by plants and by individual HIPVs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). We speculate that caterpillars use low to intermediate concentrations of HIPVs to find suitable host plants and high concentrations to avoid sites where other caterpillars are under attack by their natural enemies. Therefore, perceiving plant leaf volatiles and approaching the food plants accordingly will increase the herbivores’ feeding efficiency and enhance survival chances. Interestingly, ITCs, which are hydrolyzed from glucosinolates after leaf damage in crucifer plants, did not elicit strong responses from the butterfly antenna (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J, K</xref>). Because all receptors expressed in the caterpillar are also present in the butterfly and because of the limited number of ORs and ORNs in larvae and low expression levels of ORs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wang et al., 2024</xref>), we found it less likely that ITCs are used by <italic>P. brassicae</italic> caterpillars as foraging cues, even though these compounds are recognized by <italic>Plutella xylostella</italic> ORs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Liu et al., 2020</xref>). In our study, volatile cues of wasps were only found in very low quantities, and these compounds hardly elicited any behavioral response in the caterpillars; however, these chemicals might still play a role in the interaction between the caterpillars and wasps at a close range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ebrahim et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>The way that larval insects react to the potential threat from their natural enemies is still largely unknown for most insects. Our study that exploited CRISPR/Cas9 shows that olfaction is of high significance to caterpillars for locating food sources and likely affects their survival when under the selection pressure from natural enemies.

The parasitoid wasps were replaced every day to ensure that caterpillars were always exposed to natural enemies. The caterpillars were collected after 10 days to count the number that survived; the collected caterpillars were further reared until they pupated or <italic>C. glomerata</italic> larvae emerged.</p></list-item></list></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Larval host-plant seeking behavior</title><p>Caterpillar (<italic>n</italic> = 54–73) food-plant seeking behavior was evaluated in a greenhouse under the same conditions in which the caterpillars were reared. Plant leaf discs or green paper discs (Trophée 1224 ‘Forest Green’, Clairefontaine, France), with 12 mm diameter were placed at opposite positions along the edge of a 188-mm-diameter Petri dish. A single L3 caterpillar was then placed at the center of the arena. Each caterpillar was observed for 10 min, the first choice that the caterpillars made and the time spent were recorded. The caterpillars were provided with a choice between either (1) a cabbage leaf disc and a paper disc, (2) a tomato leaf disc and a paper disc, or (3) a cabbage leaf disc and a tomato leaf disc. A choice was recorded when caterpillars began feeding on the cabbage leaf disc or contacted the tomato leaf/green paper discs. New discs were used for every caterpillar, and the positions of discs were exchanged after every ten tests.</p><p>To further test the host-plant locating behavior of L3 caterpillars, we investigated the behaviors of caterpillars in a Y-tube olfactometer (diameter 35 mm) with a built-in black Y-shaped wire, allowing caterpillars to crawl along the wire and make a choice smoothly in the laboratory. Each arm was provided with a 1.1 l/min inlet airflow which had been purified by charcoal and humidified by water before entering the treatment jars. Healthy plants were untreated, infested plants were infested with 30 early L3 caterpillars for 24 hr and with caterpillars on plants while testing. Differently treated plants were placed in jars to test caterpillar behaviors. The caterpillars had been starved for approximately 5 hr before testing. Each caterpillar was tested and observed for 5 min, and caterpillar behavior was monitored by a camera. The position of inlet airflow was changed every five tests to avoid position bias.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Volatile analysis</title><p>Volatiles were collected from L3 <italic>P. brassicae</italic> caterpillars, 3-day-old female <italic>C. glomerata</italic> wasps, <italic>P. brassicae</italic> caterpillars and <italic>C. glomerata</italic> wasps together, caterpillar frass collected from L3 caterpillars and caterpillar saliva also collected from L3 caterpillars using glass capillaries following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mattiacci et al., 1994</xref>. Fresh frass and saliva samples were stored in a freezer at –20°C and thawed overnight at room temperature before volatile collection. Headspace collection of volatiles was performed from five treatments: 20 female wasps (Cg) in a 10-ml glass vial (<italic>n</italic> = 12); 20 L3 caterpillars (Pb) in a 10-ml glass vial (<italic>n</italic> = 10); 20 L3 caterpillars and 2 female wasps (Pb–Cg) in a 10-ml glass vial (<italic>n</italic> = 14); 100 mg caterpillar frass (Pb-Fr) in a 1.5-ml glass vial (<italic>n</italic> = 10); and 50-µl caterpillar saliva (Pb-S) in a 1.5-ml glass vial (<italic>n</italic> = 12). Clean empty glass vials (10 and 1.5 ml) were used as a negative control. Volatiles were collected through dynamic headspace sampling using Tenax TA adsorbent material (20/35 mesh; Camsco, USA). Synthetic air (Air Synthetic 4.0 Monitoring from Linde Gas, The Netherlands) at 110 ml min<sup>–1</sup> to the samples in 10 ml vials and 55 ml min<sup>–1</sup> to the samples in 1.5 ml vials were constantly supplied as a carrier for the volatiles, while simultaneously the volatiles were trapped by drawing air at 100 and 50 ml min<sup>–1</sup>, respectively, through a stainless-steel tube filled with 200 mg Tenax TA for 2 hr.</p><p>The collected volatiles were thermally released from the Tenax TA adsorbent using an Ultra 50:50 thermal desorption unit (Markes, UK) at 250°C for 10 min under a helium flow of 20 ml min<sup>–1</sup>, while simultaneously re-collecting the volatiles in a thermally cooled universal solvent trap: Unity (Markes, UK) at 0°C. Once the desorption process was completed, the volatile compounds were released from the cold trap by ballistic heating at 40°C s<sup>–1</sup> to 280°C, which was then kept for 10 min, while all the volatiles were transferred to a ZB-5MS analytical column 30 ml × 0.25 mm ID × 1 mm F.T. with a 10 m built-in guard column (Phenomenex, USA), placed inside the oven of a Thermo Trace GC Ultra (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA), for separation of volatiles. The GC oven temperature was initially held at 40°C for 2 min and was immediately raised at 6°C min<sup>–1</sup> to a final temperature of 280°C, where it was kept for 4 min under a constant helium flow of 1 ml min<sup>–1</sup>. For the detection of volatiles, a Thermo Trace DSQ quadrupole mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) coupled to the GC was operated in an electron impact ionization mode at 70 eV in a fullscan mode with a mass range of 35–400 amu at 4.70 scans s<sup>–1</sup>. The MS transfer line and ion source were set at 275 and 250°C, respectively.</p><p>Automated baseline correction, peak selection (S/N &gt;3), and alignments of all extracted mass signals of the raw data were processed following an untargeted metabolomic workflow using MetAlign software, producing detailed information on the relative abundance of mass signals representing the available metabolites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lommen, 2009</xref>). This was followed by the reconstruction of the extracted mass features into potential compounds using the MSClust software through data reduction by means of unsupervised clustering and extraction of putative metabolite mass spectra (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tikunov et al., 2012</xref>). Tentative identification of volatile metabolites was based on a comparison of the reconstructed mass spectra with those in the NIST 2008 and Wageningen Mass Spectral Database of Natural Products MS libraries, as well as experimentally obtained linear retention indices.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Caterpillar response to individual chemical compounds</title><p>L3 caterpillars (<italic>n</italic> = 31–50 for each compound, each genotype) were tested in a custom-made set-up consisting of 25 separate arenas in the laboratory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Each arena allowed caterpillars to move freely along two channels of 90 mm located in opposite directions of a central opening, which permitted the caterpillar to crawl into the arena. At the end of the arenas, airflows are introduced to deliver volatile chemicals. The airflow was sucked out through the channel below the central opening simultaneously. Single caterpillars were placed in the central well of the individual arenas before the test. Caterpillars were given a choice between a selected volatile chemical of interest (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1H</xref>) and paraffin oil. Input odors were delivered at 1.1 l min<sup>–1</sup> for both chemicals and solvent controls, and the odors were sucked out at 2.2 l min<sup>–1</sup> at the same time from the center. The arena was cleaned by ethanol and dried by high-pressure air. The position of chemicals was exchanged after each test. The behavior of caterpillars was recorded for 10 min at 100 frames per minute using a Canon TV lens JF16mm (Canon, Japan). Behavioral data were extracted by EthoVision XT 11.5 software (Noldus, The Netherlands). Data were removed from the dataset when the caterpillar stayed in the arena for less than 10 s. All tests were performed at room temperature.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Unless stated otherwise, statistical tests were performed in R (version 4.4.0; R Core Team, 2016) in combination with RStudio (Posit, USA). Datasets were tested for normal distribution using a Shapiro–Wilk test and for equal variances using Levene’s test. The difference of glomerular number between WT and <italic>Orco</italic> KO caterpillars was tested with a Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Electroantennographic responses between the two genotypes were tested statistically by using the Student’s <italic>t</italic>-test when the values were normally distributed and had homogenous variance or tested by using the Kruskal–Wallis rank-sum test when the requirements for the <italic>t</italic>-test were not met. The difference in butterfly mating frequency was analyzed by using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test; differences in oviposition dynamics were tested with a GLM with a negative binomial distribution. The development differences between WT and KO caterpillars on full plants and under the thread of disarmed parasitoids were tested using a Student’s <italic>t</italic>-test, and survival rate difference between the two genotypes was tested using a GLM with a beta-binomial distribution. Caterpillar host-plant selection behaviors in Petri dishes and in the Y-tube were analyzed with a Chi-square test. Differences in the relative time spent by the caterpillars between the control side and the odor side of the multichannel arenas were compared by a non-parametric Wilcoxon rank-sum test. PCA of volatile blends was achieved by MetaboAnalyst (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pang et al., 2024</xref>). Data were normalized by logarithmic transformation and scaled in auto mode. Ward’s method and Euclidean distance were employed in the hierarchical clustering heatmap by default settings without clustering samples. In addition, the abundance of volatiles as peak heights was imported into SIMCA-P 17 statistical software (Umetrics, Sweden), and the data were analyzed by MVDA. Supervised Orthogonal Projection to Latent Structures Discriminant Analysis (OPLS-DA) was employed to compare and correlate treatment groups.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Resources, Software, Validation, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Supervision, Validation, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Data curation, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media xlink:href="elife-105585-mdarchecklist1-v1.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>Analysis of volatile compounds in the headspace of Cotesia glomerata wasps, Pieris brassicae caterpillars, caterpillars and wasps in the presents of each other, caterpillar frass and caterpillar spit.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Volatile compounds detected in the headspace of the different treatment samples.

The authors used CRISPR/Cas9 to knockout odorant receptor co-receptors (Orco), and conducted a comparative study on the behavior and olfactory system of the mutant and wild-type larvae. The study found that Orco-expressing olfactory sensory neurons in antennae and maxillary palps of Orco knockout (KO) larvae disappeared, and the number of glomeruli in the brain decreased, which impairs the olfactory detection and primary processing in the brain. Orco KO caterpillars show weight loss and loss of preference for optimal food plants; KO larvae also lost weight when attacked by parasitoids with the ovipositor removed, and mortality increased when attacked by untreated parasitoids. On this basis, the authors further studied the responses of caterpillars to volatiles from plants attacked by the larvae of the same species and volatiles from plants on which the caterpillars were themselves attacked by parasitic wasps.

The authors used CRISPR/Cas9 to knockout odorant receptor coreceptors (Orco), and conducted a comparative study on the behavior and olfactory system of the mutant and wild-type larvae. The study found that Orco-expressing olfactory sensory neurons in antennae and maxillary palps of Orco knockout (KO) larvae disappeared, and the number of glomeruli in the brain decreased, which impairs the olfactory detection and primary processing in the brain. Orco KO caterpillars show weight loss and loss of preference for optimal food plants; KO larvae also lost weight when attacked by parasitoids with the ovipositor removed, and mortality increased when attacked by untreated parasitoids. On this basis, the authors further studied the responses of caterpillars to volatiles from plants attacked by the larvae of the same species and volatiles from plants on which the caterpillars were themselves attacked by parasitic wasps.

In the Materials and Methods, we mention how we selected the target region and evaluated potential off-target sites by Exonerate and CHOPCHOP. Neither of these methods found potential off-target sites with a more-than-17-nt alignment identity. Therefore, we assumed no off-target effect in our Orco knockout. Furthermore, we did not find any developmental differences between wildtype and knockout caterpillars when these were reared on leaf discs in Petri dishes (Fig S4). We will further highlight this information on the off-target evaluation in the Results section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Figure 1E: Only one olfactory receptor neuron was marked in WT.

Therefore, to explain the loss of Orcoexpressing neurons in the mutant (Figure 1F), a more rigorous explanation of the photo is required.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing this out. The figure shows only a qualitative comparison between WT and KO and we did not aim to determine the total number of Orco positive neurons in the maxillary palps or antennae of WT and KO caterpillars, but please see our previous work for the neuron numbers in the caterpillar antennae (Wang et al., 2024). We did indeed find more than one neuron in the maxillary palps, but as these were in very different image planes it was not possible to visualize them together. However, we will add a few sentences in the Results and Discussion section to explain the results of the maxillary palp Orco staining.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) In Figure 1G, H, the four glomeruli are circled by dotted lines: their corresponding relationship between the two figures needs to be further clarified.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing this out. The four glomeruli in Figure 1G and 1H are not strictly corresponding. We circled these glomeruli to highlight them, as they are the best visualized and clearly shown in this view. In this study, we only counted the number of glomeruli in both WT and KO, however, we did not clarify which glomeruli are missing in the KO caterpillar brain. We will further clarify this in the figure legend.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Line 130: Since the main topic in this study is the olfactory system of larvae, the experimental results of this part are all about antennal electrophysiological responses, mating frequency, and egg production of female and male adults of wild type and Orco KO mutant, it may be considered to include this part in the supplementary files. It is better to include some data about the olfactory responses of larvae.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your suggestion. We do agree with your suggestion, and we will consider moving this part to the supplementary information. Regarding larval olfactory response, we unfortunately failed to record any spikes using single sensillum recordings due to the difficult nature of the preparation; however we do believe that this would be an interesting avenue for further research.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5)Line 166: The sentences in the text are about the choice test between &quot; healthy plant vs. infested plant&quot;, while in Fig 3C, it is &quot;infested plant vs. no plant&quot;. The content in the text does not match the figure.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing this out. The sentence is “We compared the behaviors of both WT and Orco KO caterpillars in response to clean air, a healthy plant and a caterpillar-infested plant”. We tested these three stimuli in two comparisons: healthy plant vs no plant, infested plant vs no plant. The two comparisons are shown in Figure 3C separately. We will aim to describe this more clearly in the revised version of this manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) Lines 174-178: Figure 3A showed that the body weight of Orco KO larvae in the absence of parasitic wasps also decreased compared with that of WT. Therefore, in the experiments of Figure 3A and E, the difference in the body weight of Orco KO larvae in the presence or absence of parasitic wasps without ovipositors should also be compared. The current data cannot determine the reduced weight of KO mutant is due to the Orco knockout or the presence of parasitic wasps.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing this out. We did not make a comparison between the data of Figures 3A and 3E since the two experiments were not conducted at the same time due to the limited space in our BioSafety III greenhouse. We do agree that the weight decrease in Figure 3E is partly due to the reduced caterpillar growth shown in Figure 3A. However, we are confident that the additional decrease in caterpillar weight shown in Figure 3E is mainly driven by the presence of disarmed parasitoids. To be specific, the average weight in Figure 3A is 0.4544 g for WT and 0.4230 g for KO, KO weight is 93.1% of WT caterpillars. While in Figure 3E, the average weight is 0.4273 g for WT and 0.3637 g for KO, KO weight is 85.1% of WT caterpillars. We will discuss this interaction between caterpillar growth and the effect of the parasitoid attacks more extensively in the revised version of the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) Lines 179-181: Figure 3F shows that the survival rate of larvae of Orco KO mutant decreased in the presence of parasitic wasps, and the difference in survival rate of larvae of WT and Orco KO mutant in the absence of parasitic wasps should also be compared. The current data cannot determine whether the reduced survival of the KO mutant is due to the Orco knockout or the presence of parasitic wasps.</p></disp-quote><p>We are happy that you highlight this point. When conducting these experiments, we selected groups of caterpillars and carefully placed them on a leaf with minimal disturbance of the caterpillars, which minimized hurting and mortality. We did test the survival of caterpillars in the absence of parasitoid wasps from the experiment presented in Figure 3A, although this was missing from the manuscript. There is no significant difference in the survival rate of caterpillars between the two genotypes in the absence of wasps (average mortality WT = 8.8 %, average mortality KO = 2.9 %; P = 0.088, Wilcoxon test), so the decreased survival rate is most likely due to the attack of the wasps. We will add this information to the revised version of the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(8) In Figure 4B, why do the compounds tested have no volatiles derived from plants?

We assume you mean Figure 4D/4E instead of Figure 4B. In Figure 4B, many of the identified chemical compounds are essentially plant volatiles, especially those from caterpillar frass and caterpillar spit. In Figure 4D/4E, most of the tested chemicals are derived from plants. But indeed, we did not include ITCs, based on information from the EAG results in Figures 2A &amp; 2B. Butterfly antennae did not respond strongly to ITCs, so we did not include ITCs in the larval behavioural tests. Instead, the tested chemicals in Figure 4D/4E either elicit high EAG responses of butterflies or have been identified as “important” by VIP scores in the chemical analyses. In the EAG results of <italic>Plutella xylostella</italic> (Liu et al., 2020), moths responded well to a few ITCs, the tested ITCs in our study are actually adopted from this study except for those that were not available to us. However, butterflies did not show a strong response to the tested ITCs; therefore, we did not include ITCs because we expected that <italic>Pieris brassicae</italic> caterpillars are not likely to show good responses to ITCs. We will add this explanation to the revised version of our manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(9) The custom-made setup and the relevant behavioral experiments in Figure 4C need to be described in detail (Line 545).</p></disp-quote><p>We will add more detailed descriptions for the setup and method in the Materials and Methods.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(10) Materials and Methods Line 448: 10 μL paraffin oil should be used for negative control.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing this out. We used both clean filter paper and clean filter paper with 10 μL paraffin oil as negative controls, but we did not find a significant difference between the two controls. Therefore, in the EAG results of Figure 2A/2B, we presented paraffin oil as one of the tested chemicals. We will re-run our statistical tests with paraffin oil as negative control, although we do not expect any major differences to the previous tests.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript investigated the effect of olfactory cues on caterpillar performance and parasitoid avoidance in Pieris brassicae. The authors knocked out Orco to produce caterpillars with significantly reduced olfactory perception. These caterpillars showed reduced performance and increased susceptibility to a parasitoid wasp.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>This is an impressive piece of work and a well-written manuscript. The authors have used multiple techniques to investigate not only the effect of the loss of olfactory cues on host-parasitoid interactions, but also the mechanisms underlying this.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>(1) I do have one major query regarding this manuscript - I agree that the results of the caterpillar choice tests in a y-maze give weight to the idea that olfactory cues may help them avoid areas with higher numbers of parasitoids. However, the experiments with parasitoids were carried out on a single plant. Given that caterpillars in these experiments were very limited in their potential movement and source of food - how likely is it that avoidance played a role in the results seen from these experiments, as opposed to simply the slower growth of the KO caterpillars extending their period of susceptibility? While the two mechanisms may well both take place in nature - only one suggests a direct role of olfaction in enemy avoidance at this life stage, while the other is an indirect effect, hence the distinction is important.</p></disp-quote><p>We do agree with your comment that both mechanisms may be at work in nature and we do address this in the Discussion section. In our study, we did find that wildtype caterpillars were more efficient in locating their food source and did grow faster on full plants than knockout caterpillars. This faster growth will enable wildtype caterpillars to more quickly outgrow the life-stages most vulnerable to the parasitoids (L1 and L2). The olfactory system therefore supports the escape from parasitoids indirectly by enhancing feeding efficiency directly.</p><p>Figure 3D shows that WT caterpillars prefer infested plants without parastioids to infested plants with parasitoids. In addition, we observed that caterpillars move frequently between different leaves. Therefore, we speculate that WT caterpillars make use of volatiles from the plant or from (parasitoid-exposed) conspecifics via their spit or faeces to avoid parts of the plant potentially attracting natural enemies. Knockout caterpillars are unable to use these volatile danger cues and therefore do not avoid plant parts that are most attractive to their natural enemies, making KO caterpillars more susceptible and leading to more natural enemy harassment. Through this, olfaction also directly impacts the ability of a caterpillar to find an enemy-free feeding site.</p><p>We think that olfaction supports the enemy avoidance of caterpillars via both these mechanisms, although at different time scales. Unfortunately, our analysis was not detailed enough to discern the relative importance of the two mechanisms we found. However, we feel that this would be an interesting avenue for further research. Moreover, we will sharpen our discussion on the potential importance of the two different mechanisms in the revised version of this manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) My other issue was determining sample sizes used from the text was sometimes a bit confusing.
