projects broadly throughout the cortex and constitutes a critical source of neuromodulation for arousal and attention. Traditionally, this system was thought to function diffusely. However, recent studies have revealed a high degree of spatiotemporal specificity in cholinergic signaling. How the organization of cholinergic afferents confers this level of precision remains unknown. Here, using intersectional genetic fate mapping, we demonstrate that cholinergic fibers within the mouse cortex exhibit remarkable laminar and regional specificity and that this is organized in accordance with cellular birthdate. Strikingly, birthdated cholinergic projections within the cortex follow an inside-out pattern of innervation. While early born cholinergic populations target deep layers, late born ones innervate superficial laminae. We also find that birthdate predicts cholinergic innervation patterns within the amygdala, hippocampus, and prefrontal cortex. Our work reveals previously unappreciated specificity within the cholinergic system and the developmental logic by which these circuits are assembled.</p></abstract><kwd-group

role in modulating attention, motivation, and learning within neocortical, hippocampal, and subcortical circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ballinger et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Luchicchi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Picciotto et al., 2012</xref>). The primary source of ACh within these structures are the projection neurons located in several nuclei throughout the basal forebrain. Historically, these neurons were thought to be relatively indiscriminate sources of ACh, releasing it slowly and diffusely throughout the cortex to mediate widespread circuit activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sarter et al., 2009</xref>). Nonetheless, considerable in vitro work has implied a multitude of layer-, cell type-, and synapse-specific cholinergic effects (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Muñoz and Rudy, 2014</xref>). Recent in vivo findings have revealed an even higher level of spatiotemporal coordination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Froemke et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Muñoz et al., 2017</xref>). These observations hint that the ACh system is composed of distinct cell types that target specific layers and circuit elements of the cortex in a temporally precise manner.</p><p>Classically, the basal forebrain cholinergic neurons (BFCNs) have been divided into four groups based upon cell body location – Ch1 (medial septum), Ch2 (vertical diagonal band), Ch3 (horizontal diagonal band), and Ch4 (substantia innominata and nucleus basalis) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mesulam et al., 1983</xref>). These broad anatomical divisions roughly reflect their innervation of different brain structures (i.e. neocortex, hippocampus, and amygdala). Further efforts delineated a more refined topography. Early work suggested that rostrally located cells project to medial cortical areas and that caudal cells project laterally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baskerville et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Saper, 1984</xref>). This work was primarily carried out using anterograde and retrograde tracers which allowed the broad spatial topography to be determined, but could not distinguish between cholinergic and noncholinergic cells. More recently, genetic tools have allowed for the sparse, selective targeting of cholinergic cell types but failed to reveal their overall topographic and anatomical organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Li et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zaborszky et al., 2015</xref>). Here, by using a hybrid genetic/retrograde labeling strategy, we demonstrate the existence of cholinergic neurons with specific projections to deep, middle, and superficial layers of the mouse somatosensory cortex.</p><p>We further sought to understand how this organization in the cholinergic system arises during development. It is known that all cholinergic neurons in the forebrain originate within the Nkx2.1+ proliferative region of the ventral embryonic telencephalon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Marin et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Patel et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Xu et al., 2008</xref>). The diversity of other cell types arising from this region is generated by both spatially defined progenitor pools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gelman et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nóbrega-Pereira et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wonders et al., 2008</xref>), as well as temporal shifts in the neuronal subtype produced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Inan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Miyoshi et al., 2007</xref>). Here, we investigated the developmental origins of cholinergic projection neuron topography. We were surprised to find that the temporal, but not the spatial, organization of the progenitors predicted the organization of the mature cholinergic projections. Furthermore, we found that the axons of cholinergic neurons born at different embryonic timepoints take distinct pathways to reach their projection targets. Together, these results illustrate that the temporal origins of the BFCNs predict the precise organization of their cortical and subcortical axonal topographies.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Layer-specific cholinergic projections in the mature somatosensory cortex</title><p>To explore specificity of cholinergic axonal arborizations, we used a hybrid genetic/viral strategy to label small subpopulations of cholinergic neurons innervating the mature cortex.

By restricting this virus to either the superficial or deep layers of the primary somatosensory cortex of <italic>Chat<sup>FlpO</sup>; Rosa26<sup>Ai65</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), we were able to selectively label cholinergic neurons with axons projecting to specific cortical layers. The fluorescent reporter fills the entire axonal arborization of labeled cholinergic neurons and thus allowed us to determine the extent of arborization of individual cells across laminae. Using this method, we observed that the majority of projections were restricted to the injected layers. This indicates that most cholinergic neurons predominantly arborize within specific cortical laminae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>). In particular, deep layer injections largely showed projections restricted to layers 5 and 6 (L5-6) of the somatosensory cortex, whereas superficial injections primarily showed projections within layers 1 through 4 (L1-4), with some showing remarkable specificity for L1.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Retrograde labeling of layer-specific cholinergic projections in the somatosensory cortex.</title><p>See also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplements 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">3</xref>.

The soma of the L1-targeting cell was located in the rostral substantia innominata, sending its axon rostrally then dorsally through the medial septum, ultimately entering the cortex through L1. Despite the fact that this cell had arborizations extending from the caudal motor cortex to the rostral visual cortex, it was almost entirely restricted to layer 1. Conversely, the soma of the L5/6-targeting cell was located in the nucleus basalis, near the globus pallidus. Its axon traversed through the striatum to enter the external capsule before entering the somatosensory cortex from L6. Unlike the L1-targeting cell, the arborizations of the L5/6-targeting cell were restricted to the somatosensory cortex and covered a much more limited rostral to caudal territory.</p><p>Moreover, we mapped the soma locations of the labeled cholinergic neurons within the basal forebrain in order to gain insight into whether cell body localization is related to the layer topography of their axonal arborizations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,E,F</xref>). We found that both deep- and superficial-targeting cholinergic neurons can reside within one of several nuclei across the rostral-caudal axis of the basal forebrain, including the vertical diagonal band (vDB), horizontal diagonal band (hDB), substantia innominata (SI), and nucleus basalis (NB).

However, the organization of this system, how it develops, and how this organization may mediate its specificity is still poorly understood. Here, we show that cholinergic neurons targeting the somatosensory cortex innervate specific layers – an organizational principle that was previously unknown and likely significantly contributes to the laminar specificity of cholinergic signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Muñoz and Rudy, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Muñoz et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Obermayer et al., 2017</xref>). Furthermore, we found that this specificity is determined by the birthdate of cholinergic neurons in the BF, with early born cholinergic neurons primarily targeting deep layers and later born neurons targeting progressively superficial layers of the somatosensory cortex. Importantly, we identified a population of cholinergic neurons whose axonal projections are almost completely restricted to layer 1. Cholinergic neuronal birthdate is also correlated with projection topography in other target regions, including other cortical areas, hippocampus, and amygdala. Finally, we found that cholinergic neurons born at different times project via distinct axonal pathways to reach their targets. Together, these findings extend our understanding of the organization of BFCNs by revealing the relationship between their developmental origins and their specific projection fields.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Layer-specificity of cholinergic neurons</title><p>Given the distinct actions of ACh in different cortical laminae, the existence of layer-specific cholinergic neurons has been previously hypothesized. Here, using intersectional genetics, we were able to identify layer-specific populations in the somatosensory cortex for the first time. Perhaps most notably, we discovered the existence of a population of cholinergic neurons, primarily born at E12 that almost exclusively innervate layer 1. This population may explain the high density of cholinergic axons in L1 compared to other layers. Moreover, it has important functional implications for ACh in cortical processes regulated by L1, such as cross-modal signaling.</p><p>Importantly, we observed marked differences in the degree of innervation specificity within sensory (S1 and V1) and non-sensory (mPFC and M1) cortical regions. In a recent anterograde tracing study, it was shown that labeled cohorts of cholinergic neurons targeting the mPFC could be divided into two groups: one group projecting to all layers, and another projecting to deep layers only (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bloem et al., 2014</xref>). Our results corroborate this finding: projections from early born cholinergic neurons are relatively restricted to deeper layers, while projections from later born cells were visible across all layers of mPFC. M1 showed a similar trend, with some labeled cohorts of neurons showing deep layer projection specificity, while others more diffusely innervated the entire cortical mantle. This discrepancy between the degree of innervation specificity observed in sensory versus non-sensory areas may relate to the distinct roles of cholinergic signaling in information flow within these regions (bottom-up versus top-down, respectively).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>The role of spatial versus temporal cues in BF organization</title><p>We initially expected that cholinergic neurons targeting different layers or regions might originate from spatially distinct progenitor zones. Instead, however, we found no major differences in the contribution of cholinergic cells that emanate from the MGE or POA with regards to their cell body location or projection topography. Complementing our results, a recent study fate mapped cholinergic neurons arising from the embryonic septum, another Nkx2.1+ region. Like the MGE and POA, the septum gives rise to cholinergic neurons whose axons have no apparent specificity within the cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Magno et al., 2017</xref>). Together, these results show that these broad embryonic zones all produce heterogenous populations of cholinergic neurons that, as a group, project throughout the forebrain. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that smaller, more specific subregions of these embryonic structures could give rise to populations of cholinergic neurons with more defined projection topography.</p><p>By contrast, we discovered that cellular birthdate defines subpopulations of cholinergic neurons with distinct projection distributions. How this specificity is achieved is unclear. Are cholinergic populations specified as ‘deep layer-targeting’ or ‘superficial layer-targeting’ as soon as they become postmitotic or do these reflect temporal shifts in guidance cues that both dictate their projection trajectory and laminar specificity? Although at present prohibitively challenging, one could potentially discern between these possibilities through heterochronic transplantation of birthdated, postmitotic cholinergic neurons.</p><p>Furthermore, cholinergic projections could initially project broadly across cortical laminae and become refined to specific layers through a combination of synaptic pruning and programmed cell death. In cholinergic neurons, both these processes are regulated in part by the p75 neurotrophin receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barrett, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boskovic et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Niewiadomska et al., 2011</xref>). Additionally, attractant or repellant cues secreted from cortical cells could play a key role in guiding cholinergic fibers to the appropriate layers. This is a particularly compelling idea given that the ‘inside-out’ innervation pattern of cholinergic neurons observed here reflects the manner in which the cortex itself is generated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Angevine and Sidman, 1961</xref>). Further investigation into the precise signaling mechanisms within the cortex that establish and maintain the laminar specificity of cholinergic neurons will be an extremely interesting avenue for future study.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Cholinergic neuron diversity</title><p>Our work adds a level of complexity in our understanding of cholinergic neuron diversity. Cholinergic diversity likely extends beyond differences in their axonal targeting, with subpopulations possessing distinct functional and electrophysiological properties. For example, a recently published study suggests that different basal forebrain cholinergic cell types are responsible for the two timescales of ACh release in the cortex, with one mediating slow, volume transmission and the other characterized by phasic, point-to-point release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Laszlovszky et al., 2020</xref>). Additionally, it has recently been shown that cholinergic neurons directly within the globus pallidus are more intimately involved in basal ganglia circuitry and have specialized firing properties when compared to their neighbors in the nucleus basalis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Saunders et al., 2015</xref>). In addition to the BFCNs, other potential sources of ACh exist in the forebrain. For example, cholinergic neurons in the pedunculopontine and laterodorsal tegmental nuclei of the brainstem innervate the basal ganglia and thalamus, but do not appear to directly innervate most cortical areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Huerta-Ocampo et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Martinez-Gonzalez et al., 2011</xref>).

Every eighth section from each brain was examined under a fluorescence microscope and tdTomato+ cell bodies were annotated onto a brain atlas. For figures, cell locations were approximated to their location on a representative atlas for that rostro-caudal region. Cells were summed and the proportion of cell bodies within each region per brain was calculated. ANOVA was used to determine whether significant differences between the proportions of cells within each region existed across groups, with post-hoc tests using Sidak’s (spatial fate mapping) or Tukey’s (temporal fate mapping) multiple comparisons tests.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Neurolucida reconstructions and projection quantification</title><p>For whole neuron reconstructions, brains were chosen with extremely sparse viral labeling to ensure clarity assigning projections to the cell of interest. Sections containing the cell of interest were imaged on a Zeiss LSM 800. Z-stacks of images were then loaded into Neurolucida 360 (MBF Biosciences) and trees were reconstructed using the ‘user guided’ option with Directional Kernels. Contours of major features in the brain sections were also traced for alignment of sections to produce the final reconstruction.</p><p>For the quantification of neuronal projections given brain regions, confocal images were taken of relevant brain regions. The total projections within that region were reconstructed in Neurolucida 360 and the total projection length was quantified using Neurolucida explorer. To account for the fact that tamoxifen induction of <italic>CreER</italic> activity results in a variable number of neurons labeled across brains, this quantification was normalized in one of two ways. For overall projection density quantification within a given region, total projection length was normalized to the number of cells labeled in that brain to give a ‘normalized projection score’ (total projection length/number of cells*1000). For layer analysis, the projection within a given layer was simply quantified as a proportion of the total projection length within that cortical region.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Pathway analysis</title><p>Cholinergic axonal trajectories in birthdated brains were quantified by counting the number of fiber segments within a given pathway (rostral, septal, rostrolateral, or caudolateral). This number was then converted to a proportion relative to the contribution of other pathways to account for variable labeling in cell number across brains. The rostral pathway was defined as fibers running vertically (i.e. parallel to the edge of the mPFC) in the superficial-most part of L1 of the medial cortex in sections rostral to the medial septum. Fibers in the septal pathway were those in the medial part of sections containing the septum that perforated the corpus callosum or ran vertically through L1 in the cingulate cortex. The rostrolateral pathway was defined as fibers running through the external capsule in sections containing the medial septum or those more rostral; the caudolateral pathway fibers were those in the external pathways in sections caudal to this.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Sample size</title><p>No statistical method was used to determine sample sizes.

birthdate predicts laminar and regional cholinergic projection topography in the forebrain&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Sacha Nelson as the Reviewing Editor and Huda Zoghbi as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have largely concurring views and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The revisions requested below only address clarity and presentation.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors use intersectional genetic fate mapping to reveal previously unknown specificity in the development and projection patterns of central cholinergic neurons of the mammalian basal forebrain. This fills an important gap in our understanding of this modulatory system long known to be critical to forebrain function.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>See the suggestions for textual revisions below.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This is a simple but elegant manuscript that examines the projection rules for forebrain cholinergic neurons, namely, the relationship between their origin during development and their projection. The authors used intersectional dual-recombinase-dependent reporter activation to label cholinergic neurons (expressing ChAT-FlpO) that project either to the superficial or deep layers of the primary somatosensory cortex by restricting Cre expression to those layers using viral injections. This showed a layer-restricted projection. They then moved on the determine whether projection was dependent on spatial embryonic origin, using Lhx6Cre or ShhCre, and suggested that the origin does not predict the projection pattern. Using a tamoxifen-inducible Cre line (Ascl1CreER) the authors find that lower layers are innervated primarily by earlier-born cholinergic neurons. Birthdate also predicted the topographic projection in other regions of the forebrain including the amygdala and the hippocampus. And finally, by mapping the position and projection paths of birthdated neurons the authors find rostro-caudal differences in their localization and the axonal projection routes.</p><p>I have only minor concerns that can be addressed with minor revisions:</p><p>In Figure 2 and in the Results and Discussion the authors conclude that “Spatial embryonic origin does not predict projection topography of cholinergic neurons”. I would say that this is an overstatement given the tools that the authors have used. Shh-Cre labels indeed POA-derived neurons but Lhx6-Cre labels all the other populations of cholinergic neurons, hence, delineates a broad embryonic origin. The conclusion from the findings here should be that “POA and MGE/septal-derived cholinergic neurons project equally to different forebrain areas.”. This leaves open the possibility that smaller spatially-restricted populations of neurons may have more restricted topographic projections.</p><p>In the Discussion the authors should briefly talk about the possibility that cell death may contribute e.g. to the final laminar specificity that is observed. Also, a discussion on the timing of development of the target neurons or target areas relative to the cholinergic neurons would be useful. Are early-born targets innervated by early-born cholinergic neurons? This seems to be largely the case from the data presented.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This is a lovely study. It demonstrates several new findings that are highly significant for understanding the organization of the cholinergic projections within the forebrain.</p><p>The authors convincingly show that cholinergic neurons have quite specific laminar termination zones in sensory cortex, that neurons projecting to deeper layers are born earlier and those projecting more superficially are born later. In addition, there is the very important finding that the structure where the cells originate is generally not clearly related to their laminar termination zones. The system in non-sensory areas seems to be slightly distinct but also with distinct distributions of targeting to structures based more loosely on birthdate.</p><p>The methods are elegant and definitive. I have essentially no substantive criticisms of the manuscript as it is.</p><p>I think there are a couple of remaining questions (outside the scope of this study but sensible to consider in the future) perhaps worth discussing. It seems that it isn't known from this study is whether the laminar projection patterns are initially specific or become so upon later refinement (as happens with many projections). It seems possible that cells projecting to deep layers in a limited r/v domain may initially project more widely in the radial domain and then be refined to be in deep layers later? Similarly, the superficially projecting neurons could also be more radially distributed in their termination initially and then refine. This latter possibility for the Layer 1 projecting cells seems perhaps less likely since they project within Layer 1 for a long way and stay in that lamina – but then perhaps there are selective cues for these cells to stay in this lamina that are made by either selective interneurons or CR cells. Again, both of these possibilities seem like interesting follow-up questions.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.63249.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>[…] I have only minor concerns that can be addressed with minor revisions:</p><p>In Figure 2 and in the Results and Discussion the authors conclude that “Spatial embryonic origin does not predict projection topography of cholinergic neurons”.

In the revised work, we have addressed the issues raised and trust our work is now suitable for publication. Reviewer one points out that our spatially delineated Cre drivers are too broad to conclude that they do not mask a finer spatial restriction masked within these regions. We whole-heartedly agree with this concern and have revised the manuscript to recognize this caveat accordingly. They also point out that cell death may contribute to the laminar distributions that we observe in the mature cholinergic projections, a point we have also now acknowledged in the revised work. Reviewer two points out that the final precision may reflect some reorganization in the cholinergic fibers due to selective cues emanating from particular populations such as the CR or interneuron populations. We have also revised our work to discuss this interesting possibility.</p></body></sub-article></article>
