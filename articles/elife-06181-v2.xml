Conventional studies have focused on identifying the residues that have a direct involvement in an enzymatic reaction, but these so-called ‘catalytic residues’ are embedded in extensive interaction networks. Although fundamental to our understanding of enzyme function, evolution, and engineering, the properties of these networks have yet to be quantitatively and systematically explored. We dissected an interaction network of five residues in the active site of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> alkaline phosphatase. Analysis of the complex catalytic interdependence of specific residues identified three energetically independent but structurally interconnected functional units with distinct modes of cooperativity. From an evolutionary perspective, this network is orders of magnitude more probable to arise than a fully cooperative network. From a functional perspective, new catalytic insights emerge. Further, such comprehensive energetic characterization will be necessary to benchmark the algorithms required to rationally engineer highly efficient enzymes.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.06181.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06181.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06181.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Enzymes are biological catalysts that speed up the reactions that are essential for life. As such, enzymes convert ‘reactant’ molecules into other molecules. Reactant molecules bind to part of the enzyme called the active site. Some of the amino acids that make up the active site must directly interact with these molecules to catalyze the reaction.</p><p>Mutating individual active site amino acids often greatly reduces or destroys the ability of the enzyme to increase reaction rates. These amino acids are known as ‘catalytic residues’. However, catalytic residues do not work in isolation: instead, they interact with other residues in the enzyme to carry out their function. Therefore, the effects of these interactions need to be characterized in order to fully understand how enzymes work.</p><p>Sunden et al. explored the interactions within a network of five residues found at the active site of an enzyme, called alkaline phosphatase, which was taken from the bacterial species <italic>E. coli</italic>. Nearly all of the possible combinations of these five residues were examined. The results of these experiments indicated that even though all five residues are structurally linked, only a subset of the residues affected one another functionally, even though all of them are structurally connected. In particular, three groups—or functional units—of residues were found in the enzyme structure. The residues within each functional unit directly or indirectly cooperate to increase different aspects of the enzyme's catalytic activity. Sunden et al. used this information to develop models that describe how the functional units work together, and suggest that the likelihood of the active site evolving so that its residues are not fully cooperative is high.</p><p>It remains to be seen whether similar cooperative networks exist in the active sites of other enzymes and how residues further away affect those in and around the active site. Understanding how the residues in the active site work together and being able to model their interactions could help efforts to develop more efficient enzymes for use in biotechnology in the future.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.06181.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06181.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>alkaline phosphatase</kwd><kwd>structure function</kwd><kwd>enzyme mechanism</kwd><kwd>enzyme design</kwd><kwd>enzyme evolution</kwd><kwd>enzyme catalysis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM64798</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Herschlag</surname><given-names>Daniel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM049243</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Herschlag</surname><given-names>Daniel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000015</institution-id><institution>U.S. Department of Energy</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Office of Biological and Environmental Research</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sunden</surname><given-names>Fanny</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sunden</surname><given-names>Fanny</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000097</institution-id><institution>National Center for Research Resources (NCRR)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sunden</surname><given-names>Fanny</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sunden</surname><given-names>Fanny</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Biomedical Technology Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sunden</surname><given-names>Fanny</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation (NSF)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Graduate Research Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Peck</surname><given-names>Ariana</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-9"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004189</institution-id><institution>Max-Planck-Gesellschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ressl</surname><given-names>Susanne</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Conventional studies have focused on enzymatic residues directly involved in catalysis;

Remarkable progress has been made since catalysis was viewed as a ‘life force’ just over a century ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Buchner, 1897</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hein, 1961</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barnett, 2003</xref>). Now, the chemical moieties involved in enzymatic transformations can be identified by a combination of structural and functional approaches. The positions of functional groups in X-ray structures can typically be combined with chemical intuition to derive mechanisms for enzymatic reactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Benkovic and Bruice, 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Walsh, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Sinnott, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Silverman, 2002</xref>). Such mechanisms are routinely supported by site-directed mutagenesis experiments in which large deleterious rate effects are observed when putative catalytic residues are mutated.</p><p>While there remain a subset of reactions that are less understood and whose important and fascinating reaction details are still being worked out (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Das et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Weeks et al., 2012</xref>), we can write reasonable chemical mechanisms for the vast majority of enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Benkovic and Bruice, 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Walsh, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Sinnott, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Silverman, 2002</xref>). In contrast, our understanding of the energetics that underlie enzymatic catalysis is far less developed. Such understanding is critical for elucidating the pathways that have been followed in molecular evolution and for designing new, highly efficient enzymes.</p><p>The current dominant mechanistic tools, X-ray crystallography and removal of catalytic residues via site-directed mutagenesis, while powerful, have fundamental limitations. Structures reveal the positions of functional groups in active sites, but these static pictures do not allow reaction probabilities to be determined. Specifically, although energies derived from a given structure can, in principle, reveal potential energies, full sampling of the ensemble states of the enzyme, substrates, and surrounding solvent is needed to obtain free energies. It is difficult to combine such sampling with high-level energy functions and to make nontrivial predictions required for independent assessment of such energetic models.</p><p>Site-directed mutagenesis has two fundamental limitations. First, site-directed mutagenesis reads out the difference in free energy of the reaction (ΔΔG) for the mutant enzyme relative to the wild type (WT), and so does not report an absolute energetic contribution to catalysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kraut et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Herschlag and Natarajan, 2013</xref>). As an example, the vastly different assignments of the catalytic contributions of residues in the Ketosteroid Isomerase oxyanion hole, dependent on the type and extent of mutation, provide a particularly clear demonstration of this limitation and underscore the need to clearly and explicitly define the comparison states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kraut et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Schwans et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>The second limitation of site-directed mutagenesis is that enzymatic residues do not act in isolation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Narlikar and Herschlag, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kraut et al., 2003</xref>). The apparent contribution of one residue is also a function of the surrounding residues and the overall structure, as demonstrated by energetic coupling in double mutant cycles and more dramatically by the fact that a denatured protein still contains its catalytic residues but these so-called catalytic residues no longer provide catalysis (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kraut et al., 2003</xref> for discussion) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Carter et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Horovitz, 1996</xref>).</p><p>One seemingly important aspect of the interconnectivity of enzymatic residues is highlighted in X-ray structures, which typically reveal or suggest active site hydrogen bond networks and imply a functional connection between the identified catalytic residues and these more extensive ‘network residues’. Indeed, prior investigations have identified networks of energetically coupled residues in enzymes that contribute synergistically to catalysis. These studies include incisive double mutant cycle analysis demonstrating functional and energetic connections between residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hermes et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dion et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Horovitz et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Rajagopalan et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Masterson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Singh et al., 2014</xref>). Larger scale coupled networks have been observed through statistical analysis of co-evolution and characterization of individual residue's relaxation timescales by NMR (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lockless and Ranganathan, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Eisenmesser et al., 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">2005</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25"/>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">McElheny et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Freedman et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Halabi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Doucet et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>A remaining challenge, undertaken in this study, is to link mutant cycle analysis to extended networks. Currently, we lack the ability to ascertain the energetic properties of network residues from structural inspection, first principles, or empirical models. For example, do these networks act as fully cooperative units where disruption of any connection would dissipate the advantage from all of the residues in the network? In the other extreme, do certain side chains act independently from their network neighbors, positioned for function by their backbone placement and/or packing interactions with other portions of the side chain?</p><p>Although either extreme might be presumed unlikely, such expectations are not grounded in data given the current absence of quantitative assessments of these extended networks. We have therefore investigated the functional behaviors of an interaction network hypothesized from available structural data in the <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> alkaline phosphatase (AP) active site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Our experiments reveal and quantitatively delineate the energetic interconnectivity within this highly proficient active site, the type of active site that will be necessary to create if we are to engineer enzymes that rival the catalytic power of natural enzymes.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06181.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Alkaline phosphatase (AP) structure and active site.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The three-dimensional structure of AP with bound P<sub>i</sub> (PDB 3TG0).

The energetic effects we refer to here and in the remainder of this study are related to free energy differences. Prior work identified E322, which is required for Mg<sup>2+</sup> binding, and R166 as catalytic residues, with mutations of these leading to 88,000 and 6300-fold decreases in the rate of catalytic activity, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Zalatan et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">O'Brien et al., 2008</xref>). Nevertheless, these residues are part of an extensive hydrogen-bonded and Mg<sup>2+</sup>-coordinating network that also involves D101, D153, K328, the Mg<sup>2+</sup> ion liganded by E322, and two water molecules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p><p>As described in the following sections, we determined the effects of removing each of the five side chains of this apparent network individually and in combination. To determine if a residue's contribution is independent of or dependent on the other side chains, we determined the activity of a minimal form of the AP active site with all five residues mutated, herein referred to as AP minimal (D101A/D153A/R166S/E322Y/K328A), and we also restored each side chain individually to this minimal enzyme. As described below, the results indicated a strong interdependence of the residues, prompting us to explore these interconnections by making nearly all possible combinations of these five mutants (28 out of 32; 2<sup>n</sup>, where n = 5, the number of positions mutated). Our results identified three interconnected functional units, each with distinct underlying energetic properties, and allowed us to develop a quantitative model that reproduces the observed rate constants and predicts the rate constants of the remaining four mutants not tested herein.

In each case, there was a larger deleterious effect from removing the residue than the rate enhancement afforded by adding it back. The differential effects ranged from 2.6 to &gt;1900-fold, corresponding to differential energetic effects of up to at least 4.5 kcal/mol. Indeed, D153 added back in isolation is deleterious by at least 10-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) but beneficial by 230-fold when added in the otherwise WT background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Further, the small 2.6-fold (0.57 kcal/mol) differential between restoring D101 to AP minimal and removing it from WT AP likely arises coincidentally from different mechanistic contributions (see below). Thus, each of the five residues has some energetic connection to at least one residue in this network. Overall, the contribution from adding all five residues back is 580-fold greater than predicted from assuming energetically additive effects from addition of each residue individually (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ1">Equation 1</xref>).</p><p>An empirical or theoretical framework to explain this energetic behavior is lacking. In particular, there is no way to discern from structural inspection of an active site whether all neighbors have substantial energetic interactions, the scale and form of these energetic connections, or whether and how far beyond nearest neighbors functional effects extend.

Mutation of R166 to serine or alanine has a similar energetic effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">O'Brien et al., 2008</xref>), and given the energetic similarity of R166S and R166A and the practical limits on the number of mutants that could be investigated, we used R166S in all subsequent experiments.</p><p>The effects of the other residues on R166 were determined by comparing the effect of mutation of this residue (R166S) in 13 different mutant backgrounds. We first determined the effects of D153 and D101, which are both within hydrogen bonding distance of R166. In the extremes, if the function of R166 was fully dependent on the neighboring aspartate residues then there would be little or no effect from adding back the R166 side chain in the absence of both D101 and D153. Alternatively, if R166 was independent of its neighbors, its full catalytic effect would be restored regardless of the presence of the aspartate residues.</p><p>Relative to the full effect of 6300-fold from addition of the R166 side chain with all other residues present, addition of this side chain in the absence of both aspartate side chains gives a much smaller rate increase of only ∼10-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, left black bar). The presence of either aspartate residue increases the catalytic effectiveness of R166, such that reintroduction of the arginine side chain contributes 170 or 220-fold with D153 or D101 present, respectively, more than the increase from R166 addition with neither aspartate residue present. However, this is still considerably less than the 6300-fold increase with both aspartate residues present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, black bars).<fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06181.007</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Catalytic effects of R166 in different mutant backgrounds.</title><p>The effects of restoring R166 in different aspartate backgrounds with the Mg<sup>2+</sup> ion and K328 present (black) or absent (grey).

In contrast, E322Y AP, which lacks the bound Mg<sup>2+</sup> ion that is not part of the R166 functional unit, does not influence the position of R166 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Zalatan et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>To further explore the effects of the aspartate residues on the R166 functional unit, we solved the crystal structure of D101A/D153A AP (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). In one subunit of the AP homodimer, the guanidinium group is flipped away from the active site and adopts a catalytically unproductive conformation that is similar to the conformation observed in one structure of D153G, but more displaced than in the other structure of D153G and D101S AP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). In the other monomer, R166 was observed to populate two rotameric positions, one of which is similarly flipped away from the active site while the other is pointed towards the active site. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Although this structure lacks a bound Mg<sup>2+</sup> ion in the active site, the functional and structural data presented above suggest that this loss will not influence the position of R166. In both active sites of D101A/D153A AP, the bound P<sub>i</sub> is not well positioned, populating multiple conformations that are each distinct from its position in WT AP, which likely closely mimics the reactive phosphoryl conformation (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app2">Appendix 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Appendix 2 Figure 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Holtz et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">O'Brien et al., 2008</xref>). These structural comparisons provide evidence that the aspartate residues that flank R166 help to correctly position the reactive phosphoryl group and provide a self-consistent picture of the functional effects of the D101/R166/D153 functional unit. Nevertheless, a future challenge will be to quantitatively link structural rearrangements and resulting structural ensembles to functional effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Frederick et al., 2007</xref>).<table-wrap id="tbl2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06181.008</object-id><label>Table 2.</label><caption><p>X-ray crystallographic data collection and refinement statistics</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.06181.008">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06181.008</ext-link></p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr><td colspan="2">Data collection</td></tr><tr><td> Space group</td><td>P6<sub>3</sub>22</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"> Unit cell axes</td></tr><tr><td> <italic>a, b, c</italic> (Å)</td><td>161.4, 161.4, 140.1</td></tr><tr><td> <italic>α, β, γ</italic> (<sup>ο</sup>)</td><td>90.0, 90.0, 120.0</td></tr><tr><td> Resolution range (Å)</td><td>52.89–2.24 (2.31–2.24)<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="tblfn22">*</xref>,<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="tblfn23">†</xref></td></tr><tr><td> R<sub>merge</sub> (%)</td><td>43.0 (305.9)</td></tr><tr><td> R<sub>pim</sub> (%)<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="tblfn24">‡</xref></td><td>9.6 (71.9)</td></tr><tr><td> &lt;I&gt;/&lt;σI&gt;</td><td>7.8 (1.4)</td></tr><tr><td> Completeness (%)</td><td>100.0 (100.0)</td></tr><tr><td> Multiplicity</td><td>21.6 (19.7)</td></tr><tr><td> <italic>CC</italic><sub>1/2</sub></td><td>0.996 (0.582)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2">Refinement</td></tr><tr><td> Resolution range (Å)</td><td>52.89–2.24<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="tblfn23">†</xref></td></tr><tr><td> No. unique reflections</td><td>51,819 (5086)</td></tr><tr><td> R<sub>work</sub>/R<sub>free</sub> (%)</td><td>21.7/25.9</td></tr><tr><td> Number of atoms</td><td>6794</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"> Average B-factors (Å<sup>2</sup>)</td></tr><tr><td>  protein</td><td>37.8</td></tr><tr><td>  water</td><td>30.2</td></tr><tr><td>  ligands</td><td>41.2</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"> R.m.s. deviation from ideality</td></tr><tr><td>  Bond length (Å)</td><td>0.006</td></tr><tr><td>  Bond angles (<sup>ο</sup>)</td><td>1.10</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"> Ramachandran statistics</td></tr><tr><td>  Favored regions (%)</td><td>98.4</td></tr><tr><td>  Allowed regions (%)</td><td>1.6</td></tr><tr><td>  Outliers (%)</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td> PDB code</td><td>4YR1</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn id="tblfn22"><label>*</label><p>Values in parenthesis are for the highest resolution shell.</p></fn><fn id="tblfn23"><label>†</label><p>The high resolution cut-off applied during scaling and refinement was decided based on CC<sub>1/2</sub> and completeness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Diederichs and Karplus, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Evans and Murshudov, 2013</xref>).</p></fn><fn id="tblfn24"><label>‡</label><p>R<sub>pim</sub> is reported in addition to R<sub>merge</sub> due to the high multiplicity of the data set.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06181.009</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Structure of the active site of D101A/D153A AP.</title><p>The active sites of the superimposed crystal structures of P<sub>i</sub>-bound D101A/D153A AP (protein: blue, P<sub>i</sub>: orange) and P<sub>i</sub>-bound WT AP (protein: white, P<sub>i</sub>: transparent).

From a functional perspective, given the close quarters within an active site, even if fully independent functional units were readily obtainable, interconnected units might still be preferable to allow a compact active site that can accommodate the density of groups needed to provide multiple interactions with centrally located substrates and thus optimal catalysis. From an evolutionary perspective, parsimony in natural selection might be expected to lead to multiple uses of the same residue, such that one residue could serve in two functional units, and one functional unit might serve as a foundation or scaffold from which to build other functional units, thereby leading to interconnected functional units. This idea is related to a proposal of Hanson and Rose that natural selection favors the use of the minimal number of acidic and basic residues in active sites, so that such residues tend to be reused when mechanistically reasonable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hanson and Rose, 1975</xref>).</p><p>Whereas AP in its fully evolved form has functionally distinct D101/R166/D153 and D153/Mg<sup>2+</sup>/K328 units (i.e., these functional units do not provide an additional advantage to one another), mutations that disrupt the surrounding AP scaffold could alter these energetics and possibly render these units energetically interdependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Narlikar and Herschlag, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kraut et al., 2003</xref>).

A second structural connection between D101 and the Mg<sup>2+</sup> ion can be traced as follows: D51 is a ligand of both the Mg<sup>2+</sup> ion and the Zn<sup>2+</sup> ion that coordinates the nucleophilic oxyanion of S102 (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>Z</mml:mi><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn><mml:mo>+</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>), and D101 is directly upstream of S102, with its side chain anchored to the backbone amide of S102 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2-3-2"><title>What is the origin of their anti-cooperative energetics?</title><p>Given this connection, why are these energetically anti-cooperative—that is, how is a favorable effect from each residue prevented or obviated by the presence of the other residue? A model that D101 and the Mg<sup>2+</sup> ion can each make a catalytic interaction alone that is prevented by a steric block or conformational rearrangement upon addition of the other residue would require fortuitous catalytic interactions present in mutant enzyme forms that are not maintained in WT and is therefore unlikely. A more appealing model is the one in which the two residues have a redundant effect, such that either residue can alone provide a rate advantage through the same mechanism. Given that D51 is a ligand of both the Mg<sup>2+</sup> ion and the Zn<sup>2+</sup> ion that coordinates the nucleophilic oxyanion of S102 (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf2"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>Z</mml:mi><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn><mml:mo>+</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>), the Mg<sup>2+</sup> ion could help position the serine oxyanion with respect to the rest of the catalytic apparatus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). D101 is directly upstream of S102 with its side chain anchored to the backbone amide of the S102. Thus, it is possible that either D101 or Mg<sup>2+</sup> interactions can facilitate proper positioning of the S102 oxyanion for nucleophilic attack and that, once either of the two interactions is made, positioning is optimized such that no further functional enhancement occurs upon addition of the second (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2-3-3"><title>Active site redundancy</title><p>As described above, our energetic data indicate that there is a redundant effect of the Mg<sup>2+</sup> ion and D101.

It is sometimes suggested that more ‘important’ pathways or functions evolve redundancy, but more complex mechanisms are required to maintain redundancy, otherwise it would simply be lost over evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cookea et al., 1997</xref>). One intriguing idea is that redundancy is built to aid evolvability, and evolvability itself is a property that has been selected for over evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Maynard Smith, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Conrad, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Joyce, 1997</xref>). It is also possible that many reported cases of redundancy have individual functional effects that are too small to be detected in laboratory assays or have favorable functional effects that manifest only under natural growth conditions.</p><p>We propose a distinct origin of the D101/Mg<sup>2+</sup> redundancy, arising from the high degree of connectivity within the AP active site. D101 and the Mg<sup>2+</sup> ion are each involved in other functional networks and are embedded in an extensively interwoven active site. These interconnections presumably position functional groups to make optimal catalytic interactions. As noted above, the functional networks overlap with one another that is, have shared residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>), and these overlaps may have arisen as evolution co-opted residues within active sites as anchor points for positioning new residues. Given the high density of functional groups within active sites and the presumed need for multiple interconnections to provide optimal positioning of functional groups for transition state interactions, residues that evolved for different functional purposes may end up structurally linked and with the ability to position the same group or groups.<fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06181.016</object-id><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>AP active site functional units.</title><p>The residues of the functional unit are color-coded as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>.

Site-directed mutagenesis reveals residues that give large functional effects upon mutation, and double mutant cycles provide powerful tests for energetic dependence vs independence between two residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Carter et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hertel et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Horovitz, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Narlikar et al., 1999</xref>). However, residues never function in isolation, and essentially every residue in a protein structure can be connected, via chains of hydrogen bonding and packing interactions, to every other residue. In cases of allostery, there are energetic interactions over large distances, and in certain cases the residues and conformations involved in the allosteric transition have been mapped (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Monod et al., 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Shulman et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cui and Karplus, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">McLaughlin et al., 2012</xref>). We are particularly interested in active site networks because the residues constituting these networks are critical for the most basic catalytic functions of enzymes, these networks have not been previously mapped, and an understanding of their extent and properties may facilitate engineering of enzymes that rival natural enzymes in catalytic efficiency and specificity.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Active site networks and functional units</title><p>We have interrogated a network of five residues in the active site of the model enzyme AP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). A priori, these residues could have functioned fully cooperatively or fully independently. Although either extreme might have been considered unlikely, there were no data for this system (or, to our knowledge, other systems) that would allow us to know or predict the degree and extent of functional interconnectivity.</p><p>We observed three overlapping functional units, D101/R166/D153, D153/Mg<sup>2+</sup>/K328, and D101/Mg<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). Each functional unit exhibited distinct energetic behaviors. The aspartate residues of the D101/R166/D153 unit make nearly independent contributions to the catalytic function of the central arginine residue; D153 and K328 (and presumably their associated water molecules) act cooperatively with the Mg<sup>2+</sup> ion and increase its contribution to catalysis; and the Mg<sup>2+</sup> ion and D101 are energetically anti-cooperative and apparently constitute a redundant functional unit.</p><p>A mathematical model that describes these energetics quantitatively accounts for all of the AP variants, reproducing the observed catalytic rates for all 28 mutants within a factor of two and predicting the catalytic rates of the remaining four variants that were not tested herein (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl5">Appendix 1 Table 2</xref>). Nevertheless, the atomic-level interactions and properties that underlie each of these distinct and complex energetic behaviors are not known. We propose the following models: each aspartate residue of the D101/R166/D153 unit helps to position R166, thereby lowering the conformational entropy cost for making its interactions with the two phosphoryl oxygen atoms; the network of the D153/Mg<sup>2+</sup>/K328 functional unit and its two associated water molecules exists in alternative, likely less structured conformations until all three of these groups are present and can position hydrogen bond donors to one of the oxygen atoms of the transferred phosphoryl group; and D101 and the Mg<sup>2+</sup> ion can each position the serine oxyanion nucleophile with respect to <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf3"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>Z</mml:mi><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn><mml:mo>+</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>, rendering their contributions redundant.

An interconnected active site will have fewer residues and thus require a less expansive search of mutational space. Further, multiple functional groups need to ‘pack’ into a limited space to interact with the substrate and stabilize the transition state.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Synergy between experimental and computational enzymology</title><p>The approach taken in this study introduces a powerful opportunity to deepen the feedback loop between experiment and computation. It is generally recognized that the most powerful tests of computational approaches are true predictions, made ‘blindly’ with pertinent data not yet collected or obtained by others but not released prior to reporting computational results and predictions. Such blind predictions have proven critical in other areas of biochemistry and biophysics to determine whether seemingly predictive and descriptive algorithms were indeed predictive and correct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Moult et al., 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">2011</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60"/>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Nielsen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cruz et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dill and MacCallum, 2012</xref>). Nevertheless, the vast majority of computational studies of enzyme mechanism make ‘predictions’ for results that are already known and are thus not true independent tests. Further, single active site mutations predominantly give effects that fall within typical and rather narrow ranges, limiting the usefulness of traditional site-directed mutagenesis as a robust test of computational approaches.</p><p>We suggest that computational predictions of the rate effects from multiple mutations may provide extensive and nontrivial predictions that can be quantitatively tested by experiment and that are needed to effectively advance computational methods and our understanding. Our group is willing to test predictions from individual computational groups or consortia, using AP or other systems where we know robust kinetic measurements are possible; we are willing to carry out such experiments in advance and withhold the results or send them to an independent evaluator to ensure that comparisons between experiment and computation will be possible and made in a timely manner; and we are willing to discuss with computational groups the best systems to carry out such tests. We strongly believe that such synergistic approaches, informal and formal, will be required to unite computational and experimental enzymology and to make the greatest advances in our understanding of catalysis.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Enzyme design</title><p>There has been recent excitement about the ability to design new enzymes, some of which catalyze reactions not seen in nature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Röthlisberger et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Siegel et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hilvert, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bos and Roelfes, 2014</xref>). The ability to repurpose and create protein scaffolds and to place functional groups in desired locations is a truly remarkable advance. Nevertheless, designed enzymes to-date have modest rate enhancements relative to naturally occurring enzymes and can lack the stereospecificity observed with naturally occurring enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Wolfenden and Snide, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lassila et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baker, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bos and Roelfes, 2014</xref>). Indeed, enzyme mimics and bovine serum albumin (BSA) can catalyze reactions with rate enhancements similar to designed enzymes prior to their improvement by randomization and selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kirkby et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Schmidt et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>These observations raise the following questions: what distinguishes naturally occurring enzymes from current designed enzymes, and what is needed to achieve more proficient designs? The most apparent difference is the absence of extended and extensive hydrogen bond networks in and around active sites of designed enzymes. For example, the most carefully studied designed enzyme, a retroaldolase, has a lysine residue placed within a hydrophobic pocket (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Jiang et al., 2008</xref>). Rate enhancements are achieved by lowering the lysine p<italic>K</italic><sub>a</sub> due to its non-polar environment (to increase the concentration of the reactive free amine at neutral pH) and from binding the hydrophobic substrate in this lysine-containing pocket; these mechanisms provide ∼10<sup>5</sup>-fold catalysis for a designed enzyme, with modest additional rate enhancement obtained through subsequent rounds of selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lassila et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hilvert, 2013</xref>).</p><p>We hope that an empirical understanding of the extent and properties of active site networks will help in future design efforts as well as promote more conceptual and theoretical understanding. Although it would not be appropriate to generalize from the single example of AP, our dissection of the AP active site network does show that optimal positioning of catalytic residues can occur with only a subset of the full network; thus, it may be possible to attempt designs with active site modules that correspond to functional units identified in this study and, we hope, subsequent studies. A recent attempt to incorporate an active site catalytic triad produced designed enzymes that, after several rounds of selection, were able to catalyze a side reaction with efficiencies similar to analogous natural enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Rajagopalan et al., 2014</xref>). Taking a longer view, the hand-in-hand development and testing of computational approaches, as outlined above (see ‘Synergy between experimental and computational enzymology’), will ultimately provide foundational models for the efficient design of highly effective and specific new enzymes.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Evolutionary pathways and probabilities</title><p>The evolution of a fully cooperative network would be exceedingly improbable and more difficult the larger the number of constituent residues, as all of the residues would need to arise through random drift with a selective advantage accruing only once the entire network was in place. A probability model in which each of five residues would arise with a one in twenty probability (i.e., one active residue out of the total 20 amino acids) and all are needed for a selective advantage (i.e., full cooperativity) has a probability of 1/(6.8 × 10<sup>5</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A</xref>, bottom pathway and <xref ref-type="app" rid="app3">Appendix 3</xref>). This probability arises because there are five steps (or positions) each with 20 possible residues, and there are five chances of ‘choosing’ a WT residue, starting with AP minimal with all five WT residues missing, four chances of choosing the next residue, etc.<fig id="fig10" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06181.017</object-id><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><title>Cooperative and independent models of active site evolution.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic comparing fully cooperative (bottom) and stepwise (top) models for a single pathway. In the fully cooperative model, simultaneous acquisition of all five WT residues is required to confer a selective advantage, leading to a mean waiting time of 4.7 × 10<sup>5</sup> (arbitrary units) considering all 120 pathways of adding in the residues (black net rates; for simplicity, only one intermediate of the multiple possible mutant combinations is shown in each step). In contrast, the stepwise model, in which acquisition of any WT residue confers a fitness advantage and is thus irreversible (top, black numbers), has a minimum mean waiting time of 32. If only one of the 120 pathways leads to a stepwise increase in fitness (top, grey numbers) then the mean waiting time would be 69. The model and simplifying assumptions made to highlight the differences arising from the presence or absence of cooperativity are described in <xref ref-type="app" rid="app3">Appendix 3</xref>. (<bold>B</bold>) Model of active site evolution showing the 120 possible paths in the AP landscape for introduction of the five residues investigated herein, in an otherwise WT background. A stepwise model in which acquisition of any WT residue is considered irreversible and all paths are possible would result in a mean waiting time of 32 (all arrows, grey and black, same as part <bold>A</bold>, top). As a subset of mutagenic steps toward WT AP (36 of the 80 potential evolutionary steps) confers a selective advantage (here defined as a rate increase of &gt;threefold) and paths containing steps that do not confer such an advantage have much lower probabilities, we consider the 34 of 120 pathways that provide a monotonic fitness increase as all five WT residues are added. This gives a mean waiting time between the mean waiting times for the stepwise models for a single pathway and 120 pathways, 32 and 69, respectively.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.06181.017">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06181.017</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-06181-fig10-v2.tif"/></fig></p><p>Conversely, evolution of a hypothetical enzyme in which each active site residue provides an independent rate advantage would be considerably more probable, as addition of those residues would lead to monotonically increasing catalysis (i.e., be continually uphill on a fitness landscape and thus selected for after each addition). We first consider a simplified model with a single pathway of five successive steps that each lead to increased fitness, each with a one in twenty probability representing a single advantageous residue of the twenty possible residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A</xref>, top path, black numbers). The probability of achieving the final state for a multi-step process can be considered in terms of a mean waiting time, akin to a reaction's half-time or the inverse of its rate constant (scaled by ln 2). In this case, with five successive irreversible steps each with probability 1/20, the ‘rate constant’ is 1/100 and the mean wait time is 69 (in arbitrary units; <xref ref-type="app" rid="app3">Appendix 3</xref>). (Calculating probabilistic waiting times using a hidden Markov Model, such as is often used for probability calculations, gives the same relative values as the kinetic mean times [<xref ref-type="app" rid="app3">Appendix 3</xref>].) This kinetic mean wait time is about three orders of magnitude lower than that for the fully cooperative process, which is obtained by computing the mean waiting time: 4.7 × 10<sup>5</sup> (=6.8 × 10<sup>5</sup> × ln 2; <xref ref-type="app" rid="app3">Appendix 3</xref>). Thus, if it were functionally equally probable to obtain an active site with these different underlying energetic properties (i.e., fully cooperative vs stepwise; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A</xref>), evolution would favor the non-cooperative solution by greater than 1000-fold. In other words, for every enzyme that evolved five residues with full functional dependence on one another, there would be more than 1000 with active sites containing residues whose stepwise addition each provided a selective advantage.</p><p>As we observed functional units exhibiting a range of energetic behaviors within the AP active site, we asked the question: where does the energetic behavior of AP place it along this wide range of evolutionary probabilities? There are 120 possible pathways from AP minimal to WT AP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B</xref>). To assess the range of possible mean waiting times, we consider two limiting cases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A</xref>, top pathway): i. The case in which there is a single pathway of the 120 that is favorable; this is the simplified model presented above and gives a mean wait time of 69. ii. The case in which all 120 potential pathways are favorable—that is, proceed with a selective advantage at each step; in this case the mean waiting time is 32, even shorter than for case (i) because there are more ways to traverse the landscape from AP minimal to WT AP.</p><p>Because we have rate constants for each AP species (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), we can determine which pathways would confer a selective advantage. Using an arbitrary minimal cutoff of &gt;threefold increase in <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>cat</italic></sub>/<italic>K</italic><sub>M</sub>, 34 of the 120 pathways confer a fitness advantage; with a cut-off of a fivefold increase in <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>cat</italic></sub>/<italic>K</italic><sub>M</sub>, 28 of these pathways remain. Thus, although the AP active site residues studied herein have varied energetic behaviors, in many cases addition of a WT residue leads to a significant rate increase, providing multiple favorable evolutionary routes. While not all 120 pathways are favorable for AP, many are, and the mean waiting time will thus be within the range of 32–69, &gt;1000-fold shorter than the expected waiting time to evolve a fully cooperative network.</p><p>Although a fully cooperative network would probably not have been anticipated, we were unaware of how strong the evolutionary pressure would be for stepwise increases in fitness. Similar conclusions have been drawn for the evolution of unlinked loci where largely additive rather than fully cooperative or synergistic effects have been observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arnegard et al., 2014</xref>). It will be fascinating to explore more broadly the interplay of functional effects and evolutionary probabilities and how this interplay has biased the complement of extant enzymes. Such underlying probabilistic preferences presumably also impact biological solutions at higher levels of function such as gene regulation and neuronal function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">McLean et al., 2011</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Implications for exclusion of water from active sites</title><p>Many enzymes have loops or flaps that close over active sites or domains that accomplish analogous closure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Pai et al., 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bennett and Steitz, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alber et al., 1987</xref>). These events exclude solvent, and it is often stated or implied that the exclusion of water provides the underlying driving force to evolve these processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Pai et al., 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bennett and Steitz, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Harris et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cleland et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Richard and Amyes, 2004</xref>). However, the observation that water is excluded does not logically indicate that the exclusion of water causes enhanced catalysis.</p><p>AP has an open cavity to allow cleavage of a wide range of phosphate esters, consistent with its putative role in scavenging inorganic phosphate; nevertheless, it has one of the largest known rate enhancements, suggesting that full exclusion of water is not required to attain extremely efficient enzymatic catalysis.</p><p>AP does, however, appear to exclude water from access to the non-bridging phosphoryl oxygen atoms, and we considered whether that exclusion is catalytically important. Removal of R166 (and D101), which allows solvent access to the phosphoryl oxygen atoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">O'Brien et al., 2008</xref>) does not diminish the catalytic contribution from the Mg<sup>2+</sup> ion or the D153/Mg<sup>2+</sup>/K328 functional unit, which also interact with at least one of these phosphoryl oxygen atoms. Thus, at least for AP, the wholesale exclusion of solvent from the active site does not enhance catalytic contributions. We suggest, most generally, that flap or domain closure allows the establishment of additional specific interactions for optimal transition state interactions while providing a route for the ingress and egress of substrates and products, rather than generic rate enhancements from solvent exclusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Wolfenden, 1974</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">1976</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93"/>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alber et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Herschlag, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Pompliano et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Herschlag, 1991</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-9"><title>Closing remarks</title><p>A deeper investigation into the energetics and energetic interconnections within an active site—that of <italic>E. coli</italic> AP—has led to new knowledge, new models for catalytic effects, and a quantitative assessment of the evolutionary probability of establishing an active site network.

Enzyme concentrations were varied by at least fivefold, and substrate concentrations were extended to at least fivefold below the <italic>K</italic><sub>M</sub> value for each enzyme based on <italic>K</italic><sub>M</sub> values determined over wider ranges of substrate. Reaction rates were linear in enzyme concentration at each substrate concentration for each enzyme, and no reaction was observed without added enzyme. Values of <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub>/<italic>K</italic><sub>M</sub> determined from linear fits to the lowest substrate concentrations were the same, within error, as values determined from full Michaelis–Menten fits, and R<sup>2</sup> values were &gt;0.98 in all cases.

The E322Y mutants exhibited time-dependent Zn<sup>2+</sup> activation, as observed previously, and were shown to level to a maximal rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Zalatan et al., 2008</xref>). Mutants with E322 not mutated were incubated in storage buffer with Mg<sup>2+</sup> added (10 mM sodium MOPS, pH 7.0, 50 mM NaCl, 100 µM ZnCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>). To test for kinetic effects arising from decreased metal affinity of the mutants compared to WT, mutants R166S, D101A/R166S/D153A/K328A, D101A/D153A, E322Y, D101A/R166S/D153A/E322Y/K328A, and D101A/R166S were also incubated with varying Zn<sup>2+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentrations for a week. The following metal ion concentrations were used in the incubation experiment: 100 µM ZnCl<sub>2</sub>; 1.0 mM ZnCl<sub>2</sub>; 100 µM ZnCl<sub>2</sub> and 100 µM MgCl<sub>2</sub>; 100 µM ZnCl<sub>2</sub> and 1.0 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>; 100 µM ZnCl<sub>2</sub> and 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>; 1.0 mM ZnCl<sub>2</sub> and 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>.

The activities of mutants R166S, D101A/R166S/D153A/K328A, D101A/D153A, and D101A/R166S do not increase with higher concentrations of Mg<sup>2+</sup>.</p><p>Phosphate monoester hydrolysis by D101A, D153A, R166S, and D101A/D153A AP was also measured with methyl phosphate (Me-P), using the same reaction buffer and conditions as for pNPP. The formation of the inorganic phosphate (P<sub>i</sub>) product from Me-P hydrolysis was monitored discontinuously by withdrawing aliquots from ongoing reactions, quenching in 6 M guanidine-HCl, and detecting P<sub>i</sub> with a modified Malachite Green assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lanzetta et al., 1979</xref>) at eight or more specified times. Rate constants were determined from initial rates, and activity of the free enzyme, <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub>/<italic>K</italic><sub>M</sub>, was determined. At least two different enzyme concentrations and at least seven different substrate concentrations were used for each enzyme.

The metal ion occupancies were consistent with an active site saturated with Zn<sup>2+</sup> and lacking Mg<sup>2+</sup> (Zn<sup>2+</sup>:protein ratio 2.49; Mg<sup>2+</sup>: protein ratio 0.01; P<sub>i</sub>: protein ratio 0.06).

model for the energetic behavior of the five-residue AP active site network.</title><p>Removal of individual residues from WT AP gives different catalytic effects than introduction of the same residues in a minimal background lacking all five of the investigated residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B</xref>). These differences indicate that an independent model to account for the effect of the individual residues cannot accurately reproduce the data. In a mathematical sense, more than five variables are needed. Here we develop a minimal mathematical model to account for all 32 AP variants. This model accurately reproduces the 28 measured rate constants (within twofold; table below) and provides predictions for the four unmeasured rate constants.</p><p>Our analyses in the ‘Results and discussion’ sections identify three functional units. If these units fully account for the functional interactions between side chains then we should be able to accurately fit the data with a mathematical model with the following components (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ2">Equation 2</xref> below): 1.

For AP mutants with <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub>/<italic>K</italic><sub>M</sub> values for pNPP hydrolysis that are substantially smaller than that for WT AP and therefore likely are rate-limited by the chemical step instead of substrate association, the ratio of reactivity of pNPP to Me-P (or other alkyl phosphates) is in the range of 1000–5000 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Pompliano et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Eisenmesser et al., 2002</xref>). (The lower <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub>/<italic>K</italic><sub>M</sub> value for alkyl phosphates presumably arises in large part due to their lower intrinsic reactivity, which is reflected in their high leaving group p<italic>K</italic><sub>a</sub> relative to pNPP p<italic>K</italic><sub>a</sub> = ∼16 and 7 for alkyl alcohols and p-nitrophenol, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Evans and Murshudov, 2013</xref>].)

The similar values of these ratios for all AP variants other than WT strongly suggest that the chemical step is rate limiting or nearly rate limiting in all cases. The small variations of the ratios could represent experimental error, small idiosyncrasies of individual mutants, or a not-quite fully rate-limiting chemical step for the mutants with the smaller ratios (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>). These small differences, if present in the chemical step, would not affect any of the conclusions drawn herein. In principle we could have used Me-P for all of the comparisons instead of pNPP and a correction for WT (see below), but the faster intrinsic reactivity of pNPP has allowed us to measure AP mutants that are over a billion-fold slower than WT and will allow future comparisons with considerably less reactive AP substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">McCoy et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Emsley et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>As alluded to above, to provide a <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub>/<italic>K</italic><sub>M</sub> value for WT AP that could be compared with the mutant APs, that is, that represented the same rate-limiting step, we calculated the <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub>/<italic>K</italic><sub>M</sub> value expected for pNPP if the chemical step were rate limiting, that is, if the binding equilibration were sufficiently fast such that association were not rate limiting. To accomplish this we used the procedure of O'Brien et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Eisenmesser et al., 2002</xref>), assuming that the ratio of the barrier height for the chemical step for Me-P vs pNPP is the same for WT AP as it is for R166S AP, a reasonable assumption given the similarity of this ratio for a range of mutants and the observation that R166 interacts with the non-bridging phosphoryl oxygen atoms that are common in the two substrates and does not interact with the leaving groups, which are different.

A mean waiting time (t<sub>mean</sub>) is the same as a reaction halftime for processes that can be described by an exponential: that is, t<sub>mean</sub> = (ln 2/<italic>k</italic>) = 0.693/<italic>k</italic>. In the main text, we only provide mean waiting times in cases that can be described by an exponential form, as simulations are required for models with non-exponential forms and the conclusions in this study do not rest on such details.</p><p>A hidden Markov Model can also be used to calculate the mean waiting time. Assume that we allow five positions to mutate in any order to their WT residues using a discrete time process, and when any position is mutated to the WT residue, it is fixed. We additionally assume that at each step, mutations are modeled as occurring uniformly at random at any position that has not yet been fixed to the WT residue. (For simplicity, we consider mutations at the amino acid rather than the nucleotide level; this simplification does not significantly alter the conclusions.)

The detailed findings and their interpretation will interest the specialist, but the larger picture will interest a broader readership.

Here, the authors relied on properties of two AP-derived model systems: a WT enzyme that contains individual point mutations of five catalytically critical residues: D101, D153, R166, E322 (a mutation that abrogates binding of catalytic Mg<sup>2+</sup>) and K328 and a minimal enzyme, where all five of these residues are mutagenized and individual WT residues added back into this minimal background. Measurements of <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>cat</italic></sub><italic>/K</italic><sub>M</sub> in these mutants have allowed authors to determine if the catalytic effects of any of these residues individually are dependent on the context of any of the other four.</p><p>The study reveals three functional subunits, which while structurally interconnected are coupled in terms of free energy. The conclusions are based on elegantly designed, very clean experiments where the side chain of interest is added into the WT or the minimal background, and effect of <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>cat</italic></sub><italic>/K</italic><sub>M</sub> measured. While, for example, the catalytic effectiveness of R166 is enhanced by D101 and D153, it is unaffected by the presence or absence of K328 and Mg<sup>2+</sup>. These experiments led to a conclusion that D101/R166/D153 form a functional unit, which is supported by the observed distortion and flipping away of the guanidine group in X-ray structures of previously published D153G and newly acquired D101A/D153A AP, while the positioning of Arg in the structure of E322Y AP is the same as in the WT. Similarly, D153/ Mg<sup>2+</sup>/K328 form a functional unit, and so do D101/Mg<sup>2+</sup>. While all three functional subunits are uncoupled in terms of free energy, they are interconnected as they share residues in common. The authors speculate that such arrangement is preferred, given the limited space in the active site. Additionally, they postulate that multiple uses of a same residue is, evolutionarily, a more feasible scenario.</p><p>Overall, the study is highly significant and it provides a blueprint for interrogation of functional interconnectivity in an active site.</p><p>Major issue to address:</p><p>The manuscript, as presently written, fails to do justice to the large body of extant work on internal coupling in proteins. The article begins with the statement that the establishment of functional connected catalytic units within an enzyme's active site has not been previously accomplished. That may be true for alkaline phosphatase but as a general statement it is false. Studies on triose phosphate isomerase, ribonuclease, and dihydrofolate reductase have established the presence of a coupled network of catalytic residues both within and outside the catalytic site that would qualify under the author's definition as interconnected catalytic units. Modern computational methods when combined with experimental data provide for powerful insights because the entire enzyme can be taken into consideration. Small individual units are often found embedded in larger secondary protein elements with the latter being the “unit”. Finally, the conclusion that the evaluation of the five residues subject to mutation arrived evolutionarily in a stepwise rather than a cooperative process is widely anticipated based on numerous literature articles.</p><p>There are too many key papers that have not been cited:</p><p><italic>Dihydrofolate reductase:</italic></p><p>a) Howell et al., 1993 (suppressor mutations);</p><p>b) Wright et al., 2005 (residue connectivity through relaxation NMR);</p><p>c) Kohen et al., 2014 (connectivity through temperature dependent isotope efforts);</p><p>d) Benkovic et al., 2002 (double/triple mutation of active site residues); and</p><p>e) Romanathan/Hammes-Schiffer (molecular mechanics calculations).</p><p><italic>Triose phosphate isomerase:</italic></p><p>Knowles et al., 1990, and Petsko et al., 1987.</p><p><italic>Ribonuclease:</italic></p><p>Numerous authors.</p><p>Other specific issues to address in the manuscript:</p><p>1) The adjective “deep” should be removed from the Title and a section heading in the paper.

The prior results make two general important points that are now described in the manuscript (along with the pertinent references): 1) There are energetic interactions between active site residues (e.g., the effects of mutations in DHFR on the ‘top’ and ‘bottom’ of the substrate binding pocket); and 2) There are many examples of long-range effects and long-range coupling between residues in enzymes (e.g., this, most simply, arises in all cases of allostery). By contrast, by examining the full set of mutant combinations, our study delineates a full set of interaction free energies and is able to define functional units among structurally connected active site residues.</p><p><italic>Modern computational methods when combined with experimental data provide for powerful insights because the entire enzyme can be taken into consideration.

When there is a selective advantage, then the probability of going ‘back’ is reduced. The extent of reduction is a result of the selective advantage that is conferred, but many factors contribute in addition to the protein’s activity (e.g., the degree to which this activity is limiting for survival, the degree of increase in population size, the relationship between population size and survival and reproduction) Because of this complexity, we simplified the model and assumed a reversion probability of zero, to render the effects most transparent and easiest to interpret.

The D101 effect (with Mg<sup>2+</sup> absent) that is referred to here is independent of the presence or absence of R166, i.e., this 20-fold effect does not require the presence of R166. There is an additional effect of D101 when R166 is present.
