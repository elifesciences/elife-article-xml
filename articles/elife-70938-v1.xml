For example, 1-palmitoyl-2-glutaroyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (PGPC) and 1-palmitoyl-2-(5-oxovaleroyl)-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POVPC), two important oxidation products of 1-palmitoyl-2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (PAPC), can activate acid sphingomyelinase to produce ceramide that then induces cell death of smooth muscle cells and macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Greig et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Loidl et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Stemmer et al., 2012</xref>).

OxPAPC components such as PGPC and POVPC may disrupt endothelial barriers in the lung while a full-length oxygenated product, 1-palmitoyl-2-(5,6-epoxyisoprostane E2)-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidyl choline (PEIPC), was found to protect the barrier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Birukova et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>In addition to inducing cell death, oxPLs are able to evoke inflammatory responses in macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bochkov et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Vladykovskaya et al., 2011</xref>).

Cells were either not primed or primed with 10 ng/ml TLR2/1 agonist Pam3CSK4 (Pam3) for 7 hr and then a test lipid (PGPC, POVPC, oxPAPC, or non-oxidized PAPC) was added to the culture media for an additional 18 hr. We found that 5–12.5 μg/ml (8–21 μM) PGPC or POVPC and 12.5 μg/ml oxPAPC could induce significant cell death with or without Pam3 priming, whereas 12.5 μg/ml (16 μM) non-oxidized PAPC was inactive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). PGPC- and POVPC-induced IL-1β secretion occurred only in Pam3-primed cells and was dose-dependent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Non-oxidized PAPC did not induce IL-1β release by primed cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), in agreement with previous findings that only oxidized PLs activate the inflammasome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zanoni et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zanoni et al., 2017</xref>). Pam3-induced IL-6 production was minimally affected by the presence of oxPLs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Mature IL-1β (p17) appeared only after Pam3-primed macrophages had been treated with either PGPC or POVPC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Previous studies have shown that PGPC or POVPC induced IL-1β release from primed bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) in a NLRP3-, caspase 1/11-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yeon et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zanoni et al., 2017</xref>), while Muri et al. have found that caspase 8 but not caspase 1 or NLRP3 was required for cyclo-epoxycyclopentenone-induced IL-1β processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Muri et al., 2020</xref>). We found that caspase 1 inhibitor VX-765, caspase 8 inhibitor Z-IETD-FMK, NLPR3 inhibitor MCC950, and pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK significantly reduced IL-1β release and caspase 1 processing in primed macrophages but did not prevent oxPL-induced cell death, demonstrating that oxPL-induced cell death does not require inflammasome activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Stemmer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E and F</xref>).

Plasma platelet-activating factor acetyl hydrolase (PAF-AH) and intracellular PAF-AH II, which cleave sn-2 oxidized acyl chains from PGPC and POVPC, are GDSL lipases that have structural similarity to AOAH; lecithin-cholesterol-acyltransferase transfers oxidized acyl chains from oxPLs to cholesterol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Goyal et al., 1997</xref>); and oxidized acyl chains can be reduced by enzymes such as aldose reductase, phospholipid glutathione peroxidase, peroxiredoxin 6, and glutathione transferase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mauerhofer et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Vladykovskaya et al., 2011</xref>).

Using four mouse models, we found that AOAH diminishes oxPL-induced acute lung injury.</p><p>In previous studies, we found that AOAH does not prevent acute responses to LPS. Instead, the enzyme modulates the late, or longer-lasting, responses to LPS stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lu et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lu et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Shao et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zou et al., 2017</xref>). <italic>Aoah<sup>+/+</sup></italic> and <italic>Aoah<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice had similar degrees of lung injury 24 hr after LPS was instilled i.n., while on day 4, <italic>Aoah<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice showed delayed resolution of pulmonary inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zou et al., 2017</xref>). <italic>Aoah<sup>+/+</sup></italic> and <italic>Aoah<sup>-/-</sup></italic> resident peritoneal macrophages had comparable innate responses to TLR stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lu et al., 2008</xref>). In contrast, AOAH efficiently limits inflammasome activation by oxPLs. This may be related in part to its location in endolysosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Luchi and Munford, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Staab et al., 1994</xref>), where oxPLs may be delivered when they are internalized by CD14 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kagan et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zanoni et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zanoni et al., 2017</xref>), and by the enzyme’s ability to inactivate both oxPLs and LPCs. By inactivating oxPLs in endolysosomes, AOAH prevents oxPL leakage into the cytosol and endolysosomal damage, diminishing inflammasome activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Thus, while endolysosomal AOAH cannot deacylate LPS before it is sensed by TLR4, the enzyme may act on oxPLs before they activate the inflammasome.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Acyloxyacyl hydrolase (AOAH) deacylates and inactivates oxidized phospholipids (oxPLs).</title><p>After oxPLs enter endolysosomes in a CD14-dependent pathway, AOAH in endolysosomes deacylates and inactivates oxPLs.

Low concentrations of oxPLs have usually induced protective effects while high concentrations have been stimulatory/toxic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mauerhofer et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Muri et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Oskolkova et al., 2010</xref>). Zanoni et al. found that PGPC or POVPC activated the inflammasome in primed dendritic cells or macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zanoni et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zanoni et al., 2017</xref>), and we confirmed their results with lower concentrations of oxPLs. In contrast, Chu et al. found that a low concentration (2 μg/ml) of oxPAPC directly bound caspase 11 and inhibited LPS-induced pyroptosis, IL-1β release, and septic shock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chu et al., 2018</xref>). The discrepant effects reflect different experimental conditions. When Chu et al. either transfected LPS and oxPAPC simultaneously into the cytosol of macrophages or treated macrophages with oxPAPC first and then transfected LPS, they found reduced cell death and IL-1β release. In this experimental setting, oxPAPC, as a partial agonist, may compete with the strong agonist, LPS. In our study, we primed macrophages with microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs) such as LPS or Pam3 for several hours to increase inflammasome component expression and then added oxPLs to activate the inflammasome. In our experiments, LPS did not enter the cytosol to activate caspase 11. Even when we added LPS and PGPC/POVPC simultaneously to macrophages, we also observed inflammasome activation, suggesting that macrophages may be primed by TLR4 stimulation before oxPLs are taken up via CD14 and then transferred from endolysosomes to cytosol to activate the inflammasome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zanoni et al., 2017</xref>). In addition, we used specific oxPAPC components, PGPC or POVPC, instead of oxPAPC with its many components and diverse bioactivities. Thus, the oxPL species used and their concentrations, the routes of MAMP and oxPL delivery, and the order of addition of MAMP and oxPLs may contribute to the observations made in different laboratories. In this study, we focused on defining the role that AOAH plays in preventing oxPL-induced inflammasome activation. Whether AOAH also plays a role in regulating or promoting the anti-inflammatory activities of oxPLs awaits further investigation.</p><p>In summary, we have presented in vitro and in vivo evidence that a host lipase, AOAH, can deacylate and inactivate two important oxPLs and also LPC.

Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed by cannulating the trachea with a 20-gauge catheter that was firmly fixed with a suture. The lung was then infused with 1 ml PBS containing 5 mM EDTA, and BALF was harvested. This procedure was repeated five times, and the BALF was combined. The lung was then cut into pieces for preservation in RNA Later (TianGen) for RT-PCR or in 4% paraformaldehyde for histological analysis.</p><p>In some experiments, we used transgenic mice that express AOAH from the CD68 promoter in macrophages and dendritic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ojogun et al., 2009</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Acid aspiration-ventilation acute lung injury model</title><p>Mice were anesthetized i.p. with 1% pentobarbital sodium (100 μg/g body weight) to reach a state of deep anesthesia. An infrared heater was used to maintain body temperature. 40 μl 0.2 M HCl was instilled intratracheally using a 1 mm diameter capillary tube. A 20-gauge catheter was then inserted into the airway and connected to a mechanical respirator (Harvard apparatus). Respiration was carried out for 60 min with 100 breaths/min, tidal volume 0.5 ml, sigh volume 0.5 ml, sigh frequency 1/0, and inspiratory to expiratory ratio 1:2. The mice were then removed from the respirator and monitored. 24 hr later, mice were euthanized and analyzed.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Analysis of BALF</title><p>After the lungs were lavaged with 1 ml PBS twice, BALF was collected and centrifuged. The cell-free supernatant was used to measure protein concentrations with a bicinchoninic acid (BCA) kit (Pierce). The total BALF protein amount equals protein concentration times 1 ml. Inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in BALF were measured using TNF-α, IL-6 (BD), or IL-1β (R&amp;D Systems) ELISA kits. The cell pellet was resuspended in PBS, and total cell numbers were counted using Cellometer (Nexelcom). Cell differential counting was conducted using cytospin and Wright–Giemsa staining. After counting 300 cells, the proportions of neutrophils, monocytes-macrophages, and lymphocytes were calculated and used to determine the number of each cell type. To assess alveolar barrier damage, extravascular Evans blue was measured as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zou et al., 2017</xref>). Briefly, Evans blue was injected i.v. 1 hr before euthanasia. After perfusion of the lungs, extravascular Evans blue was extracted and the optical density was measured at 620 nm (reference 740 nm) using a Tecan reader.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Real-time PCR</title><p>RNA from AMs or lungs was isolated using RNA isolation kit (Tiangen) and reversely transcribed (Tiangen).

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Paul Noble as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The manuscript demonstrates that endogenous oxidized phospholipids (OxPLs) can stimulate inflammatory responses in host cells, including induction of cell death and processing of interleukin-1 β. The manuscript futher identifies a host enzyme, acyloxyacyl hydrolase (AOAH), that cleaves oxidized phospholipids and thereby reduces their pro-inflammatory properties. A combination of in vitro and in vivo experiments supports the anti-inflammatory effects of AOAH. These are important findings that shed light on the mechanisms that limit damaging inflammation and we expect the findings to be of broad interest. The reviewers agreed that some technical aspects of the experiments and/or their presentation could be improved. We encourage submission of a revised version that address the following essential revisions:</p><p>(1) One of the main claims of the manuscript is that OxPLs have pro-inflammatory effects that include inflammasome activation (independent of Casp11). This claim is somewhat at odds with at least some of the existing literature which claims that OxPLs inhibit Casp11 inflammasome activation and/or synergize with LPS to produce enhanced Casp11-dependent IL-1 release. The apparent discrepancies with the literature are not adequately discussed or addressed.</p><p>(a) We require more discussion of how the new claims of this manuscript are to be reconciled with previous claims in the literature (e.g., see papers cited by R2).</p><p>(b) To support the main claim of inflammasome activation by OxPLs, we require that the authors address which inflammasome is being activated. At a minimum, we require that they test for the possible involvement of NLRP3 either with NLRP3 KO cells or MCC950 inhibitor.</p><p>(2) We require that technical issues with many of the experiments be addressed:</p><p>(a) All immunoblots require loading controls (see comments from all reviewers).</p><p>(b) Figure 2C-F: a better description of the experiment is required (see comments from R2).</p><p>(c) The blot in 3F needs quantification; if the effect is not significant, more caution is warranted.</p><p>(d) Clarify if AOAH KO cells have a growth defect, and if so, normalize the data in Figure 4 as requested by R2.</p><p>(e) Address the possible confounding issues associated with using Pam3CSK4 as a priming agent (see comments from R1).</p><p>(f) Address the issues raised about ZVAD/VX765 (see R1) and modify conclusions as necessary.</p><p>(g) Address the statistical issues identified by R3.</p><p>(3) The in vivo experiments using the HCl ventilation model (Figure 7) are particularly central to the main conclusion of the paper, namely, the claim that endogenous OxPLs are counteracted by AOAH (The other in vivo experiments involve provision of exogenous inflammatory lipids). As such, the data provided with this model in Figure 7 should be solidified:</p><p>(a) Improve the analysis of the histological findings in Figure 7 as suggested by R3.</p><p>(b) Quantify additional inflammatory markers, e.g., quantification of cytokines at the protein level, and markers of lung damage, e.g., quantification of Evans Blue and/or BAL protein as suggested by R3.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>(1) It is difficult to know how to reconcile this work with other work in the field. It has been claimed that OxPLs antagonize Casp11 and are thus anti-inflammatory, whereas the current work suggests they are pro-inflammatory independent of Casp11. A more straightforward discussion of previous work and any relevant differences is necessary to help a reader put the present work in context.</p><p>(2) If Casp11 is not activated by OxPLs, which inflammasome is? At a minimum a simple experiment with NLRP3 KO cells (or MCC950) could rule in or out NLRP3, which is the most obvious candidate.</p><p>(3) Although it is appreciated that priming is necessary for this system, it is potentially confouding that many experiments use a lipid (Pam3CSK4) to prime since AOAH may potentially be acting on this lipid (and this may in part explain some of the observed effects). Can the authors address this possibility a bit more cleanly? Why not prime with a cytokine (e.g., TNF?) that would not itself be a possible substrate of AOAH?</p><p>(4) The experiments with ZVAD in S1 lack a ZVAD only control. In my experience ZVAD itself is highly toxic to macropahges so this control seems critical. In addition, since there is a CASP8 pathway downstream of inflammasome activation, CASP1 inhibitors are not sufficient to reach the conclusion that cell death is inflammasome-independent (e.g., p.6).</p><p>(5) Many of the western blots lack loading controls.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>In this manuscript Zou et al., investigate the role of the lipase AOAH on the pro-inflammatory roles of oxidized lipids (PGPC, POVPC). They show that the removal of sn-1 and sn-2 acyl chains from these lipids by AOAH dampens oxPL induced inflammasome activation, in vitro and in vivo. They further demonstrate that AOAH also dampens inflammasome activation evoqued by LPC. In conclusion, AOAH reduces tissue inflammation and cell death in response to endogenous oxidized lipids.</p><p>Oxidized lipids have diverse biological activities, among these the induction of pathology and inflammation. Thus, the identification of an endogenous regulator that can dampen these effects is novel and interesting. The manuscript is understandable and the experiments can be easily followed. However some important controls are missing, and some point require clarification. Thus, the manuscript would improve if the following points would be addressed:</p><p>The OxPL field is highly controversial. For example, OxPAPAC has also been shown to block non-canonical inflammasome activation (PMID: 29520027), and in general acts as an anti-inflammatory molecule (PMID: 32234476). The authors show discuss these discrepancies and ideally provide experimental data to show how AOAH affect the anti-inflammatory functions of OxPL.</p><p>Which inflammasome is activated by POVPC, PGPC and LPC. The authors report no involvement of Casp-11 in oxPAPC-induced IL-1b release, but which inflammasome is involved then? NLRP3 involvement could easily be tested using MCC950.</p><p>Figure 1D/E, 2F, 3b, 3F, 4D-F: These blots require a loading control. It would be better to show combined supernatant and lysates samples, and blot for Casp-1, IL-1b, and a loading control (b-actin). (same for blots in Figure S1).</p><p>Figure 2C-F: It is unclear if dPGPC or dPOVPC means PGPCPOVPC sn-2 isolated after AOAH incubation or just PGPC/POVPC treated with AOAH. Please be more specific. If it is PGPC/POVPC treated with AOAH, then why do we not see a strong activation of the inflammasome due to the LPC that is produced?</p><p>Is AOAH still in the preps containing dPGPC etc..? If yes, a necessary control is to incubate cells with AOAH.</p><p>Figure 3F: this blot is hardly convincing. It appears that there is similar levels of IL-1b induced by LPC and dLPC.</p><p>Figure 4A: AOAH-/- cells appear to have a viability defect or grow more slowly, as they have lower crystal violet levels even without treatment. Thus all other values need to be normalized by setting the crystal violet values of untreated cells as 100%. I believe this will significantly change the data.</p><p>Figure 4E: please show LDH and Il-1b data as well, and quantify the blots as done for other blots. It looks like the actual data contradict the authors conclusions. Taking for example Figure 3F as an example (where the authors claim a significant difference), I would actually claim that there is more Casp-1 p20 even upon Dotap transfection of PGPC and POVPC.</p><p>Priming of AOAH expression: The authors mention that AOAH expression needs to be induced and that oxPL are poor inducers. This makes me wonder how AOAH can reduce cell death unprimed cells in Figure 4A-C for example. It would be helpful for the reader if the authors would provide blots showing AOAH expression in figure 4A-C.</p><p>Animal model: It is not evident from the manuscript why the authors chose the intranasal installation model. Please explain. Previous papers investigating the effects of oxPL used i.p. injections.</p><p>The authors should clearly point out that their data contradict findings by Zanoni et al., 2016, which proposed IL-1b release in dependence of Casp-11.</p><p>It would be helpful if the authors could include the chemical structures of OxPAPC, POVPC, LPC etc.., and how they are converted by AOAH incubation.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>While the study is overall quite thorough, and of general interest, there are several clarifications, additional analyses, and additional data that could overall strengthen the findings. These are outlined below.</p><p>Generally there are some issues with the statistical analysis. It seems the Mann Whitney test was used to compare 2 groups, but in many of the experiments there are multiple groups, which indicates a need for using ANOVA tests. Also it is not always clear how many repeats were done, and the reasoning behind mega-analysis for some experiments, and representative samples for other experiments. The number of repeats for each experiment should be clarified and justified by the use of power analysis.</p><p>Figure 1:</p><p>D and E should be quantified as compared to their loading control. There is also do indication of percent of total input, or controls for differences when the supernatants are concentrated. Cleaved caspase-1 levels should also be examined in the cell lysate as well as the media.</p><p>Figure 2:</p><p>A and B do not appear to have statistics performed. Also where there is no indication of statistical significance, does this mean it wasn't analyzed or that it is not significant. This should be clarified. What statistics are performed should be described in the figure legends.</p><p>As with Figure 1 4 needs additional controls and quantification.</p><p>It says one representative experiment of 3 or 4 is shown, but it should be clarified which is 3 and which is 4. Also if possible a mega-analysis should be performed for optimal statistics. If this is not possible (due to a range of values between experiments) this should be specified. In order for a representative experiment to be shown all experiments must be statistically significant, or a mega-analysis needs to be done.</p><p>Figure 3:</p><p>This figure has many of the same concerns as the other figures in terms of quantification of the WB, and also how the statistics were done precisely. What the stars indicate should be indicated in every figure legend (not just M and Ms). It is unclear why this figure has a quantification of the WB, but other figures do not. It should be done on all, and also everything should be relative to the loading control and percent input.</p><p>Figure 4:</p><p>It seems like some of the experiments were only does twice. Did statistical analysis allow for this to be an acceptable number? This should be clarified.</p><p>Figure 5:</p><p>It is unclear why the quantification of cytokines and other inflammatory factors is done at the transcriptional level. Given the post-transcriptional regulation of many of these factors, and the availability of BALF, this data could be greatly strengthened by inclusion of some protein level data for key factors. Also some explanation as to why these specific cytokines, chemokines, and IRAK-M were chosen would be useful. What is the significance of IRAK-M in the context of acute lung injury for example?</p><p>It is interesting, that in contrast to the other models, in AOAH-/- mice LPS alone induced an increase in monocytes. This should be addressed in the discussion.</p><p>Figure 6:</p><p>It is encouraging that much of the transcriptional data recapitulates at the protein level, but this should also be shown in Figure 5.</p><p>Figure 7:</p><p>The histology in Figure 7 is a very important point, but for this to have any relevance it must be quantified and scored by a pathologist in a blinded fashion. Given that there is usually a wide range of phenotypes in different regions of the lung in this model the whole lung needs to be examined for proper quantification.</p><p>In addition, BAL protein and/or Evan's Blue assays should be done to determine how this damage compares to that seen in the other in vivo models. This is particular relevant as one would expect more damage in this model in the control animals.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.70938.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The manuscript demonstrates that endogenous oxidized phospholipids (OxPLs) can stimulate inflammatory responses in host cells, including induction of cell death and processing of interleukin-1 β.

Later, the same group found that PGPC or POVPC but not oxPAPC can induce IL-1β release from primed bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDM) in a NLRP3-, Caspase 1/11-dependent manner (Zanoni et al., 2017). Yeon et al., also found that POVPC induced IL-1β and processed caspase 1 release from primed BMDM, which required NLRP3 (Yeon et al., 2017). In contrast, Muri et al., found that caspase 8 but not caspase 1 or NLRP3 was required for cyclo-epoxycyclopentenone-induced IL-1β release in primed bone marrow-derived dendritic cells or macrophages.</p><p>We found that NLRP3 specific inhibitor MCC950 reduced PGPC or LPC-induced inflammasome activation and IL-1β release. To our surprise, using inhibitors we found that in addition to caspase 1, caspase 8 was also indispensable, suggesting that caspase 8 may cleave caspase 1 and activated caspase 1 cleaves pro-IL-1β (Chi et al., 2014; Philip et al., 2014).

We added actin controls to all blots. As 12.5 μg/ml oxPLs caused about 80% cell death of macrophages, it is hard to use cell actin as loading control for IL-1β or caspase 1 p20 in culture medium. As suggested by Reviewer 2, we used medium + cell mixture to blot for Caspase 1 (p20) and actin. When 5 μg/ml oxPLs were used, 80% of cells were alive; we used culture medium for caspase 1 (p20) and cell lysate for actin measurement.

It has been claimed that OxPLs antagonize Casp11 and are thus anti-inflammatory, whereas the current work suggests they are pro-inflammatory independent of Casp11. A more straightforward discussion of previous work and any relevant differences is necessary to help a reader put the present work in context.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for raising this important question. We think the oxPL species used and their concentrations, the routes of MAMP and oxPL delivery, and the order of addition of MAMP and oxPLs may contribute to the observations made in different laboratories. We have added a paragraph in the Discussion and another in the Methods, lines 298-325 and lines 347-358 (highlighted).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) If Casp11 is not activated by OxPLs, which inflammasome is? At a minimum a simple experiment with NLRP3 KO cells (or MCC950) could rule in or out NLRP3, which is the most obvious candidate.</p></disp-quote><p>We found that NLRP3 specific inhibitor MCC950 reduced PGPC or LPC-induced inflammasome activation and IL-1β release. To our surprise, using inhibitors we found that in addition to caspase 1, caspase 8 was also indispensable, suggesting that caspase 8 may cleave caspase 1 and activated caspase 1 cleaves pro-IL-1β (Chi et al., 2014; Philip et al., 2014). Please see lines 95-105, new Figure 1E, F and new Figure 3B, C.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Although it is appreciated that priming is necessary for this system, it is potentially confouding that many experiments use a lipid (Pam3CSK4) to prime since AOAH may potentially be acting on this lipid (and this may in part explain some of the observed effects). Can the authors address this possibility a bit more cleanly? Why not prime with a cytokine (e.g., TNF?) that would not itself be a possible substrate of AOAH?</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the suggestion. Because AOAH does not regulate acute responses to LPS (Lu et al., 2008) or Pam3 (Figure 4C, IL-6) in vitro or in vivo (Lu et al., 2008; Zou et al., 2017), we do not expect AOAH to modulate the priming effects of Pam3 or LPS. To explore the possibility that inactivating the priming agent prevents inflammasome activation, we tested CpG, which can also prime macrophages for oxPL-induced inflammasome activation and is not an AOAH substrate. We found that when AOAH WT and KO macrophages were primed with CpG, PGPC induced more cell death and IL-1β release from AOAH KO macrophages than from WT macrophages. Please see lines 154-159 and new Figure 4E.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) The experiments with ZVAD in S1 lack a ZVAD only control. In my experience ZVAD itself is highly toxic to macropahges so this control seems critical. In addition, since there is a CASP8 pathway downstream of inflammasome activation, CASP1 inhibitors are not sufficient to reach the conclusion that cell death is inflammasome-independent (e.g., p.6).</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the good suggestions. We have added inhibitor-only controls and found that those inhibitors including ZVAD did not regulate cell death or IL-1β release in our experimental settings (New Figure 1E, Figure 3B).

They show that the removal of sn-1 and sn-2 acyl chains from these lipids by AOAH dampens oxPL induced inflammasome activation, in vitro and in vivo. They further demonstrate that AOAH also dampens inflammasome activation evoqued by LPC. In conclusion, AOAH reduces tissue inflammation and cell death in response to endogenous oxidized lipids.</p><p>Oxidized lipids have diverse biological activities, among these the induction of pathology and inflammation. Thus, the identification of an endogenous regulator that can dampen these effects is novel and interesting. The manuscript is understandable and the experiments can be easily followed. However some important controls are missing, and some point require clarification. Thus, the manuscript would improve if the following points would be addressed:</p><p>The OxPL field is highly controversial. For example, OxPAPAC has also been shown to block non-canonical inflammasome activation (PMID: 29520027), and in general acts as an anti-inflammatory molecule (PMID: 32234476).
