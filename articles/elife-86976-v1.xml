However, it remains largely elusive how cell cycle recovery is initiated after DNA damage. In this study, we discovered the upregulated protein level of MASTL kinase hours after DNA damage. MASTL promotes cell cycle progression by preventing PP2A/B55-catalyzed dephosphorylation of CDK substrates. DNA damage-induced MASTL upregulation was caused by decreased protein degradation, and was unique among mitotic kinases. We identified E6AP as the E3 ubiquitin ligase that mediated MASTL degradation. MASTL degradation was inhibited upon DNA damage as a result of the dissociation of E6AP from MASTL. E6AP depletion reduced DNA damage signaling, and promoted cell cycle recovery from the DNA damage checkpoint, in a MASTL-dependent manner. Furthermore, we found that E6AP was phosphorylated at Ser-218 by ATM after DNA damage and that this phosphorylation was required for its dissociation from MASTL, the stabilization of MASTL, and the timely recovery of cell cycle progression. Together, our data revealed that ATM/ATR-dependent signaling, while activating the DNA damage checkpoint, also initiates cell cycle recovery from the arrest. Consequently, this results in a timer-like mechanism that ensures the transient nature of the DNA damage checkpoint.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>DNA damage checkpoint</kwd><kwd>cell cycle recovery</kwd><kwd>MASTL</kwd><kwd>E6AP</kwd><kwd>ATM</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CA233037</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Peng</surname><given-names>Aimin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DE030427</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Peng</surname><given-names>Aimin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The initiation of DNA damage checkpoint recovery involves ATM-mediated E3 ubiquitin ligase E6AP phosphorylation which disrupts E6AP-MASTL association and leads to MASTL protein accumulation and cell cycle resumption.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>DNA damage activates a wide range of cellular responses, including DNA repair, cell cycle checkpoints, and cell death. Collectively defined as the DNA damage response (DDR), these mechanisms ensure genomic integrity and prevent progression of cancer, aging, and other diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ciccia and Elledge, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Jackson and Bartek, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lou and Chen, 2005</xref>). Among these DDR pathways, the DNA damage checkpoint temporally halts the progression of the cell cycle, to facilitate DNA repair and avoid detrimental accumulation of DNA damage. The DNA damage checkpoint can act at multiple stages of the cell cycle to impede DNA replication and block mitotic entry. Initiation of the DNA damage checkpoint signaling relies on two phosphoinositide 3 kinase-related protein kinases, ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM), ATM and RAD3-related (ATR). Upon DNA damage, ATM and ATR phosphorylate and activate checkpoint kinases CHK1 and CHK2, which, in turn, inhibit CDC25 to prevent activation of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Shiloh, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zhou and Elledge, 2000</xref>).</p><p>How does the cell initiate cell cycle recovery after DNA damage is an important, yet largely unanswered, question. Distinct from the simplistic view that the cell cycle resumes passively following the repair of DNA damage and decay of checkpoint signaling, recovery from the DNA damage checkpoint is likely an active and regulated process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bartek and Lukas, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Clémenson and Marsolier-Kergoat, 2009</xref>). For example, Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) and other cell cycle kinases can facilitate the deactivation of DNA damage signaling and resumption of cell cycle progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alvarez-Fernández et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Macůrek et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Mamely et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Peng, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Peschiaroli et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">van Vugt et al., 2004a</xref>). Furthermore, it has been observed in yeast, frog, and mammalian cells that the cell cycle can be restarted without completion of DNA repair, a phenomenon defined as adaptation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bartek and Lukas, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Clémenson and Marsolier-Kergoat, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Syljuåsen, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Toczyski et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">van Vugt and Medema, 2004b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yoo et al., 2004</xref>). Aside from senescence and other types of permanent cell cycle withdrawal, the DNA damage checkpoint-mediated cell cycle arrest is transient, raising the question about mechanisms that mediate the timely initiation of DNA damage checkpoint recovery.</p><p>Microtubule-associated serine/threonine kinase-like (MASTL, also known as Greatwall) has been characterized as an important regulator of mitosis. Like CDK1 and other mitotic kinases, MASTL is activated during mitotic entry, and the kinase activity of MASTL promotes mitosis, although mitotic entry is still permitted in mammalian cells depleted of MASTL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Archambault et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blake-Hodek et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Castilho et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Peng and Maller, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Vigneron et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Voets and Wolthuis, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yu et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yu et al., 2006</xref>). Upon activation, MASTL phosphorylates α-endosulfine (ENSA) and cyclic AMP-regulated 19 kDa phosphoprotein (ARPP19) which then inhibit PP2A/B55 (protein phosphatase 2A/B55 targeting subunit). Because PP2A/B55 functions as the principal phosphatase catalyzing the dephosphorylation of CDK substrates, the coordination between the kinase activity of MASTL with that of CDK1 enables substrate phosphorylation and mitotic progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Castilho et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gharbi-Ayachi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mochida et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mochida et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Vigneron et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, in addition to its mitotic function, MASTL is also required for cell cycle recovery from the DNA damage checkpoint in <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extracts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Medema, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Peng et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Peng et al., 2010</xref>). Addition of MASTL in extracts facilitated, and depletion of MASTL hindered, DNA damage checkpoint recovery, as evidenced by both mitotic phosphorylation of CDK substrates and de-activation of checkpoint signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Peng et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Peng et al., 2010</xref>).

In this study, we discovered the protein stabilization of MASTL post DNA damage, identified E6 associated protein (E6AP) as the underlying E3 ubiquitin ligase mediating MASTL proteolysis, and delineated ATM-mediated E6AP phosphorylation as a mechanism to initiate DNA damage checkpoint recovery.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>MASTL expression is upregulated after DNA damage</title><p>While investigating the role of MASTL in cell cycle regulation and DDR, we observed unexpected upregulation of MASTL protein levels in cells treated with DNA damage.

The function of E6AP in the DNA damage checkpoint via MASTL modulation suggests E6AP as a DDR factor and a potential tumor suppressor.</p><p>ATM/ATR phosphorylates a myriad of substrates to promote DNA repair and activate the cell cycle checkpoints (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Flynn and Zou, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Shiloh, 2003</xref>). We found that MASTL accumulation after DNA damage was disrupted by inhibition of ATM/ATR, suggesting that ATM/ATR modulated MASTL proteolysis. Our study further revealed that ATM phosphorylated E6AP at Ser-218, leading to E6AP dissociation from MASTL and the subsequent MASTL stabilization. Our functional characterization of E6AP Ser-218 is interesting, as phosphorylation of this residue has been detected in numerous proteomic studies as a modification induced by DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beli et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Matsuoka et al., 2007</xref>), mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Franz-Wachtel et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kettenbach et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Olsen et al., 2010</xref>), or cancer progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Klammer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Schweppe et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Weber et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Our results suggest that ATM/ATR, while important for the activation of the DNA damage checkpoint, also engages a mechanism to initiate cell cycle recovery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). This mechanism at least partially answers the puzzling question of how cell cycle recovery is initiated from the state of the DNA damage checkpoint. The DNA damage checkpoint targets cell cycle kinases to halt the cell cycle; on the other hand, the re-activation of CDK, PLK1, MASTL, and other cell cycle kinases promotes the de-activation of DNA damage checkpoint signaling and cell cycle resumption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Peng, 2013</xref>). For example, PLK1 and CDK can mediate the phosphorylation of DDR factors to suppress DNA damage checkpoint signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alvarez-Fernández et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Macůrek et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Mamely et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Peschiaroli et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">van Vugt et al., 2004a</xref>). Cell cycle kinases are known to coordinate with each other in positive feedback reactions to achieve full activation and bring about mitosis. We speculate that, in the case of DNA damage recovery, ATM-mediated MASTL upregulation may provide an initial signal to trigger these positive feedback reactions, ultimately shifting the balance from cell cycle arrest to recovery. Of note, this timer-like mechanism can contribute to the transient nature of the DNA damage checkpoint, as observed in yeast, frog, and mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bartek and Lukas, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Clémenson and Marsolier-Kergoat, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Syljuåsen, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">van Vugt et al., 2004a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yoo et al., 2004</xref>). In comparison to the recovery stage, the expression level of MASTL is not upregulated during the activation stage of the DNA damage checkpoint, allowing efficient checkpoint activation. The subsequent impact of MASTL upregulation on promoting checkpoint recovery and cell cycle progression can be attributed to inhibition of PP2A/B55, although the potential involvement of additional mechanisms is not excluded. Finally, the resumption of the cell cycle after DNA damage is a potentially vital process that enables tumor cell progression and treatment evasion. MASTL kinase has emerged as an important factor of tumorigenesis and treatment resistance in multiple types of cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fatima et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Marzec and Burgess, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wang et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, future studies built upon our current findings may shed new light on cancer resistance and identify new anti-cancer drug targets to enhance treatment outcome.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Antibodies and chemicals</title><p>Mouse antibody to MASTL (clone 4F9, Millipore MABT372) was described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wang et al., 2011</xref>).

The issue is highly relevant to our understanding of how genome stability is maintained or compromised when our genome is damaged. The authors present the intriguing conclusion that this is based on a timer, implying that the outcome of a damaging insult is somewhat of a lottery; if a cell can fix the damage within the allocated time provided by the &quot;timer&quot; it will maintain stability, if not then stability is compromised. If this conclusion can be supported by solid data, the paper would make a very important contribution to the field.</p><p>However, the story in its present form suffers from a number of major gaps that will need to be addressed before we can conclude that MASTL is the &quot;timer&quot; that is proposed here. The primary concern being that altered MASTL regulation seems to be doing much more than simply acting as a timer in control of recovery after DNA damage. There is data presented to suggest that MASTL directly controls checkpoint activation, which is very different from acting as a timer. The authors conclude on page 8 &quot;E6AP promoted DNA damage checkpoint signaling by counteracting MASTL&quot;, but in the abstract the conclusion is &quot;E6AP depletion promoted cell cycle recovery from the DNA damage checkpoint, in a MASTL-dependent manner&quot;. These 2 conclusions are definitely not in alignment. Do E6AP/MASTL control checkpoint signaling or do they control recovery, which is it?</p><p>Also, there is data presented that suggest that MASTL does more than just controlling mitotic entry after DNA damage, while the conclusions of the paper are entirely based on the assumption that MASTL merely acts as a driver of mitotic entry, with E6AP in control of its levels. This issue will need to be resolved.</p><p>and finally, the authors have shown some very compelling data on the phosphorylation of E6AP by ATM/ATR, and its role in the DNA damage response. But the time resolution of these effects in relation to arrest and recovery have not been addressed.</p><p>Revised manuscript:</p><p>I think the authors did a good job in revising the paper, and provide compelling support for a timer function in the checkpoint. I do think they still have missed one important point how MASTL could act as a timer to control recovery. The data clearly show that MASTL somehow controls ATM/ATR activity, whilst their final model (fig.9) places MASTL upstream of CDK activity, without mentioning its feedback on ATM/ATR. I think there are 2 possible explanations for the timer function of MASTL they have discovered here, both may be relevant. The first is enhanced CDK activation by direct control of CDK phosphorylation through MASTL/B55/PP2A. The second is through MASTL-mediated shut-down of ATM/ATR activation (mechanism to be determined) which is also reported here. Their final model and discussion do not display sufficient appreciation for this latter option, and I would argue that the HU-recovery experiment shown in Fig.5B is actually in strong support of the second explanation, rather than the first.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.86976.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>This manuscript describes a role for the ATM-E6AP-MASTL pathway in DNA damage checkpoint recovery. However, the data in the first version of the manuscript strongly suggest that E6AP is involved in checkpoint activation, which raises doubts about the exact function of this pathway. Additional minor issues were raised regarding the quality of some of the data. Although some minor points were addressed in the revised manuscript, the major issue whether the E6AP-MASTL pathway mediates checkpoint activation or checkpoint recovery was not experimentally addressed. Instead, the authors state that &quot;the expression level of MASTL is not upregulated during the activation stages of the DNA damage checkpoint&quot;.

The main issue raised by the reviewers was that because E6AP depletion reduced checkpoint signaling vis MASTL upregulation, this pathway is likely to be involved also in DNA damage checkpoint activation, in addition to checkpoint recovery. Hence, the proposed “timer”-like model is not fully supported. However, it is important to note that, the expression level of MASTL is not upregulated during the activation stage of the DNA damage checkpoint (unless E6AP is depleted). DNA damage signaling, via ATM-dependent E6AP phosphorylation, caused MASTL accumulation over time. This ultimately shifts the balance toward checkpoint recovery and cell cycle re-entry. As such, the role of MASTL (and E6AP-depletion) in suppressing DNA damage checkpoint is in harmony with the proposed role of MASTL upregulation in promoting checkpoint recovery. We have made additional clarifications about this point in the revised manuscript.</p><p>We have also addressed other concerns raised by the reviewers, as explained in the point-to-point responses below. With the addition of new modifications and data, we believe the revised manuscript is complete and conclusive.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>In principle a very interesting story, in which the authors attempt to shed light on an intriguing and poorly understood phenomenon; the link between damage repair and cell cycle re-entry once a cell has suffered from DNA damage.

The authors present the intriguing conclusion that this is based on a timer, implying that the outcome of a damaging insult is somewhat of a lottery; if a cell can fix the damage within the allocated time provided by the &quot;timer&quot; it will maintain stability, if not then stability is compromised. If this conclusion can be supported by solid data, the paper would make a very important contribution to the field.</p><p>However, the story in its present form suffers from a number of major gaps that will need to be addressed before we can conclude that MASTL is the &quot;timer&quot; that is proposed here. The primary concern being that altered MASTL regulation seems to be doing much more than simply acting as a timer in control of recovery after DNA damage. There is data presented to suggest that MASTL directly controls checkpoint activation, which is very different from acting as a timer. The authors conclude on page 8 &quot;E6AP promoted DNA damage checkpoint signaling by counteracting MASTL&quot;, but in the abstract the conclusion is &quot;E6AP depletion promoted cell cycle recovery from the DNA damage checkpoint, in a MASTL-dependent manner&quot;. These 2 conclusions are definitely not in alignment. Do E6AP/MASTL control checkpoint signaling or do they control recovery, which is it?</p><p>Also, there is data presented that suggest that MASTL does more than just controlling mitotic entry after DNA damage, while the conclusions of the paper are entirely based on the assumption that MASTL merely acts as a driver of mitotic entry, with E6AP in control of its levels. This issue will need to be resolved.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for his/her insightful comments. The main issue raised by the reviewers was that because E6AP depletion reduced checkpoint signaling vis MASTL upregulation, this pathway is likely to be involved also in DNA damage checkpoint activation, in addition to checkpoint recovery. Hence, the proposed “timer”-like model is not fully supported. However, it is important to note that, the expression level of MASTL is not upregulated during the activation stage of the DNA damage checkpoint (unless E6AP is depleted). DNA damage signaling, via ATM-dependent E6AP phosphorylation, caused MASTL accumulation over time. This ultimately shifts the balance toward checkpoint recovery and cell cycle re-entry. As such, the role of MASTL (and E6AP-depletion) in suppressing DNA damage checkpoint is in harmony with the proposed role of MASTL upregulation in promoting checkpoint recovery. We have made additional clarifications about this point in the revised manuscript.</p><p>As suggested by the reviewer, we have rephrased the statement in abstract to “E6AP depletion reduced DNA damage signaling, and promoted cell cycle recovery from the DNA damage checkpoint, in a MASTLdependent manner”.</p><p>As a mitotic kinase, MASTL promotes mitotic entry and progression. This is well in line with our findings that DNA damage-induced MASTL upregulation promotes cell cycle re-entry into mitosis. MASTL upregulation could also inhibit DNA damage signaling. This manner of feedback, inhibitory, modulation of DNA damage signaling by mitotic kinases (e.g., PLK1, CDK) has been implicated in previous studies (reviewed in Cell &amp; Bioscience volume 3, Article number: 20 (2013)). In the revised manuscript, we have included more discussions about this aspect of checkpoint regulation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Finally, the authors have shown some very compelling data on the phosphorylation of E6AP by ATM/ATR, and its role in the DNA damage response. But the time resolution of these effects in relation to arrest and recovery have not been addressed.</p></disp-quote><p>Detailed time point information is now added in the figure legends for E6AP phosphorylation data. We were able to observe this event during early stages (e.g., 1 hr, or 2-4 hr) of the DNA damage response, prior to significant MASTL protein accumulation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>This is an interesting study from Admin Peng's laboratory that builds on previous work by the PI implicating Greatwall Kinase (the mammalian gene is called MASTL) in checkpoint recovery.</p><p>The main claims of this study are:</p><p>1. Greatwall stability is regulated by the E6-AP ubiquitin ligase and this is inhibited following DNA damage in an ATM dependent manner.</p><p>1. Greatwall directly interacts with E6-AP and this interaction is suppressed by ATM dependent phosphorylation of E6-AP on S218</p><p>1. E6-AP mediates Greatwall stability directly via ubiqitylation</p><p>1. E6-AP knock out cells show reduced ATM/ATR activation and quicker checkpoint recovery following ETO and HU treatment</p><p>1. Greatwall mediated checkpoint recovery via increased phosphorylation of Cdk substrates</p><p>In my opinion, there are several interesting findings presented here but the overall model for a role of the E6-AP -Greatwall axis is not fully supported by the current data and will require further work. Moreover, there are a number of technical issues making it difficult to assess and interpret the presented data.</p><p>Major points:</p><p>1. The notion that Greatwall is indeed required for checkpoint recovery hinges on two experiments shown in Figures 5A and B where Greatwall depletion blocks the accumulation of HELA cells in mitosis following recovery from ETO treatment and in G2/M following release from HU. An alternative possibility to the direct involvement of Greatwall in checkpoint recovery could be that Greatwall in HeLA cells is required for S-phase progression (as for example Charrasse et al. suggested). A simple control would be to monitor the accumulation of mitotic cells by microscopy or FACS following Greatwall depletion without any further checkpoint activation.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for his/her insightful comments.</p><p>Charrasse et al. showed ENSA knockout prolonged, but not stopped the progression of S-phase. In our experiments, MASTL (partial) knockdown did not significantly impact HeLa cells proliferation in the absence of DNA damage (Fig. 5, supplemental 1A). The reported role of MASTL in checkpoint recovery was consistently seen in response to various drugs, including etoposide which typically induces G2 arrest. Thus, we do not believe a prolonged S-phase accounts for the checkpoint recovery phenotype.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. The changes in protein levels of Greatwall and the effects of E6-AP on Greatwall stability are rather subtle and depend mostly on a qualitative assessment of western blots. Where quantifications have been made (Figures 2D and 4F) the loading control and the starting conditions for Greatwall (0 timepoints in the right panel) appear saturated making precise quantification impossible. I would argue that the authors should at least quantify the immuno-blots that led them to conclude on changes in Greatwall levels and make sure that the exposure times used are in the dynamic range of the camera (or film). A more precise experiment would be to use the exogenously expressed CFP-Greatwall that is described in Figure 6 and measure the acute changes in protein levels using quantitative fluorescence microscopy in live cells. This is, in my opinion, a lot more trustworthy than quantitative immuno-blots.</p><p>I also note here that most experiments linking Greatwall levels to E6-AP were done using siRNA, while the E6-AP ko cells would be a more reliable background for these experiments, especially with reconstituted controls.</p></disp-quote><p>DNA damage-induced MASTL upregulation was observed in various cell lines and after different treatments. To further strengthen this point, as suggested by the reviewer, we have included quantification of fluorescent measurements (Fig. 2, supplemental 1 A-C). Quantification of immunoblots for MASTL upregulation was also added in Fig. 1, supplemental 1E.The effects of E6AP depletion were consistently shown for both siRNA and stable KO.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. This study has no data linking the effects of Greatwall to its canonical target PP2A:B55. The model shown in Figure 9 is therefore highly speculative. The possibility that Greatwall could act independently of PP2A:B55 should at least be considered in the discussion given the lack of experimental evidence.</p></disp-quote><p>The role of MASTL in promoting cell cycle progression via suppressing PP2A/B55 has been well established. As suggested by the reviewer, we have included discussions to acknowledge that “The role of MASTL upregulation in promoting checkpoint recovery and cell cycle progression can be attributed to inhibition of PP2A/B55, although the potential involvement of additional mechanisms is not excluded”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. The major effect of E6-AP depletion on the checkpoint appears to be a striking reduction in ATM/ATR activation, suggesting that this ubiquitin ligase is involved in checkpoint activation rather than recovery. It is not clear if this phenotype is dependent on Greatwall. If so it would be hard to reconcile with the default model that E6-AP acts via the destabilisation of Greatwall. In the permanent absence of E6-AP, increased Greatwall levels should inactivate B55:PP2A. How would this lead to a decrease in ATM/ATR activation? This is unlikely, and indeed Figure 5E shows that the reduction of MASTL in parallel to E6-AP does not result in elevated levels of ATR/ATM activation. Conversely, the S215A E6-AP mutant does have a strong rescue impact on ATR/ATM (Figure 8D).</p></disp-quote><p>We do not propose that PP2A/B55 directly dephosphorylates ATM/ATR-mediated phosphorylation. In fact, PP2A/B55 dephosphorylates and inactivates mitotic kinases and substrates which can feedback inhibit DNA damage checkpoint signaling (as previously shown for PLK1 and CDK). We included in a discussion about this point in the revised manuscript.</p><p>The point regarding checkpoint activation vs recovery is addressed below (point 5).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. In summary, I do not think that the presented experiments clearly dissect the involvement of E6-AP and Greatwall in checkpoint activation and recovery. E6-AP depletion has a strong effect on checkpoint activation while Greatwall depletion is likely to have various checkpoint-independent effects on cell cycle progression.</p></disp-quote><p>It is important to note that, the expression level of MASTL is not upregulated during the activation stage of the DNA damage checkpoint (unless E6AP is depleted).

Different types of DNA damage trigger an increase in protein levels of mitotic kinase MASTL, also called Greatwall, caused by increased protein stability. The authors identify E3 ligase E6AP to regulate MASTL protein levels. Depletion or knockout of E6AP increases MASTL protein levels, whereas overexpression of E6AP leads to lower MASTL levels. E6AP and MASTL were suggested to interact in conditions without damage and this interaction is abrogated after DNA damage. E6AP was shown to be phosphorylated upon DNA damage on Ser218 and a phosphomimicking mutant does not interact with MASTL. Stabilization of MASTL was hypothesized to be important for recovery of the cell cycle/mitosis after DNA damage.</p><p>The identification of this novel pathway involving ATM and E6AP in MASTL regulation in the DNA damage response is interesting. However, is surprising that authors state that not a lot is known about DNA damage recovery while Greatwall and MASTL have been described to be involved in DNA damage (checkpoint) recovery. In addition, PP2A, a phosphatase downstream of MASTL is a known mediator of checkpoint recovery, in addition to other proteins like Plk1 and Claspin. Although some of the publications regarding these known mediators of DNA damage recovery are mentioned, the discussion regarding the relationship to the data in this manuscript are very limited.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for his/her insightful comments. As suggested, the previously reported role of PLK1 and other cell cycle kinases in DNA damage checkpoint recovery is discussed in more details in the revised manuscript. As for PP2A/B55, we do not think it promotes checkpoint recovery, e.g., by dephosphorylating ATM/ATR or their substrates. Instead, this phosphatase dephosphorylates cell cycle kinases or their substrates, such as CDK1 or PLK1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The regulation of MASTL stability by E6AP is novel, although the data regarding this regulation and the interaction are not entirely convincing. In addition, several experiments presented in this paper suggest that E6AP is (additionally) involved in checkpoint signalling/activation, whereas the activation of the G2 DNA damage checkpoint was described to be independent of MASTL. Has E6AP multiple functions in the DNA damage response or is ATM-E6AP-MASTL regulation not as straightforward as presented here?</p><p>Altogether, in my opinion, not all conclusions of the manuscript are fully supported by the data.</p></disp-quote><p>We showed that E6AP depletion reduced checkpoint signaling vis MASTL upregulation, so this pathway is likely to be involved also in DNA damage checkpoint activation, in addition to checkpoint recovery.
