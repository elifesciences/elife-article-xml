However, their roles in responding to naturalistic predatory threats, characterized by less explicit cues and the absence of reiterative trial-and-error learning events, remain unexplored. In this study, we conducted single-unit recordings in rats during an ‘approach food-avoid predator’ task, focusing on the responsiveness of dPAG and BLA neurons to a rapidly approaching robot predator. Optogenetic stimulation of the dPAG triggered fleeing behaviors and increased BLA activity in naive rats. Notably, BLA neurons activated by dPAG stimulation displayed immediate responses to the robot, demonstrating heightened synchronous activity compared to BLA neurons that did not respond to dPAG stimulation. Additionally, the use of anterograde and retrograde tracer injections into the dPAG and BLA, respectively, coupled with c-Fos activation in response to predatory threats, indicates that the midline thalamus may play an intermediary role in innate antipredatory-defensive functioning.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>predator</kwd><kwd>fear</kwd><kwd>defensive behavior</kwd><kwd>decision-making</kwd><kwd>single-unit</kwd><kwd>optogenetics</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MH099073</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>Jeansok John</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F32MH127801</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kong</surname><given-names>Mi-Seon</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003725</institution-id><institution>National Research Foundation of Korea</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NRF-2022M3E5E8018421</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cho</surname><given-names>Jeiwon</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003725</institution-id><institution>National Research Foundation of Korea</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NRF-2022R1A2C2009265</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cho</surname><given-names>Jeiwon</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AG067008</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>Eun Joo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Electrophysiological recordings and optogenetics reveal how the dorsal periaqueductal gray and basolateral amygdala interact in antipredatory responses, with a potential intermediary role for the midline thalamus.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The interaction between the dorsal periaqueductal gray (dPAG) and the basolateral amygdala (BLA) plays a pivotal role in defensive mechanisms across both animals and humans. Research on Pavlovian fear conditioning (FC), which involves pairing a conditional stimulus (CS; e.g., tones, lights, contexts) with an unconditional stimulus (US; e.g., electric shock) to produce conditional fear responses (CRs), suggests that the dPAG is part of the ascending US pain transmission pathway to the BLA, the presumed site for CS-US association formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">De Oca et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gross and Canteras, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Herry and Johansen, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kim et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ressler and Maren, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Walker and Davis, 1997</xref>). This pathway is thought to be mediated through the lateral and dorsal-midline thalamus regions, including the posterior intralaminar nucleus and paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus (PVT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Krout and Loewy, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">McNally et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yeh et al., 2021</xref>; but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brunzell and Kim, 2001</xref>). Supporting this model, rodent studies have shown that electrical stimulation of the dPAG, which triggers robust activity bursts (jumping, running, escaping) similar to footshock-induced unconditional responses (URs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jenck et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Olds and Olds, 1963</xref>), can effectively act as a surrogate US for both auditory and contextual FC in rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Di Scala et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kim et al., 2013</xref>). In parallel, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Johansen et al., 2010</xref> found that pharmacological inhibition of the PAG, encompassing both dorsal (dPAG) and ventral (vPAG) regions, diminishes the behavioral and neural responses in the amygdala elicited by periorbital shock US, thereby impairing the acquisition of auditory FC. Furthermore, while dPAG neurons initially respond to the shock US, the development of fear CRs results in a reduction of US-evoked neural responses in the PAG due to increased amygdala-PAG pathway-mediated analgesia that dampens footshock nociception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Johansen et al., 2010</xref>). Fundamentally, the negative feedback circuit between the amygdala and the dPAG serves as a biological implementation of the Rescorla–Wagner model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rescorla and Wagner, 1972</xref>), a foundational theory of associative learning that emphasizes the importance of prediction errors in reinforcement (i.e., US), as applied to FC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fanselow, 1998</xref>). However, the relevance of PAG–amygdala interactions observed in controlled conditioning chambers remains to be assessed in more realistic threat scenarios.</p><p>In human cases of intractable pain surgery, stimulation of the dPAG has been reported to induce intense fear and panic sensations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Carrive and Morgan, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Magierek et al., 2003</xref>). For instance, one patient described the sensation of PAG stimulation as “Something horrible is coming, somebody is now chasing me, I am trying to escape from him” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amano et al., 1982</xref>). Similarly, our previous work demonstrated that electrical stimulation of either the dPAG or BLA prompted naïve rats foraging for food in a naturalistic environment to flee to a safe nest in the absence of external threats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kim et al., 2013</xref>). Notably, the fleeing behavior induced by dPAG stimulation was contingent on an intact amygdala, whereas BLA stimulation-induced fleeing did not require an intact PAG. This pattern suggests that the fear/panic sensations reported in humans may originate from an innate fear information flow from the dPAG to the BLA.</p><p>To further explore this, we employed single-unit recordings and optogenetics in an ‘approach food-avoid predator’ paradigm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Choi and Kim, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wang et al., 2015</xref>), focusing on the responsiveness of dPAG and BLA neurons to an approaching robotic predator. Our findings reveal that optogenetic activation of the dPAG not only precipitated escape behaviors but also significantly increased BLA neuron activity. BLA neurons activated through dPAG optogenetic stimulation exhibited immediate and heightened synchronous activity in response to the predator threat, unlike BLA neurons unresponsive to dPAG stimulation. Considering the lack of direct monosynaptic projections between dPAG and BLA neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Vianna and Brandão, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">McNally et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cameron et al., 1995</xref>), we utilized anterograde and retrograde tracers in the dPAG and BLA, respectively. This was complemented by c-Fos expression analysis following exposure to predatory threats. Our anatomical findings suggest that the PVT may be part of a network that conveys predatory threat information from the dPAG to the BLA.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>dPAG neurons respond to extrinsic predatory threats during a risky foraging task</title><p>Five male Long–Evans rats, maintained at 85% of their normal weight through food restriction, were implanted with microdrive arrays positioned above the dPAG. The dPAG includes dorsomedial (dmPAG), dorsolateral (dlPAG), and lateral (lPAG) regions, as designated by extensive track-tracing, neurochemical, and immunohistochemical studies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bandler et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bandler and Keay, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Carrive, 1993</xref>). During baseline sessions, rats were required to procure a food pellet in an open arena (202 cm length × 58 cm width × 6 cm height; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) and return to their nest to consume it. The electrodes were gradually lowered (&lt;120 µm/day) into the dPAG during these sessions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Once well-isolated neural activities were detected, rats underwent predator testing with successive pre-robot, robot, and post-robot sessions (5–15 pellet attempts/session). During the robot session, the animals’ outbound foraging time (latency to reach the pellet or the predator-triggering zone) increased, while the pellet success rate decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>). We collected a total of 94 dPAG units (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>) during predator testing, with 23.4% (n = 22) showing increased firing rates (<italic>z</italic> &gt; 3) specifically to the approaching robot with short-latency responses (&lt;500 ms) during the robot session, but not during the pre- and post-robot sessions (robot cells; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E and F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C and D</xref>). We focused our analysis on excited robot cells, excluding other types of units that showed food-specific and mixed robot encounter + pellet procurement responses (pellet and BOTH cells; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>), to investigate predator-related dPAG activity. One cell that exhibited decreased firing rates (z &lt; –3) specifically to the robot was also excluded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>). The majority of the robot cells (90.9%) did not show significant correlations between movement speed and neuronal firing rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>). These results suggest that dPAG neurons participate in detecting an advancing robot and eliciting antipredatory-defensive behaviors, such as fleeing to a safe nest.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Dorsal periaqueductal gray (dPAG) single-unit recordings during risky foraging.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Rats underwent pre-robot, robot, and post-robot sessions, successfully securing pellets in pre- and post-robot trials, and failing during robot trials due to robot interference.

A separate group of rats with unilateral ChR2 (n = 9) or EYFP (n = 4) injections and optic fiber implantation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) underwent 4 days of baseline training followed by testing sessions. During testing, rats were allowed to procure a pellet without light stimulation (Off) and with light stimulation (On) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). The stimulation parameters employed were identical to those used in the anesthetized rats. During light-on trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>), the ChR2-expressing animals were not able to procure the pellet and consistently fled into the nest, whether the pellet was placed at a 76.2 cm long distance from the nest (On<sub>L</sub>) or at a 25.4 cm short distance from the nest (On<sub>S</sub>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F and G</xref>). However, EYFP control rats did not show any defensive behaviors. Latency to procure pellets increased as a function of the stimulation intensity, frequency, and duration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H–J</xref>). These results demonstrate that optical stimulation of CaMKII-expressing dPAG neurons effectively caused naïve rats approaching a food pellet to flee to the nest without an external threat.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Dorsal periaqueductal gray (dPAG) optical stimulation evokes fear.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Virus injection, optrode implantation in dPAG, and light stimulation during single-unit recordings in anesthetized rats.

From 66 BLA recorded neurons, 185 BLA pairs were computed for cross-correlograms (CCs) during post-robot surge (2 s periods subsequent to robot activation; robot session), post-pellet, and post-stim (2 s periods subsequent to pellet procurement; pre- and post-stim sessions) epochs. Twenty-six CCs showed significant peaks (z scores &gt; 3) around the paired spikes (between 0 ms and 100 ms) during the post-surge epoch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</xref>).

To identify potential mediators that relay predator signals from the dPAG to the BLA, we injected the anterograde tracer AAV-CaMKII-EYFP into the dPAG and investigated robot-induced c-Fos activities in AAV-expressed terminal areas of the dPAG. Cholera toxin subunit B (CTB) was also injected into the BLA in a subset of AAV-injected animals to examine potential anatomical evidence of relays between the dPAG and BLA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref>). After recovery, rats were trained to procure a pellet from the foraging arena. Animals were randomly assigned to foraging-only and robot-experienced groups. The foraging-only group quickly procured the pellet, while the robot-experienced group failed during the testing session (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Ninety minutes after testing, animals were perfused to analyze c-Fos activity and the tracers. Consistent with prior research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cameron et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Krout and Loewy, 2000</xref>), we also observed strong terminal expression in midline thalamic areas emerging from dPAG cell body AAV infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Among these, the PVT showed increased levels of c-Fos-positive cells in rats encountering the robot predator compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E and F</xref>). In animals that were also injected with CTB in the BLA, the robot encounter increased the percentage of CTB-labeled PVT neurons expressing c-Fos, compared to the foraging-only control, while the density of CTB remained comparable between the groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G and H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).

As such, the brain’s fear system, which evolved to counteract unpredictable, uncontrolled threats originating from biological agents, likely influences our everyday behavior when confronted with perceived risks. In line with this view, studies using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and an ‘active escape paradigm’—in which virtually represented subjects are chased by a virtual predator and receive an electric shock when ‘caught’—have shown that as the threat transitions from a distant position to an impending encounter with the subject, neural activity shifts from the ventromedial PFC and amygdala toward the PAG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mobbs et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mobbs et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>The present study investigated the neural mechanisms underlying antipredatory-defensive behaviors in rats engaged in a naturalistic goal-directed behavior of foraging for food in an open arena, using a combination of electrophysiology, optogenetics, and tracing techniques. We found that neurons in the dPAG are involved in detecting predatory threats and eliciting antipredatory-defensive behaviors in rats. Specifically, dPAG neurons displayed increased spiking in response to an approaching robot predator as rats reflexively fled from the open foraging arena into a safe nest. However, dPAG neuronal activity did not increase when the robot was stationary, which contrasts with a previous study that reported enhanced dPAG neuronal activity in mice exposed to an anesthetized (motionless) rat separated by a wire mesh in a chamber (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Deng et al., 2016</xref>) or a live rat tethered (restrained) with a harness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Reis et al., 2021</xref>). It has been suggested that looming stimuli may serve as simple, evolutionarily reliable signals of danger because genes are not capable of providing the brain with detailed information about all potential predatory threats, and all predators must approach their prey for consumption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kim and Jung, 2018</xref>). Our study also demonstrated that optogenetic stimulation of CaMKII-expressing dPAG neurons caused naïve rats approaching a food pellet to instantly flee to the nest without an external threat (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tsang et al., 2023</xref>). This confirmed escape behavior in foraging rats with dPAG electrical stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kim et al., 2013</xref>) was evoked by intrinsic dPAG neurons, not the fibers of passage or current spread to other brain regions. In contrast to our observation of escape-to-the-nest behavior, optogenetic activation of dPAG in mice elicited various defensive behaviors, such as running, freezing, and conditioned avoidance, when tested in a chamber (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Deng et al., 2016</xref>). This is consistent with the notion that the behavioral outcome from brain stimulation is influenced by environmental settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kim et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>As mentioned in the introduction, the dPAG is recognized as part of the ascending nociceptive pathway to the BLA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">De Oca et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gross and Canteras, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Herry and Johansen, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kim et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ressler and Maren, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Walker and Davis, 1997</xref>). The dPAG is also implicated in non-opioid analgesia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bagley and Ingram, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cannon et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fields, 2000</xref>). However, it is essential to emphasize that, despite its roles in pain modulation, the primary behavior observed in dPAG-stimulated, naive rats foraging for food in an open arena was goal-directed escape to the safe nest, underscoring the dPAG’s critical function in survival behaviors.</p><p>Our study also revealed that BLA neurons respond both to direct dPAG optical stimulation and to an external robot predator. Specifically, BLA cells responsive to dPAG stimulation showed increased firing rates and were more likely to be co-activated by predatory threats compared to dPAG stimulation-non-responsive BLA cells. Additionally, the firing rates of BLA cells in response to dPAG stimulation highly correlated with their responses to the actual predatory agent, indicating that BLA neurons involved in processing dPAG signals may play a crucial role in enhancing the coherence of the BLA network, thereby effectively managing predatory threat information. These findings, combined with previous research demonstrating that the amygdala is necessary for both intrinsic dPAG stimulation-induced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kim et al., 2013</xref>) and extrinsic robot-evoked (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Choi and Kim, 2010</xref>) escape behavior, suggest the dPAG-amygdala pathway’s involvement in processing innate fear signals and generating antipredatory-defensive behavior. However, it is crucial to consider the recent discovery that optogenetic stimulation of CA3 neurons (3000 pulses) leads to gain-of-function changes in CA3-CA3 recurrent (monosynaptic) excitatory synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Oishi et al., 2019</xref>). Although there is no direct connection between dPAG neurons and the BLA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Vianna and Brandão, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">McNally et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cameron et al., 1995</xref>), and no studies have yet demonstrated gain-of-function changes in polysynaptic pathways to our knowledge, the potential for our dPAG photostimulation (320 pulses) to induce similar changes in amygdalar neurons, thereby enhancing their sensitivity to predatory threats, cannot be dismissed.</p><p>We confirmed strong terminal expressions in the midline thalamic areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cameron et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Krout and Loewy, 2000</xref>) following AAV injection into the dPAG using immunohistochemistry. Notably, the PVT, in contrast to other midline thalamic subregions, exhibited increased c-Fos reactivity in response to the robot predator. This observation aligns with recent findings that dPAG projections specifically target the PVT rather than the centromedial intralaminar thalamic nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yeh et al., 2021</xref>). Additionally, subpopulations of the c-Fos-reactive PVT neurons were found to express CTB, retrogradely labeled by injection into the BLA. These results, in conjunction with previous research on the roles of the dPAG, PVT, and BLA in producing flight behaviors in naïve rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Choi and Kim, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Daviu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Deng et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kim et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kim et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kong et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ma et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Reis et al., 2021</xref>), the anterior PVT’s involvement in cat odor-induced avoidance behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Engelke et al., 2021</xref>), and the PVT’s regulation of behaviors motivated by both appetitive and aversive stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Choi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Choi and McNally, 2017</xref>), suggest the involvement of the dPAG→PVT→BLA pathways in antipredatory-defensive mechanisms, particularly as rats leave the safety of the nest to forage in an open arena (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Reis et al., 2023</xref>). Given the recent significance attributed to the superior colliculus in detecting innate visual threats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lischinsky and Lin, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wei et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zhou et al., 2019</xref>) and the cuneiform nucleus in the directed flight behavior of mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bindi et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tsang et al., 2023</xref>), further exploration into the communication between these structures and the dPAG-BLA circuitry is warranted.</p><p>While our findings demonstrate that opto-stimulation of the dPAG is sufficient to trigger both fleeing behavior and increased BLA activity, we have not established that the dPAG-PVT circuit is necessary for the BLA’s response to predatory threats. To establish causality and interregional relationships, future studies should employ methods such as pathway-specific optogenetic inhibition (using retrograde Cre-recombinase virus with inhibitory opsins; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lavoie and Liu, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Li et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Senn et al., 2014</xref>) or chemogenetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boender et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Roth, 2016</xref>) in conjunction with single-unit recordings to fully characterize the dPAG-PVT-BLA circuitry’s (as opposed to other midline thalamic regions for controls) role in processing predatory threat-induced escape behavior. If inactivating the dPAG-PVT circuits reduces the BLA’s response to threats, this would highlight the central role of the dPAG-PVT pathway in this defense mechanism. Conversely, if the BLA’s response remains unchanged despite dPAG-PVT inactivation, it could suggest the existence of multiple pathways for antipredatory defenses.</p><p>Future studies will also need to delineate the downstream pathways emanating from the BLA that orchestrate goal-directed flight responses to external predatory threats as well as internal stimulations from the dPAG/BLA circuit. Potential key structures include the dorsal/posterior striatum, which has been associated with avoidance behaviors in response to airpuff in head-fixed mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Menegas et al., 2018</xref>) and flight reactions triggered by auditory looming cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Li et al., 2021</xref>). Additionally, the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH) has been implicated in flight behaviors in mice, evidenced by responses to the presence of a rat predator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Silva et al., 2013</xref>) and upon optogenetic activation of VMH Steroidogenic factor 1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kunwar et al., 2015</xref>) or the VMH-anterior hypothalamic nucleus pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wang et al., 2015</xref>). Investigating the indispensable role of these structures in flight behavior could involve lesion or inactivation studies. Such interventions are anticipated to inhibit flight behaviors elicited by amygdala stimulation and predatory threats, confirming their critical involvement. Conversely, activating these structures in subjects with an inactivated or lesioned amygdala, which would typically inhibit fear responses to external threats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Choi and Kim, 2010</xref>), is expected to induce fleeing behavior, further elucidating their functional significance.</p><p>The innate predator-fear functions of the dPAG and BLA are distinct from their learned fear functions, as observed in FC studies. In FC, the dPAG is proposed to play a role in ‘US-processing’, transmitting footshock (pain) information to the amygdala, thus enhancing the CS pathway’s ability to activate the amygdalar fear system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fanselow, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Maren, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Almeida et al., 2004</xref>). This hypothesis is supported by research demonstrating that muscimol inactivation of the dPAG hinders FC to the footshock US (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Johansen et al., 2010</xref>), while electrical stimulation of dPAG neurons effectively serves as a US surrogate for FC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ballesteros et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kim et al., 2013</xref>). As conditioning progresses, amygdalar fear may suppress footshock-evoked dPAG’s teaching signals, thereby moderating FC in the amygdala, potentially through conditioned analgesia that dampens the footshock US’s painfulness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fanselow, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fanselow and Bolles, 1979</xref>). Consistent with this amygdalar-dPAG negative feedback notion, research has revealed that as CS-evoked responses of amygdalar neurons increase with CS-US pairings, footshock-evoked neural activity in the dPAG decreases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Johansen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ozawa et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Quirk et al., 1995</xref>). It remains to be determined whether there are distinct populations of innate predator-responsive and pain-responsive dPAG neurons or if the same dPAG neurons react to a wide range of aversive stimuli. Furthermore, it is worth noting that the same dPAG stimulation resulted in an activity burst UR in a small operant chamber, as opposed to a goal-directed escape to a nest UR in a large foraging arena (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kim et al., 2013</xref>). Additionally, FC to shock or predator US does not readily occur in naturalistic settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zambetti et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>Overall, this study enhances our understanding of the neural basis of antipredatory-defensive behaviors in rats, emphasizing the important roles of the dPAG and BLA in processing and responding to threat-related stimuli. The study also suggests the possibility of an innate fear mechanism, which may complement the commonly studied learned fear mechanism in the research of anxiety and fear-related disorders. Further research into these mechanisms could lead to the development of novel therapeutic interventions that target both innate and learned fear mechanisms, improving the treatment of anxiety and fear-related disorders.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Subjects</title><p>Male and female Long–Evans rats (initial weight 325–350 g) were individually housed in a climate-controlled vivarium (accredited by the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care), with a reversed 12 hr light/dark cycle (lights on at 7 PM) and placed on a standard food-restriction schedule with free access to water to gradually reach ~85% normal body weights.

For optogenetic stimulation, anesthetized male rats were injected with adeno-associated viruses (AAVs; serotype 5) to express Channelrhodopsin-EYFP (AAV5-CaMKIIa-hChR2(H134R)-EYFP, UNC Vector Core) or EYFP only (AAV5-CaMKIIa-EYFP) in the dPAG at a rate of 0.05 µl/min (total volume of 0.5 µl) via a microinjection pump (UMP3-1, World Precision Instruments) with a 33-gauge syringe (Hamilton). Animals were randomly assigned to each group. To avoid backflow of the virus, the injection needle was left in place for 10 min. After virus injection, an optic fiber attached to ferrules (0.22 NA, 200 µm core; ferrule diameter: 2.5 mm; Doric Lenses) or an optrode was implanted 0.4 mm dorsal to the injection sites. The microdrive and/or ferrule were secured by Metabond and dental cement with anchoring screws. Behavioral and recording experiments started after at least 1 week of recovery while optogenetic stimulation sessions started after at least 4 weeks after the surgery to allow for sufficient viral expression.

Once the rat returned to the nest with the pellet, the gate was closed. The behavior-only groups underwent 4 days of baseline foraging training. For the recording experiments, baseline sessions continued until unit activity in the dPAG or amygdala unit was successfully detected.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-3"><title>Testing</title><p>For dPAG recordings, single units were recorded across three successive sessions: pre-robot, robot, and post-robot (7–14 trials/session; 4–14 recording days; n = 5 rats, 96 units). The number of trials varied among subjects because trials were excluded if rats attempted to procure the pellet within 10 s post-dPAG stimulation or robot activation. This exclusion criterion was implemented to ensure an accurate characterization of unit responsiveness. In the pre- and post-robot trials, rats were permitted to freely procure the pellet. Before initiating the robot trials, a programmed robot (LEGO Mindstorms EV3 set) was placed at the end of the foraging arena. Upon the gate’s opening, whenever the rat came near (~25 cm) the pellet, the programmed robot would surge forward 23 cm, 60 cm, or 140 cm toward the animal at a velocity of ~75 cm/s, before returning to its original position. If the rat made another attempt to procure the pellet within 10 s after a robot activation, both the preceding and subsequent trials were excluded from the analyses to isolate and measure the unit properties accurately. For optical stimulation and behavioral experiments, the procedure included three baseline trials with the pellet placed 75 cm away, followed by three dPAG stimulation trials with the pellet locations sequentially set at 75 cm, 50 cm, and 25 cm. During each approach to the pellet, rats received 473 nm light stimulation (1–2 s, 20 Hz, 10 ms width, 1–3 mW) through a laser (Opto Engine LLC) and a pulse generator (Master-8; A.M.P.I.). Additional testing to examine the functional response curves was conducted over multiple days, with incremental adjustments to the stimulation parameters (intensity, frequency, duration) after confirming that normal baseline foraging behavior was maintained. For these tests, one parameter was adjusted incrementally while the others were held constant (intensity curve at 20 Hz, 2 s; frequency curve at 3 mW, 2 s; duration curve at 20 Hz, 3 mW). If the rat failed to procure the pellet within 3 min, the gate was closed, and the trial was concluded. For amygdala recordings with optical stimulation of the dPAG, pre-stim, stim, and post-stim sessions (5–15 trials/session) were carried out successively on the same day. These three consecutive phases mirrored the pre-robot, robot, and post-robot sessions, except that the dPAG light stimulation was given instead of the robot predator (6–18 recording days; n = 6 rats, 320 units). A subset of these animals (n = 3 out of 6 rats, 85 out of 320 units) also participated in a robot session following the post-stim session on selected days (1–16 recording days). Sessions involving the robot predator were repeated until habituation was observed or recordings were deemed invalid due to limitations with the microdrive or failure to detect units. Note that the mean success rate for the dPAG recordings was 2.8% ± 1.31, and animals subjected to the BLA recordings did not succeed in retrieving pellets during any of the robot trials.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Optrode recording under anesthesia</title><p>Upon optrode implantation, the animal was kept under anesthesia and moved to a unit recording setup (Neuralynx).

In total, 10 and 14 stimulation sessions were repeated in the two anesthetized rats, respectively.

A spike-sorting program (SpikeSort 3D; Neuralynx) and additional manual cutting were used for cluster isolation. Peri-event time histograms (PETH) were generated using NeuroExplorer (version 5.030; Nex Technologies) and further analyzed with custom MATLAB programs. The unit and speed data were binned at 0.1 s or 1 s and aligned to the time when the robot was activated, when the pellet was procured, or when the rat turned its body immediately before fleeing to the nest. All PETH data were normalized (<italic>z</italic>-scored) to the pre-event baseline period (from –5 s to 0 s prior to pellet procurement or robot activation, across 50 bins). Food approaching was indicated by the animal entering a designated zone 19 cm from the pellet, a behavior driven by hunger.

Previous studies have shown that the basolateral nucleus of the amygdala (BLA) and the periaqueductal gray matter (PAG) are necessary for the acquisition and expression of conditioned fear responses. However, it remains unclear how BLA and PAG neurons respond to predatory threats when animals are foraging for food. To address this question, Kim and colleagues conducted in vivo electrophysiological recordings from BLA and PAG neurons and assessed approach-avoidance responses while rats searched for food in the presence of a robotic predator.</p><p>The authors observed that rats exhibited a significant increase in the latency to obtain the food pellets and a reduction in the pellet success rate when the predator robot was activated. A subpopulation of PAG neurons showing an increased firing rate in response to the robot activation didn't change their activity in response to food pellet retrieval during the pre- or post-robot sessions. Optogenetic stimulation of PAG neurons increased the latency to procure the food pellet in a frequency- and intensity-dependent manner, similar to what was observed during the robot test. Combining optogenetics with single-unit recordings, the authors demonstrated that photoactivation of PAG neurons increased the firing rate of 10% of BLA cells. A subsequent behavioral test in 3 of these same rats demonstrated that BLA neurons responsive to PAG stimulation displayed higher firing rates to the robot than BLA neurons nonresponsive to PAG stimulation. Next, because the PAG does not project monosynaptically to the BLA, the authors used a combination of retrograde and anterograde neural tracing to identify possible regions that could convey robot-related information from PAG to the BLA. They observed that neurons in specific areas of the paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus (PVT) that are innervated by PAG fibers contained neurons that were retrogradely labeled by the injection of CTB in the BLA. In addition, PVT neurons showed increased expression of the neural activity marker cFos after the robot test, suggesting that PVT may be a mediator of PAG signals to the BLA.</p><p>Overall, the idea that the PAG interacts with the BLA via the midline thalamus during a predator vs. foraging test is new and quite interesting. The authors have used appropriate tools to address their questions. However, there are some major concerns regarding the design of the experiments, the rigor of the histological analyses, the presentation of the results, the interpretation of the findings, and the general discussion that largely reduces the relevance of this study.</p><p>The authors have fully addressed all my concerns.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.88733.4.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The authors characterized the activity of the dorsal periaqueductal gray (dPAG) - basolateral amygdala (BLA) circuit.

The authors employed single-unit recording and optogenetics tools to address these issues in an 'approach food-avoid predator' paradigm. They characterized dPAG and BLA neurons responsive to a looming robot predator and found that dPAG opto-stimulation elicited fleeing and increased BLA activity. Importantly, they found that dPAG stimulation produces activity changes in subpopulations of BLA neurons related to predator detection, thus supporting the idea that dPAG conveys innate fear signals to the amygdala. In addition, injections of anterograde and retrograde tracers into the dPAG and BLA, respectively, along with the examination of c-FOS activity in midline thalamic relay stations, suggest that the paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus (PVT) may serve as a mediator of dPAG to BLA neurotransmission. Of relevance, the study helps to validate an important concept that dPAG mediates primal fear emotion and may engage upstream amygdala targets to evoke defensive responses. The series of experiments provides a compelling case for supporting their conclusions. The study brings important concepts revealing dynamics of fear-related circuits particularly attractive to a broad audience, from basic scientists interested in neural circuits to psychiatrists.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa4"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.88733.4.sa4</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>Eun Joo</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Washington</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Seattle</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Kong</surname><given-names>Mi-Seon</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Washington</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Seattle</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Park</surname><given-names>Sanggeon</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Ewha Womans University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Seoul</named-content></addr-line><country>Republic of Korea</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Cho</surname><given-names>Jeiwon</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Ewha Womans University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Seoul</named-content></addr-line><country>Republic of Korea</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>Jeansok John</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Washington</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Seattle</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the previous reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Public Reviews</bold></p><p><italic>Reviewer 1 summarized that: In this revised version of the manuscript, the authors have made important modifications in the text, inserted new data analyses, and incorporated additional references, as recommended by the reviewers. These modifications have significantly improved the quality of the manuscript.</italic></p></disp-quote><p>We are grateful for the reviewer's positive recognition of our revisions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><italic>Reviewer 2 noted that:</italic></p><p><italic>(1) The authors do not show if the PVT mediates dPAG to BLA communication with any functional behavioral assay.</italic></p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s suggestion to include a functional assay to investigate the role of the PVT in mediating communication between the dPAG and BLA. Our primary objective was to confirm the upstream role of the dPAG in processing and relaying naturalistic predatory threat information to the BLA, thereby broadening our current understanding of the dPAG-BLA relationship based on Pavlovian fear conditioning paradigms.</p><p>Given previous anatomical findings indicating the absence of direct monosynaptic projections from the dPAG to the BLA (Cameron et al. 1995, McNally, Johansen, and Blair 2011, Vianna and Brandao 2003), we employed both anterograde and retrograde tracers, supplemented by c-Fos expression analysis following predatory threats, to explore possible routes through which threat signals may be conveyed from the dPAG to the BLA. Our findings indicated significant activity within the midline thalamic regions, particularly the PVT as a mediator of dPAG-BLA interactions, corroborating the possibility of dPAGàBLA information flow.</p><p>Investigating the PVT's functional role appropriately would require single-unit recordings, correlation analysis of PVT neuronal responses with dPAG and BLA neuronal responses, and pathway-specific causal techniques, involving other midline thalamic regions for controls. This comprehensive study would represent an independent study.</p><p>In response to previous feedback, we have carefully revised our manuscript to moderate the emphasis on the PVT's role. Both the Abstract, Results, and Discussion refer more broadly to &quot;midline thalamic regions&quot; and “The midline thalamus” (subheading) rather than specifically to the PVT. In the Introduction, we mention that the PVT &quot;may be part of a network that conveys predatory threat information from the dPAG to the BLA.&quot; Our conclusions about the functional interaction between the dPAG and BLA, which broaden the view of Pavlovian fear conditioning, are not contingent on confirming a specific intermediary role for the PVT.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><italic>(2) The author also do not thoroughly characterize the activity of BLA cells during the predatory assay.</italic></p></disp-quote><p>Our previous studies have extensively detailed BLA cell firing characteristics, including their responsiveness to food and/or a robot predator during the predatory assay (Kim et al. 2018, Kong et al. 2021), and compared these findings to other predator studies (Amir et al. 2019, Amir et al. 2015). In the current study, out of 85 BLA cells, 3 were food-specific and 4 responded to both the pellet and the robot, with none of these 7 cells responding to dPAG stimulation.</p><p>Given our earlier findings of the immediate responses of BLA neurons to robot activation, we specifically examined whether robot-responsive BLA neurons receive signals from the dPAG. For this analysis, we excluded all food-related cells (pellet cells and BOTH cells) and focused on the time window immediately after robot activation (within 500 ms after robot onset). This approach enabled us to avoid potential confounds from residual effects of robot-induced immediate BLA responses during the animals’ flight and nest entry behaviors.</p><p>Furthermore, as previously described, the robot is programmed to move forward a fixed distance and then return, repeatedly triggering foraging behavior. This setup facilitates the analysis of neural changes during food approach and predator avoidance conflicts. However, animals quickly adapt to the robot, reducing freezing and stretch-attend behaviors, making time-stamped analysis of these behaviors unfeasible.</p><p>We would like to highlight that the present study explicitly focused on demonstrating whether BLA neurons that responded to intrinsic dPAG optogenetic stimulation also responded to extrinsic predatory robot activation, and compared their firing characteristics to those BLA neurons that did not respond to dPAG stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). This targeted analysis provides insights into the responsiveness of BLA neurons to both intrinsic and extrinsic stimuli, furthering our understanding of the dPAG-BLA interaction in the context of predatory threats.</p><p><italic>Reviewer 3 also raised no concerns and stated that: The series of experiments provide a compelling case for supporting their conclusions. The study brings important concepts revealing dynamics of fear-related circuits particularly attractive to a broad audience, from basic scientists interested in neural circuits to psychiatrists.</italic></p><p>We sincerely thank the reviewer for the positive feedback on our revisions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the Authors</bold></p><p><italic>Reviewer 1: There are a few minor concerns that the authors may want to fix:</italic></p><p><italic>(1) Point (5) The sentence: &quot;The complexity of targeting the dPAG, which includes its dorsomedial, dorsolateral, lateral, and ventrolateral subdivisions&quot; is hard to follow because the ventrolateral subdivision is not part of the dPAG. The authors may want to say specific subregions of the PAG instead. It is also unclear why transgenic animals would be needed for this projection-defined manipulations. The combination of retrograde Cre-recombinase virus with inhibitory opsin or chemogenetic approach may be sufficient.</italic></p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s insightful feedback regarding our description of the dPAG and the use of transgenic mice in future studies. As suggested, we have corrected the manuscript to exclude the 'ventrolateral' subdivision from the dPAG description, now accurately aligning with pioneering studies (Bandler, Carrive, and Zhang 1991, Bandler and Keay 1996, Carrive 1993) that designated dPAG as including the dorsomedial (dmPAG), dorsolateral (dlPAG) and lateral (lPAG) regions, as cited in our revised manuscript.</p><p>We acknowledge the reviewer’s helpful suggestion regarding the use of retrograde Cre-recombinase virus with inhibitory opsins or chemogenetic approaches as viable alternatives. These methods have been incorporated into our discussion (pages 14-15): “While our findings demonstrate that opto-stimulation of the dPAG is sufficient to trigger both fleeing behavior and increased BLA activity, we have not established that the dPAG-PVT circuit is necessary for the BLA’s response to predatory threats. To establish causality and interregional relationships, future studies should employ methods such as pathway-specific optogenetic inhibition (using retrograde Cre-recombinase virus with inhibitory opsins; Lavoie and Liu 2020, Li et al. 2016, Senn et al. 2014) or chemogenetics (Boender et al. 2014, Roth 2016) in conjunction with single unit recordings to fully characterize the dPAG-PVT-BLA circuitry’s (as opposed to other midline thalamic regions for controls) role in processing predatory threat-induced escape behavior. If inactivating the dPAG-PVT circuits reduces the BLA's response to threats, this would highlight the central role of the dPAG-PVT pathway in this defense mechanism. Conversely, if the BLA's response remains unchanged despite dPAG-PVT inactivation, it could suggest the existence of multiple pathways for antipredatory defenses.”</p><p>This revision addresses the critique by clarifying the anatomical description of the dPAG and emphasizing the feasibility of using targeted viral approaches without the necessity for transgenic animals.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><italic>(2) Point (6e) The authors mentioned that &quot;pellet retrieval&quot; was indicated by the animal entering a designated zone 19 cm from the pellet, driven by hunger. Entering the area 19cm of distance should be labeled as food approaching rather then food retrieval because in many occasions the animals may be some seconds away of grabbing the pellet.</italic></p></disp-quote><p>We agree and incorporate the change (pg. 22).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><italic>(3) Point (11) We would strongly recommend the authors to replace the terminology &quot;looming&quot; by &quot;approaching&quot; to avoid confusion with several previous studies looking at defensive behaviors in responses to looming induced by the shadow of an object moving closer to the eyes.</italic></p></disp-quote><p>Done.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><italic>(4) Point (17) The authors mentioned that &quot;A total of three rats were utilized for the robot testing experiments depicted in Fig. 2 G-J.&quot; However, the figure indicates a total of 9 ChR2 and 4 controls.</italic></p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the confusion in our previous author responses. To examine the optical stimulation effects on behavior in Fig. 2G-J, we used a total of 9 ChR2 and 4 EYFP rats. The experimental sequence is detailed in the previously revised manuscript (pg. 20): “For optical stimulation and behavioral experiments, the procedure included 3 baseline trials with the pellet placed 75 cm away, followed by 3 dPAG stimulation trials with the pellet locations sequentially set at 75 cm, 50 cm, and 25 cm. During each approach to the pellet, rats received 473-nm light stimulation (1-2 s, 20-Hz, 10-ms width, 1-3 mW) through a laser (Opto Engine LLC) and a pulse generator (Master-8; A.M.P.I.). Additional testing to examine the functional response curves was conducted over multiple days, with incremental adjustments to the stimulation parameters (intensity, frequency, duration) after confirming that normal baseline foraging behavior was maintained. For these tests, one parameter was adjusted incrementally while the others were held constant (intensity curve at 20 Hz, 2 s; frequency curve at 3 mW, 2 s; duration curve at 20 Hz, 3 mW). If the rat failed to procure the pellet within 3 min, the gate was closed, and the trial was concluded.”</p><p>This clarification ensures that the actual number of animals used is accurately reflected and aligns with the figure data, addressing the reviewer's concern.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><italic>Reviewer 2: The authors made important changes in the text to address study limitations, including citations requested by the Reviewers and additional discussions about how this work fits into the existing literature. These changes have strengthened the manuscript.</italic></p><p><italic>(1) However, the authors did not perform new experiments to address any of the issues raised in the previous round of reviews. For example, they did not make optogenetic manipulations of the pathway including the PVT, and did not add any loss of function experiments. The justification that these experiments are better suited for future reports using mice is not convincing, because hundreds of papers performing these types of circuit dissection assays have been performed in rats.</italic></p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer's comments regarding the experimental scope of our study. Our study’s primary objective was to explore the dPAG’s upstream functional role in processing and conveying naturalistic predatory threat information to the BLA, extending our current understanding of the dPAG-BLA relationship based on Pavlovian fear conditioning paradigms. We believe that our findings effectively address this goal.</p><p>Our use of anterograde and retrograde tracers, supplemented by c-Fos expression analysis in response to predatory threats, was primarily conducted to verify the possibility of the dPAGàBLA information flow during predator encounters. This involved exploring potential routes through which threat signals might be conveyed from the dPAG to the BLA, given the lack of direct monosynaptic projections from the dPAG to BLA neurons (Cameron et al. 1995, McNally, Johansen, and Blair 2011, Vianna and Brandao 2003). This methodology helped us identify a potential structure, PVT, for more in-depth future studies. A thorough examination of the PVT's role would require single-unit recordings and causal techniques, incorporating other midline thalamic regions as controls, representing a significant and separate study on its own.</p><p>In response to prior feedback, we have carefully revised our manuscript to generally address the role of &quot;midline thalamic regions&quot; rather than focusing specifically on the PVT. We wish to emphasize that our findings, which illustrate unique functional interactions between the dPAG and BLA in response to a predatory imminence, remain compelling and informative even without definitive evidence of the PVT’s involvement.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><italic>Reviewer 3: In the revised version of the manuscript, the authors addressed adequately all the concerns raised by the reviewers.</italic></p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the thoughtful feedback on the earlier version of our manuscript and for reexamining the revisions we have made.</p><p>References</p><p>Amir, A., P.
