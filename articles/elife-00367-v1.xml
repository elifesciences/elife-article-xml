We used the budding yeast, <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, to ask whether nutrients that must be digested extracellularly select for the evolution of undifferentiated multicellularity. Because yeast use invertase to hydrolyze sucrose extracellularly and import the resulting monosaccharides, single cells cannot grow at low cell and sucrose concentrations. Three engineered strategies overcame this problem: forming multicellular clumps, importing sucrose before hydrolysis, and increasing invertase expression. We evolved populations in low sucrose to ask which strategy they would adopt. Of 12 successful clones, 11 formed multicellular clumps through incomplete cell separation, 10 increased invertase expression, none imported sucrose, and 11 increased hexose transporter expression, a strategy we had not engineered. Identifying causal mutations revealed genes and pathways, which frequently contributed to the evolved phenotype. Our study shows that combining rational design with experimental evolution can help evaluate hypotheses about evolutionary strategies.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00367.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00367.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00367.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Life first appeared on Earth more than 3 billion years ago in the form of single-celled microorganisms. The diverse array of complex life forms that we see today evolved from these humble beginnings, but it is not clear what triggered the evolution of multicellular organisms from single cells.</p><p>One of the simplest multicellular eukaryotes is the yeast, <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>—a fungus that has been used for centuries in baking and brewing and, more recently, as a model organism in molecular biology. Yeast cells feed on sugar (sucrose), but are unable to absorb it directly from their surroundings. Instead they secrete an enzyme called invertase, which breaks down the sucrose into simpler components that cells can take up with the help of sugar transporters.</p><p>However, single yeast cells living in a low-sucrose environment face a problem: most of the simple sugars that they produce diffuse out of reach. To overcome this difficulty, the cells could form multicellular clumps, which would enable each cell to consume the sugars that drift away from its neighbours. Alternatively, the cells could increase their production of invertase, or they could begin to take up sucrose directly.</p><p>Using genetic engineering, Koschwanez et al. produced three strains of yeast, each with one of these traits, and confirmed that all three strategies do indeed help fungi to grow in low sucrose. But could any of these traits evolve spontaneously? To test this possibility, Koschwanez et al. introduced wild-type yeast cells into a low-sucrose environment and studied any populations of cells that managed to survive. Of 12 that did, 11 had acquired the ability to form multicellular clumps, while 10 had increased their expression of invertase. Surprisingly, none had evolved the ability to import sucrose. However, 11 of the populations that survived also displayed an adaptation that the researchers had not predicted beforehand: they all expressed higher levels of the sugar transporters that take up sucrose breakdown products.</p><p>The work of Koschwanez et al. suggests that the benefits of being able to share invertase and, therefore, simple sugars, may have driven the evolution of multicellularity in ancient organisms. Moreover, their use of rational design (engineered mutations) combined with experimental evolution (allowing colonies to grow under selection pressure and studying the strategies that they adopt) offers a new approach to studying evolution in the lab.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00367.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00367.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>Multicellularity</kwd><kwd>Experimental evolution</kwd><kwd>Evolution of cooperation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institute of General Medical Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>K25GM085806</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Koschwanez</surname><given-names>John H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institute of General Medical Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM06873</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Koschwanez</surname><given-names>John H</given-names></name><name><surname>Foster</surname><given-names>Kevin R</given-names></name><name><surname>Murray</surname><given-names>Andrew W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The ability to share resources for the benefit of all members of a group may have driven ancient organisms to evolve from a unicellular to a multicellular state.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Multicellular organisms have evolved from a unicellular ancestor at least 25 times (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Grosberg and Strathmann, 2007</xref>), but we know little about what selected for the simplest form of multicellularity: an undifferentiated clump of cells produced by the repeated division of a single cell. Two driving forces have been proposed, protection from a variety of factors (including predation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kessin et al., 1996</xref>], environmental stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Smukalla et al., 2008</xref>], and phagocytosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Boraas et al., 1998</xref>]) and more efficient nutrient usage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dworkin, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Pfeiffer and Bonhoeffer, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Koschwanez et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alegado et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>In earlier work, we showed that sharing public goods favors clumps over isolated cells and proposed that sharing could have selected for simple multicellularity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Koschwanez et al., 2011</xref>). The budding yeast, <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, utilizes sucrose by secreting invertase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dodyk and Rothstein, 1964</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Carlson et al., 1981</xref>). Over 95% of this enzyme remains in the cell wall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Esmon et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Tammi et al., 1987</xref>), where it hydrolyzes sucrose into glucose and fructose, which are imported into the cell by a variety of hexose transporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Meijer et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Reifenberger et al., 1997</xref>). Lab yeast strains cannot grow from low density in low concentrations of sucrose because of diffusion: each cell captures only a small fraction of the sugars that sucrose hydrolysis releases, and the molecules released by other, distant cells are at very low concentration. As a result, cells cannot capture enough glucose and fructose to grow. Forming multicellular clumps overcomes this failure; cells in a clump can capture glucose and fructose diffusing from their neighbors and grow in concentrations of sucrose where low concentrations of individual cells cannot.</p><p>Speculating on evolution based on experiments with engineered strains is problematic. How well is the ease of engineering a strategy correlated with its evolutionary accessibility? Are multiple mutations required? Do these mutations reduce fitness in other environmental conditions? Are other strategies more accessible? Do certain combinations of strategies outcompete single strategies? And finally, how many different strategies does a set of parallel cultures adopt? Experimentally evolving populations, characterizing their phenotypes, and finding the mutations responsible for evolution allows us to address these questions.</p><p>We compared engineered and evolved solutions to the problem of growing on low sucrose concentrations. We engineered and tested three strategies that allow yeast cells to grow on low sucrose: forming multicellular clumps, importing sucrose before hydrolyzing it, and increasing invertase expression. We also evolved unengineered, laboratory strains to grow in the same conditions. All but one of the 12 clones selected from 10 independent populations form multicellular clumps as a result of incomplete cell separation, showing that this selection efficiently selects for multicellularity. In addition, 10 of the clones elevated invertase expression and 11 elevated hexose transporter expression, a strategy that we failed to anticipate, but none showed evidence of sucrose import. We combined bulk segregant analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Michelmore et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brauer et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Segrè et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Birkeland et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Magwene et al., 2011</xref>) with whole genome sequencing to identify putative causal mutations. We recreated two of the evolved clones, one with five mutations and one with eight mutations, to show that mutations we had identified were indeed causal. Finally, we competed the evolved clones against their ancestor and found that adaptation in sucrose severely reduces fitness in high glucose.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Three engineered strategies for growth in low sucrose</title><p>We began by asking whether undifferentiated multicellularity was the only strategy that allowed yeast cells to grow on low sucrose.

Mal11 is a maltose importer that can also import sucrose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Stambuk et al., 1999</xref>), but is not expressed in our yeast strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brown et al., 2010</xref>). We expressed Mal11 from a strong, constitutive promoter (<italic>P</italic><sub><italic>ACT1</italic></sub>) in three different strains: a standard lab strain (<italic>SUC2)</italic>, a strain that does not secrete invertase but produces cytoplasmic invertase (<italic>suc2-1cyt</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Koschwanez et al., 2011</xref>), and a strain that lacks invertase (<italic>suc2</italic>Δ). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> shows that both the <italic>SUC2</italic> and <italic>suc2-1cyt</italic> strains that make the maltose importer can grow from single cells on as little as 1 mM sucrose. The nearly identical growth of the <italic>SUC2</italic> and <italic>suc2-1cyt</italic> strains shows that the importer makes extracellular sucrose digestion dispensable, and the failure of the <italic>suc2Δ</italic> strains to grow shows that sucrose utilization after import still requires invertase. Thus three different strategies, clumping, increased invertase expression, and sucrose import, each allows yeast to grow from low cell density at low sucrose concentrations.</p><p>We competed each of the three strategies against an unmodified strain to ask whether they could invade an ancestral population. Derivatives of the two competing strains, each expressing a different fluorescent protein, were mixed together and passaged on 1 mM sucrose. In each passage, the cells were grown together for almost eight generations and then diluted 200-fold into fresh medium. The competition was assessed by the number of passages required to eliminate the less fit strain, or the ratio between the two strains at the end of the sixth passage. The three engineered strains all outcompeted the ancestral wild-type lab strain in 1 mM sucrose (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>), although the strain engineered to express increased invertase (EngHiInvertase) was a much worse competitor than the other two (EngClumpy, EngSucImport).<table-wrap id="tbl1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00367.005</object-id><label>Table 1.</label><caption><p>Fitness of engineered strains, evolved clones, recreated strains, and reverted strains</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00367.005">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00367.005</ext-link></p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td>Strain 1</td><td>Strain 2</td><td>1 mM sucrose</td><td>1 mM glucose + 1 mM fructose</td><td>80 mM glucose</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>EngClumpy</td><td>Wild-type lab</td><td>+++</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>EngHiInvertase</td><td>Wild-type lab</td><td>+</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>EngSucImport</td><td>Wild-type lab</td><td>+++</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>EvoClone1</td><td>Ancestor</td><td>++++</td><td>−−−</td><td>−−−−</td></tr><tr><td>EvoClone2</td><td>Ancestor</td><td>++++</td><td>0</td><td>−−</td></tr><tr><td>EvoClone3</td><td>Ancestor</td><td>++++</td><td>−−−</td><td>−−−−</td></tr><tr><td>EvoClone4</td><td>Ancestor</td><td>++++</td><td>+</td><td>−−−</td></tr><tr><td>EvoClone5</td><td>Ancestor</td><td>++++</td><td>+</td><td>−−−</td></tr><tr><td>EvoClone6</td><td>Ancestor</td><td>++++</td><td>+</td><td>−−</td></tr><tr><td>EvoClone7A</td><td>Ancestor</td><td>++++</td><td>−−</td><td>−−−</td></tr><tr><td>EvoClone7B</td><td>Ancestor</td><td>++++</td><td>+</td><td>−</td></tr><tr><td>EvoClone7C</td><td>Ancestor</td><td>++++</td><td>−−−</td><td>−−−−</td></tr><tr><td>EvoClone8</td><td>Ancestor</td><td>++++</td><td>−</td><td>−−−−</td></tr><tr><td>EvoClone9</td><td>Ancestor</td><td>++++</td><td>−</td><td>−−−</td></tr><tr><td>EvoClone10</td><td>Ancestor</td><td>++++</td><td>−</td><td>−−−−</td></tr><tr><td>Recreated2</td><td>Ancestor</td><td>++++</td><td>−</td><td>−</td></tr><tr><td>Recreated9</td><td>Ancestor</td><td>++++</td><td>0</td><td>−</td></tr><tr><td>EvoClone2</td><td>Recreated2</td><td>+</td><td>+</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>EvoClone9</td><td>Recreated9</td><td>+</td><td>−</td><td>−−−</td></tr><tr><td>EvoClone2</td><td>Reverted2</td><td>++++</td><td>+</td><td>−</td></tr><tr><td>EvoClone9</td><td>Reverted9</td><td>++++</td><td>+</td><td>+</td></tr><tr><td>EvoClone2</td><td>EngClumpy</td><td>++</td><td>0</td><td>−−</td></tr><tr><td><italic>ace2Δ</italic></td><td>Ancestor</td><td>+++</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td><italic>gin4-W19* irc8-G57V mck1-G227Vfs249</italic></td><td>Ancestor</td><td>+++</td><td>−</td><td>−</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><p>++++Strain 1 eliminates strain 2 in 1–2 growth cycles.</p></fn><fn><p>+++ Strain 1 eliminates strain 2 in 3–4 growth cycles.</p></fn><fn><p>++ Strain 1 eliminates strain 2 in 5–6 growth cycles.</p></fn><fn><p>+ Strain 1 &gt; 75% of population after 6 growth cycles.</p></fn><fn><p>0 Neither strain is &gt;75% of population after 6 growth cycles.</p></fn><fn><p>− Strain 2 &gt; 75% of population after 6 growth cycles.</p></fn><fn><p>−− Strain 2 eliminates strain 1 in 5–6 growth cycles.</p></fn><fn><p>−−− Strain 2 eliminates strain 1 in 3–4 growth cycles.</p></fn><fn><p>−−−− Strain 2 eliminates strain 1 in 1–2 growth cycles.</p></fn><fn><p>Growth cycle numbers are averaged over three independent experiments.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Experimental evolution produces multicellularity</title><p>Having shown that engineering can produce three different strategies for growth on low sucrose, we asked, ‘What would evolution do?'

Two genes, <italic>ACE2</italic> and <italic>UBR1,</italic> were mutated in at least half the clones, and groups of genes in three pathways, involved in glucose sensing (the <italic>RGT1</italic> group), growth regulation (the <italic>IRA1/IRA2</italic> group), and transcription (the Mediator group) were also mutated in many clones. We suspect that most of the putative causal mutations are loss of function mutations. Many alleles of the two most frequently mutated genes, <italic>ACE2</italic> and <italic>UBR1</italic> were nonsense mutations. In addition, amongst the 39 genes that were only mutated once, 12 (31%) of the mutations were nonsense mutations. This suggests that many of the mutations in the remaining 27 genes are loss of function mutations: for two genes that have been extensively studied, <italic>URA3</italic> and <italic>CAN1</italic>, 31% of strong loss of function mutations are nonsense mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lang and Murray, 2008</xref>). (Because loss-of-function mutations are typically recessive, we use lower case italic nomenclature to indicate the putative causal allele (e.g., <italic>irc8-G57V</italic>), and upper case italics to indicate the wild-type allele (e.g., <italic>IRC8</italic>). See the notes for <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl5">Table 5</xref> for a description of the mutation nomenclature. Roman text (e.g., Irc8) indicates the protein). <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 2</xref> is a summary of the mutations in each gene pathway.</p><p>Ace2 activates the transcription of enzymes that degrade the septum that connects mother to daughter cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Colman-Lerner et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sbia et al., 2008</xref>). <italic>ACE2</italic> was mutated in eight evolved clones; six of these mutations were nonsense mutations scattered through the open reading frame. All six of these clones had at least tenfold reductions in the expression of three genes known to aid in cell separation (<italic>CTS1</italic> [chitinase], <italic>DSE1</italic>, and <italic>DSE2</italic> [<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">supplementary file 1B</xref>]) in agreement with the original finding that <italic>ace2Δ</italic> mutants are clumpy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dohrmann et al., 1992</xref>).</p><p>Ubr1 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase in the N-end rule pathway. Ubr1 targets proteins with certain N-terminal amino acids, which are exposed by proteolytic cleavage or removal of the N-terminal methionine, for degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bartel et al., 1990</xref>). <italic>UBR1</italic> was mutated in 6 of the 12 clones; four mutations were nonsense mutations, strongly suggesting that the remaining two are also a loss of function mutations. Rad6, the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme that forms a heterodimer with Ubr1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dohmen et al., 1991</xref>), had a missense mutation in a seventh evolved clone.</p><p>The Rgt1 pathway controls cells' response to external glucose concentrations. In high glucose, Rgt1, a transcription factor, represses the expression of high affinity hexose transporters such as <italic>HXT4</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ozcan and Johnston, 1999</xref>). In low glucose, Snf3, a membrane-spanning glucose sensor, induces degradation of Mth1, a protein that is needed for Rgt1 to extert its repressive effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Broach, 2012</xref>). One of the genes in the Rgt1 pathway was mutated in 8 of the 12 clones: <italic>SNF3</italic> (3 missense), <italic>MTH1</italic> (2 nonsense), and <italic>RGT1</italic> (2 nonsense, 1 missense); no clones had two mutations in the pathway. Because Mth1 and Rgt1 work together to repress genes involved in growth on poor carbon sources, we expect that the mutations we isolated are loss of function mutations. <italic>MTH1</italic> loss of function mutations have been selected by others in glucose-limited chemostats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kao and Sherlock, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kvitek and Sherlock, 2011</xref>). On the other hand, because Snf3's activity leads to the induction of glucose-repressed genes, we speculate that the <italic>SNF3</italic> mutations may result in gain of function. One of our mutations, <italic>snf3-A231D,</italic> lies near a known dominant mutation, <italic>SNF3</italic>-<italic>R229K</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Ozcan et al., 1996</xref>), that elevates hexose transporter expression.</p><p>The Ras-cAMP pathway regulates cell growth in response to nutrients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Broach, 2012</xref>). Ras1 and Ras2 are small G proteins whose activity responds to nutrient sensing and who stimulate the activity of adenyl cyclase, which produces cAMP. Ira1 and Ira2 both encode GTPase activating proteins that inactivate Ras by stimulating its intrinsic GTPase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Tanaka et al., 1989</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">1990</xref>). <italic>IRA1</italic> or <italic>IRA2</italic> were mutated in four unrelated evolved clones (3 missense, 1 nonsense). Mutations that increase cAMP-dependent protein kinase activity are known to prevent starvation-induced cell cycle arrest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Matsumoto et al., 1983</xref>). By increasing Ras activity, loss of function mutations in <italic>IRA1</italic> and <italic>IRA2</italic> will elevate cAMP, which may allow cells to grow at lower external sugar concentrations than their ancestors.</p><p>Mediator is a multiprotein, global regulator of eukaryotic transcription. We found mutations in four of the at least 20 proteins that make up Mediator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Myers and Kornberg, 2000</xref>): <italic>SIN4</italic> (2 missense mutations), <italic>CSE2</italic> (1 nonsense mutation), <italic>MED1</italic> (1 nonsense mutation), and <italic>NUT1</italic> (1 nonsense mutation). Both mutations in <italic>SIN4</italic> occurred in residue 128 (G128D, G128S) and one, <italic>sin4-G128D</italic>, was also identified in a screen for suppressors of a deletion in <italic>SWI6.</italic> Swi6 associates with Swi4 to form SBF (SCB [Swi4-Swi6 cell cycle box] binding factor), a complex that regulates transcription early in the yeast cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Li et al., 2005</xref>). The <italic>SIN4</italic> mutations thus may cause increased expression of a gene normally activated by SBF. The hexose transporter gene, <italic>HXT3</italic>, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Iyer et al., 2001</xref>) is a known target of SBF and its was strongly elevated (108-fold and 32-fold) in the two clones (EvoClone1 and EvoClone4) carrying <italic>SIN4</italic> mutation (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2 tbl5">Table 2 and 5</xref>).</p><p>We analyzed read depth across all evolved clones and saw three major duplication or deletion events: (1) chromosome 3 in EvoClone10 was duplicated in the region between 152 and 172 kb from the left end of the chromosome. This doubling of read depth was reduced to a 50% increase in the segregated pool, indicating that the duplication was not causal. (2) The number of P-Type ATPases at the <italic>ENO1/2/5</italic> locus was reduced from 3 to 2 in EvoClone6 and EvoClone10. This reduction was also present in the backcrossed strain, indicating that it may have been causal. (3) The number of hexose transporter gene repeats at the <italic>HXT6/7</italic> locus increased from two in the ancestral strain to three in EvoClone7C. This amplification was also present in the backcrossed strain, indicating that it also may have been causal. Amplification of the <italic>HXT6/7</italic> locus has been found in other experimental evolutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Brown et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gresham et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kao and Sherlock, 2008</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Recreation of evolved clones verifies causal mutations</title><p>Are the putative causal mutations really responsible for the evolved phenotypes? We addressed this question by engineering the candidate mutations from two clones, EvoClone2 and EvoClone9, into their ancestor and asking if this manipulation reproduced the behavior of these clones.

Both the evolved and recreated clones outcompeted their ancestor in 1–2 passages (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>) showing that they are much fitter on low sucrose. Both recreated strains were slightly less fit their evolved counterparts: there were fewer recreated than evolved cells after six passages (46 generations). This fitness defect has three possible causes: (1) the recreated clones are missing minor causal alleles, which we failed to find; (2) detrimental mutations were introduced during the multiple transformations required to make the recreated strains; or, (3) the evolved clone (which is a mutator, unlike the recreated strain) continued to evolve and adapt during the competition.</p><p>To confirm that the putative causal alleles accounted for the evolved phenotype, we reverted these alleles in the evolved clones to their ancestral state. We replaced each of the mutant alleles in EvoClone2 and EvoClone9 with the ancestral allele. Both the resulting strains, Reverted2 and Reverted9, grew poorly in 1 mM sucrose, mostly existed as single cells, and were quickly outcompeted by the evolved clones (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>We used bulk segregant analysis to ask whether individual alleles were required for the evolved phenotype. We crossed the recreated strains to their ancestors, isolated haploid spores, selected this population for growth on 1 mM sucrose, and measured the frequency of the evolved alleles in the selected population. All five mutations in Recreated2 were strongly selected for, six of the eight mutations in Recreated9 were strongly selected for, and one mutation in Recreated9 was moderately selected for, confirming that all but one of the thirteen putative causal mutations were causal for improved growth on low sucrose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). We suspect that the eighth mutation in Recreated9, <italic>gcn2-I1528L</italic>, may be a false positive. In the original spore selection, the mutant allele segregated at only 91%, the low end of our threshold, and the mutation changed a poorly conserved isoleucine to leucine, suggesting it is unlikely to have a major effect on the protein's activity. In sum, our recreation experiments show that the putative causal alleles, with a single exception, are both necessary and sufficient to produce the evolved phenotype.<fig-group><fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00367.022</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Bulk segregant analysis with the recreated strains verifies causal alleles and shows that alleles responsible for clumpiness are selected in low sucrose and not low monosaccharide.</title><p>The recreated strains were backcrossed, sporulated, and selected in three different media: 1 mM sucrose (low sucrose), 80 mM glucose (high glucose), and 1 mM glucose plus 1 mM fructose (low monosaccharide).

Do the mutations selected on low sucrose increase, decrease, or have no effect on fitness on other carbon sources? To ask this question, we selected spores from crosses between ancestral and recreated clones in low monosaccharide and high glucose. Several mutations were selected for in low sucrose but not in low monosaccharide: mutations in <italic>MTH1</italic>, <italic>CSE2</italic>, and <italic>ACE2</italic> in Recreated2; and in <italic>MCK1</italic>, <italic>IRC8</italic>, and <italic>GIN4</italic> in Recreated9. The primary selective force for four of these six mutations is likely to be their ability to produce multicellularity: an <italic>ace2</italic>Δ strain is morphologically similar to EvoClone2 and a <italic>mck1-G227Vfs249 irc8-G57V gin4-W19*</italic> strain is morphologically similar to EvoClone9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Each of these two strains also outcompetes the ancestor strain in low sucrose but not in low monosaccharide (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). This shows that multicellular clumps were specifically selected by growth in low sucrose, rather than being a general response to low sugar concentrations. But clumpiness alone was not sufficient to match the growth of the evolved strains in sucrose—the engineered clumpy strain (EngClumpy) was not as fit in 1 mM sucrose as one of the evolved clones that had similar clump size (EvoClone2) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>Our evolved clones are less fit than their ancestor on high glucose (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). There are two explanations for this observation. The first is a direct result of selection: some mutations that improve growth on low sucrose reduce fitness on high glucose. The second appeals to the large number of mutations that hitchhiked with the causal mutations: some of the hitchhikers are neutral on low sucrose, but slow cell growth on high glucose. We distinguished these two possibilities by competing the evolved and recreated strains against their ancestor in high glucose. For both EvoClone2 and EvoClone9, the recreated strains performed as well as or better than the evolved clones, but worse than the ancestor, suggesting that both causal alleles and hitchhiking alleles contribute to the evolved clones' reduced fitness in high glucose.</p><p>We identified the causal alleles that impair growth on high glucose through bulk segregant analysis. When the progeny of the cross between ancestor and recreated strains are grown on high glucose, one of the causal mutations (<italic>ubr1-C175Y</italic>) in Recreated2 is selected against, three are approximately neutral, and one (<italic>ira1-S2553C</italic>) is strongly selected for. For Recreated 9, one mutation (<italic>gin4-W19*</italic> ) is very strongly selected against, one (<italic>ubr1-L1050Yfs1063</italic>) is weakly selected against, three are roughly neutral, two are weakly selected for (<italic>mck1-G227Vfs249</italic> and <italic>are1(-10 G</italic>→<italic>T</italic>)), and one (<italic>mcd1</italic>-<italic>S175L</italic>) is very strongly selected for in high glucose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Note that the mutations in <italic>UBR1</italic> and <italic>GIN4</italic> have opposite effects in low monosaccharide: <italic>ubr1</italic> mutations are selected for in both low sucrose and low monosaccharide, whereas the <italic>gin4-W19*</italic> mutation is selected against in low monosaccharide.</p><p>To analyze the effect of individual mutations on expression of <italic>HXT4</italic> and <italic>SUC2</italic> in EvoClone2, we made seven strains, each with a different allelic combination of the five causal mutations. We then measured <italic>HXT4</italic> and <italic>SUC2</italic> expression using RT-qPCR in the seven new strains and in Recreated2. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref> shows the results. The increase in <italic>HXT4</italic> expression is clearly a result of the <italic>MTH1</italic> loss of function mutation (<italic>mth1-H154Tfs156</italic>): all combinations containing this allele have higher <italic>HXT4</italic> expression than those containing the ancestral <italic>MTH1</italic> allele. This result confirms the role of <italic>MTH1</italic> in hexose transporter repression. The gradient in <italic>SUC2</italic> expression across the allelic combinations indicates that <italic>SUC2</italic> expression is a complex phenotype, which is under the quantitative control alleles at several genes. We also checked the clumpiness of each strain by manual observation using a microscope: the strains with the wild type <italic>ACE2</italic> allele were not clumpy, while each strain with <italic>ace2-L323*</italic> was clumpy. This result confirms that the clumpiness in EvoClone2 is caused by the loss of function mutation in <italic>ACE2</italic>.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In earlier work, we showed that clumps of yeast could grow in concentrations of sucrose where single cells could not. We speculated that the sharing of public goods (in this case, the hydrolysis products of sucrose) could select for multicellularity. Here, we confirmed this hypothesis: 11 of 12 clones evolved in low sucrose formed multicellular clumps caused by cells failing to separate after cell division (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3fs1 fig3s2 fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplements 1–3</xref>). RNA sequencing revealed two additional strategies that most clones used: 10 elevated invertase expression, a strategy we had engineered, and 11 elevated hexose transporter expression, a strategy we had not engineered. We found no evidence of another strategy we had engineered: sucrose import. We cannot eliminate the possibility that the clones import some sucrose, but when we kept cells from secreting invertase, their fitness in low sucrose was severely reduced, showing that their growth still depends on invertase secretion. We identified the mutations that led to increased growth on low sucrose and showed that these were necessary and sufficient to recreate the evolved phenotype in two of the evolved clones. The genes that were mutated identified pathways that control cell growth and nutrient utilization.</p><p>The evolved cells clump because they fail to separate after cell division, rather than by flocculating (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). A loss of function mutation in <italic>ACE2</italic> was likely the primary contributor to the clumpy phenotype in at least 6 of the 11 multicellular clones. We were able to recreate the clumpy morphology of EvoClone9 with mutations in <italic>MCK1</italic>, <italic>IRC8</italic>, and <italic>GIN4</italic>; note that EvoClone3, one of the two other clumpy clones with wild type <italic>ACE2</italic>, also had a mutation in <italic>IRC8</italic>. Mutations in <italic>ACE2</italic> are likely to be frequent because inactivation of this gene simultaneously reduces the expression of multiple genes needed for cell separation; mutations in the genes that Ace2 regulates would be likely to have smaller effects. None of our clones became clumpy by restoring function to <italic>AMN1</italic>, the gene whose loss of function allele was selected for during laboratory domestication of budding yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Yvert et al., 2003</xref>). This is not surprising since the target size for mutations that restore <italic>AMN1</italic> to its wild type function is much smaller than the target size for inactivating <italic>ACE2.</italic></p><p>Was the clumpy phenotype selected because it confers some other advantage, such as faster settling in unstirred cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Ratcliff et al., 2012</xref>), rather than because it improves growth in low sucrose? Three lines of evidence show that this is not true. First, none of the evolved clones had a strong fitness advantage over the ancestor in 1 mM glucose plus 1 mM fructose, the monosaccharide equivalent of 1 mM sucrose (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>) showing that these clones were specifically adapted to sucrose. Second, a strain that was engineered to be clumpy (EngClumpy) outcompeted the ancestor in low sucrose, but not low monosaccharide (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>), demonstrating that low sucrose concentrations specifically selects for clumps, reinforcing our earlier findings on engineered multicellularity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Koschwanez et al., 2011</xref>). Third, the alleles that recreate the clumpy morphology (<italic>ace2-L323*</italic> in EvoClone2 and the combination of <italic>mck1-G227Vfs249</italic>, <italic>gin4-W19*</italic>, and <italic>irc8-G57V</italic> in EvoClone9) are strongly selected for in low sucrose and are not selected for in low monosaccharide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). Because the starting pool of segregants and the selection protocol was identical in both media, this result shows that more efficient sucrose utilization, rather than some other phenotype, selected for the clumpy phenotype.</p><p>Analyzing gene expression and the role of individual mutations demonstrated that we had selected for more than multicellularity. Most (10 out of 12) of the evolved clones had increased invertase expression, even though the strain we had engineered to have high invertase expression had only a small advantage over a wild-type strain (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). The advantage of increased invertase expression in a shaken culture of single cells is likely to be small since all cells share the monosaccharides that escape from the small, unstirred volume that surrounds each cell. But high invertase expression makes sense in conjunction with the other two strategies we observed, multicellularity and elevated monosaccharide import. In a clump, multiple cells share a larger unstirred volume and have preferential access to the monosaccharides their neighbors release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Koschwanez et al., 2011</xref>). Increasing invertase expression will increase the rate of sucrose hydrolysis, and making more hexose transporters will increase the fraction of the monosaccharides that are imported rather than escaping to the bulk medium. Thus we expect that increasing invertase expression, making cell clumps, and making more hexose transporters will act together to increase fitness on low sucrose. Because low extracellular glucose induces the expression of both high affinity hexose transporters and invertase, it is likely that single mutations can increase levels of both types of proteins. In addition, clumpiness may indirectly elevate invertase expression: because secreted invertase expression peaks at roughly 0.5 mM external glucose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Koschwanez et al., 2011</xref>), clumps may increase invertase expression because concentrating the cells in space collectively raises the local glucose concentration.</p><p>Many of the mutations we selected are likely to affect the linked processes of sugar harvesting and the control of cell growth. As the level of potential nutrients in their environment falls, cells must make choices: how much of their resources they invest in trying to harvest nutrients from their environment, and how much of the imported nutrients they store to meet future challenges and how much they use to maximize their current growth rate. As an example, wild strains may stop growing and dividing at low external glucose levels because this decision improves their ability to survive if glucose levels continued to fall, even though they could support cell growth at the current glucose concentration if they expressed very high levels of hexose transporters and stored no sugar as glycogen. Influences on this type of decision are likely to explain repeated mutations in one gene (<italic>UBR1</italic>) and three groups of genes, which control glucose's effect on transcription (the <italic>RGT1</italic> group), how nutrient availability controls cell growth (the <italic>IRA</italic> group), and general transcription (the Mediator group).</p><p><italic>UBR1</italic> was mutated in half of the evolved clones. Four of the six mutations are nonsense mutations, suggesting that we selected for inactivation of this protein. We suspect that prevention of N-end rule mediated protein degradation increases the expression of genes that promote growth in carbon limited cells: in both evolved clones that we recreated, the evolved allele of <italic>UBR1</italic> was selected for in sucrose and low monosaccharide and selected against in high glucose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>).</p><p>The <italic>RGT1</italic> group of genes gives external glucose concentrations the ability to control the expression of genes needed for growth in low glucose concentrations. Genes in this pathway were causally mutated in 8 of 12 evolved clones. The pattern of mutations we observe in these genes is consistent with selection to reduce the repression mediated by Rgt1 and Mth1. We also found, by using RT-qPCR on one of the reconstructed clones, that a loss-of-function mutation in <italic>MTH1</italic> was responsible for the increase in <italic>HXT4</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Mutations in one of the components of the Mediator complex, Sin4, had previously been shown to be involved in genes required for passage through Start, the transition in the yeast cell cycle that is most sensitive to nutritional signals. We recovered two mutations in this gene and found they were both associated with a strong increase in expression of Hxt3, a low affinity glucose transporter.</p><p>We saw mutations in <italic>IRA1</italic> and <italic>IRA2</italic> in four independent lineages. These mutations are likely to reduce the activity of Ira1 and Ira2 and thus increase the activity of Ras at low sugar concentrations, promoting growth. A mutant of <italic>IRA1</italic> in EvoClone2 was one of only two mutants of 13 in the recreated strains that was strongly selected for in all three conditions, and mutants of <italic>IRA1</italic> have been found in a yeast experimental evolution done in low glucose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kao and Sherlock, 2008</xref>) and rich media (Lang, personal communication, October 2012). We suspect that Ira1 and Ira2 reduce the activity of Ras and thus the growth rate of cells on suboptimal carbon sources (low sugar concentrations, ethanol). Because we used batch cultures, even the high glucose cultures went through an environmental shift after they had fermented all the glucose to ethanol. Disruption of either <italic>IRA1</italic> or <italic>IRA2</italic> increases sensitivity to heat shock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Tanaka et al., 1989</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">1990</xref>). We suggest that we have selected for mutants than ignore pathways designed to induce cells exposed to unfavorable conditions to reduce their growth rate and induce programs that will protect them if conditions worsen.</p><p>We took an integrated approach to understanding evolution. Experimental evolution has long been used to study nutrient adaptation in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Paquin and Adams, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ferea et al., 1999</xref>) and bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Levin et al., 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lenski et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barrick et al., 2009</xref>). Although evolved bacteriophage isolates were sequenced in the 1990s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bull et al., 1997</xref>), the cost of cellular genome sequencing has only recently dropped to a level where it is possible to find single nucleotide polymorphisms in an evolved microbe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barrick et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Araya et al., 2010</xref>). We combined engineering, experimental evolution, bulk segregant analysis, and genetic reconstruction to build a picture of how budding yeast evolve in response to a specific challenge: the need to grow on a nutrient that is released into the local environment by extracellular hydrolysis. Testing hypothetical strategies by engineering allowed us to look for their phenotypic signatures, such as the increased expression of hydrolytic enzymes, in evolved populations. Having a method to sift the minority of causal mutations from the majority of hitchhikers allowed us to use mutators and increase the speed of evolution. The ability to swap evolved and ancestral alleles made it possible to verify our methods for identifying causal mutations and show that we had identified mutations that were either generalists, promoting growth across all the environments we tested, or specialists showing antagonistic pleiotropy by being strongly beneficial in one environment and deleterious in another. Finally, performing multiple experiments in parallel allowed us to identify mutations in particular genes and pathways as contributing strongly to evolutionary success.</p><p>We speculate that unicellular organisms have evolved a combination of three strategies to access nutrients that are digested extracellularly: increasing secretion of an extracellular hydrolase, increasing the import of its products, and forming multicellular clumps. An increase in nutrient transport seems the least costly, but its effect as a sole strategy is limited if the local concentration of the hydrolysis products remains unchanged. An increase in enzyme secretion will increase the level of the hydrolysis products, but enzyme production is costly and allows unrelated cells from the same or different species to ‘cheat' and steal simple nutrients without incurring the cost. The formation of multicellular clumps allows the hydrolysis products to be shared among direct kin and reduces the risk of cheating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Koschwanez et al., 2011</xref>). We have shown that yeast, when selected for growth in low sucrose media, used a mixture of all three strategies.</p><p>The combination of laboratory engineering and evolutionary analysis shown here and in our previous work supports the speculation that the sharing of public goods was the initial selection for undifferentiated multicellularity. For organisms with rigid cell walls like yeast, algae, and bacteria, cells must secrete enzymes to separate mother from daughter after cytokinesis. The target size for mutations in these enzymes and the control circuits that regulate their production will be large, making it easy to evolve undifferentiated multicellularity. Although lab strains of yeast were selected to be unicellular during their domestication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mortimer and Johnston, 1986</xref>), the level of clumpiness varies in wild isolates of yeast, and undifferentiated multicellularity may have been recurrently selected for its advantage in harvesting nutrients or for protection from stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Smukalla et al., 2008</xref>). Organisms without a cell wall, such as animal cells, would need another innovation, such as cell-adhering cadherins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abedin and King, 2008</xref>), in order to evolve multicellular clumps. But even in these organisms, cells must adhere to each other during sexual reproduction, implying the existence of adhesive proteins that could be modified to allow the evolution of multicellular clumps.</p><p>If undifferentiated multicellularity is so easy to evolve in eukaryotes, then why did it take so long for fossils of differentiated multicellular organisms to appear in the fossil record? Indeed, there is suggestive evidence of undifferentiated eukaryotic multicellularity 2 billion years ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">El Albani et al. 2010</xref>), but the radiation of more complex multicellularity is not seen for over a billion years later. This disparity has received a large amount of attention in paleontology, particularly in the context of the seemingly rapid radiation of the animals at the base of the Cambrian. Possible explanations for this ‘Cambrian explosion' include novel selective forces due to the environmental changes that occurred shortly before the Cambrian or the possibility that evolutionary arms races among a few early species drove the radiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Marshall, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Peters and Gaines, 2012</xref>). Alternatively, the evolution of differentiated multicellularity may have been slow and gradual and we simply lack the fossil evidence. Whatever the case, it is interesting to ask why the first differentiation might have arisen. From our data, we speculate that the effectiveness of clumping as a strategy could be improved if a limited number of cells increase their enzyme secretion. Such a simple division of labor may have been the precursor to complex multicellularity in the lineages that lead to animals and other complex multicellular species.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Media</title><p>Unless otherwise noted, the experimental evolution and all experiments were conducted in minimal (no amino acids or nucleotides) synthetic media with the following two exceptions: (1) the auxotrophic strains expressing high levels of Flo1 required the addition of leucine, histidine, and lysine, and (2) strains undergoing galactose induction in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> were pregrown in YP 2% glycerol (10 g/l yeast extract, 20 g/l peptone, and 2% [v/v] glycerol) plus the indicated concentration of galactose.

After 4–5 days of incubation on a roller drum at 25°C, sporulation was verified by observing the cells in a microscope.</p><p>To digest ascii, 1 ml of the sporulated culture was pelleted and resuspended in 50 µl 10% Zymolyase (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.zymoresearch.com">www.zymoresearch.com</ext-link>) for 1 hr at 30°C. 400 µl of water and 50 µl of 10% Triton X-100 were added, and the digested spores were sonicated for 5–10 s to separate the tetrads. Tetrad separation was verified by observing the cells in a microscope. The separated tetrads were then spun down slowly (6000 rpm) and resuspended in growth media.</p><p>To select haploid spores, the entire digested spore culture was added to 50 ml of 1 mM glucose + 1 mM fructose minimal media and growth to saturation.

Each culture was selected for growth in 1 mM sucrose through four passages (inoculation to saturated growth) as follows: one 100:1 dilution, and three 500:1 dilutions (≈34 generations total). The cells were spun down and resuspended in YNB during each dilution in order to eliminate the non-sucrose carbon sources from the media. Genomic DNA was made from the final saturated culture.</p><p>Bulk segregant analysis of Recreated2 and Recreated9 followed the same procedure with one exception: the cells were not spun down in between dilutions. Instead, 100 µl of culture was added directly to 50 ml of fresh media for a 500:1 dilution.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Genomic DNA preparation</title><p>To prepare genomic DNA, the culture was pelleted and resuspended in 50 µl of 1% Zymolyase in 0.1 M, pH 8.0 NaEDTA.

Intact RNA was verified by observing two sharp rRNA bands using agarose gel electrophoresis. cDNA was made from 100–200 ng of RNA using Thermo Scientific Maxima First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit for RT-qPCR (K1641). The 20 µl reaction was diluted tenfold and 11 µl of the diluted sample was used for real time qPCR using Thermo Scientific Maxima SYBR Green/ROX qPCR Master Mix (K0222). Amplification efficiency of the primers was verified by generating standard curves with four serial dilutions.

All software written for this analysis is publicly available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/koschwanez">https://github.com/koschwanez</ext-link>. We used the following criteria to select putative causal mutations: (1) the evolved clone was mutated relative to the strain used to inoculate the time zero culture, (2) the mutation caused a nonsynonymous substitution in a coding region or changed the promoter sequence ≤500 bp upstream of the coding region start site, and (3) the mutation appeared in over 90% of the reads in backcrossed pool. Putative causal mutations were manually verified by looking at aligned reads.</p><p>RNA sequences were aligned to the S288C reference genome using TopHat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Trapnell et al., 2009</xref>), and significant differences in expression between the ancestor and the evolved clone were called using the default setting in Cufflinks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Trapnell et al., 2010</xref>). The Cufflinks package uses the log of the ratio of expression in two conditions together with an estimate of the gene's variance to generate a t-value that it uses in a Students t-test. We used one ancestor derivative, yJHK110, as the reference strain to compare expression with the evolved clones, and the other ancestor derivative, yJHK111, as a control strain in the comparison.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Data analysis and figures</title><p>Unless otherwise noted, data analysis was performed in the R programming language (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.r-project.org">www.r-project.org</ext-link>) and plots were generated using the R library ggplot2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wickham, 2009</xref>).

Trace plots were used in two analyses. First, we estimated the spread of mutations through a population by Sanger sequencing time points from the evolution. Second, we estimated the segregation of alleles in the backcrossed, recreated strains by Sanger sequencing the putative causal alleles in the final, selected population. The fraction of mutant alleles in the population was assumed to be the height of the mutant allele peak divided by the height of the mutant allele peak plus the ancestor allele peak. In the time course analysis, values below 5% (the approximate background level) were assumed to be zero, and values above 95% were assumed to be 100%. In the segregation analysis, actual values, not corrected for background, are shown.</p><p>We note that many of the mutations appear to rise with very similar time courses to each other. This could reflect the modest time resolution of our measurements and the insensitivity of using Sanger sequencing to estimate allele frequencies, but we suspect it reflects the strong advantages that accrue to those rare lineages where two or three beneficial mutations occur in quick succession (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lang et al., 2011</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Competitions</title><p>To compare the fitness of the recreated and evolved strains, we developed a fitness assay that was suitable for strains with non-uniform morphologies. We could not use standard, quantitative methods of measuring fitness, such as FACS-based competitions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Desai et al., 2007</xref>), because we were not able to accurately count the number of cells per clump in a large population. We therefore used a qualitative microscopy-based fitness assay to compare growth of a YFP-labeled population and a CFP-labeled population. We started the competitions by growing each population separately to saturation in 1 mM glucose + 1 mM fructose. Equal volumes of each strain were mixed together, and then checked under a microscope to verify that both strains were equally present. 50 µl of the mixed culture was then inoculated into 10 ml of the test media. When the culture reached visible density (&gt;10<sup>6</sup> cells/ml), three blindly chosen images of a 20 µl sample were taken on the microscope with a 20× objective. Extermination was defined as zero cells in one strain and more than 30 total cells of the other strain. If both strains were still present, 50 µl of the culture was inoculated into 10 ml of fresh media. After six growth cycles, a winner was declared if there was a clear majority (&gt;75%) of one strain. Otherwise, the competition was declared a tie. The number of cycles until extermination was averaged across three independent experiments, and qualitative values (++++ through −−−−) were assigned as described in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>. + or − was assigned if one of the strains won two out of the three independent competitions that lasted through all six growth cycles.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Check for flocculation or cell separation</title><p>The evolved clones already constitutively expressed YFP, and a constitutively expressed CFP version of each clone was made by deleting the P<sub><italic>ACT1</italic></sub>-ymCitrine-<italic>URA3</italic> construct from the <italic>URA3</italic> locus and then transforming with a <italic>ura3</italic>Δ::P<sub><italic>ACT1</italic></sub>-yCerulean-<italic>URA3</italic> construct. The two versions of each strain were grown separately in 1 mM glucose + 1 mM fructose media to saturation, and then the two versions were vortexed or sonicated (both gave identical results) for 10 s and then combined at low density in fresh 1 mM sucrose media. The mixed cultures were grown to visible density at 30°C and then pipetted into a well of a glass-bottomed 96-well plate and examined by microscope.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor and 2 reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewer discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>In this paper the authors have set out to test the hypothesis that multicellularity can emerge in otherwise single-celled microbes by selection for improved growth in low-sucrose environments. Sucrose utilization in budding yeast is unusual as it must be hydrolyzed extracellularly by invertase, resulting in glucose and fructose, which can then be imported into the cell. In low sucrose conditions, cells can't grow when they exist as single cells as hydrolyzed glucose and fructose is lost through diffusion. However, the authors have previously shown that if cells are engineered to clump together they can grow in this condition. This is presumably because the local concentration of the products of sucrose hydrolysis (glucose and fructose) is sufficiently high for cells to grow when they clump but not when they are present as individual cells. In this paper the authors have performed a long-term selection in which wild type, non-clumpy cells were propagated by serial dilution in an environment containing low sucrose. They find that this condition does indeed result in selection for clumpy cells. In addition, most of the clones that they analyze have increased expression of the invertase gene (SUC2) and, surprisingly, increased expression of a large number of hexose transporter genes. The authors used a mutator strain and thus mutants with increased fitness have acquired a large number of mutations. To identify causative alleles the authors performed bulk segregant analysis, which allowed them to identify the likely alleles that confer increased fitness. They prove that a fitness increase is attributable to some of these mutations by engineering strains containing only these mutations in addition to reverting acquired mutations in the evolved strains. They speculate that clumping of unicellular organisms may have led to the development of multicellularity.</p><p>This is an excellent dataset that should definitively be published in a major journal. In fact, the experiments, as well as the analysis and the presentation, are mostly very clear. Still, there are some minor comments that need attention in a revised version.</p><p>1) There is little discussion about the general implications of the findings. Hence, the reader is left with the impression that it would have been rather easy to evolve the first steps to multicellularity, but would ask him or herself why it took such a long time until the first multicellular organisms emerged. Maybe the system studied is actually an oversimplification that has only an indirect implication for the evolution of multicellularity. We are of course aware that any such discussion would be rather speculative, but it might nonetheless be worthwhile to address at least some of the pertinent issues.</p><p>2) Regrettably, the authors have neglected to include an essential control: a population of cells propagated in parallel in a non-sucrose environment. Ideally, this would be a low glucose/fructose environment using identical methods. Using long term-selections it is very easy to select for clumping cells either intentionally (Ratcliff et al 2012) or unintentionally (Lang et al., 2011). As the authors set out to demonstrate that it is a benefit of sharing secreted invertase that drives selection for clumpiness, we would have expected this simple control. Alternatively, the same selection using a cytoplasmically expressed invertase and a <italic>MAL11</italic> overexpression allele would also serve as a negative control. This would provide the proof that the observed outcome is unique to the sucrose selection. Nevertheless, we do not consider the lack of this control as a fatal flaw as the authors present multiple post hoc analyses to demonstrate that the fitness increase is unique to a low sucrose environment. The most compelling being the demonstration that the evolved clones have no fitness difference (or slightly reduced fitness) compared with wild type in a low glucose/fructose environment.</p><p>3) The authors use of bulk segregant analysis to identify beneficial mutations and engineering to recreate strains is impressive. However, some simple tetrad dissection would enable the authors to make more definitive statements about the effect of ace2 mutations on clumpiness and Rgt1 pathway mutations' HXT expression (assayed using qPCR). In addition they could test whether the Ubr1 mutations segregate with any of the phenotypes. Segregation analysis of <italic>SUC2</italic> expression in a cross would test whether it is always associated with clumpiness.</p><p>4) The fact that the “recreated” strains are less fit than the evolved clones suggests that something is being missed. One obvious explanation is copy number variation. Studies from the Rosenzweig, Botstein, and Sherlock labs have shown that long-term propagation of yeast strains in nutrient poor environments using chemostats results in selection for transporter amplifications. As the low sucrose environment is also a nutrient poor one, we would expect amplification alleles to be beneficial. However, the authors' data do not allow testing for this as they have performed RNASeq analysis of clones. Were any individual clones sequenced that can be analyzed for copy number variation? The authors could also check in the bulk segregant sequencing data for evidence of copy number variation at the <italic>SUC2</italic> locus or any of the HXT loci that appear to be massively increased in expression.</p><p>5) Many wild <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> strains are clumpy and loss of clumpiness is likely a lab-adapted trait. The authors should make it clear that loss and gain of clumpiness is likely to have occurred many times in yeast populations and provide other explanations for why clumpiness in yeast cells might be recurrently selected.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00367.028</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) There is little discussion about the general implications of the findings.

Indeed, there is suggestive evidence of undifferentiated eukaryotic multicellularity 2 billion years ago (El Albani et al. 2010), but the radiation of more complex multicellularity is not seen for over a billion years later. This disparity has received a large amount of attention in paleontology, particularly in the context of the seemingly rapid radiation of the animals at the base of the Cambrian. Possible explanations for this “Cambrian explosion” include novel selective forces due to the environmental changes that occurred shortly before the Cambrian or the possibility that evolutionary arms races among a few early species drove the radiation (Marshall 2006; Peters and Gaines 2012). Alternatively, the evolution of differentiated multicellularity may have been slow and gradual and we simply lack the fossil evidence. Whatever the case, it is interesting to ask why the first differentiation might have arisen. From our data, we speculate that the effectiveness of clumping as a strategy could be improved if a limited number of cells increase their enzyme secretion. Such a simple division of labor may have been the precursor to complex multicellularity in the lineages that lead to animals and other complex multicellular species.”</p><p><italic>2) Regrettably, the authors have neglected to include an essential control: a population of cells propagated in parallel in a non-sucrose environment.

There are three strong lines of evidence that argue that the evolution of multicellularity was a specific response to low sucrose concentrations: (1) the failure of the evolved clones to show increased fitness on low monosaccharide concentrations; (2) the fitness advantage of engineered clumpy strains in sucrose and not in low monosaccharide; (3) the failure to select for the mutations that cause multicellularity (<italic>ace2</italic> in Recreated 2 and <italic>mck1</italic>, <italic>irc8</italic>, and <italic>gin8</italic>) on low monosaccharide concentrations when we analyze the effect of individual mutations as they segregate in a cross between the ancestral and evolved strains.</p><p><italic>3) The authors use of bulk segregant analysis to identify beneficial mutations and engineering to recreate strains is impressive.

We concluded that the <italic>ACE2</italic> mutation caused clumpiness and the <italic>MTH1</italic> mutation caused increase in <italic>HXT4</italic> expression (as the reviewers suspected). The <italic>SUC2</italic> expression was more complex and we were not able to make any conclusions from these data. The <italic>UBR1</italic> mutation did not seem to influence any of the phenotypes. These additional experiments are detailed in the Results and the Materials and methods sections. The data from the experiment is in Figure 8–figure supplement 1.</p><p><italic>4) The fact that the “recreated” strains are less fit than the evolved clones suggests that something is being missed. One obvious explanation is copy number variation.

At the reviewers' suggestion, we looked more carefully at read depth, particularly for amplification of the hexose transporters and <italic>SUC2</italic>. We found one case of amplification at these loci: the <italic>HXT6/HXT7</italic> locus was duplicated in EvoClone7C. This amplification was also present in the backcrossed strain, indicating that it may have been causal. We now have the following paragraph in the Results section describing the three total events we found:</p><p>“We analyzed read depth across all evolved clones and saw three major duplication or deletion events: (1) Chromosome 3 in EvoClone10 was duplicated in the region between 152 and 172 kb from the left end of the chromosome. This doubling of read depth was reduced to a 50% increase in the segregated pool, indicating that the duplication was not causal. (2) The number of P-Type ATPases at the <italic>ENO1/2/5</italic> locus was reduced from 3 to 2 in EvoClone6 and EvoClone10. This reduction was also present in the backcrossed strain, indicating that it may have been causal. (3) The number of hexose transporter gene repeats at the <italic>HXT6/7</italic> locus increased from two in the ancestral strain to three in EvoClone7C. This amplification was also present in the backcrossed strain, indicating that it also may have been causal. Amplification of the <italic>HXT6/7</italic> locus has been found in other experimental evolutions (Brown et al. 1998; Gresham et al. 2008; Kao and Sherlock 2008).”</p><p><italic>5) Many wild</italic> S. cerevisiae <italic>strains are clumpy and loss of clumpiness is likely a lab-adapted trait. The authors should make it clear that loss and gain of clumpiness is likely to have occurred many times in yeast populations and provide other explanations for why clumpiness in yeast cells might be recurrently selected</italic>.</p><p>We agree and we have added the following text to the discussion:</p><p>“Although lab strains of yeast were selected to be unicellular during their domestication (Mortimer and Johnston 1986), the level of clumpiness varies in wild isolates of yeast, and undifferentiated multicellularity may have been recurrently selected for its advantage in harvesting nutrients or for protection from stress (Smukalla et al. 2008).”</p></body></sub-article></article>
