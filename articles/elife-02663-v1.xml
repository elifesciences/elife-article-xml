How newly generated neurons find their appropriate layer during the development of the brain is an important question; and, in humans, when this process goes awry, it can often result in seizures and mental retardation.</p><p>An enzyme called GSK-3 regulates several major signaling pathways important to brain development. The GSK-3 enzyme switches other proteins on or off by adding phosphate groups to them.</p><p>Morgan-Smith et al. set out to better understand the role of GSK-3 in brain development by deleting the genes for this enzyme specifically in the cerebral cortex of mice. Mice have two genes that encode slightly different forms of the GSK-3 enzyme. Deleting both of these in different groups of neurons during brain development revealed that a major group of neurons need GSK-3 in order to migrate to the correct layer. Specifically, the movement of neurons from where they arise in the central region of the brain to the outermost layer (a process called radial migration) was disrupted when the GSK-3 genes were deleted.</p><p>Morgan-Smith et al. further found that cortical neurons without GSK-3 were unable to develop the shape needed to undertake radial migration because they failed to switch from having many branches to having just two main branches. Additional experiments revealed that these abnormalities did not depend on certain signaling pathways, such as the Wnt-signaling pathway or the PI3K signaling pathway that can control GSK-3 activity.</p><p>Instead, Morgan-Smith et al. found that two proteins that are normally targeted by the GSK-3 enzyme have fewer phosphate groups than normal in the cortical neurons that did not contain the enzyme: both of these proteins regulate the shape of neurons by interacting with the molecular ‘scaffolding’ within the cell. The GSK-3 enzyme was already known to modify the activities of many other proteins that affect the migration of cells. Thus, the findings of Morgan-Smith et al. suggest that this enzyme may coordinate many of the mechanisms thought to underlie this process during brain development.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02663.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02663.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>neuronal migration</kwd><kwd>neuronal morphology</kwd><kwd>cortical development</kwd><kwd>GSK-3</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS050968</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Snider</surname><given-names>William D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>5F31NS067838</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Morgan-Smith</surname><given-names>Meghan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS045892</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Snider</surname><given-names>William D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The kinase GSK-3 regulates cortical neuronal migration and dendritic orientation by phosphorylating key cytoskeletal proteins.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Glycogen synthase kinase (GSK-3) α and β are serine/threonine kinases that act as key downstream regulators in multiple signaling pathways, including Wnt/β-catenin, receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK)/PI3K, and Sonic hedgehog (Shh) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kaidanovich-Beilin et al., 2012</xref>). GSK-3s act via mechanisms that include regulation of transcription factors, control of multiple aspects of cellular metabolism, and phosphorylation of cytoskeletal proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hur and Zhou, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kaidanovich-Beilin and Woodgett, 2011</xref>). Most often, although not invariably, GSK-3s function as negatively acting kinases by inhibiting the functions of substrates at baseline. Inhibition is then relieved via signaling pathways that engage GSK-3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Doble and Woodgett, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kaidanovich-Beilin and Woodgett, 2011</xref>). For most GSK-3 substrates, phosphorylation by another kinase near the GSK-3 site (‘priming’) is required for, or enhances, GSK-3 substrate phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cohen and Frame, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Doble and Woodgett, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kaidanovich-Beilin and Woodgett, 2011</xref>). Priming kinases for GSK-3 substrates include cyclin dependent kinase-5 (cdk5), a kinase that is known to regulate important neurodevelopmental events like radial migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Tanaka et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cole et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Li et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Xie et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>In the nervous system, GSK-3β has long been thought to be a target of lithium used in treatment of bipolar disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Klein and Melton, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">O'Brien et al., 2004</xref>). Some of the GSK-3β effects related to lithium actions are due to regulation of signaling downstream of dopamine receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Beaulieu et al., 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Urs et al., 2012</xref>). More recently GSK-3 signaling has been implicated in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Emamian et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mao et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Emamian, 2012</xref>). Disrupted in Schizophrenia-1 (DISC1), mutated in some familial cases of schizophrenia, is thought to function in part by modulating GSK-3β effects on progenitor proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mao et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Singh et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Despite the obvious importance of GSK-3 signaling in pathogenesis and treatment of psychiatric disorders, there are important gaps in information on the role of GSK-3 in the developing brain. It has clearly been established that GSK-3 signaling is a strong regulator of radial progenitor proliferation in the developing cerebral cortex and that these effects are at least partly meditated through β-catenin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chenn and Walsh, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kim et al., 2009</xref>). Additionally, a recent study demonstrated an important role for GSK-3 in regulating INP amplification, an effect associated with GSK-3β binding to the scaffolding protein Axin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Fang et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, critical roles for GSK-3 signaling in processes that control neuron number in the developing telencephalon have been established.</p><p>In contrast, functions of GSK-3 in regulating developing cortical neurons are much less clear. Multiple in vitro studies have suggested roles for GSK-3 in regulating neuronal polarity and axon growth and branching (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hur and Zhou, 2010</xref> for review). These functions are thought to be mediated via GSK-3 phosphorylation of microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) including Collapsin response mediator protein-2 (CRMP-2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Yoshimura et al., 2005</xref>), Adenomatous polypsis coli (APC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Shi et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Zhou et al., 2004</xref>), Tau (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Stoothoff and Johnson, 2005</xref>), microtubule-associated protein 1B (MAP1B) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Trivedi et al., 2005</xref>), Doublecortin (DCX) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bilimoria et al., 2010</xref>), and subsequent regulation of cytoskeletal dynamics. In general, inhibition of GSK-3β via serine 9 (ser9) and GSK-3α via serine 21 (ser21) phosphorylation and subsequent relief of phosphorylation of downstream targets is thought to be required for the formation of the axon and subsequent axonal growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Jiang et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hur and Zhou, 2010</xref>). In a similar vein, a study employing in utero electroporation of an activating construct suggested that GSK-3 inhibition was essential for radial-guided cortical neuronal migration downstream of STK11 (LKB1) via a mechanism involving APC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Asada and Sanada, 2010</xref>). A prediction of this work might be that GSK-3 deletion would enhance axon growth and radial migration. However, to date these effects of GSK-3 on neuronal polarity and migration have not been confirmed with mouse genetic studies. Further, mice with point mutation knockins that prevent ser9/21 phosphorylation are viable and have not been reported to show defects in neuronal morphology or migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">McManus et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gartner et al., 2006</xref>). Finally, GSK-3 may regulate migration and morphology of cortical neurons via entirely different pathways for example via mediating effects of semaphorin signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Renaud et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Nakamura et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>We have now assessed GSK-3 functions in newly born cortical neurons using <italic>Neurod6</italic> (<italic>Nex</italic>)-Cre (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Goebbels et al., 2006</xref>) to mediate recombination of <italic>Gsk3</italic> floxed alleles in INPs and newly born excitatory neurons. We demonstrate, surprisingly, that GSK-3 activity is essential for radial neuron migration in all areas of the cortex and in the hippocampus. In contrast, tangential migration is not affected after <italic>Gsk3</italic> deletion in cortical interneuron precursors. Remarkably, the migration effects appear to be independent of Wnt/β-catenin signaling that mediates GSK-3 functions in neuronal progenitors. The few upper layer neurons that reached their normal location exhibited strikingly abnormal orientation of basal dendrites. GSK-3 control of migration and morphology is correlated with the regulation of phosphorylation of DCX on ser327 and CRMP-2 on Thr514. We conclude that GSK-3 is a critical regulator of neuronal migration and morphogenesis and that GSK-3 regulation is mediated by phosphorylation of key cytoskeletal proteins.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>GSK-3 signaling regulates migration of cortical excitatory neurons</title><p>To investigate the function of GSK-3 in developing cortical neurons, we generated <italic>Gsk3a</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup><italic>Gsk3b</italic><sup><italic>loxp/loxp</italic></sup><italic>:Neurod6</italic>-<italic>Cre</italic> mice (<italic>Gsk3:Neurod6</italic>).

Deep layer neurons appeared to be normally positioned (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Thus staining with Tbr1, a layer 6 marker, revealed a distinctive band in the deeper layers of the cortex in both controls and <italic>Gsk3:Neurod6</italic> mutants. In contrast, we noted clear abnormalities in the localization of Cux1 expressing neurons that normally populate Layers 2/3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).

GSK-3 regulation of migration appears to be independent of Wnt/β-catenin and PI3K signaling. Rather, <italic>Gsk3</italic> deletion is associated with striking reductions in phosphorylation of key microtubule regulatory proteins, DCX and CRMP-2.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>GSK-3 regulation of cortical neuronal development</title><p>Our work builds on a growing body of evidence establishing critical requirements for GSK-3 in cortical neuronal development, with GSK-3 signaling having different functions at different developmental stages. In radial progenitors, GSK-3 is a critical mediator of proliferation via regulation of β-catenin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kim et al., 2009</xref>). At later stages, recent work has demonstrated that GSK-3 is a key mediator of the amplification of the INP pool via interactions with the scaffolding protein Axin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Fang et al., 2013</xref>). Axin-GSK-3 binding in the cytoplasm is clearly required for expansion of the INP pool, although the mechanism of GSK-3 action was not specified in this study. Interestingly, β-catenin regulation of transcription in the nucleus was required for differentiation of INPs into neurons. These effects of GSK-3 signaling on radial progenitors and INPs are presumably a strong determinant of final cortical neuronal number in mature animals.</p><p>We now find that excitatory neuron development is also under important GSK-3 regulation. Thus, Cux1-expressing neurons require GSK-3 signaling for timely multipolar to bipolar transition and migration along radial processes. Deeper layer neurons expressing Tbr1 were not strongly influenced, but we cannot be certain that GSK-3 protein was fully depleted in these earlier born neurons at the time migration was occurring. The behavioral consequences of migration failure and dendritic arbor abnormalities could not be assessed due to early death of the <italic>Gsk3</italic>-mutant animals. Whether death was due to cortical abnormalities or defects in other cells that underwent recombination with <italic>Neurod6-Cre</italic> could not be determined. However, even a very mild form of this type of migration defect would presumably be catastrophic for human brain development.</p><p>In contrast to regulation of progenitor proliferation and neural differentiation, GSK-3 regulation of radial migration appears to be independent of Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Thus, neither the stabilization of β-catenin nor deletion of all <italic>Dvl</italic>s in developing cortical neurons using the <italic>Neurod6-Cre</italic> driver produced major defects in cortical layering. Interestingly, the migration defect also appears to be independent from a migration defect associated with mutations of the schizophrenia-associated protein, DISC1. DISC1 regulates progenitor proliferation via interactions with GSK-3, decreased GSK-3 kinase activity and, ultimately, increased β-catenin signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mao et al., 2009</xref>). Interestingly, a recent study demonstrated that DISC1 regulates migration independently of GSK-3 via effects on the centrosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ishizuka et al., 2011</xref>). However, our work reported here clearly demonstrates that GSK-3 also has a critical role in the regulation of cortical neuronal migration.</p><p>Radial migration is an enormously complex process requiring timely progenitor differentiation, dramatic morphological change, intricate mechanisms for cell and nuclear movements, and dynamic sensing of multiple cues that start and stop the process. Not surprisingly, GSK-3 joins dozens of other molecules implicated in the control of radial migration (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ayala et al., 2007</xref> for review). Comparisons with the literature suggest that effects of GSK-3 deletion are among the most severe that have yet been observed.</p><p>Interestingly, GSK-3 importantly regulates multiple proteins implicated in migration and is an important mediator in several of the signaling pathways involved. Thus GSK-3 is known to phosphorylate DCX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bilimoria et al., 2010</xref>), FAK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bianchi et al., 2005</xref>), dynamin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Clayton et al., 2010</xref>), neurogenin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Li et al., 2012</xref>), CRMP-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Uchida et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Yoshimura et al., 2005</xref>), and MAP1B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Trivedi et al., 2005</xref>). Further, GSK-3 mediates Reelin signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Beffert et al., 2002</xref>), LKB1 effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Asada and Sanada, 2010</xref>), Cdc42 effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Etienne-Manneville and Hall, 2003</xref>), integrin signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Guo et al., 2007</xref>), semaphorin signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Eickholt et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Uchida et al., 2005</xref>), and other pathways that have been implicated in control of radial migration. Finally, GSK-3 shares multiple substrates with cdk5, a kinase that is situated among the most important regulators of neuronal migration and acts as a ‘priming’ kinase for GSK-3 signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Xie et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>Clearly GSK-3 effects on neuronal development extend well beyond the phase of migration. For example, although dendritic arbors form, abnormalities in dendritic orientation were striking in <italic>Gsk3</italic>-deleted neurons. Importantly, interference with semaphorin signaling mediators also produces abnormalities of apical process development and orientation of basal dendrites (see below).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Mechanisms of GSK-3 regulation</title><p>In general, GSK-3 acts via two classes of mechanisms: one where GSK-3 activity inhibits substrate function or availability and another where GSK-3 activity is required for substrate function. Therefore, we might expect <italic>Gsk3</italic> deletion to enhance processes normally inhibited by GSK-3 activity and to inhibit processes that require GSK-3 activity.</p><p>Multiple studies have suggested that inhibition of GSK-3 kinase activity is important for morphological functions such as establishment of neuronal polarity and cellular migration. The effects of GSK-3 inhibition are thought to be mediated by dephosphorylation of CRMP-2, APC and other cytoskeletal mediators with resulting stabilization of microtubules at the tips of axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Etienne-Manneville and Hall, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Jiang et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Yoshimura et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hur and Zhou, 2010</xref>). Another recent study employing in utero electroporation suggested that an STK11(LKB1)/GSK-3 pathway resulting in GSK-3β ser9 phosphorylation and APC localization at the leading edge was important in cortical neuronal migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Asada and Sanada, 2010</xref>).</p><p>In the studies outlined above, inhibition of GSK-3β kinase activity is indicated by phosphorylation on Ser9 and inhibition of GSK-3α by phosphorylation on Ser21. However, a major unresolved paradox is that mice <italic>with Gsk3a and Gsk3b</italic> point mutation knock-ins that prevent ser9 and ser21 phosphorylation respectively do not exhibit widespread morphological abnormalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gartner et al., 2006</xref>). Similarly, truncation mutants of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> GSK-3 homologue, <italic>Shaggy</italic>, that lack inhibitory phosphorylation sites are not associated with morphological abnormalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Papadopoulou et al., 2004</xref>). In the context of neuronal migration, although GSK-3 ser9/21 phosphorylation is enhanced downstream of Reelin signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Beffert et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gonzalez-Billault et al., 2005</xref>), GSK-3β kinase activity towards the important substrate MAP1B is actually increased rather than diminished (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gonzalez-Billault et al., 2005</xref>). Finally, our findings reported here do not support critical roles in radial migration for STK11, CDC42, or PTEN, all of which are known to regulate GSK-3 ser9/21 phosphorylation. These findings, taken together, raise questions about the importance of negative regulation of GSK-3 via Ser9/21 phosphorylation on functions of microtubule binding proteins related to migration in vivo.</p><p>Our results demonstrate that <italic>Gsk3</italic> deletion blocks radial migration and that <italic>Gsk3</italic> over-expression may enhance it. Thus our results are more in line with a mechanism in which GSK-3 activity is required for normal substrate function. Several proteins have been shown to require GSK-3 kinase activity for normal function. These include DCX where GSK-3 mediated phosphorylation is thought to be required for DCX's actions in regulating axon branching and possibly in migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bilimoria et al., 2010</xref>). Additional examples possibly relevant to migration are GSK-3 regulation of FAK phosphorylation at ser722 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bianchi et al., 2005</xref>) and dynamin-1 phosphorylation of ser774 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Clayton et al., 2010</xref>). GSK-3 phosphorylation regulates functions of these proteins in complex ways, but possibly enhances functions that may be required for neuronal migration.</p><p>A well-studied example of a pathway that is associated with upregulation of GSK-3 activity is semaphorin signaling. Semaphorin family members have multiple roles as chemorepellants and chemoattractants for many classes of axons and dendrites (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Pasterkamp, 2012</xref>). Semaphorin signaling strongly activates GSK-3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Eickholt et al., 2002</xref>) resulting in phosphorylation of a key MAP, CRMP-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Uchida et al., 2005</xref>), as well as other CRMP family members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cole et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Yamashita and Goshima, 2012</xref>). Intriguingly, during neuronal polarization semaphorin signaling is associated with suppression of axons, and formation of dendrites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Shelly et al., 2011</xref>), consistent with the idea that dephosphorylated CRMP-2 may favor axon formation, whereas phosphorylated CRMP-2 may be critical to proper formation of dendritic arbors.</p><p>Importantly, migration and dendritic abnormalities that we have described here are consistent with cortical neuron phenotypes reported due to manipulation of semaphorin and CRMP signaling. Interfering with semaphorin, NP1 or Plexin via silencing RNAs and gene knockouts has been reported to interfere with radial migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Renaud et al., 2008</xref>).

Further, reduced semaphorin signaling causes bifurcation of CA1 pyramidal dendrites in the developing hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Nakamura et al., 2009</xref>). Downstream of semaphorins, interfering with CRMP functions has been reported to affect migration and result in branched apical dendrites and abnormal dendrite orientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Yamashita et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Yamashita and Goshima, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ip et al., 2012</xref>; for a review see, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ip et al., 2014</xref>). Finally, in the context of cortical neuronal migration, phosphorylation of CRMP-2 promotes migration. Thus a GSK-3 phosphomimetic CRMP-2 can rescue migration defects associated with knockdown of the semaphorin signaling mediator, α2-chimaerin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ip et al., 2012</xref>). Taken together, these findings suggest that inhibition of CRMP2 phosphorylation at Thr514 in <italic>Gsk3</italic>-deleted neurons may partially explain the migration and dendritic orientation abnormalities we have observed.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In sum, we have demonstrated a key cell autonomous role for GSK-3 signaling in regulating radial migration and dendritic orientation of cortical excitatory neurons. <italic>Our Gsk3</italic> deletion results are not in line with what might have been predicted from prior studies that have correlated ser9/21 phosphorylation with relief of negative GSK-3 phosphorylation and negative regulation of cytoskeletal-associated proteins. In particular, we do not find evidence that an STK11(LKB1)/GSK-3 inhibitory pathway is a key migration regulator. In contrast, our results are consistent with the idea GSK-3 phosphorylation of DCX and CRMP-2 is required for appropriate cytoskeletal regulation and migration. Finally, our data are consistent with the idea that GSK-3 activity is essential for the effects of semaphorin and CRMP-2 signaling on cortical neuronal development in vivo.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice</title><p>Mice were cared for according to animal protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

Your full submission has been evaluated by a Senior editor and 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the decision was reached after discussions between the reviewers.</p><p>While all three of the reviewers appreciated the general high quality of the data that were presented in this manuscript, after a lengthy discussion our concern was that, as is, the data presented in the manuscript are not sufficiently novel for publication in <italic>eLife.</italic> However, given the high quality of the manuscript, and potential interest of the findings, we would be happy to consider a revised version of the paper in which you have added perhaps another piece of data that adds a conceptual advance as well as data addressing the reviewers concerns. In that regard, if you were to validate all of the different conditional mouse knockout models that you have used with specific regard to their efficacy, then all of the reviewers agreed that this would considerably increase the novelty of the conclusions that you could draw.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> In this manuscript by Morgan-Smith et al., the authors have defined an important role for GSK-3 signaling in the migration of excitatory cortical and hippocampal neurons during embryonic murine development. In general, the studies are very nicely performed, and the amount of work is extensive. Having said that, some of their conclusions do not seem to be justified on the basis of the data that are presented, and the manuscript could be significantly improved by consideration of a number of issues, as follows.</p><p>1) The authors demonstrate a robust and clearly-defined deficit in the migration of newborn Cux1-positive cortical neurons as soon as they are born. In contrast, they see that the deeper-layer Tbr1-positive neurons are unaffected. Since these neurons are born quite a bit earlier, are the authors confident that their driver line Nex-Cre actually causes recombination early enough to affect these earlier-born neurons? Also, most Tbr1-positive neurons are generated directly by radial glia, while the Cux1-positive neurons are largely generated via intermediate progenitors. Since intermediate progenitors are targeted by their Nex-Cre construct, might this provide an explanation for these differences?</p><p>While it is not essential for the authors to address these issues experimentally here, they should be more cautious in their interpretation of these differences.</p><p>2) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>, using mice floxed for both GSK3A and B, it looks like there are many more Cux1-positive neurons in addition to their deficit in migration. Is it possible that inducible deletion of GSK3 in intermediate progenitors causes an expansion of cortical neurons which in turn affects their migration indirectly? The authors need to address this possibility by quantifying the relative proportions of Cux1-positive neurons in these floxed mice relative to the controls.</p><p>3) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, the authors show statistical significance, but they only have an n = 2 for controls. How can this be the case? I realize that some authors count each section as an n, but this isn't really valid for these types of analyses.</p><p>4) One of the main conclusions of this manuscript is that GSK3 is essential for radial but not tangential migration, based upon their analysis of cortical excitatory vs MGE-generated inhibitory interneurons. This conclusion isn't really warranted by the data they show. In particular, while <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–A'</xref> does show that inhibitory interneurons make it into the cortex, these data need to be quantified and it needs to be shown that GSK3 has actually been deleted in these neurons to draw this conclusion.</p><p>5) Similarly, the authors conclusions about direct effects of GSK3 ablation on dendritic orientation are also difficult to draw based upon their experimental design. In particular, while I agree that their data convincingly show inappropriate orientation of the dendrites of Cux1-positive neurons in layers 2-3, the authors cannot rule out the possibility that these neurons were delayed or perturbed in their migration to this location, and that the dendritic deficits are a secondary consequence of any such perturbations. The authors need to deemphasize their conclusions that these are direct effects unless they have data dissociating migration from later events such as dendritic development.</p><p>6) Data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6 fig7">Figures 6 and 7</xref> showing negative results vis a vis migration with multiple signaling proteins are a nice addition to the manuscript. However, to really substantiate these negative data, it would be important to (i) show that the Cre-mediated recombination really did occur as predicted, and (ii) show some kind of quantification to rule out the possibility that there are indeed neuronal deficits, but that they are just more subtle than with GSK3 knockout.</p><p>7) I'm not sure the small amount of microarray data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref> really adds anything to the manuscript. I would either add all of the microarray data or remove this.</p><p>8) The data on Crmp-2 are important and interesting. The Dcx data are potentially also very interesting, but the authors don't show that there is no change in total Dcx levels. In the absence of such data, it is difficult to know whether relative phosphorylation of Dcx is actually decreased.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> In the manuscript 26-02-2014-RA-eLife-02663 entitled “GSK-3 signaling in developing cortical neurons regulates migration and dendritic polarization”, Morgan-Smith and colleagues address the question of molecular mechanisms of neuronal migration, a timely and very interesting problem with many significant knowledge gaps. Since many of the molecules implicated in this process are major players in important intracellular signalling events, this question is of considerable interest to a general audience. Specifically, the manuscript focuses on the regulation of cytoskeleton dynamics in migrating posmitotic neurons in the vertebrate cortex, and the role of LKB1, GSK-3 and APC signalling cascade. These proteins have been previously implicated in neuronal migration in a study using non-genetic and acute manipulations (Asada, N. &amp; Sanada, 2010).</p><p>Taking advantage of the Nex:cre driver, the authors first analyse two different post-mitiotic neuron knockouts of GSK-3 alpha and beta and show that they are required for the positioning of Cux1+ neurons in cortical layers 2/3. Overexpression of GSK-3 through in utero electroporation results in more neurons occupying superficial cortical layers. Tangential neuronal migration in GSK-3 mutants is not affected suggesting that it GSK-3 is specifically involved in radial migration. Cell-autonomous deletion of GSK-3 reproduced the migration defect and revealed a neuronal morphology defect (the authors argue for dendrite orientation defects), as well as the persistence of the migration defects in postnatal animals. Next, the authors used Nex:cre to delete beta catenin, disheveled, LKB1, CDC42 and Pten, and show no effect on cortical neuron migration. However, the authors note, that in such knockouts, there was no change of Wnt target gene expression, or in the phosphorylation state of some of the GSK-3 substrates. However, the authors do finally show that GSK-3 loss of function does lead to a consistent decrease of pDCX and pCRMP-2 levels.</p><p>The data are mostly well-documented and convincing. Indeed, as authors claim, to my knowledge, this is the first genetic demonstration that GSK-3's are required for specific aspects of neuronal migration. My main concern is with the novelty of the findings, relative to the J Nsci study by Asada and Sanada which also showed a requirement for GSK-3 in migration, albeit through an acute, non-genetic manipulation. Other studies, including Shi et al. Curr Biol 14, 2025-2032 (2004) have also implicated GSK-3 in dendrite vs axon polarity.</p><p>Additionally, while I appreciate the lack of migration phenotypes in other KOs examined here, contrasted with Asada's manipulations of LKB1, I am concerned about the extent of the loss of function induced. The fact that in the b-cat KO, the authors fail to detect any effect on Wnt signalling targets makes me wary of their strong conclusions. Especially, since the effect of KO on b-catenin expression is barely more than a two-fold change. How do we know that the induction of those KOs is efficient enough to warrant the strong conclusion that LKB1, Pten, b-catenin etc, are not required for migration?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> The study by Morgan-Smith and colleagues investigates the role of GSK3 in the developing mouse telencephalon. Using a line allowing efficient deletion of GSK3 in newly-born excitatory neurons, the study documents migration failures both in the developing cerebral cortex and the hippocampus. These defects are not observed with medial eminence-derived interneurons. The conclusion that GSK play a critical role in the migration of cortical excitatory neurons is supported by data based on a GSK-overexpression approach causing enhanced migration. A thorough analysis of the canonical Wnt pathway suggests that it is not involved in the phenotype described here. By contrast, based on results illustrating a dramatic reduction of phosphorylated CRMP-2 it would appear that GSK may be critically involved in a semaphorin pathway. These results fit well with recent observations by Ip and colleagues as well as with a report by Chen and colleague on the role of Semaphorin 3A in the radial migration of cortical neurons. This is a very well executed, thorough and interesting study. In addition to the main results summarised in the above, another virtue of this study is that it reports on a range of negative, but surprising and useful results. Beyond the lack of involvement of the Wnt pathway, the lack of effects of the deletions of PTEN and especially of Cdc42 are quite surprising. Clearly then, this important study should be published in a scholarly, high profile journal as it is likely to be of high interest to developmental neurobiologists as well as to human neurogeneticists.</p><p>My main recommendation would be to revise the Abstract to better highlight the interest of the study. In particular, the first sentence is difficult to understand (“strongly regulates progenitors”?) and a bit discouraging as well since one of the virtue of the deleter line used here is to leave aside these previously investigated aspects of GSK3. They were also somewhat less interesting from a developmental neurobiology viewpoint since they dealt in essence with proliferation as opposed to migration. In a similar vein, it is unfortunate that the Abstract fails to mention that GSK does not seem to be involved in the migration of cortical interneurons. Finally, the role of GSK in the Semaphorin pathway would be worth emphasizing in the Abstract and perhaps better explained in the Introduction. The important <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2008</xref> study is briefly mentioned there as well, but it would be useful if it would be better emphasize at the expense of some of the Wnt pathway discussion that could be kept for the Discussion.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02663.019</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>We have thoroughly revised our manuscript based on helpful comments of the reviewers.

We have also added the caveat to the text that we assessed only gross measures of tangential migration as we did not asses migration of interneuron subtypes in this study: “These results are not meant to imply that migration of interneurons was normal in every respect as we did not assess migration of specific interneuron subsets.”</p><p><italic>5) Similarly, the authors conclusions about direct effects of GSK3 ablation on dendritic orientation are also difficult to draw based upon their experimental design. In particular, while I agree that their data convincingly show inappropriate orientation of the dendrites of Cux1-positive neurons in layers 2-3, the authors cannot rule out the possibility that these neurons were delayed or perturbed in their migration to this location, and that the dendritic deficits are a secondary consequence of any such perturbations. The authors need to deemphasize their conclusions that these are direct effects unless they have data dissociating migration from later events such as dendritic development</italic>.</p><p>The reviewer makes an interesting point. However, we are not in complete agreement. We specifically chose the few neurons in normal locations in Layer 2-3 for analysis. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,A’</xref> shows that some <italic>Gsk3</italic> deleted neurons are normally positioned by E19 and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref> shows a few Cux 1 neurons normally positioned as early as E16. It seems fair to assume that these neurons did not undergo a prolonged migration delay, presumably because GSK-3 levels were not drastically reduced in these few neurons at these early stages. As the reviewer acknowledges, the abnormal orientation of the dendrites is striking. We think the most plausible explanation is that dendrites of <italic>Gsk3</italic> deleted neurons do not respond normally to directional cues that are present.</p><p>We agree that we can’t absolutely prove that dendritic polarization is directly related to GSK-3 abrogating signaling as opposed to an abnormality acquired during migration. We have therefore modified the title to: <italic>“</italic>GSK-3 signaling in developing cortical neurons is essential for radial migration and dendritic orientation” which is certainly true and avoids the terms “regulate” and “polarization”. We have also modified our text to reflect reviewer concerns on this point as follows: A) We changed the section heading from: “GSK-3 regulates dendritic orientation” to “Abnormal dendritic orientation in <italic>Gsk3</italic> mutants”</p><p>B) We added text: “Images at E16 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>) and E19 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>’) show that a few <italic>Gsk3</italic> deleted neurons are normally positioned and suggest that these normally positioned neurons did not undergo a substantial delay in migration.”</p><p><italic>6) Data in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6 fig7"><italic>Figures 6 and 7</italic></xref> <italic>showing negative results vis a vis migration with multiple signaling proteins are a nice addition to the manuscript. However, to really substantiate these negative data, it would be important to (i) show that the Cre-mediated recombination really did occur as predicted, and (ii) show some kind of quantification to rule out the possibility that there are indeed neuronal deficits, but that they are just more subtle than with GSK3 knockout</italic>.</p><p>Again, a very helpful point. As noted above, we have carefully verified protein reduction and provided quantification of migration in five of the six lines where we report negative results, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement figure 1</xref>. For comparison we show quantification of the strikingly abnormal quantification in <italic>Gsk3</italic> mutants in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, new panels A and C. For <italic>Dvl123:Neurod6</italic> we did not obtain enough 6 allele mutant mice for both Westerns and detailed quantification. We do show a representative image based on inspection of multiple sections from n = 3 of the 6 allele mutant mice. We hope we can keep the image in the paper as it will be of substantial interest to researchers in this field.</p><p><italic>7) I'm not sure the small amount of microarray data shown in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6"><italic>Figure 6</italic>B</xref> <italic>really adds anything to the manuscript. I would either add all of the microarray data or remove this</italic>.</p><p>We have now removed the Table shown in former <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref> and simply mention results in the text. The full array has been deposited in GEO, NCBI for reference (GEO accession number GSE58727) and will be released to the public shortly.</p><p><italic>8) The data on Crmp-2 are important and interesting. The Dcx data are potentially also very interesting, but the authors don't show that there is no change in total Dcx levels. In the absence of such data, it is difficult to know whether relative phosphorylation of Dcx is actually decreased</italic>.</p><p>We probed for total DCX in these blots as directed. The reduction in pDCX remains very striking. The new results are shown in a revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>.</p><p>Reviewer #2: <italic>[…] The data are mostly well-documented and convincing. Indeed, as authors claim, to my knowledge, this is the first genetic demonstration that GSK-3's are required for specific aspects of neuronal migration. My main concern is with the novelty of the findings, relative to the J Nsci study by Asada and Sanada which also showed a requirement for GSK-3 in migration, albeit through an acute, non-genetic manipulation. Other studies, including Shi et al. Curr Biol 14, 2025-2032 (2004) have also implicated GSK-3 in dendrite vs. axon polarity</italic>.</p><p>We addressed this point in an exchange with the editors: our findings are in direct conflict with the Asada study. We did <italic>not</italic> verify that <italic>inhibition</italic> of GSK-3 via an LKB1→GSK-3→APC (dephosphorylation) signaling cascade is required for neuronal migration as was published in that paper. Analysis of GSK-3 in the Asada paper relied exclusively on activation of GSK-3 via the GSK-3β S9A construct and the demonstrated effects on migration were transient. We understand that GSK-3 inhibition due to ser9/ser21 phosphorylation and subsequent dephosphorylation of key cytoskeletal regulators has previously been implicated in vitro in elaboration of axons and migration of non-neuronal cells. However, we and others (Courchet et al. Cell 2013) do not find evidence that LKB1 signaling regulates migration in vivo<italic>.</italic> Finally, published work that we cite on GSK-3 mutant knock-ins that are viable and exhibit grossly normal brain development, suggest it is unlikely that ser9/ser21 phosphorylation of GSK-3 strongly regulates cortical neuron migration in vivo<italic>.</italic> Rather, our study shows that GSK-3 activity is required for cortical neuronal migration in vivo. Our evidence suggests that GSK-3 phosphorylation of key downstream cytoskeletal regulators (rather than dephosphorylation) is crucial for migration.</p><p><italic>Additionally, while I appreciate the lack of migration phenotypes in other KOs examined here, contrasted with Asada's manipulations of LKB1, I am concerned about the extent of the loss of function induced. The fact that in the b-cat KO, the authors fail to detect any effect on Wnt signalling targets makes me wary of their strong conclusions. Especially, since the effect of KO on b-catenin expression is barely more than a two-fold change. How do we know that the induction of those KOs is efficient enough to warrant the strong conclusion that LKB1, Pten, b-catenin etc, are not required for migration?</italic></p><p>To clarify, we did not assess Wnt target genes in <italic>Ctnnb1</italic><sup><italic>Ex3</italic></sup><italic>:Neurod6</italic> mice. Rather, we assessed Wnt target genes in <italic>Gsk3:Neurod6</italic> mice. Reviewer 1 felt that this aspect should be given less emphasis and we have changed the presentation of the data as directed (see response to point 7 above)</p><p>We now show strikingly reduced protein levels after <italic>Neurod6-Cre</italic> mediated recombination for all of signaling mediators studied (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6 and—figure supplement 1</xref>) as noted in point 6 above. These strong protein reductions demonstrate that <italic>Neurod6-Cre</italic> was highly effective in generating recombination of all of the floxed alleles used in this study.</p><p>Reviewer 3: <italic>[…] My main recommendation would be to revise the Abstract to better highlight the interest of the study. In particular, the first sentence is difficult to understand (“strongly regulates progenitors”?) and a bit discouraging as well since one of the virtue of the deleter line used here is to leave aside these previously investigated aspects of GSK3. They were also somewhat less interesting from a developmental neurobiology viewpoint since they dealt in essence with proliferation as opposed to migration. We have revised the Abstract and removed the first sentence as recommended</italic>.</p><p><italic>In a similar vein, it is unfortunate that the Abstract fails to mention that GSK does not seem to be involved in the migration of cortical interneurons</italic>.</p><p>We have added a new sentence to the Abstract: “In contrast, tangential migration is not grossly impaired after <italic>Gsk3</italic> deletion in interneuron precursors”. This point is also now mentioned in the Introduction.</p><p><italic>Finally, the role of GSK in the Semaphorin pathway would be worth emphasizing in the Abstract and perhaps better explained in the Introduction. The important</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13"><italic>Chen et al. 2008</italic></xref> <italic>study is briefly mentioned there as well, but it would be useful if it would be better emphasize at the expense of some of the Wnt pathway discussion that could be kept for the Discussion</italic>.</p><p>Because of the word limitations of the Abstract, we cannot emphasize the Sema pathway here. However, we have revised the Introduction to include information on the Sema pathway as instructed.</p></body></sub-article></article>
