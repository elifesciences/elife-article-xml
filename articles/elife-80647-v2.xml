In the human kidney, the osmotic pressure of the inner medulla can reach up to 1200 mOsm, which is fourfold higher than that in the plasma. Renal medullary cells, particularly inner medullary collecting duct (IMCD) epithelial cells, must adapt to constant changes in the osmolarity of their environment. Under dehydrated conditions, IMCD cells are exposed to hyperosmotic stress, which frequently causes cell injury and death. IMCD cells must adapt to and withstand external hyperosmolarity to maintain cell viability and fulfil their functions. It has been previously reported that under hyperosmotic conditions, renal medullary cells undergo various forms of cell death, such as necrosis and apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Han et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alfieri et al., 2002</xref>). However, the major form of cell death responsible for hyperosmolarity-induced renal medullary cell injury remains largely unknown. In addition, multiple mechanisms have been demonstrated to contribute to the maintenance of cell viability of renal medullary cells under dehydrated conditions. Among these, the transcription factor tonicity-responsive enhancer binding protein (TonEBP) and its target osmoprotective genes, including aldose reductase and heat shock protein 70 (HSP70), represents the most important protective mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lee et al., 2011</xref>). Other factors, including nuclear factor kappa B (NF-ÎºB), farnesoid X receptor (FXR), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor Î²/Î´ (PPARÎ²/Î´), and cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2), have also been reported to contribute to the survival of renal medullary cells in a hyperosmotic environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hasler et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Xu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Guan, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Moeckel et al., 2003</xref>). However, the underlying mechanism by which hyperosmolarity induces medullary cell injury and cell survival under hyperosmotic stress remains incompletely understood and requires further investigation.</p><p>Regulated cell death (RCD) is required for the normal development and maintenance of organ homeostasis. RCD signalling cascades, including apoptosis, necroptosis, pyroptosis, ferroptosis, and autophagy-associated cell death, are tightly regulated to establish a functional tissue architecture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Santagostino et al., 2021</xref>). Unlike most other cells that live under isosmotic conditions, medullary collecting duct (MCD) cells reside in an environment of variable hyperosmolarity, which frequently causes cell damage and even death. Ferroptosis is a novel type of RCD that differs from apoptosis, pyroptosis, cell necrosis, and autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Li et al., 2020</xref>). It is driven by iron-dependent oxidative destruction of the lipid bilayer and is caused by an imbalance of oxidation and antioxidation in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Yan et al., 2021</xref>). Emerging evidence suggests that hyperosmolarity results in a robust increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Yang et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ikari et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ma et al., 2019</xref>), suggesting that ferroptosis may contribute to cell damage and death of renal medullary cells under dehydration conditions. However, the role and mechanism of ferroptosis in the survival of MCD and interstitial cells under hyperosmotic conditions are currently unclear.</p><p>Unrestrained lipid peroxidation is a hallmark of ferroptosis. The reduction of lipid peroxidation to hydroxyl by glutathione peroxidase4 (GPX4) requires the catalytic selenocysteine residue of GPX4 and two electrons provided mainly by glutathione (GSH) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jiang et al., 2021</xref>). Cysteine (Cys) is the rate-limiting substrate in the biosynthesis of reduced GSH. Deprivation of cystine or Cys or inhibition of their membrane transporters (system Xc<sup>â</sup> cystine/glutamate antiporter) induces ferroptosis by depleting cellular GSH and increasing ROS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Yang et al., 2022</xref>). Glutamine (Gln) metabolism is tightly linked to ferroptosis regulation. After influx into cells via SLC1A5 (ASCT2), Gln is converted to glutamate (Glu) to produce GSH, together with Cys and glycine (Gly), to maintain redox homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hensley et al., 2013</xref>). Collectively, these findings demonstrate that dysregulation of amino acid metabolism plays an important role in the regulation of ferroptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jiang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cormerais et al., 2020</xref>). It is anticipated that sodium-dependent neutral amino acid transporter-2 (<italic>Slc38a2</italic>), as a Cys, Glu, Gly, and methionine (Met) transporter and an osmoresponsive gene, may have a great impact on GPX4 activity and GSH biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Nahm et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Mackenzie and Erickson, 2004</xref>). However, whether SLC38A2 contributes to ferroptosis regulation in renal medullary cells under hyperosmotic stress has not been explored and warrants further investigation.</p><p>In the present study, we found that ferroptosis is the major RCD in IMCD cells exposed to hyperosmotic stress. Using RNA-Seq, we found that hyperosmolarity induced <italic>Slc38a2</italic> expression in IMCD cells in an NF-ÎºB-dependent manner. Using <italic>Slc38a2</italic>-knockout mice and cultured IMCD cells, we further demonstrated that SLC38A2 exerted an osmoprotective effect on IMCD cells by inhibiting ferroptosis through activation of the SLC38A2-mTORC1 pathway. These findings uncover SLC38A2 as an osmoprotective amino acid transporter that protects renal MCD cells by inhibiting hyperosmolarity-induced ferroptosis via mTORC1 activation. <italic>Slc38a2</italic> is a critical osmoprotective gene in the renal medulla, which is a prerequisite for urine concentration and water homeostasis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Ferroptosis is the major type of regulated cell death in IMCD cells exposed to hyperosmolarity</title><p>Multiple types of RCD are involved in hyperosmolarity-induced cell damages, including apoptosis, necroptosis, and autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Xu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nunes et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bittner et al., 2017</xref>). We and others have previously reported that hyperosmotic stress significantly decreases renal medullary cell viability and induces apoptosis in only a small portion of the cell population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Xu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dmitrieva et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">KÃ¼per et al., 2011</xref>), suggesting that other types of RCD may account for hyperosmolarity-elicited cell death. To characterise the exact RCD type responsible for hyperosmolarity-induced cell death and identify new mechanistic pathways involved in the osmoprotection of renal medullary cells, we treated mIMCD3 cell line with hyperosmotic medium for 12 h. As previously reported, hyperosmolarity significantly reduced cell viability. Ultrastructural analysis by transmission electron microscopy revealed that hyperosmolarity-treated mIMCD3 cells exhibited typical morphological features of ferroptosis, including shrunken mitochondria with disappeared and fragmented cristae and disrupted cell membranes, suggesting that ferroptosis is involved in hyperosmolarity-induced cell death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>). To prove this, we performed whole transcriptome analysis using RNA-Seq in mIMCD3 cells incubated under either isosmotic or hyperosmotic conditions and found that the expression of many genes associated with ferroptosis, including <italic>Slc7a11</italic>, <italic>Slc40a1</italic>, <italic>Gpx4</italic>, <italic>Acsl4</italic>, <italic>Vdac2</italic>, <italic>Tfrc</italic>, <italic>Ncoa4</italic>, and <italic>Slc3a2</italic>, was significantly altered after hyperosmotic treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2</xref>). To confirm the involvement of ferroptosis in hyperosmolarity-induced cell death, we pre-treated mIMCD3 cells with liproxstatin-1 (Lip-1), an inhibitor of ferroptosis, followed by hyperosmotic stress. The result showed that Lip-1 attenuated cell viability in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Cell viability was also improved in a dose-dependent manner by ferrostatin-1 (Fer-1), another ferroptosis inhibitor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Lip-1 and Fer-1 at high doses almost completely abolished hyperosmolarity-induced cell death, suggesting that ferroptosis is the major type of RCD contributing to hyperosmotic stress-induced cell injury in IMCD cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>). In support of this, a cytometry study showed that hyperosmolarity significantly increased cellular lipid ROS levels, which were completely suppressed by the ferroptosis inhibitors Lip-1 and Fer-1, indicating that hyperosmolarity promotes ferroptosis mainly by enhancing lipid peroxidation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Conversely, the ferroptosis inducers, erastin and RSL-3, markedly increased the osmosensitivity of mIMCD3 cells in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D and E</xref>). Consistently, both erastin and RSL3 aggravated hyperosmolarity-induced lipid ROS accumulation in IMCD cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). We also noticed that RSL3 caused a comparable degree of cell death and lipid ROS production between isosmolarity- and hyperosmolarity-treated mIMCD3 cells, suggesting that GPX4 activity is critical for the survival of mIMCD3 cells. Altogether, these findings demonstrate that ferroptosis is the major type of RCD in IMCD cells exposed to hyperosmolar stress.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Ferroptosis is the major type of regulated cell death in inner medullary collecting duct (IMCD) cells under hyperosmotic stress.</title><p>mIMCD3 cells were treated with various doses of the ferroptosis inhibitors and inducers for 24 h, with or without hyperosmotic exposure in the final 12 h.

However, the underlying mechanism by which renal MCD cells survive harsh hyperosmotic stress remains incompletely understood. The present study demonstrated a critical role for the sodium-dependent neutral amino acid transporter SLC38A2 in the survival of MCD cells under hyperosmolar conditions. First, we clarified that ferroptosis is a major type of RCD in IMCD cells under hyperosmotic stress. Second, we identified SLC38A2 as a previously uncharacterised osmoresponsive amino acid transporter in the kidney, where its expression is significantly induced by hyperosmolality. Third, we provided a compelling evidence that SLC38A2 plays an important role in protecting IMCD cells from hyperosmotic stress-induced ferroptosis, mainly by activating the mTORC1 signalling pathway. Finally, using <italic>Slc38a2-</italic> knockout mice, we confirmed the critical role of SLC38A2 in maintaining renal medullary homeostasis and renal urine concentration by attenuating medullary cell ferroptosis. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that <italic>Slc38a2</italic> is a critical osmoprotective gene in the renal medulla, and its appropriate function is a prerequisite for urine concentration.</p><p>MCD cells are essential for urine concentration and must adapt to constant changes in environmental osmolarity to maintain their viability and functionality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Woo and Kwon, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dmitrieva and Burg, 2005</xref>). However, the underlying mechanism by which MCD cells survive in harsh hyperosmotic environments remains unclear. In the past decade, it has been repeatedly reported that apoptosis is involved in hyperosmolarity-induced cell death in MCD cells, particularly IMCD cells, and multiple factors including TonEBP, NF-ÎºB, P53, PPARÎ²/Î´, and FXR protect MCD cell viability through their anti-apoptotic properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Han et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Xu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Guan, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dmitrieva et al., 2001</xref>). However, emerging evidence suggests that in addition to apoptosis, other types of RCD may also contribute to hyperosmolarity-elicited death of MCD cells, as apoptotic cells only account for a small portion of the injured cell population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Xu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>). The present study provides a compelling evidence that ferroptosis represents the major type of RCD in hyperosmolarity-induced cell death, as the ferroptosis inhibitors, liproxstatin-1 and ferrostatin-1, almost completely abolish, whereas the ferroptosis inducers, erastin and RSL-3, significantly increase, hyperosmotic stress-induced injury of MCD cells.</p><p>The present study identified <italic>Slc38a2</italic> as an osmoresponsive gene in MCD cells. RNA-Seq analysis revealed 9266 genes differentially expressed in hyperosmolarity-treated mIMCD3 cells, including many previously reported osmoregulatory genes, such as <italic>Hspa1a</italic>, <italic>Hspa1b</italic>, <italic>Hspa41</italic>, <italic>Nfat5</italic> (<italic>TonEBP</italic>), and <italic>Hif1Î±</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Yang et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Woo et al., 2002</xref>). In addition, an array of genes involved in amino acid transport was induced by hyperosmolar treatment. Among the amino acid transporters expressed in the mouse kidney, SLC38A2 is the major transporter in the SLC38 subfamily, with high abundance in renal MCD cells, where its expression is significantly induced by hyperosmolarity. In the present study, we also provide clear evidence that SLC38A2 is directly regulated by NF-ÎºB, which can drive transcription of the <italic>Slc38a2</italic> gene by binding to its gene promoter. Therefore, <italic>Slc38a2</italic> is a novel osmoresponsive gene in IMCD cells, and its expression is under the direct control of NF-ÎºB during hyperosmotic conditions.</p><p>SLC38A2 can transport a group of neutral amino acids, including cysteine, glutamine, glycine, alanine, asparagine, histidine, methionine, proline, and serine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Mackenzie and Erickson, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Shen et al., 2022</xref>). It has been previously reported that an increase in intracellular glutamine, a common transport substrate for SLC38A2, is related to cell volume recovery under hyperosmotic conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Franchi-Gazzola et al., 2006</xref>). During hyperosmotic conditions, System A transport activity increases in renal epithelial cells, tissue fibroblasts, vascular smooth muscle cells, lymphocytes, and endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Franchi-Gazzola et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen and Kempson, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Yamauchi et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Trama et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Petronini et al., 2000</xref>). The application of <italic>Slc38a2</italic> small interfering RNA (siRNA) to inhibit its expression can hinder the increase in intracellular amino acid content and delay the recovery of cell volume (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bevilacqua et al., 2005</xref>). Therefore, SLC38A2 plays an important role in the regulation of cell volume upon hyperosmotic exposure, and the amino acids transported by SLC38A2 act as organic osmolytes in hyperosmotically stressed cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Franchi-Gazzola et al., 2006</xref>). In addition, emerging evidence shows that SLC38A2 can also transport betaine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Nishimura et al., 2014</xref>), an important osmolyte contributing to the osmoprotection of the MCD cells of dehydrated animals. Therefore, the induction of SLC38A2 in hyperosmotically stressed cells and in the renal medulla of dehydrated mice may help restore cell volume and maintain cell viability and function of MCD cells.</p><p>In the present study, we report, for the first time, a critical role of SLC38A2 in protecting IMCD cells against hyperosmolarity-induced ferroptosis by increasing cellular antioxidant capacity. Unrestrained lipid peroxidation is a hallmark of ferroptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2021</xref>). The reduction of lipid peroxidation is essential for cell survival and requires functional GPX4 and GSH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jiang et al., 2021</xref>). Cys is the rate-limiting substrate in the biosynthesis of reduced GSH. Intracellular Cys and GSH levels are highly dependent on the system Xc<sup>â</sup> cystine/glutamate antiporter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Yang et al., 2022</xref>). In addition, Glu, which can be converted from Gln and Met and metabolised into Cys and Gly, is also important for producing GSH to reduce lipid peroxidation via GPX4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hensley et al., 2013</xref>). Therefore, SLC38A2, as a Cys, Gln, Met, and Gly transporter whose expression is abundantly present in IMCD cells and significantly induced by hyperosmolarity, may help maintain cellular redox homeostasis and intracellular GPX4 activity to exert its anti-ferroptotic effect in IMCD cells both in vitro and in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). In addition, we found that hyperosmotic stress reduced GPX4 levels in cultured IMCD cells, which could be restored by SLC38A2 overexpression. Conversely, water deprivation downregulated GPX4 expression in the renal medulla of WT mice, which was further reduced in <italic>Slc38a2<sup>â/â</sup></italic> mice. These findings demonstrate that SLC38A2 may protect MCD cells from ferroptosis by increasing GPX4 expression and activity.</p><p>In addition to supplying sufficient Cys, Glu, Met, and Gly for GSH biosynthesis in IMCD cells under hyperosmotic stress, SLC38A2 may also exert its anti-ferroptotic effect by activating the mTORC1 signalling pathway. mTORC1 integrates multiple signal inputs, including energy, growth factors, and amino acids, to promote cell growth and proliferation by phosphorylating S6K1 and 4EBP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>). In the present study, we found that hyperosmolarity suppressed IMCD cell viability by inhibiting mTORC1 activity, which was markedly attenuated by SLC38A2 overexpression. It has been previously reported that glutamine, a well-documented SLC38A2 substrate, can strongly activate mTORC1 by facilitating cellular uptake of leucine via the System L amino acid transporter SLC7A5/SLC3A2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Nicklin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cohen and Hall, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). Therefore, it is reasonable to draw a conclusion that hyperosmolarity-induced SLC38A2 expression may protect the MCDs of dehydrated mice through increasing mTORC1 expression and activity.</p><p>In the present study, we found that the <italic>Slc38a2-</italic>knockout mice exhibited a slight increase in both urine output and osmolyte excretion. It is speculated that as an amino acid transporter, <italic>Slc38a2</italic>-gene deficiency results in blunted cellular uptake of certain amino acids by peripheral tissues and elevated levels of amino acids in the plasma, which cause mild osmotic diuresis. Under dehydrated conditions, enhanced collecting duct ferroptosis may also contribute to increased urine output in the <italic>Slc38a2</italic>-knockout mice. In addition, elevated circulating amino acid levels and increased glomerular filtration of amino acids into the renal tubules may be responsible for a slight increase in urinary osmolarity observed in the <italic>Slc38a2</italic>-knockout mice.</p><p>Taken together, our data demonstrate that (1) ferroptosis is the major type of RCD in hyperosmolarity-exposed IMCD cells; (2) <italic>Slc38a2</italic> is a novel osmoresponsive gene in IMCD cells, and its expression is significantly induced by NF-ÎºB under hyperosmotic stress; (3) SLC38A2 protects IMCD cells from hyperosmolality-induced ferroptosis both in vitro and in vivo; and (4) the renoprotective effect of SLC38A2 is mediated by the activation of the mTORC1 signalling pathway. Altogether, our study demonstrates that SLC38A2-mediated anti-ferroptotic effects represent a novel and critical mechanism by which renal MCD cells can survive and function in a harsh hyperosmotic environment. Pharmacological blockade of the SLC38A2-mTORC1 axis by the SLC38A2 inhibitor and rapamycin may disrupt renal medullary architecture and impair urine concentration by promoting ferroptosis of MCD cells.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animal studies</title><p>Male C57BL/6 WT mice were purchased from the Vital River Laboratory Animal Technology (Beijing, China).

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Martin Pollak as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Reviewer #1. These are very well done studies which make the point convincingly that SLC38A2 plays an important role in protecting IMCD cells from hypertonic stress. The studies are complete and include cultured cell lines, primary cultures and intact mice. I have made a few suggestions about presentation in the public comments. The only consequential question is whether, in the intact mouse, water deprivation alters the upstream regulator (nF-kappaB) and the downstream TORC1 pathway as would be suggested by the studies in the cultured cells.</p><p>(1) For clarity, please consider moving the in vivo studies up in the results. This will motivate the detailed mechanistic studies in the cultured cells. The way the text is now, the reader wonders whether all of the work in cultured cells relates at all to the intact animal. You have such strong data in the intact mouse, that it likely should be moved up earlier in the narrative.</p><p>(2) Since the in vivo results correlate so well with the studies in culture, does water deprivation increase nF-kappaB or TORC1 expression in the intact mouse kidney?</p><p>Reviewer #2. I recommend another thorough proof-read by a native English speaker.</p><p>The terms hyperosmolarity and hypertonicity are used to describe the same experimental condition (hyperosmolarity). I suggest to consistently stick with the term &quot;hyperosmolarity&quot; to avoid confusion.</p><p>Slc38a2 and SLC38A2 are used to describe the same gene/protein. I recommend to use consistent nomenclature (Slc38a2) to avoid confusion.</p><p>Figure 7I does not contribute to the key message of this figure. It would be better to include these data into Figure 6.</p><p>Figure 8A, B were copied and pasted from https://cello.shinyapps.io/kidneycellexplorer/. Although these data support the expression of Slc38a2 mRNA in medullary cells, I suggest to move them into Supplementary Data.</p><p>Figure 8C. Detection of Slc38a2 protein in proximal tubules is surprising and non-consistent with the single cell sequencing data presented in Figure 8A and B. Is this staining specific or background? Control staining with secondary AB only would address this question.</p><p>Figure 9M: Increased TUNEL staining is suggested to be present in renal medullas of Slc38a2 knockout mice compared to control mice. This is an important finding. However, only two images of fluorescent stainings are presented. TUNEL positive cells should be quantitated and evaluated statistically.</p><p>Figure S9: Knockout mice excrete slightly increased urinary volume, but at the same time they display increased urinary osmolarity. This combination of findings is surprising and unexpected. Does this mean that knockout mice excrete more osmolytes than control mice? I would have expected equal osmolyte excretion rates. The authors should discuss this finding.</p><p>Reviewer #3. Show the functional significance of SLC38A2 in vivo by comparing the long-term effects of water deprivation (with and without mTor inhibitor) of WT and ko-mice.</p><p>Explain Tubular gain of function (i.e. increased urine osmolality) with SLC38A2 ko.</p><p>Electron microscopic evidence for ferroptosis in vivo.</p><p>Explain: mOsmo -SLC38A2/NFkB dose response in IMCD3 cells in vivo.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>These studies address the mechanisms by which medullary collecting duct cells survive the rigors of periodic medullary hypertonicity which is needed for urinary concentration. The authors make a convincing case that hypertonicity leads to upregulation of the nF-kappaB pathway, which drives synthesis of the amino acid transporter, SLC38A2, which in turn provides critical amino acid substrates for the synthesis of the oxygen scavenger, glutathione. The studies combine work in cell lines, primary cultures and in the intact mouse. The work starts with an unbiased RNASeq approach which identified the upregulation of the SLC38A2 gene, and the authors then examine, systematically the role of upregulation of SLC38A2 in cell survival, and the pathways involved in SLC38A2 regulation. The studies are convincing and well performed.</p><p>I have only a few comments, which might improve the presentation.</p><p>1. Towards the end of the Results the authors turn to the whole animal, showing that water deprivation upregulates SLC38A2 expression, and showing the localization of SLC38A2 on cell membranes. I might move from the RNASeq to a description of the in vivo results in mice, including the knockout studies. These establish the importance of SLC38A2 in the intact mouse.

Since long-term water deprivation is very harmful for experimental animals (PMID: 31818909; PMID: 17536615), the Animal Ethics Committee only allowed us to extend the period of water deprivation (WD) to 48 hours. Wild-type (WT) and the <italic>Slc38a2</italic>-knockout (KO) mice were divided into following groups: WT-WD-vehicle (n=9), KO-WD-vehicle (n=7), WT-WD-rapamycin (n=11), and KO-WD-rapamycin (n=8). The mice were intraperitoneally injected with rapamycin (2mg/kg/day) or vehicle (saline) for 7 consecutive days and were subjected to 2-day water deprivation staring from the fifth day. The results showed that both WT and KO mice receiving saline treatment can tolerate 2-day water restriction. However, in the presence of rapamycin, almost all KO mice were dead after 2-day water deprivation. Although WT mice survived 7-day rapamycin treatment and 2-day water restriction, all of them were in serious health condition. Therefore, we decided to terminate the experiment and could not complete the study. However, the findings further provided evidence supporting the importance of SLC38A2 (SLC38A2) in maintaining water homeostasis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Explain Tubular gain of function (i.e. increased urine osmolality) with SLC38A2 ko.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the meaningful comment.

We guess the reviewer means dose response in mIMCD3 in vitro, since mIMCD3 is a mouse collecting duct cell line. It has been well known that NF-ÎºB as a transcription factor plays an important role in promoting the survival of the collecting duct cells. A recent study (PMID: 32175843) showed that the induction of SLC38A2 (SLC38A2) is mediated by the nuclear factor ÎºB (NF-ÎºB) family protein, which is consistent with our findings. In the mIMCD3 cells, we found a dose-dependent response of active NF-ÎºB (p-NF-ÎºB) to osmotic pressure between 300 mOsm and 800 mOsm (Figure 6A). However, in terms of SLC38A2, we only observed a dose-dependent response of SLC38A2 protein between 300 mOsm and 600 mOsm (Figure 5B). The reason for the inconsistence remains unclear. One possibility is that the half-life of SLC38A2 protein is shorter than that of NF-ÎºB protein. The other possibility is that the effect of NF-ÎºB on SLC38A2 expression is dependent on the NF-ÎºB activity. At low level NF-ÎºB induces SLC38A2 expression, while at high level it suppresses SLC38A2 expression. However, the precise mechanism by which NF-ÎºB affects SLC38A2 expression requires further investigation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>These studies address the mechanisms by which medullary collecting duct cells survive the rigors of periodic medullary hypertonicity which is needed for urinary concentration.

The studies combine work in cell lines, primary cultures and in the intact mouse. The work starts with an unbiased RNASeq approach which identified the upregulation of the SLC38A2 gene, and the authors then examine, systematically the role of upregulation of SLC38A2 in cell survival, and the pathways involved in SLC38A2 regulation.

The mIMCD3 is a mouse inner medullary collecting duct cell line which is commonly used for studying the collecting duct function in vitro. The mIMCD3 cells were usually cultured in isotonic medium, which is in sharp contrast to medullary collecting duct cells in the kidney who live in a hypertonic and hypoxic environment. In addition, as a transformed cells, mIMCD3 cells loss many characteristics of renal medullary collecting duct cells. As a result, mIMCD3 cells can only tolerate hypertonicity up to 600 mOsm. In the hypertonic medium with 700 mOsm and higher, most of mIMCD3 cells are dead, leading to the degradation of most of proteins including SLC38A2 (SLC38A2). As the reviewer pointed out, urine and medullary osmolality can go much higher under dehydration condition. To better mimic the in vivo characteristics of medullary collecting duct cells, we also cultured primary renal collecting duct cells who can tolerate much higher osmolality. As shown in Figure 8E in the revised manuscript, SLC38A2 protein expression remains at high level under 1200 mOsm. Therefore, as described in the manuscript, SLC38A2 has an important protective effect on the survival of medullary cells under hypertonic conditions above 600 mOsm in vivo.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure S3: Induction of Slco4a1 and Slc5a3 mRNA was much stronger with hyperosmolality compared to the effect on Slc38a2 mRNA.

They show that hypertonicity dose-dependently increased NF-ÎºB activity in mIMCD3 cells from 300-800 mOsm. How do the authors reconcile this notion with repression of SLC38A2 expression with 700 and 800 mOsm (Figure 3.)?</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the wonderful comment. It has been well known that NF-ÎºB as a transcription factor plays an important role in promoting the survival of the collecting duct cells. A recent study (PMID: 32175843) showed that the induction of SLC38A2 (SLC38A2) is mediated by the nuclear factor ÎºB (NF-ÎºB) family protein, which is consistent with our findings. In the mIMCD3 cells, we found a dose-dependent response of active NF-ÎºB (p-NF-ÎºB) to osmotic pressure between 300 mOsm and 800 mOsm (Figure 6A). However, in terms of SLC38A2, we only observed a dose-dependent response of SLC38A2 protein between 300 mOsm and 600 mOsm (Figure 5B). The reason for the inconsistence remains unclear. One possibility is that the half-life of SLC38A2 protein is shorter than that of NF-ÎºB protein. The other possibility is that the effect of NF-ÎºB on SLC38A2 expression is dependent on the NF-ÎºB activity. At low level NF-ÎºB induces SLC38A2 expression, while at high level it suppresses SLC38A2 expression. However, the precise mechanism by which NF-ÎºB affects SLC38A2 expression requires further investigation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 9: Can the authors provide independent evidence for ferroptosis by performing electron microscopic studies of renal medullae?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this important comment. As the reviewer suggested, we conducted an electron microscopic study on renal medullas of wild-type (WT) and the <italic>Slc38a2</italic>-knockout (KO) mice with 24-hour water deprivation. The results showed that although both genotypes exhibited robust changes in mitochondrial morphology, the reduction of mitochondria volume and loss and rupture of mitochondrial crest were more severe in renal medullary cells of the KO mice than that in WT mice under water deprivation condition, which was in line with the findings in cultured cells under hyperosmolarity. Therefore, both in vitro and in vivo studies demonstrate that hyperosmolarity can aggravate renal medullary cell ferroptosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig4">Author response image 4</xref>).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure S9: The authors demonstrate increased urine osmolality in SLC38A2 ko mice (despite higher urine output). How do the authors explain the obviously increased medullary osmotic gradient?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the constructive comment and suggestion. As shown in Figure S9 (Figure 4âfigure supplement 2 in the revised manuscript), the <italic>Slc38a2</italic>-knockout mice indeed excreted slightly increased urinary volume. As described in the manuscript, SLC38A2 is an important neutral amino acid transporter in vivo and amino acids can serve as important osmolytes. We measured urine osmolyte and amino acid excretion in both wild-type (WT) and <italic>Slc38a2</italic>-knockout (KO) mice. The results showed that daily osmolyte and amino acid excretion in the <italic>Slc38a2</italic>-KO mice was significantly higher than that in WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig3">Author response image 3A</xref> and B), suggesting a slight increase in urinary osmolality. It is speculated that as an amino acid transporter, <italic>Slc38a2</italic>-gene deficiency results in blunted uptake of certain amino acids by peripheral tissues and elevated level of amino acids in the plasma, which causes a mild osmotic diuresis. In addition, under dehydrate condition, increased collecting duct ferroptosis as reported in this paper may also contribute to increased urine output in the <italic>Slc38a2</italic>-knockout mice. In terms of medullary osmotic gradient, we speculate that it is slightly reduced due to massive ferroptosis of medullary collecting duct cells in the <italic>Slc38a2</italic>-knockout mice after dehydration. In the revised manuscript, we briefly discussed this important issue.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>How do the authors explain the &quot;polyuria&quot; under basal (S9b) and challenged conditions (S9e).</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks a lot for your careful reading and meaningful question.

Such experiments (maybe combined with Tor-inhibitors) may yield insight into the functional role of SLC38A2 in water deprived animals.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank the reviewer for the meaningful suggestion. Since long-term water deprivation is very harmful for experimental animals (PMID: 31818909; PMID: 17536615), the Animal Ethics Committee only allowed us to extend the period of water deprivation (WD) to 48 hours. Wild-type (WT) and <italic>Slc38a2</italic>-knockout (KO) mice were divided into following groups: WT-WD-vehicle (n=9), KO-WD-vehicle (n=7), WT-WD-rapamycin (n=11), and KO-WD-rapamycin (n=8). The mice were intraperitoneally injected with rapamycin (2mg/kg/day) or vehicle (saline) for 7 consecutive days and were subjected to 2-day water deprivation staring from the fifth day. The results showed that both WT and KO mice receiving saline treatment can tolerate 2-day water restriction. However, in the presence of rapamycin, almost all KO mice were dead after 2-day water deprivation. Although WT mice survived 7-day rapamycin treatment and 2-day water restriction, all of them were in serious health condition. Therefore, we decided to terminate the experiment but could not complete the study. However, the findings further provided evidence supporting the importance of SLC38A2 (SLC38A2) in maintaining water homeostasis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In the discussion, the authors state: &quot;Finally, by using SLC38A2 gene knockout mice, we confirm the critical role of SLC38A2 in maintaining renal medullary homeostasis and renal urine concentration by attenuating medullary cell ferroptosis.&quot; The increased urine osmolality in SLC38A2 ko mice indicates the opposite.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the valuable comment. In the present study, we showed that the <italic>Slc38a2</italic> (SLC38A2) gene knockout (KO) aggravated ferroptosis of medullary collecting duct cells, leading to an impaired urine concentration and increased urine output. The increased urine osmolyte excretion is possibly due to enhanced glomerular filtration of amino acids into renal tubules as a results of elevated plasma amino acid levels (data not shown). Another possibility is that <italic>Slc38a2</italic>-gene deficiency in renal tubules reduced the capacity of renal reabsorption of the filtrated amino acids, resulting in a slight increase in urine osmolality and mild osmotic diuresis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors use different osmolarities ranging between 300-1200 mOsm without explaining why. (i.e. Figure 1a-c with 300 and 600 mOSM vs. With 300 and 500 mOSM in Figure 1d-f).</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your meaningful question. The mIMCD3 is a mouse inner medullary collecting duct cell line which is commonly used for studying the collecting duct function in vitro. The mIMCD3 cells were usually cultured in isotonic medium, which is in sharp contrast to medullary collecting duct cells in the kidney who live in a hypertonic and hypoxic environment. In addition, as a transformed cells, mIMCD3 cells loss many characteristics of renal medullary collecting duct cells after many passages. As a result, mIMCD3 cells can only tolerate hypertonicity up to 600 mOsm and in the hypertonic medium with 700 mOsm and higher, most of mIMCD3 cells are dead. As the reviewer mentioned, urine and medullary osmolality can go much higher in vivo under dehydration condition. To better mimic the in vivo characteristics of medullary collecting duct cells, we also cultured primary renal collecting duct cells who can tolerate much higher osmolality, which allowed us to determine the effect of higher osmotic pressure (up to 1200 mOsm) on these cells.</p><p>As mentioned above, the mIMCD3 cells are more suitable for testing the effect of osmolality between 300 mOsm and 800 mOsm. Since hypertonicity causes ferroptosis of mIMCD3 cells in a dose dependent manner, we chose 600 mOsm to determine the protective effect of the ferroptosis inhibitor and 500 mOsm to measure injurious effect of the ferroptosis agonist.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 9 M: Can the authors localize TUNEL-positivity to either interstitial and/or tubular cells?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the constructive comment.
