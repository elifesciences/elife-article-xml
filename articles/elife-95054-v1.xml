The physiological roles of PT in sperm biology and the clinical relevance of variants of PT proteins to male infertility are still largely unknown. We reveal that cylicin-1, a major constituent of the PT, is vital for male fertility in both mice and humans. Loss of cylicin-1 in mice leads to a high incidence of malformed sperm heads with acrosome detachment from the nucleus. Cylicin-1 interacts with itself, several other PT proteins, the inner acrosomal membrane (IAM) protein SPACA1, and the nuclear envelope (NE) protein FAM209 to form an ‘IAM–cylicins–NE’ sandwich structure, anchoring the acrosome to the nucleus. WES (whole exome sequencing) of more than 500 Chinese infertile men with sperm head deformities was performed and a <italic>CYLC1</italic> variant was identified in 19 patients. <italic>Cylc1</italic>-mutant mice carrying this variant also exhibited sperm acrosome/head deformities and reduced fertility, indicating that this <italic>CYLC1</italic> variant most likely affects human male reproduction. Furthermore, the outcomes of assisted reproduction were reported for patients harbouring the <italic>CYLC1</italic> variant. Our findings demonstrate a critical role of cylicin-1 in the sperm acrosome–nucleus connection and suggest <italic>CYLC1</italic> variants as potential risk factors for human male fertility.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>perinuclear theca</kwd><kwd>CYLC1</kwd><kwd>male infertility</kwd><kwd>sperm head deformity</kwd><kwd>acrosome

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In mammalian sperm, the cytoskeletal element encapsulating the nuclei is a detergent- and high salt-resistant structure called the perinuclear theca (PT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Oko and Sutovsky, 2009</xref>). Apically, the PT resides between the inner acrosomal membrane (IAM) and the nuclear envelope (NE) making up the subacrosomal layer (PT-SAL, also known as the acroplaxome), while caudally, it resides between the cell membrane and the NE making up the postacrosomal part (PT-PAR, also known as the calyx). The PT is not composed of traditional cytoskeletal proteins but rather of a variety of spermatid-specific cytosolic and nuclear proteins. Longo et al. determined that two kinds of basic proteins are the major constituents of PT: calicin and cylicins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Longo et al., 1987</xref>). After that, more than 20 PT-enriched proteins, such as fatty acid-binding protein (FABP)9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Oko and Morales, 1994</xref>), actin-capping protein (CP) α3/β3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">von Bülow et al., 1997</xref>), transcription factor STAT4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Herrada and Wolgemuth, 1997</xref>), actin-related proteins ACTRT1/2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Heid et al., 2002</xref>), histone H2B variant H2BL1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aul and Oko, 2002</xref>), sperm-borne oocyte activating factors (PLCζ and PAWP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aarabi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hachem et al., 2017</xref>), and the glutathione <italic>S</italic>-transferase GSTO2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hamilton et al., 2017</xref>), have been identified from mammalian sperm.</p><p>The PT is speculated to function as (1) an architectural element involved in the shape changes of the nucleus during spermiogenesis, (2) a cement linking the acrosome with the nucleus, and (3) a candidate for sperm-borne oocyte activation. However, the physiological roles of PT in sperm are largely uncertain due to the lack of evidence from gene knockout animal models. Our recent studies of <italic>Ccin</italic>- and <italic>Actrt1</italic>-knockout mice indicate that PT, at least, physiologically functions to protect nuclear structure and anchor developing acrosomes to the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Zhang et al., 2022a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Zhang et al., 2022b</xref>). Loss of calicin specifically leads to the surface subsidence of sperm heads in the nuclear condensation stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Zhang et al., 2022a</xref>). Importantly, we further report that three infertile men with sperm head deformities carry homozygous pathogenic mutations in <italic>CCIN</italic>, and the corresponding <italic>Ccin</italic>-mutant mice mimic the phenotype in patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fan et al., 2022</xref>). <italic>Actrt1</italic>-KO male mice are severely subfertile as a result of detached acrosomes and fertilization deficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Zhang et al., 2022b</xref>). ACTRT1 anchors acrosomes to the nucleus by interacting with some IAM proteins and NE proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Zhang et al., 2022b</xref>).</p><p>Hess et al. cloned cDNAs encoding cylicin-1, named for the Greek word for ‘cup’ or ‘beaker’. 74 kDa cylicin-1 contains numerous lysine dipeptides followed by a third variable amino acid (KKX). The C-terminal tail contains proline-rich segments and the central portion of the protein is arranged as a series of repeating units that are predicted to form short alpha helices. Northern blotting detects the cylicin-1 transcript only in the testis, and an antibody against cylicin-1 specifically stains the PT-PAR of human and bovine sperm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hess et al., 1993</xref>). Apart from the first expression study of calicin-1 published 30 years ago, the physiological role of cylicin-1 in sperm biology is still unknown.</p><p>In this study, we generated a <italic>Cylc1</italic>-KO mouse model and revealed that loss of cylicin-1 leads to severe male subfertility as a result of sperm head deformities and acrosome detachment. A <italic>CYLC1</italic> variant was identified from a WES (whole exome sequencing) study of infertile patients with sperm head deformities. The contribution of this variant to male subfertility with sperm acrosome detachment is further confirmed by animal evidence from <italic>Cylc1</italic>-mutant mice.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Generation of <italic>Cylc1</italic>-KO mice</title><p>Cylicin-1 is a major and specific constituent of the PT of mammalian sperm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Longo et al., 1987</xref>).

sperm</title><p>We next generated <italic>Cylc1</italic>-mutant mice that carried a single amino acid change equivalent to the variant in human CYLC1 using CRISPR/Cas9 technology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A, B</xref>). <italic>Cylc1</italic>-mutant mice grew normally but were male subfertile. Of the 42 female mice mated with WT males, 35 were pregnant and gave rise to 281 offspring. In contrast, of the 28 female mice mated with <italic>Cylc1</italic>-mutant males, only 11 were pregnant, giving rise to 49 offspring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C, D</xref>). <italic>Cylc1</italic>-mutant mice and WT mice showed similar testis sizes and weights (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Spermatogenesis and sperm production were generally normal, as indicated by hematoxylin–eosin staining of the testis and cauda epididymis from <italic>Cylc1</italic>-mutant mice and WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Further examination showed that the sperm count and total motility of <italic>Cylc1</italic>-mutant mice were similar to those indexes in WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E, F</xref>). Similar to <italic>Cylc1</italic>-KO mice, <italic>Cylc1</italic>-mutant mice produced sperm with abnormal head morphologies, exhibiting varying degrees of ‘fan-shaped’ heads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>). Compared with the closely attached acrosomes in WT mice, spermatids from <italic>Cylc1</italic>-mutant mice exhibited varying degrees of acrosome detachment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>). The F-actin bundles of spermatid heads in WT mice possessed typical fibrous textures, whereas spermatids of <italic>Cylc1</italic>-mutant mice showed uneven, thin, or ectopic F-actin distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>). The phenotype of sperm acrosome detachment in <italic>Cylc1</italic>-mutant mice was further observed by TEM technology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I</xref>). TEM analysis of elongating spermatids within the testis revealed an enlarged space area between the IAM and the NE in <italic>Cylc1</italic>-mutant mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I</xref>). Hence, the above animal evidence suggests that this CYLC1 variant is generally responsible for the patient phenotypes.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title><italic>Cylc1</italic>-mutant mice show male subfertility with sperm acrosome detachment.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Mice carrying an SNV (c.1407G&gt;T/p.K469N) in the <italic>Cylc1</italic> gene equivalent to that in nine patients harboring the CYLC1 variant were generated using CRISPR/Cas9 technology.

Cylicin-1 is specifically expressed at the PT-SAL (between the IAM and the NE) in spermatids and is ultimately distributed to the PT-PAR in sperm. <italic>Cylc1</italic>-KO male mice are severely subfertile with acrosome detachment and aberrant head morphology. By recruiting a large cohort (&gt;500 infertile men with sperm head deformities), a <italic>CYLC1</italic> variant was identified in 19 individuals by WES. <italic>Cylc1</italic>-mutant mice equivalent to the variant in human <italic>CYLC1</italic> mimicked the phenomena of patients. Our experimental observations indicate that cylicin-1 mediates the acrosome–nucleus connection across species, and importantly, <italic>CYLC1</italic> variants are linked to male in/subfertility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Schematic diagram showing the physiological role of CYLC1 on acrosome attachment in humans and mice.</title><p>A <italic>CYLC1</italic> variant is identified in a large cohort of &gt;500 Chinese infertile men with sperm head deformities. Both <italic>Cylc1</italic>-KO mice and <italic>Cylc1</italic>-mutant mice exhibited severe male subfertility with spermatozoa showing detached acrosome and head deformities. Cylicin-1 is specifically expressed at the acroplaxome (Apx), between nuclear envelope (NE) and inner acrosomal membrane (IAM), of spermatids. Cylicin-1 interacts itself and with other perinuclear theca (PT) proteins (including CCIN, ACTRT1, ACTRT2, ACTL7A, and CAPZA3) in the acroplaxome layer and mediates the acrosome–nucleus connection through interacting with IAM protein SPACA1 and NE protein FAM209.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-95054-fig7-v1.tif"/></fig><p>PT is a cytoskeletal element encapsulating the sperm nucleus. Compared with other sperm structures, such as acrosome and axoneme-based flagella, our understanding of the PT is very limited. Although the morphological structures and protein compositions of PT are well studied, the physiological roles of sperm PT structure are still largely unknown. Our recent two studies using <italic>Ccin</italic>-KO and <italic>Actrt1</italic>-KO mice have explored two different physiological functions of sperm PT—protecting sperm nuclear structure and mediating acrosome–nuclear connection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Zhang et al., 2022a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Zhang et al., 2022b</xref>). Loss of calicin specifically causes ‘surface subsidence’ of the sperm nucleus at the nuclear condensation stage, and sperm from <italic>Ccin</italic>-KO mice exhibit DNA damage and fertilization failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Zhang et al., 2022a</xref>). ACTRT1 forms a large ARP complex with ACTL7A and ACTL9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Zhang et al., 2022b</xref>). <italic>Actrt1</italic>-, <italic>Actl7a</italic>-, and <italic>Actl9</italic>-deficient mice all exhibit acrosome detachment and partial/total fertilization failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Xin et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dai et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Zhang et al., 2022b</xref>). Studies from <italic>Actrt1</italic>-, <italic>Actl7a</italic>-, <italic>Actl9</italic>-, and <italic>Cylc1</italic>-deficient mice unequivocally demonstrate the essential role of PT structure in mediating acrosome–nucleus connections. <italic>Actrt1</italic>-KO mice and <italic>Cylc1</italic>-KO mice are severely subfertile rather than completely infertile, indicating that acrosome–nucleus connections may require additive or synergistic effects of several PT proteins.</p><p>In spermatids, the acrosome is tightly bound to the PT-SAL plate, which in turn is anchored to the NE of the elongating spermatid nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Zhang et al., 2022a</xref>). The ‘IAM–SAL–NE’ sandwich structure plays a central role in acrosome attachment, and perturbations in this structure are conceivably the major causes of acrosome detachment from the sperm nucleus. The existing evidence is as follows: (1) no close association of the IAM with the NE is formed in spermatids of <italic>Spaca1</italic>-KO mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fujihara et al., 2012</xref>); (2) SPACA1 interacts with PT-SAL proteins (e.g., CCIN, ACTRT1, and ACTL7A) to anchor the acrosome to the PA-SAL structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Xin et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Zhang et al., 2022a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Zhang et al., 2022b</xref>); and (3) PT-SAL proteins (e.g., CCIN and ACTRT1) could further connect with NE proteins (e.g., DPY19L2, FAM209, PARP11, and SPATA46) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Zhang et al., 2022a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Zhang et al., 2022b</xref>).</p><p>Cylicin-1 interacts with itself and other PT proteins (e.g., CCIN, ACTRT1, ACTRT2, ACTL7A, CAPZA3, and CAPZB) to form a PT-SAL plate. Cylicin-1 homopolymer further connects the acrosome to the NE, likely by interacting with IAM proteins (e.g., SPACA1) and NE proteins (e.g., FAM209). Disruption of the ‘IAM–SAL–NE’ sandwich structure is suggested to be the reason for acrosome detachment in <italic>Cylc1</italic>-deficient spermatids. Deficiency of cylicin-1 also partially affects the formation or stability of ACTRT1–ACTL7A and ACTL7A–SPACA1. However, the physiological organization of ‘IAM–SAL–NE’ protein complexes and how the CYLC1 variant will affect this structure at the molecular or even atomic level have not been clear until now.</p><p>Mutations in genes encoding PT proteins have been shown to be associated with male infertility with sperm head deformities. Xin et al. identified a homozygous missense mutation of <italic>ACTL7A</italic> in two infertile brothers presenting sperm acrosomal ultrastructural defects and early embryonic arrest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Xin et al., 2020</xref>). WES of 21 male individuals with fertilization failure identified homozygous pathogenic variants in <italic>ACTL9</italic> in three individuals, also showing sperm acrosome detachment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dai et al., 2021</xref>). We report that three infertile men showing ‘surface subsidence’ of the sperm nucleus carry homozygous pathogenic mutations in <italic>CCIN</italic>, and the corresponding <italic>Ccin</italic>-mutant mice mimic the phenotype in patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fan et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>Infertility is a very heterogeneous condition, with genetic causes involved in approximately half of cases. Taking the percentage of male in/subfertile may reach more than 20% of the population into consideration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gnoth et al., 2005</xref>), the contribution of multiple genetic factors and common variants to male infertility should not be omitted. It has been suggest that mouse modelling data are critical to determine the pathogenicity of point mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Singh and Schimenti, 2015</xref>). Our mutant mouse results further proved that the identified CYLC1 variant is harmful for male fertility. Similar to <italic>Cylc1</italic>-KO mice, <italic>Cylc1</italic>-mutant mice showed severe male subfertility with sperm acrosome/head deformities. While our study was under preparation, another laboratory in parallel reported similar findings that <italic>Cylc1</italic>-KO mice showed sperm acrosome detachment and male subfertility as a reviewed preprint in eLife (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Schneider et al., 2023</xref>). This report and our current study unequivocally demonstrate the essential role of cylicin-1 in mediating sperm acrosome–nucleus connections and mouse male fertility. Intriguingly, Schneider et al. indicate that deficiency of <italic>Cylc2</italic> (even in heterozygous state) worsened the fertility of <italic>Cylc1</italic>-KO mice (from severe subfertility to infertility). Extending to humans, we suggest that CYLC1 variants contribute to male infertility, especially when combined with certain variants of other male infertility-associated genes. This notion may improve our multiperspective understanding of male in/subfertility, which is a very heterogeneous condition.</p><p>After analysing the ART outcomes of the patients harbouring CYLC1 variant, we suggest that ICSI but not IVF may serve as a promising treatment for in/subfertile men carrying <italic>CYLC1</italic> variants. The reduced rate of acrosome reaction may be one of the underlying reasons. The outcomes of ICSI together with AOA treatment seem to be better than those of ICSI alone, because good-quality embryos are obtained in the ICSI + AOA group but not in the ICSI group for patients AAW228 and AAX765. It is still not known whether a deficiency of cylicin-1 in sperm affects oocyte activation in humans.</p><p>Taken together, we provided solid animal and clinic evidence to indicate that cylicin-1 mediate the acrosome–nucleus connection of sperm and suggest <italic>CYLC1</italic> variants as potential risk factors for human male fertility.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice</title><p>Animal experiments were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of the College of Life Sciences, Beijing Normal University (CLS-AWEC-B-2023-001).

Using mouse models, the researchers demonstrate that cylicin-1 is specifically expressed in the post acrosomal sheath-like region in spermatids and plays a crucial role in mediating acrosome-nucleus connections. Loss of CYLC1 results in severe male subfertility, characterized by acrosome detachment and aberrant head morphology in sperm. Further analysis of a large cohort of infertile men reveals CYLC1 variants in patients with sperm head deformities. The study provides valuable insights into the role of CYLC1 in male fertility and proposes CYLC1 variants as potential risk factors for human male infertility, emphasizing the importance of mouse models in understanding the pathogenicity of such variants.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>This article demonstrates notable strengths in various aspects. Firstly, the clarity and excellent writing style contribute to the accessibility of the content. Secondly, the employed techniques are not only relevant but also complementary, enhancing the robustness of the study. The precision in their experimental design and the meticulous interpretation of results reflect the scientific rigor maintained throughout the study. Furthermore, the decision to create a second mouse model with the exact CYLC1 mutation found in humans adds significant qualitative value to the research. This approach not only validates the clinical relevance of the identified variant but also strengthens the translational impact of the findings.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>There are no obvious weaknesses. While a few minor refinements, as suggested in the recommendations to authors, could enhance the overall support for the data and the authors' messages, these suggested improvements in no way diminish the robustness of the already presented data.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.95054.2.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Summary:</p><p>* To verify the function of PT-associated protein CYLC1, the authors generated a Cylc1-KO mouse model and revealed that loss of cylicin-1 leads to severe male subfertility as a result of sperm head deformities and acrosome detachment.</p><p>* Then they also identified a CYLC1 variant by WES analysis from 19 infertile males with sperm head deformities.</p><p>* To prove the pathogenicity of the identified mutation site, they further generated Cylc1-mutant mice that carried a single amino acid change equivalent to the variant in human CYLC1. The Cylc1-mutant mice also exhibited male subfertility with detached acrosomes of sperm cells.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>* The phenotypes observed in the Cylc1-KO mice provide strong evidence for the function of CYLC1 as a PT-associated protein in spermatogenesis and male infertility.</p><p>* Further mechanistic studies indicate that loss of cylicin-1 in mice may disrupt the connections between the inner acrosomal membrane and acroplaxome, leading to detached acrosomes of sperm cells.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>* The authors identified a missense mutation (c.1377G&gt;T/p. K459N) from 19 infertile males with sperm head deformities. The information for the variant in Table 1 is insufficient to determine the pathogenicity and reliability of the mutation site. More information should be added, including all individuals in gnomAD, East Asians in gnomAD, 1000 Genomes Project for allele frequency in the human population; MutationTaster, M-CAP, FATHMM, and more other tools for function prediction. Then, the expression of CYLC1 in the spermatozoa from men with CYLC1 mutation should be explored by qPCR, Western blot, or IF staining analyses.</p><p>* Although 19 infertile males were found carrying the same missense mutation (c.1377G&gt;T/p. K459N), their phenotypes are somewhat different. For example, sperm concentrations for individuals AAX765, BBA344, and 3086 are extremely low but this is not observed in other infertile males. Then, progressive motility for individuals AAT812, 3165, 3172, 3203, and 3209 are extremely low but this is also not observed in other infertile males. It is worth considering why different phenotypes are observed in probands carrying the same mutation.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment"

Using mouse models, the researchers demonstrate that cylicin-1 is specifically expressed in the post acrosomal sheath-like region in spermatids and plays a crucial role in mediating acrosome-nucleus connections. Loss of CYLC1 results in severe male subfertility, characterized by acrosome detachment and aberrant head morphology in sperm. Further analysis of a large cohort of infertile men reveals CYLC1 variants in patients with sperm head deformities. The study provides valuable insights into the role of CYLC1 in male fertility and proposes CYLC1 variants as potential risk factors for human male infertility, emphasizing the importance of mouse models in understanding the pathogenicity of such variants.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the comprehensive summary of reviewer 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Strengths:</p><p>This article demonstrates notable strengths in various aspects. Firstly, the clarity and excellent writing style contribute to the accessibility of the content. Secondly, the employed techniques are not only relevant but also complementary, enhancing the robustness of the study. The precision in their experimental design and the meticulous interpretation of results reflect the scientific rigor maintained throughout the study. Furthermore, the decision to create a second mouse model with the exact CYLC1 mutation found in humans adds significant qualitative value to the research. This approach not only validates the clinical relevance of the identified variant but also strengthens the translational impact of the findings.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the positive comment of reviewer 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>There are no obvious weaknesses. While a few minor refinements, as suggested in the recommendations to authors, could enhance the overall support for the data and the authors' messages, these suggested improvements in no way diminish the robustness of the already presented data.</p></disp-quote><p>In the recommendation for the authors, reviewer 1 mentioned a recent study (Schneider et al., eLife, 2023) showing that Cylc1-KO mice exhibits a reduced sperm count, an observation not noted in our current study. We would like to comment that that main and most important phenotype of Cylc1-KO mice in both studies is quite similar, including male subfertility and abnormal head morphology. We think the different targeting strategy and mouse strain may cause this discrepancy. In Schneider’s and our current studies, the total motility abnormality of Cylc1-KO mice are not observed. We appreciate the suggestion of reviewer 1 to further examine the detailed parameters of motility such as VCL, VSL, and ALH. Given that the head deformation is the most obvious phenotype of Cylc1-KO mice and the focus of our study, we feel sorry that this detailed analysis of sperm motility was not performed in the current stage. Reviewer 1 also asked whether Cylc1-KO female mice are fertile or not. Given that Cylc1 is an X chromosome gene and Cylc1-KO (Cylc1-/Y) mice are severely subfertile, we do not obtain enough Cylc1-KO female mice to examine their fecundity. We also would like to thank reviewer 1 to point out several inaccurate descriptions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>To verify the function of PT-associated protein CYLC1, the authors generated a Cylc1-KO mouse model and revealed that loss of cylicin-1 leads to severe male subfertility as a result of sperm head deformities and acrosome detachment. Then they also identified a CYLC1 variant by WES analysis from 19 infertile males with sperm head deformities. To prove the pathogenicity of the identified mutation site, they further generated Cylc1-mutant mice that carried a single amino acid change equivalent to the variant in human CYLC1. The Cylc1-mutant mice also exhibited male subfertility with detached acrosomes of sperm cells.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the comprehensive summary of reviewer 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Strengths:</p><p>The phenotypes observed in the Cylc1-KO mice provide strong evidence for the function of CYLC1 as a PT-associated protein in spermatogenesis and male infertility. Further mechanistic studies indicate that loss of cylicin-1 in mice may disrupt the connections between the inner acrosomal membrane and acroplaxome, leading to detached acrosomes of sperm cells.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the positive comment of reviewer 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The authors identified a missense mutation (c.1377G&gt;T/p. K459N) from 19 infertile males with sperm head deformities. The information for the variant in Table 1 is insufficient to determine the pathogenicity and reliability of the mutation site. More information should be added, including all individuals in gnomAD, East Asians in gnomAD, 1000 Genomes Project for allele frequency in the human population; MutationTaster, M-CAP, FATHMM, and more other tools for function prediction. Then, the expression of CYLC1 in the spermatozoa from men with CYLC1 mutation should be explored by qPCR, Western blot, or IF staining analyses. Although 19 infertile males were found carrying the same missense mutation (c.1377G&gt;T/p. K459N), their phenotypes are somewhat different. For example, sperm concentrations for individuals AAX765, BBA344, and 3086 are extremely low but this is not observed in other infertile males. Then, progressive motility for individuals AAT812, 3165, 3172, 3203, and 3209 are extremely low but this is also not observed in other infertile males. It is worth considering why different phenotypes are observed in probands carrying the same mutation.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the suggestion of reviewer 2. First, Table 1 shows the information of the variant identified in CYLC1 gene, including allele frequency in gnomAD and functional prediction by SIFT, PolyPhen-2, and CADD. Given that mutant mice is a gold standard to confirm the pathogenicity of a variant, we generate Cylc1-mutant mice and Cylc1-mutant mice exhibit male subfertility with sperm acrosome detachment. The animal evidence is much more solid than bioinformatics prediction to confirm the pathogenicity of the identified variant in the CYLC1 gene. Second, the expression of CYLC1 in the spermatozoa from patients have been examined by IF staining (Fig. 5B). Unfortunately, the patients declined to continue in the project to donate more semen for qPCR and Western blot analyses. Third, the reviewer 2 asks why not all patients with CYLC1 gene mutation show the identical phenotype. Although some patients exhibit low sperm count or reduced motility, sperm head deformities are the shared phenotype of 19 patients. Many factors, such as way of life, may affect sperm quality. Perfectly identical phenotype of all 19 patients carrying the CYLC1 mutation is idealistic and will not always happen in clinical diagnosis. We also appreciate other suggestions from reviewer 2.</p></body></sub-article></article>
