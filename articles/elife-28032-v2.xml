Here, through the use of cross-linked constitutively open constructs, we determined the structures of KcsA’s mutants that stabilize the selectivity filter in its conductive (E71A, at 2.25 Å) and deep C-type inactivated (Y82A at 2.4 Å) conformations. These structural snapshots represent KcsA’s transient open-conductive (O/O) and the stable open deep C-type inactivated states (O/I), respectively. The present structures provide an unprecedented view of the selectivity filter backbone in its collapsed deep C-type inactivated conformation, highlighting the close interactions with structural waters and the local allosteric interactions that couple activation and inactivation gating. Together with the structures associated with the closed-inactivated state (C/I) and in the well-known closed conductive state (C/O), this work recapitulates, at atomic resolution, the key conformational changes of a potassium channel pore domain as it progresses along its gating cycle.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>c-type inactivation</kwd><kwd>KcsA</kwd><kwd>kinetic cycle</kwd><kwd>gating</kwd><kwd>crystallography</kwd><kwd>ion channels</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U54 GM087519</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Perozo</surname><given-names>Eduardo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000928</institution-id><institution>Welch Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BI-1757</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cuello</surname><given-names>Luis G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1RO1GM097159-01A1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cuello</surname><given-names>Luis G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>X-ray crystallographic studies have completed the first atomic resolution description of the kinetic cycle of a potassium channel's pore domain.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The simplest description of the gating cycle in the pore domain of a K<sup>+</sup> channel requires at least four distinct kinetic states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ostmeyer et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Panyi and Deutsch, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Yellen, 1998</xref>). At rest, the pore domain’s activation gate formed by the inner helix bundle is closed (C) while the selectivity filter is presumably conductive (O). We define this conformation as the C/O state. When an activating stimulus drives the opening of the channel’s inner helix bundle gate, the selective flow of K<sup>+</sup> can be sustained for hundredths of milliseconds through the open (O/O) state. However, as a consequence of allosteric coupling between the inner gate and the pore helix near the selectivity filter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cuello et al., 2010a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Pan et al., 2011</xref>), opening of the activation gate in many channels leads to a series of structural changes at the selectivity filter that renders it non-conductive (the O/I state), a process known as C-type inactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hoshi et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Liu et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">López-Barneo et al., 1993</xref>). Once the activating stimulus has ceased, the channel’s activation gate returns to the closed conformation and the channel transiently occupies the closed-inactivated (C/I) state with the selectivity filter inactivated. Ultimately, allosteric interactions with the activation gate reset the selectivity filter back to its conductive conformation (C/O), completing the gating cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.28032.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>KcsA’s kinetic cycle and the biochemical strategy to trap of KcsA open gating intermediates.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) pH-dependent macroscopic current recorded from asolectin liposomes containing KcsA <italic>wild type</italic>, surrounded by cartoon representations of the structural equivalents for the gating intermediates. KcsA’s gating cycle comprises at least four distinct kinetic states defined by gating intermediates in which the selectivity filter is conductive (O) or collapsed (I) and the activation gate is open (O) or closed (C). Transitions between these kinetic states define four different gating processes: C/O→O/O, that is, activation; O/O→O/I, that is, C-type inactivation; O/I→C/I, that is, deactivation and C/I→C/O, that is, repriming or recovery from C-type inactivation.

These structures have been suggested to correspond to the putative C/O (high K<sup>+</sup>) and C/I (low K<sup>+</sup>) states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Zhou et al., 2001b</xref>). Previously, it was determined the structures for KcsA in a putatively partially open-inactivated and in its fully-open and deep-inactivated states at modest resolution by crystallizing a constitutively open mutant (KcsA-OM) displaying different degrees of openings at the activation gate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cuello et al., 2010b</xref>). This strategy allowed to propose a set of structural and ion occupancy changes in the selectivity filter associated with KcsA inactivation gating. The observed changes involve an initial constriction of the permeation pathway at G77, between K<sup>+</sup> binding sites S2 and S3 at the selectivity filter. This change is accompanied by a concomitant reduction in ion occupancy in S2 and it was proposed represents an early non-conductive state (I<sup>1</sup>). As the inner helical bundle gate opens further, there is additional narrowing of the selectivity filter at G77, causing the collapse of the permeation pathway and the loss of K<sup>+</sup> at both, S2 and S3 binding sites, which likely represents a deep C-type inactivated state of KcsA or I<sup>2</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cuello et al., 2010b</xref>). The existence of a deep C-type inactivated conformation of KcsA’s selectivity filter (I<sup>2</sup> state) is supported by solution and solid state Nuclear Magnetic Resonance spectroscopy experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ader et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ader et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bhate et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Imai et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Wylie et al., 2014</xref>) and 2DIR measurements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kratochvil et al., 2016</xref>). However, at ~3.2 Å resolution, the original O/I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cuello et al., 2010b</xref>) structure does not provide information on the position of the carbonyl groups responsible for ion coordination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Zhou et al., 2001b</xref>).</p><p>Further analyses of these structures revealed that most of the degradation in overall resolution was likely due to conformational heterogeneity at the activation gate formed by the inner helix bundle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cuello et al., 2010b</xref>). In an attempt to increase the resolution of pore domain states where the inner helix bundle gate is open, a set of cysteine-bridges between adjacent subunits was engineered, using the lower resolution structure of KcsA-OM as a template (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cuello et al., 2010b</xref>). This experimental approach, combined with targeted mutations known to affect the stability of the C-type inactivated conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cordero-Morales et al., 2006</xref>), allowed the structural determination of KcsA in its ‘transient’ open-conductive (O/O, mutant E71A) and deep C-type inactivated (O/I, mutant Y82A) conformations at near atomic resolutions (2.25 Å and 2.4 Å, respectively).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Trapping KcsA with its activation gate in the open conformation</title><p>Using the open-inactivated structure of KcsA (PDB = 3F5W) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cuello et al., 2010b</xref>) as a reference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>), six cysteine pairs were tested between the N-terminal side of the transmembrane segment 1 (TM1) and the C-terminal end of TM2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>) for disulfide-bond formation in SDS gels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). While a number of cysteine pairs were formed under oxidizing conditions, cysteine-pair 28–118 (between adjacent subunits) spontaneously formed a covalently linked tetramer, which presumably has trapped-open KcsA’s activation gate (Locked-open KcsA). This double-cysteine mutant, while displaying similar overall biochemical properties to those of wild type KcsA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>) is also resistant to high temperatures, as indicated by thermal denaturation experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>).

With Rb<sup>+</sup> as charge carrier, open probability increases and the single-channel conductance is reduced (~23 pS) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>).

The backbone carbonyl of Val-76 flips out of the axis of symmetry, obliterating the S2 and S3 K<sup>+</sup> binding sites, as this transition directly affects K<sup>+</sup> coordination by backbone carbonyls at the center of selectivity filter. This seems to represent an insurmountable energetic barrier to ion movement along KcsA-selectivity filter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cuello et al., 2010b</xref>). Interestingly, Val-76 carbonyls can be seen forming hydrogen bonds with newly resolved structural waters behind KcsA’s selectivity filter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>). These appear to be a feature of the collapsed filter conformation and should be considered when analyzing the energetics of C-type inactivation onset and repriming. Moreover, as originally reported at lower resolution (and also observed in the low [K<sup>+</sup>] KcsA structure), the O/I-state pore is collapsed at the Gly-77 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>), where the inter-subunit Cα diameter is reduced from 8 to 6 Å. This change originates from the rotational freedom of Gly-77 α-carbons, and represents an additional steric barrier to the movement of K<sup>+</sup> ions along the selectivity filter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cuello et al., 2010a</xref>).

Wat-1 is in turn hydrogen-bonded to wat-2 and wat-3 and to other chemical groups of the selectivity filter, from bottom to top: Glu-71 carbonyl, Val-76 carbonyl in a neighboring subunit, Gly-77 amide nitrogen, Glu-71 and Asp-80 side chains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Diffusion of ‘inactivating waters’ determines the rate of C-type inactivation gating</title><p>The existence of these inactivating water in KcsA’s deep C-type inactivated state is highlighted by both, the arrangement of hydrogen-bonds formed with the backbone carbonyls in the selectivity filter and their absence in the conductive state of the filter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Zhou et al., 2001b</xref>). Consequently, water access to the inactivation cavity becomes a critical factor controlling the rate and magnitude of this process. In this mechanism, water molecules would diffuse into the inactivation cavity by a conduit formed by the apposition of two neighboring subunits. The entrance to this conduit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c</xref>) is guarded by Tyr-82 (Thr-449 in Shaker). This position, at the external mouth of the filter has been shown to regulate C-type inactivation gating in a variety of K<sup>+</sup> channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cordero-Morales et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">López-Barneo et al., 1993</xref>). For instance, replacing Tyr 82 in KcsA with Alanine accelerates C-type inactivation gating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cordero-Morales et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">López-Barneo et al., 1993</xref>), while in <italic>Shaker</italic> T449Y slows down this process. These experimental observations suggest that this position could work as a gatekeeper, regulating the diffusion of water molecules into the inactivation cavity. Thus, a reduction in the volume and/or hydrophobicity of this amino acid side chain would maximize the diffusion of water molecules into the inactivation cavity, increasing the rate and the magnitude of C-type inactivation. In order to address this possibility, the crystal structure of the closed Y82A mutant was solved at 2.25 Å resolution, PDB = 5 VKH, (R<sub>work</sub> = 0.1749 and R<sub>free</sub> = 0.2037). As expected, a smaller and less hydrophobic amino acid at this position not only creates a septum or a channel that communicates the extracellular milieu and the ‘inactivation cavity’, possibly enhancing the diffusion of water molecules into it, but also allows the solvation of the inactivation cavity entryway, as evidenced by the additional crystallographic water molecules detected at this region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6d</xref>). Interestingly, it has been shown computationally and experimentally that recovery from C-type inactivation is in fact, dependent on the occupancy of this buried waters into the ‘inactivation cavity’ and that as predicted, changing the water activity at the extracellular part of the channel slows down KcsA’s inactivation kinetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ostmeyer et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Finally, the central cavity of the O/I state holds a density, putatively modeled as a K<sup>+</sup> ion, since the crystallization solution contains at least 300 mM KCl.

Further constricting the selectivity filter at Gly 77 causes structural changes that eventually leads to a collapsed, deep C-type inactivated conformation of the filter with the loss of S2 and S3 K<sup>+</sup> coordination sites. This mechanism of C-type inactivation has found support from a variety of spectroscopic and computational studies carried out in KcsA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ader et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ader et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bhate and McDermott, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bhate et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Imai et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ostmeyer et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Wylie et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kratochvil et al., 2016</xref>). However, recent studies based on crystal structures of refolded semisynthetic closed-KcsA containing unnatural amino acids, have suggested that the collapsed structure of the selectivity filter might not represent the deep C-type-inactivated conformation in KcsA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Devaraneni et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>The atomic-resolution crystal structures of KcsA’s O/O and O/I states strongly suggest otherwise, since the well-established non-inactivating E71A mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cordero-Morales et al., 2006</xref>) prevented the collapse of the selectivity filter. This finding indicates that KcsA in the deep C-type inactivated state has a collapsed selectivity filter, as previously suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cuello et al., 2010a</xref>). Additionally, the existence of time dependent-conductance changes in a D-Ala semisynthetic construct cannot be used as evidence against the structural correlation between the collapsed conformation of the filter and the process of KcsA’s inactivation. Not only do these studies vastly underestimate the intrinsic conformational dynamics of the selectivity filter, but recent 2DIR data points towards a more complex conformational landscape for the selectivity filter that might include additional non-conductive conformations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kratochvil et al., 2016</xref>). Indeed, recent computational analyses suggest that the D-Alanine ‘rigidized’ selectivity filter could relax to a partially constricted conformation, with the D-Ala side chains at position 77 occluding the permeation pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Li et al., 2017</xref>). Therefore, it is possible that the 77D-Ala selectivity filter displayed a time-dependent lack of activity due to alternative constricted conformations of KcsA’s filter.</p><p>Furthermore, these experimental results, together with a number of recent reports in KcsA and other channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ader et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ben-Abu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Imai et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Panyi and Deutsch, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Peters et al., 2013</xref>) have demonstrated that the key driving force behind KcsA’s inactivation is an allosteric coupling between their activation gate and the selectivity filter. This strongly suggests that to properly study the structural changes associated with C-type inactivation at the selectivity filter of K<sup>+</sup> channels, a channel must be trapped with its activation gate open, since the structural integrity of a conductive selectivity filter is influenced by a number of parameters, most importantly, the conformation of the activation gate due to their structural coupling. This coupling ultimately will strongly influence the energetics of interaction between permeant ions and the channel’s selectivity filter as well as the pKa of activation and deactivation gating. These observations underlie a novel hysteretic gating behavior in KcsA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Tilegenova et al., 2017</xref>). Additionally, the non-inactivating Locked-open-KcsA-E71A mutant structure is consistent with the collapsed filter hypothesis of C-type inactivation, since the open state displayed a non-collapsed selectivity filter in this inactivation-deficient mutant.</p><p>Recapitulating existing data with the present high-resolution structures, KcsA’s C-type inactivation can be explained by the following minimal mechanistic model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>). Upon activation gating (C/O-to-O/O transition) KcsA’s inner bundle gate opens, expands its diameter to ~22 Å and allowing the diffusion of hydrated K<sup>+</sup> ions into the channel central cavity. Once in the cavity, a K<sup>+</sup> ion sheds off water molecules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>) immediately before entering a selectivity filter that has undergone subtle but distinctive structural changes. The O/O is a transient kinetic state that conducts K<sup>+</sup> ions for hundredths of milliseconds. But a strong allosteric coupling between KcsA’s and the selectivity filter (Phe 103 clashes with I100, Thr 74 and 75 from the signature sequence) deforms the pore helix and as a consequence the selectivity filter undergoes compensatory structural changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Pan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cuello et al., 2010a</xref>). These changes involve (1) flipping of the selectivity filter backbone C = O, which triggers the consecutive loss of the second and third K<sup>+</sup> binding sites as a function of the channel’s activation gate opening and (2) in the absence of the second and third K<sup>+</sup> binding sites the selectivity filter collapses. A KcsA kinetic intermediate that has loss as much as one K<sup>+</sup> binding site at the selectivity filter is considered an inactivated state (I<sub>1</sub>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>), which can dramatically reduce the unitary conductance of the channel(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Morais-Cabral et al., 2001</xref>). This sequence of events underlies C-type inactivation gating in KcsA and likely in other Kv channels (O/O to O/I transition). A network of water molecules that resides in a cavity behind KcsA’s selectivity filter stabilizes its collapsed conformation; diffusion of water molecules into the inactivation cavity determines the rate and magnitude of C-type inactivation. Once the stimulus is terminated, the activation gate closes (O/I to C/I transition) although the selectivity filter remains collapsed for a short period of time, likely defined by the exit rate of water molecules from the inactivation cavity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ostmeyer et al., 2013</xref>). Finally, the selectivity filter resets to the conductive conformation (C/I to C/O transition) completing the KcsA kinetic cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.28032.011</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>A structure-driven kinetic cycle for KcsA gating.</title><p>The simplest KcsA kinetic cycle contains at least four distinct states, closed and prime-to-conduct (C/O), open and conductive (O/O), open and C-type inactivated (O/I) and closed and C-type inactivated (C/I). KcsA resting state (C/O) is best represented by the structure of its closed state in high-potassium concentration (PDB 1K4C). (<bold>a</bold>) Upon proton activation, the channel undergoes conformational changes at its activation gate, increasing its diameter to 22 Å, which allows K<sup>+</sup> ions to flow down their electrochemical gradient for about 200 ms, just before the onset of C-type inactivation. The Locked-open KcsA E71A mutant (PDB 5VK6) likely represents this short-lived open and conductive state (O/O). (<bold>b</bold>) A strong allosteric coupling between KcsA’s activation gate and its filter determines the duration of its O/O state. Opening of the channel activation gate is communicated to the filter by mechanical deformation that propagates along a network of interacting amino-acid residues along the second membrane-spanning segment. Among many, Phe 103 undergoes conformational changes (yellow spheres) that make it clash with Thr 75 on the channel’s pore helix, triggering a series of structural rearrangement at the channel’s filter that yield a pore with two consecutive ion vacancies and collapsed or deep C-type inactivated. The Locked-open KcsA Y82A mutant structure (PDB 5VKE) recapitulates the most important features of KcsA’s O/I state. (<bold>c</bold>) Decreasing intracellular proton concentration triggers KcsA deactivation gating, which involves structural rearrangements that close the channel’s activation gate. For a brief period of time, KcsA exists with a collapsed filter and its activation gate closed. The structural model that best describes KcsA’s C/I state is the closed structure in low K<sup>+</sup> concentration (PDB 1K4D). (<bold>d</bold>) Once the KcsA activation gate is closed, the filter remains collapsed for an undetermined period of time, though computational calculations have suggested that the exit of the ‘inactivating waters’ from the ‘inactivation cavity’ determines the recovery rate of the channel’s filter.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-28032-fig8-v2"/></fig><fig id="fig8s1" position="float" specific-use="child-fig"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.28032.012</object-id><label>Figure 8—figure supplement 1.</label><caption><title>A structural explanation of C-type inactivation gating at the KcsA’s selectivity filter.</title><p>On the left panel, a cartoon representation showing the structural transition of KcsA’s selectivity filter once its activation gate is open. The right panel (top) shows a crystallographic view of KcsA’ selectivity filter in the conductive conformation (O/O) and the bottom panel in a deep C-type inactivated conformation (O/I). In between, two different inactivated states occur: I<sub>1</sub> (an early-inactivated state) and I<sub>2</sub> (a deep-inactivated state), which have been inferred from crystal structures of kinetic intermediates represented by KcsA’s partially-open structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cuello et al., 2010b</xref>). The onset of C-type inactivation is marked by the narrowing of the permeation pathway at Gly77, which is triggered by a strong allosteric coupling between KcsA’s selectivity filter and its activation gate (dashed red line). KcsA’s activation gate opening perturbs the conformational stability of the conductive selectivity filter by a conformation wave of mechanical deformation that travels along the channel inner helix (activation gate→selectivity filter)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cuello et al., 2010a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Pan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Panyi and Deutsch, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Zhuo et al., 2016</xref>). For channels on the left side, with ions at positions 2 and 4, an initial narrowing of the permeation pathway at G77 leads to the loss of the K<sup>+</sup> at position 2. Further narrowing of the permeation pathway yields the deep C-type inactivated state (I<sub>2</sub>) in which the carbonyl at Val76 adopt a flip conformation with an ion bound at position 4. Channels on the right side, which have K<sup>+</sup> at positions 1 and 3 would stay conductive during an early narrowing at G77, albeit with lower single-channel conductance, yet additional constricting at that position causes the exit of the K<sup>+</sup> at position 3, yielding the deep C-type inactivated state I<sub>2</sub> with an ion present at position 1.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-28032-fig8-figsupp1-v2"/></fig></fig-group><p>Trapping KcsA in its open conformation has allowed the development of an atomic description of its O/O and O/I kinetic states.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom, Kenton J Swartz (Reviewer #2), is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Richard Aldrich as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Roderick MacKinnon (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript addresses conformational states that underlie gating in the KcsA K<sup>+</sup> channel. This channel opens transiently following steps in pH from 8 to 3 and then inactivates (some would say desensitizes) partly. Activation is associated with opening of an inner helix gate and inactivation as shown here seems associated with conformational changes at the selectivity filter. This conclusion is supported by demonstration that KcsA with a trapped open inner helix gate (using disulfide bridges) still gates. Mutations near the selectivity filter that increase or decrease inactivation favor different conformations in the setting of the trapped open inner helix gate. The same lab determined similar structures at an earlier date but these are at higher resolution. The higher resolution was achieved through the disulfide bridges, which limited heterogeneity. This study makes a compelling case for two distinct gates in KcsA that are both important for gating in KcsA. The following are requested revisions for improving the manuscript.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Unless we are mistaken, the functional characterization of the Y82A and E71A mutants was not done in the background of the disulfide bonded OM. This is not trivial to do because presumably these constructs would not be responsive to low pH because the lower pH controlled gate is locked open. However, it would be nice to know that they are not responsive to low pH and then to see single channel recording similar to those in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C, D</xref> that are provided for the OM alone. It would be nice to see that the E71A-OM has a high Po and that the Y82A-OM has a low Po, etc. Also, the functional data that are provided for E71A and Y82A in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> and the OM in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C, D</xref> are all single observations and the authors should provide population data.</p><p>2) In subsection “Trapping KcsA with its activation gate in the open conformation” of the manuscript, the authors refer to thermal denaturation experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, but no wild-type KcsA control is presented in the ms nor is a result for WT KcsA cited from the literature; this should be addressed. It's probably also worth noting in the text that the 28-118 disulfide bond is formed between residues in adjacent KcsA subunits. The authors should therefore note whether the sample buffer in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> contained DTT and/or β-mercaptoethanol, or if reducing agents were present during heating of the sample (no experimental details are provided).</p><p>3) We are skeptical about the discussion of B factors (subsection “Atomic resolution structure of KcsA open and conductive” paragraph three). How did the B factors compare in the 2 structures outside the selectivity filter? More importantly, one structure has a mutation in a residue surrounding the filter (E71A) and the other does not. Because such a mutation could affect the filter, we would hesitate to give too much interpretation to their B factor differences. Moreover, it's probably not appropriate to directly compare B-factors from at two different resolutions (2.0 Å for the 1K4C structure, 2.25 Å for the 5VK6 structure), in which the structures may have been refined using different parameterization. In addition, the B-factors plotted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> appear to include those of both main chain and side chain atoms. Because B-factors for side chain atoms may be less well-defined and more subject to bias than main chain atoms, it would likely be more useful to limit the comparison to main chain atoms only. To further minimize bias in the comparisons, both data sets would need to be truncated to the same resolution (and probably same redundancy) and then re-refined, and then the authors will need to provide a strong rationale for the statistical distribution of the B-factors and provide some error estimates of these values to justify their argument. In some previous work, investigators have justified using a normalization of the B-factors, so this may be a valid approach.</p><p>4) The authors state that water exchange is a key determinant in the rate and magnitude of inactivation. This could be true but the evidence is not very strong. Does changing the activity of bulk water alter inactivation, as one would predict on the basis of this assertion? The authors should provide additional experimental support for this conclusion.</p><p>5) Subsection “Atomic resolution structure of KcsA open and deep C-type inactivated” and further in the Discussion: historically, the name C-type inactivation was given to the process of inactivation in Shaker K channels following removal of the N-terminal inactivation peptide. How do we know that the process of inactivation in KcsA (or desensitization following opening after a pH step) is the same as inactivation following voltage dependent gate opening in Shaker? We think it would be fine to motivate this work with previous studies on C-type inactivation in Shaker or other K channels, but at the end of the day this body of work is about KcsA and the authors should restrict their implications on mechanism to that protein and be more circumspect throughout.</p><p>6) Related to point 3, the discussion contained a large section opposing another study of inactivation based on D-alanine mutations that would seem to prevent the inactivated conformational change observed here. The authors state in the Discussion: &quot;Indeed, recent computational analyses of a D-Alanine &quot;rigidized&quot; selectivity filter demonstrated that the selectivity filter is able to relax to a partially constricted conformation, with the D-Ala side chains at position 77 occluding the permeation pathway (Li et al., 2017). Therefore, the 77D-Ala substitution does not lead to a rigid selectivity filter, and crucially, does not preclude the transition to a constricted conformation for the selectivity filter.&quot; This argument supposes the correctness or accuracy of the computational studies. Perhaps more importantly, don't you think it is possible that inactivation in the selectivity filter, or its inability to conduct, might be associated with a number of different filter conformations (i.e. not all inactivated filters/states look the same)?</p><p>7) What is the distinction between a C-type inactivated state and a deep C-type inactivated state? Please explain the difference.</p><p>8) Subsection “Atomic resolution structure of KcsA open and deep C-type inactivated”: &quot;Crystals of the O/I-state diffracted ~ 2.4 A with good refinement statistics, R<sub>work</sub> = 0.1948 and R<sub>free</sub> = 0.2267 and its structure was solved by molecular replacement…&quot; Crystals do not diffract with good or bad refinement statistics. You mean the model exhibited those residuals when compared to the data. In addition, the crystallographic data table (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">table 1</xref>) is incomplete. The mean R<sub>merge</sub> values for each data set are conspicuously high. Many investigators have switched to R<sub>pim</sub> or CC1/2 as an indicator of overall data quality, but these are not provided. In addition, the value of i/sigma appears to only correspond to the high-resolution shell, and the overall i/sigma is not provided. Finally, the redundancy appears to only correspond to overall redundancy, and not high-resolution shell. Without a completed data table, it is difficult for the reader to independently evaluate the X-ray data quality or make comparisons among the data sets analyzed in this manuscript. For the refinement statistics, the authors list the &quot;Wilson B-factor&quot;, which is estimated from the experimental data. The authors should instead provide the mean b-factors for atoms in each model; these are usually provided separately for the protein, water, and ligand atoms.</p><p>9) In the Discussion, the authors summarize their findings as if they have completed a mathematical proof: &quot;Taking together existing data with the present high resolution structures we can recapitulate the process of C-type inactivation in the framework of a mechanistic model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>)&quot;. Would it not be better to say, “on the basis of data presented we propose the following…” After all, we all know how tricky it can be to figure out what is really happening in these molecules!</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.28032.016</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Unless we are mistaken, the functional characterization of the Y82A and E71A mutants was not done in the background of the disulfide bonded OM.

Originally, we considered that sampling the behavior of the pH-activated channel would provide a close sampling of the gating transitions at the selectivity filter in either of the mutants. And while we still stand by that assessment, we do agree that formally, these electrophysiological measurements should be carried out on disulfide-cross-linked OM backgrounds (even if it is more difficult). Single channel traces are now shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref> depicting overall Open Probability behavior for the population active in the patch (NPo). As expected, when the inner bundle gate is crosslinked, single channel activity becomes pH independent, and solely defined by the mutation at the selectivity filter/pore helix.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) In subsection “Trapping KcsA with its activation gate in the open conformation” of the manuscript, the authors refer to thermal denaturation experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, but no wild-type KcsA control is presented in the ms nor is a result for WT KcsA cited from the literature; this should be addressed.

Formally, an approach to compare Debye-Weller B temperature factors in structures of different resolutions (and hence B factors) has been to artificially increase the overall values of the highest resolution structure. However, these comparisons are always limited by the worst-resolution data of the pair. Alternative, one could subtract the average B factor for a common stretch of residues in each case and compare, not the actual B factor values, but its variance (see Cordero-Morales et al., 2006). We have indeed followed the reviewer’s suggestions and carried out a de novo solution of wild-type KcsA, refined in house with the same parameters used during the refinement of the Locked-open E71A, at equivalent resolutions. This dataset was then used to redo the B-Factor analysis, but now with the normalized B-factors of the α carbons of amino acids of the selectivity filter. This newly generated comparison, between closed and open KcsA is shown in a new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The authors state that water exchange is a key determinant in the rate and magnitude of inactivation. This could be true but the evidence is not very strong. Does changing the activity of bulk water alter inactivation, as one would predict on the basis of this assertion? The authors should provide additional experimental support for this conclusion.</p></disp-quote><p>We have already carried out an earlier set of experiments to test this issue experimentally (in addition to extensive molecular dynamics simulations) see Ostmeyer et al., 2013. In this publication, we showed that reducing the occupancy of the buried water molecules at the filter (by imposing a high osmotic stress) accelerates the rate of recovery, as measured from the recovery rate of inactivation in the presence of a high concentration osmolyte solution (2M sucrose). The experiment provides strong, and direct experimental evidence supporting the hypothesis that water access to cavities behind the selectivity filter is a key driver of the kinetics on inactivation and inactivation repriming in KcsA. See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4 B and C</xref> from Ostmeyer et al.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Subsection “Atomic resolution structure of KcsA open and deep C-type inactivated” and further in the Discussion: historically, the name C-type inactivation was given to the process of inactivation in Shaker K channels following removal of the N-terminal inactivation peptide. How do we know that the process of inactivation in KcsA (or desensitization following opening after a pH step) is the same as inactivation following voltage dependent gate opening in Shaker? We think it would be fine to motivate this work with previous studies on C-type inactivation in Shaker or other K channels, but at the end of the day this body of work is about KcsA and the authors should restrict their implications on mechanism to that protein and be more circumspect throughout.</p></disp-quote><p>We have to disagree with this assessment. First of all, others and we have demonstrated that the time-dependent reduction in open probability observed in KcsA is not due to a “desensitization” process, which would somehow affect the pH-dependence of the channel but to the existence of a second gate at KcsA’s selectivity filter (an inactivation gate). This is not a controversial point (see Cordero-Morales et al., 2006).</p><p>However, regarding nomenclature, perhaps this is an issue of semantics: while it is indeed correct that C-type inactivation was detected (and defined) in voltage dependent K<sup>+</sup> channels as the time dependent reduction in ion current still present in the absence of fast N-type inactivation, there is ample evidence over the past 20+ years that point to the functional equivalence between the KcsA inactivation gating and that seen in voltage dependent K<sup>+</sup> channels. The details differ, of course, but there are many common observations that strongly suggest, at the very least, a “kinship” between these evolutionarily related channels:</p><p>– Inactivation in KcsA displays the same kinetic relations (transition into and out of C-type inactivated state under a two-pulse protocol);</p><p>– Same external dependence of inactivation kinetics on external K<sup>+</sup> concentrations;</p><p>– Same behavior with conductive and non-conductive ions: Rb<sup>+</sup>, plus Tl<sup>+</sup>, NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> Cs<sup>+</sup> (unpublished);</p><p>– Equivalent mutations that enhance C-type inactivation in eukaryotes do lock in the pinched filter conformation in KcsA;</p><p>– Mutations that inhibit C-type inactivation in eukaryotes lead to conductive filter conformations in KcsA.</p><p>We argue that the mechanism of inactivation in KcsA is at least related to those present in more complex eukaryotic channels. We all look for commonalities among evolutionarily related systems, but the jury is definitely out on whether there will be a “standard” C-type inactivation mechanism or different “classes” of it, depending on the pore domain. Our work points to the initiation of inactivation in KcsA as the loss of a potassium ion at the second binding site, accompanied by changes in pore diameter neat Glycine 77. This would lead to increase in the energy barrier for K<sup>+</sup> translocation between biding sites. Still, there might be other ways to add a (relatively) subtle energy barrier to inhibit K<sup>+</sup> flow, so that in some instances the Kv channel’s filter might not need to adopt the same pinched conformation to inactivate (as might be the case in the I1 conformation of KcsA). Ultimately, the observation of a similarly pinched filter in a eukaryotic pore domain (something that so far has not been observed) might help settle the score toward a “common mechanism”. Consequently, we have “toned down” the direct equivalence between eukaryotic C-type inactivation and KcsA inactivation and addressed the present results and interpretation within the context of the KcsA results and mechanism.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Related to point 3, the discussion contained a large section opposing another study of inactivation based on D-alanine mutations that would seem to prevent the inactivated conformational change observed here. The authors state in the Discussion: &quot;Indeed, recent computational analyses of a D-Alanine &quot;rigidized&quot; selectivity filter demonstrated that the selectivity filter is able to relax to a partially constricted conformation, with the D-Ala side chains at position 77 occluding the permeation pathway (Li et al., 2017). Therefore, the 77D-Ala substitution does not lead to a rigid selectivity filter, and crucially, does not preclude the transition to a constricted conformation for the selectivity filter.&quot; This argument supposes the correctness or accuracy of the computational studies. Perhaps more importantly, don't you think it is possible that inactivation in the selectivity filter, or its inability to conduct, might be associated with a number of different filter conformations (i.e. not all inactivated filters/states look the same)?</p></disp-quote><p>The argument is clearly supported by the computational calculations, but it is not necessarily dependent on their accuracy. We make the case that simply, the complexity of behavior of the unnatural substitutions at the selectivity filter makes it impossible to univocally conclude that “the constricted conformation of the selectivity filter is not the C-type inactivated state” even when some reduction in open probability is observed in the presumably rigid D-Ala mutation.</p><p>We buttress our argument, not only with solid computational work (allowing molecular explorations that are very difficult to evaluate experimentally), but also from recent 2D infrared experiments done by us (and in collaboration with, among others, F Valiyaveetil). In this work, we provide extensive evidence for the complexity of conformations (as coupled vibrational modes) at the selectivity filter and its dependence on the state of the intracellular gate (see, Kratochvil HT et al. JACS 139(26):8837-8845 (2017)). Our findings indicate that changes in the intracellular gate are linked to changes in the selectivity filter conformational heterogeneity that are distinct to those triggered by K<sup>+</sup> depletion. The existence of previously undetected conformational subensembles appear to underlie changes in ion affinity at the selectivity filter and suggest that this complexity does not disappear (just changes) in the presence of unnatural amino acids. More recent computational work (Li et al., now in press) provides strong evidence for an alternative pinched state (nonconductive) in the D-Ala KcsA mutant. We have reworked this section to provide a more inclusive set of interpretations to the inactivation process when D-Ala is part of the selectivity filter.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) What is the distinction between a C-type inactivated state and a deep C-type inactivated state? Please explain the difference.</p></disp-quote><p>We defined the deep C-type inactivated state as that reached after steady state once the inner bundle gate opens (t →∞). With this definition, we can have a better equivalent to the determined crystal structures, while making a distinction with other (presumably non-conductive) states observed when the inner bundle gate is not fully open (see Cuello et al., 2010).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Subsection “Atomic resolution structure of KcsA open and deep C-type inactivated”: &quot;Crystals of the O/I-state diffracted ~ 2.4 A with good refinement statistics, R<sub>work</sub> = 0.1948 and R<sub>free</sub> = 0.2267 and its structure was solved by molecular replacement…&quot; Crystals do not diffract with good or bad refinement statistics.
