However, most patients develop resistance and progress on therapy, highlighting the need to discover strategies that increase mTOR inhibitor effectiveness. We developed ER+ BC cell lines, sensitive or resistant to everolimus, and discovered that combination treatment of ONC201/TIC10 with everolimus inhibited cell growth in 2D/3D in vitro studies. We confirmed increased therapeutic response in primary patient cells progressing on everolimus, supporting clinical relevance. We show that ONC201/TIC10 mechanism in metastatic ER+ BC cells involves oxidative phosphorylation inhibition and stress response activation. Transcriptomic analysis in everolimus resistant breast patient tumors and mitochondrial functional assays in resistant cell lines demonstrated increased mitochondrial respiration dependency, contributing to ONC201/TIC10 sensitivity. We propose that ONC201/TIC10 and modulation of mitochondrial function may provide an effective add-on therapy strategy for patients with metastatic ER+ BCs resistant to mTOR inhibitors.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Breast cancer is one of the most frequently diagnosed cancers globally, particularly among women. The most common type of breast cancer expresses a receptor for the hormone estrogen. Many treatments block the activity of estrogen and therefore slow or block the development and spread of this type of breast cancer.</p><p>For patients with advanced breast cancer, hormone-blocking treatments work best in combination with other drugs, including one called everolimus. However, in many patients the cancer cells become resistant to these therapies, leading to disease progression and decreased survival.</p><p>To explore treatment strategies that could enhance the effectiveness of existing therapies for breast cancer, Farmaki et al. studied how cancer cells which had become resistant to everolimus responded when treated with an experimental drug called ONC201/TIC10.</p><p>A combination of everolimus and ONC201/TIC10 inhibited growth of resistant cancer cells that had been grown in a three-dimensional arrangement to mimic human tumors. Moreover, the drug combination effectively targeted breast cancer cells collected from patients whose cancer had progressed while being treated with everolimus, suggesting that ONC201/TIC10 could be relevant in a clinical setting. Finally, molecular and biochemical experiments revealed that the drug ONC201/TIC10 works by disrupting the pathways that everolimus-resistant cancer cells use to generate the energy required to grow and proliferate.</p><p>Taken together these findings suggest that ONC201/TIC10 may provide an effective add-on therapy for patients with certain types of advanced breast cancer that are no longer responding to everolimus. Before this becomes a reality for patients, however, there will have to be more experimental testing of ONC201/TIC10 to determine optimal dosing and timing strategy for future clinical trials.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>breast cancer</kwd><kwd>drug resistance</kwd><kwd>everolimus</kwd><kwd>ONC201/TIC10</kwd><kwd>mitochondria</kwd><kwd>stress response</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U01CA264620</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bild</surname><given-names>Andrea H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U54CA209978</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bild</surname><given-names>Andrea H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Experimental and clinical models identify an effective add-on therapy for drug resistant estrogen receptor positive advanced breast cancer.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Breast cancer (BC) is a fatal disease with 287,850 new cases in 2022 in the United States and an estimated mortality rate of 43,250 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://seer.cancer.gov/statfacts/html/breast.html">https://seer.cancer.gov/statfacts/html/breast.html</ext-link>).

ONC201/TIC10 has been shown to synergize with everolimus in prostate cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lev et al., 2018</xref>). Furthermore, colorectal cancer cells were more sensitive to the combination of ONC201/TIC10 with mTOR inhibitor AZD-8055 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jin et al., 2016</xref>). While the effectiveness of the combination of everolimus with ONC201/TIC10 has not been studied in BC, upregulation of mitochondrial ClpP that is a target of ONC201/TIC10 has been reported both in BC cells and tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cormio et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Luo et al., 2020</xref>). In addition, ONC201/TIC10 inhibits mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation in BC cells, causing depletion of cellular ATP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dwucet et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Greer et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ishida et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pruss et al., 2020</xref>). Increased dependency on oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) has been shown in chemotherapy resistant triple negative BC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Evans et al., 2021</xref>). Therefore, targeting ClpP and mitochondrial metabolism could constitute a valid approach for increasing the efficacy of everolimus.</p><p>The aim of our study was to explore treatment strategies that can enhance the anti-tumor activity of standard of care therapy by targeting common resistant states specific to ER+ mBC. For our study, we developed in vitro models of acquired everolimus resistance for paired ER+ BC cell lines that are either sensitive or resistant to everolimus, and viable primary patient ER+ BC cells with known response to everolimus therapy. We used these models to identify therapies effective in everolimus resistant cancer cells and found that the small molecule ONC201/TIC10 can inhibit the proliferation of resistant cells by disrupting mitochondrial function and metabolism. RNA-sequencing analysis in ER+ mBC tumors non-responsive to everolimus and mitochondrial functional assays in resistant cell lines demonstrated increased dependency on mitochondrial respiration, further supporting the sensitivity to ONC201/TIC10. Thus, we demonstrate that ONC201/TIC10 enhances the durability of everolimus in resistant ER+ BC cell lines as well as primary cells from patients progressing on everolimus.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>ONC201/TIC10 inhibits the proliferation of BC cell lines sensitive and resistant to everolimus</title><p>Everolimus resistant cell lines were generated by long-term culture of parental cell lines in the continuous presence of 100 nM everolimus for MCF7 and T47D or 50 nM everolimus for CAMA-1 for 6–12 months (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">McDermott et al., 2014</xref>).

Specifically, we investigated if combination of everolimus with ONC201/TIC10 is effective for resistant BC cells and could provide a promising treatment strategy.

Combination therapy with ONC201/TIC10 and everolimus showed increased growth inhibition in everolimus resistant BC cell lines as well as resistant patient tumor cells in 2D and 3D studies. In the 2D culture setting, ONC201/TIC10 was effective both as single agent and in combination with everolimus with similar potency in sensitive and resistant cells. In the 3D setting however, ONC201/TIC10 in combination with everolimus had a robust effect on growth inhibition in both resistant and sensitive cells, compared to ONC201/TIC10 single agent that had a minor effect. Differences in drug potency between the 2D and 3D cultures have been previously reported for BC cells and are associated with lower proliferation, increased apoptosis, microenvironmental conditions like hypoxia and reduced nutrients and altered signaling in the 3D setting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Burdett et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hamilton, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lovitt et al., 2015</xref>). These differences highlight the importance of utilizing more than one experimental model based on the hypotheses that are being addressed and given the limitations of each. Consistent with the resistant cell lines, the combination therapy had increased anti-proliferative activity in the resistant patient-derived spheroids. Collectively, these results recapitulate the increased sensitivity to the combination therapy and further support clinical relevance.</p><p>Mechanistically, ONC201/TIC10 has been shown to directly activate ClpP, through various genetic and biochemical studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Greer et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jacques et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Graves et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ishizawa et al., 2019</xref>). In BC, silencing of ClpP using siRNA or CRISPR/Cas9 System confirmed the ClpP-dependent effects of ONC201/TIC10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Graves et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Greer et al., 2022</xref>). Based on these established findings, we detail the specific pathway components driving the therapeutic response of ONC201/TIC10 in everolimus sensitive and resistant cells. We show that ONC201/TIC10 causes mitochondrial dysfunction, which is consistent with previous findings for BC cells, including suppression of mitochondrial proteins, decreased OXPHOS and activation of stress response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Greer et al., 2018</xref>). We observed this effect not only in the sensitive cells but also in everolimus resistant cells, which supports the similarity in potency of ONC201/TIC10 single agent in everolimus sensitive and resistant cells in 2D assays. Importantly, data from RNA-sequencing in everolimus resistant patient tumors and from mitochondrial functional assays in resistant cell lines demonstrated increased dependency on mitochondrial respiration supporting the sensitivity to ONC201/TIC10. Therefore, ONC201/TIC10 could be a suitable candidate for the treatment of everolimus resistant tumors that depend on mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation activity for sustained growth and proliferation.</p><p>Combination of ONC201/TIC10 with everolimus maintained the same level of mitochondrial and OXPHOS protein suppression as ONC201/TIC10 single agent. However, the activation of ISR after combination treatment was maintained only in the everolimus resistant cells and not the sensitive. This result suggests that in the sensitive cells, everolimus alleviates endoplasmic reticulum stress through the activation of different cell death mechanisms. Together these findings support the increased sensitivity of the combination in everolimus resistant cells and suggest as a mechanism of anti-proliferative activity the disruption of mitochondria and activation of stress response. Furthermore, western blot analysis and gene expression data confirm that the observed activity of ONC201/TIC10 is via induction of mitochondrial stress rather than ERK/AKT inactivation. Increased gene expression and protein levels of pro-apoptotic transcription factors CHOP and ATF4 have been reported for ONC201/TIC10 treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Greer et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ishizawa et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kline et al., 2016</xref>). Indeed, CHOP has been shown to induce apoptosis through the regulation of different anti- and pro-apoptotic genes, including genes encoding the Bcl-2 family proteins, GADD34, endoplasmic reticulum oxidoreductin 1 (ERO1α), Tribbles-related protein 3 (TRB3), and DOC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Szegezdi et al., 2006</xref>). In addition, CHOP can downregulate the expressions of Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Mcl-1, and upregulate the expression of BIM, causing increased BAK and BAX expression. Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Mcl-1 have been shown to be downregulated by imipridones and ONC201/TIC10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Al Madhoun et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rumman et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Staley et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>ATF4 can promote apoptosis either through regulating CHOP or independent of CHOP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wortel et al., 2017</xref>).

ONC201/TIC10 caused apoptosis through ATF4 in lymphoma and leukemia cells and inhibited mTORC1 signaling through the upregulation of ATF4 and DDIT4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ishizawa et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wang and Dougan, 2019</xref>).</p><p>Our results show that ISR was not activated upon combination treatment with ONC201/TIC10 and everolimus in sensitive cells, suggesting that sensitivity to everolimus in these cells can result in the activation of cell death mechanisms bypassing ISR. In line with this assumption, mTOR inhibitors are known to induce apoptosis through decreasing expression levels of various anti-apoptotic proteins, including Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Mcl-1, and survivin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Du et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mills et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wangpaichitr et al., 2008</xref>). Other mechanisms of ONC201/TIC10 anti-proliferative activity in the everolimus resistant cells might include the involvement of c-Myc. High levels of c-Myc have been shown to be a predictive factor for growth inhibition and apoptosis by imipridones in glioblastoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ishida et al., 2018</xref>). In addition, the role of the Myc gene in promoting mTOR inhibitor resistance has been described in ER+ BC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bihani et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, we used preclinical and clinical models to characterize sensitivity to mTOR inhibition. Combining experimental and clinical patient-derived data with resistant cell line driven experiments, our study provides validated findings that are consistent across different contexts, thereby strengthening the potential for clinical applications of ONC201/TIC10. Collectively, our findings suggest that ONC201/TIC10 could be used as an add-on treatment after mTOR therapy progression. Based on the initial preclinical and clinical testing of ONC201/TIC10 that demonstrated benefit with a benign clinical profile, ONC201/TIC10 is being further evaluated as single agent or in combination with other cancer therapies for various tumor types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Prabhu et al., 2020</xref>). Combination of ONC201/TIC10 with everolimus has been tested in an in vivo prostate model and was well tolerated, with no additional toxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lev et al., 2018</xref>). Further in vitro as well as in vivo testing of this combination would be necessary to determine the optimal dosing and timing strategy for future clinical trials.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell line (<italic>Homo-sapiens</italic>) female</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">CAMA-1 Breast; Mammary gland: adenocarcinoma</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">ATCC</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">HTB-21</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell line (<italic>Homo-sapiens</italic>) female</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">MCF7 Breast; Mammary gland: adenocarcinoma epithelial cell</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">ATCC</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">HTB-22</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell line (<italic>Homo-sapiens</italic>) female</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">T47D Breast; Mammary gland: carcinoma ductal epithelial cell</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">ATCC</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">HTB-133</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell line (<italic>Homo-sapiens</italic>) female</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Primary, P1, P2, P3, P4, P5</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">This paper.

Cells were plated in XF96 Cell Culture Microplate (Agilent Technologies Inc) coated with Cell-Tak adhesive (Corning) at a density of 15,000 cells per well. Six hours later cells were treated with drugs as indicated for 18 hr. Before running the assay, cell culture media were replaced with Seahorse XF assay media supplemented with 10 mM XF Glucose, 1 mM XF Pyruvate and 2 mM XF L-Glutamine and the plate was incubated in a 37°C incubator without CO<sub>2</sub> for 1 hr. The OCR was measured by XFe96 extracellular flux analyzer (Agilent Technologies) with sequential injection of 1.5 μM oligomycin A, 1 μM Carbonyl cyanide 4-(trifluoromethoxy)phenylhydrazone (FCCP), and 0.5 μM rotenone/antimycin A. For normalization, imaging was performed using Cytation 5 imager (Biotek Instruments) gathering signal intensity from brightfield, YFP (for Venus fluorescence) and Texas Red (for mCherry fluorescence) channels. Raw data processing and image analysis were performed using Gen5 3.05 software. Briefly, Gen5 3.05 software detected and generated cell counts and fluorescence intensity measurements respective for each cell line within each well. Data analysis was performed using Seahorse Wave Desktop Software 2.6. OCR was normalized to cell number. Experiments were performed trice in triplicates and representative results are shown.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Gene expression data and pre-processing</title><p>Microarray expression data from a neoadjuvant clinical trial of ER+ BC patients on everolimus were retrieved from NCBI GEO (accession number <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE119262">GSE119262</ext-link>).

Single sample gene set enrichment scores were calculated from the normalized microarray (GSE119262) or RNA-seq (GSE212369) gene expression matrices using the R package GSVA (kcdf = ‘Gaussian’, method = ‘ssgsea’). To identify pathway signatures that change in response to everolimus treatment, we analyzed the ssGSEA scores of the 21 pairs of samples from patients with gene expression data collected before and after treatment. We split the samples into responsive and non-responsive groups and identified the pathways with significant difference in mean ssGSEA scores between pre- and post-treatment groups using a paired <italic>t</italic>-test. We investigated the changes in pathway signatures in response to ONC201/TIC10 treatment using gene expression data from MDA-MB-231 cells treated with ONC201/TIC10 data collected at 0, 3-, 6-, 12-, and 24-hr time points. We obtained ssGSEA scores for the pathway signatures at each time point and fit a generalized linear model (gaussian family) for each pathway signature against time. After obtaining nominal p-values of the fit for all signatures, we calculated false discovery rates to identify signatures that changed significantly over time.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Dose–response curves were generated using GraphPad Prism 9.3.1 software and statistical comparisons were performed using one-way analysis of variance.

A different antibody was used for pFoxO3a (phospho-FoxO3a/Ser294 Antibody Cat#5538, RRID:AB_10696878, Cell Signaling) and TRAIL (TRAIL Monoclonal Antibody, 55B709.3 Cat# MA1-41027; RRID:AB_1087999, Thermo Fisher Scientific) (Figure 4—figure supplement 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8.

We reconducted the Western blot experiments for TUFM, TFAM, BiP, ATF4, CHOP, and β-actin for all 6 cell lines and treatments for Figure 4A and 4B, as well as the experiments for pAKT, AKT, pERK, ERK, pFoxO3a, FoxO3a, pS6, S6, TRAIL and β-actin for all 6 cell lines and treatments for Figure 4—figure supplement 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1. It would be nice to see whether you can abrogate the effects of the combination with siRNA against ClpP. That would strengthen the mechanistic point you make.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. It has been previously reported in breast cancer that the mechanism of ONC201/TIC10 action involves binding and activation of ClpP through multiple silencing experiments (Graves et al., 2019; Greer et al., 2022) Our study is unique in the discovery that this therapy is effective in advanced ER+ breast cancer cells resistant to everolimus, a common standard of care drug used in this patient population. We show that ONC201/TIC10 has an increased therapeutic response in everolimus resistant cells compared to cancer cells sensitive to this therapy and detail the specific pathway components driving this response. Our study is the first to describe that ONC201/TIC10 could be used as an add-on treatment after mTOR therapy progression.</p><p>We also show that ONC201/TIC10 causes enhanced mitochondrial dysfunction, including suppression of mitochondrial proteins, oxidative phosphorylation inhibition and activation of stress response in everolimus resistant cells. In addition to the prior publication of the proposed knockdown studies (Greer et al., 2022; Jacques et al., 2020; Graves et al., 2019; Ishizawa et al. 2019), the siRNA knockdown methodology has limitations in our model system based on the duration of the siRNA-induced knockdown, as the 3-diminsional assays are measured over 3-4 weeks, and a transient effect from siRNA may not be sufficient over the duration of the experiment.</p><p>We have amended the manuscript to reference the previously established findings which describe how knockdown of ClpP abrogates the biological effects of ONC201/TIC10 (Discussion line 251, and references listed). We thank the reviewer for this suggestion, as it strengthens the link between drug and mechanism.</p><p>Lastly, for everolimus, the mechanism of action is well-known (Faivre et al., 2006; Law et al., 2006; Mita et al., 2003). Everolimus binds to the immunophilin FK Binding Protein-12 (FKBP-12) to generate a complex that inhibits the activation of the mammalian Target of Rapamycin (mTOR), a key regulatory kinase. As everolimus, an mTOR inhibitor, does not target ClpP (but targets mTOR signaling), the ClpP knockdown is not relevant for this drug’s mechanism. We have included this information in the manuscript for clarity.</p><p>Introduction section, line 34</p><p>“Everolimus, an analog of rapamycin, binds to the immunophilin FK Binding Protein-12 (FKBP-12) to generate a complex that inhibits the activation of mTOR, a key regulatory kinase (Faivre et al., 2006; Law et al., 2006; Mita et al., 2003).”</p><p>Discussion section, line 251</p><p>“Mechanistically, ONC201/TIC10 has been shown to directly activate ClpP, through various genetic and biochemical studies (Greer et al., 2022; Jacques et al., 2020; Graves et al., 2019; Ishizawa et al. 2019). In breast cancer, silencing of ClpP using siRNA or CRISPR/Cas9 System confirmed the ClpP-dependent effects of ONC201/TIC10 (Graves et al., 2019; Greer et al., 2022). Based on these established findings, we detail the specific pathway components driving the therapeutic response of ONC201/TIC10 in everolimus sensitive and resistant cells.”</p><p>References added:</p><p>Faivre, S., Kroemer, G., and Raymond, E.
