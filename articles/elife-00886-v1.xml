We found that the midgut shows striking regional differentiation along its anterior-posterior axis. At least ten distinct subregions differ in cell morphology, physiology and the expression of hundreds of genes with likely tissue functions. Stem cells also vary regionally in behavior and gene expression, suggesting that they contribute to midgut sub-specialization. Clonal analyses showed that stem cells generate progeny located outside their own subregion at only one of six borders tested, suggesting that midgut subregions resemble cellular compartments involved in tissue development. Tumors generated by disrupting Notch signaling arose preferentially in three subregions and tumor cells also appeared to respect regional borders. Thus, apparently similar intestinal stem cells differ regionally in cell production, gene expression and in the ability to spawn tumors.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00886.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00886.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00886.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Many cells in the body accumulate wear and tear over time, and a fraction of them are always nearing the end of their lives. However, in some tissues there are stem cells that can divide into daughter cells which then differentiate and replace the damaged cells. Unlike embryonic stem cells, these ‘adult tissue stem cells’ normally differentiate into only a few related cell types, but their ability to produce replacement cells keeps the tissue functioning normally. Here, Marianes and Spradling have investigated a type of adult stem cell, known as intestinal stem cells, that resides in the midgut of fruit flies.</p><p>The midgut is the major site of digestion in fruit flies, and functions much like the small intestine in mammals. This tissue is a long tube that is lined with two types of cells: digestive cells and hormone-producing cells. These cell types are maintained by thousands of apparently similar intestinal stem cells, and it has long been thought that the stem cells give rise to cells throughout the midgut by responding to the same set of signals. However, certain digestive processes—such as the breakdown or uptake of particular nutrients—are known to occur only in a specific portion of the intestine. For example, in fruit flies, a region in the middle of the intestine is acidified, and may act like an extra stomach. And in both fruit flies and mammals, iron is taken up mostly in the area of the gut just after the stomach. These regional differences in function have led to uncertainty over how midgut cells both arise and are replaced.</p><p>Marianes and Spradling now show, based on a detailed study of tissue cells and stem cells, that the midgut contains at least ten subregions that occur in a specific order. The cells in these subregions have distinct features, including shape, size and contents (e.g., stores of carbohydrates or nutrients). Each subregion appears to perform specific functions during digestion, and the cells in these subregions also transcribe genes that reflect their roles in breaking down or storing various nutrients. Interestingly, the stem cells in most subregions are distinct, and do not differentiate into the cells from adjacent subregions. The subregions also differ in their incidence of cancer: when a particular signal was inhibited in stem cells in all ten subregions, aggressive tumors formed in only three subregions and the tumor cells did not cross into neighboring subregions.</p><p>These observations may inform future studies of the mammalian small intestine and improve our understanding of its susceptibility to cancer and other diseases.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00886.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00886.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>intestine</kwd><kwd>midgut</kwd><kwd>stem cell</kwd><kwd>Drosophila</kwd><kwd>cancer</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Spradling</surname><given-names>Allan C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funder had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The intestine contains distinct subregions specialized for digestion along its anterior-posterior axis, and the stem cells that constantly renew these subregions are not interchangeable.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Stem cells allow a tissue to maintain homeostasis by regularly replacing old and damaged cells (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Losick et al., 2011</xref>). For example, intestinal stem cells (ISCs) of the adult Drosophila midgut (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ohlstein and Spradling, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Micchelli and Perrimon, 2006</xref>) generate the two major differentiated cell types of the gut, enterocytes and enteroendocrine cells, throughout life. ISCs with high levels of the Delta (Dl) ligand specify daughters to be enterocytes via unidirectional Notch signaling, while ISCs with low Delta levels specify enteroendocrine cell daughters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Micchelli and Perrimon, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ohlstein and Spradling, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">2007</xref>). Although, the exact nature of their niche remains unclear, ISCs are highly responsive to signals from neighboring cells. The animal’s nutritional state, as sensed in part by insulin signaling, influences ISC division and whether divisions are symmetric or asymmetric (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Choi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">O’Brien et al., 2011</xref>). Dietary toxins, pathogenic bacteria, or other stressors stimulate enterocytes to release Egfr and JAK/STAT ligands that trigger nearby stem cells to multiply and produce tissue hyperplasia (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jiang and Edgar, 2011</xref>).</p><p>ISCs that follow a generally similar program of enterocyte and enteroendocrine cell production based on Notch signaling were detected along the entire length of the midgut by clonal analysis and marker gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ohlstein and Spradling, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Micchelli and Perrimon, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ohlstein and Spradling, 2007</xref>). Whether these stem cells are precisely equivalent, however, has not been critically tested since most studies have focused on the posterior midgut, where ISC divisions are frequent. Some differences are plausible, since histological studies have long distinguished the middle midgut from the anterior and posterior segments. The middle midgut has an acidic pH, and is itself tripartite in organization. The anterior portion contains specialized enterocytes known as interstitial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Filshie et al., 1971</xref>), interspersed with morphologically distinctive ‘copper cells’, which selectively fluoresce following exposure to copper ions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Poulson and Bowen, 1952</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">McNulty et al., 2001</xref>). There follows a zone of ‘large flat cells’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Poulson and Waterhouse, 1960</xref>) and an ‘iron region’ enriched in the iron-storage protein Ferritin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Poulson and Waterhouse, 1960</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Poulson and Bowen, 1952</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mehta et al., 2009</xref>). Copper cells depend uniquely on the homeotic gene <italic>labial</italic> during embryonic differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Panganiban et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hoppler and Bienz, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dubreuil et al., 2001</xref>) and function in acid production using vacuolar H<sup>+</sup> ATPase pump proteins localized on their apical membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dubreuil, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Shanbhag and Tripathi, 2009</xref>). A recent study of ISCs in the copper region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Strand and Micchelli, 2011</xref>) found that they are capable, like posterior ISCs, of replenishing all the major cell types, including copper, interstitial and enteroendocrine cells. However, copper region ISCs were reported to differ from posterior ISCs in lacking the Notch ligand Delta, and in being normally quiescent in the absence of stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Strand and Micchelli, 2011</xref>). Thus, the regulation of ISCs differs in the copper region compared to other studied regions of the midgut.</p><p>The possible existence of regional variation is further suggested by the restricted spatial localization of some digestive enzymes in midguts from a variety of insects (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Terra and Ferreira, 1994</xref>) and from Drosophila larvae. Some enzymes, such as the lipase Magro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sieber and Thummel, 2012</xref>), may be trafficked into the midgut from the proventriculus via the peritrophic matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">King, 1988</xref>). Others such as, α-amylase, which is expressed primarily in the anterior and posterior midgut regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Thompson et al., 1992</xref>) probably indicate true regional differences in enterocyte expression. Some of the strongest evidence for further regionalization comes from studies showing that unique neuropeptides are secreted by enteroendocrine cells located in specific gut regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ohlstein and Spradling, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Veenstra et al., 2008</xref>). These spatial differences in gene expression might be induced downstream of the ISC by region-specific signals, or they might reflect intrinsic differences in regional stem cell programming.</p><p>Here we document extensive regionalization along the length of the Drosophila midgut, at the level of morphology, cell behavior and gene expression. Each subregion displays a sharp boundary with its neighbors, suggesting that it carries out distinctive functions. ISCs likely contribute to these differences, since stem cells from most tested regions did not produce adjacent region cells even when located at the border. Regional stem cell differences likely influence tumorigenesis, since midgut tumors caused by attenuating Notch signaling arose at very different rates in the different subregions. Thus, tissue stem cells may comprise a wider variety of types, each with a more limited therapeutic scope, than previously appreciated.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Regionalized morphological ultrastructure along the midgut a/p axis</title><p>The Drosophila intestine varies significantly in cellular content and activity based on age, sex, mating status, and nutritional and environmental conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ohlstein and Spradling, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">O’Brien et al., 2011</xref>; reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jiang and Edgar, 2011</xref>).

EM analyses of longitudinally sectioned midguts revealed many more reproducible regional differences in enterocyte structure than those described previously in the middle midgut, including differences in cell type, cell size, membrane invaginations, microvillar length, and the presence of ferritin particles, glycogen or lipid droplets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).

For example, the expression of the neuropeptides Npf and Ast-A is patterned within the midgut (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Veenstra et al., 2008</xref>) and we observed expression of the corresponding mRNAs within the middle and posterior regions, as predicted, along with patterned expression of many other previously unlocalized neuropeptide mRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,D</xref>). The <italic>labial (lab)</italic> gene encodes a homeobox transcription factor that is only expressed in the copper cell region, where it is required for copper cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Panganiban et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hoppler and Bienz, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dubreuil et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Strand and Micchelli, 2011</xref>). The RNAseq data showed that labial reads were detected only within the middle midgut in experiments that divided the midgut into anterior (A1, A2 and A3), middle (Cu, LFC and Fe) or posterior (P1, P2, P3 and P4) sections. Revealingly, <italic>lab</italic> fpkm was 40–100 times higher in isolated Cu region RNA than in any other adult midgut region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). All seven of the midgut segments we were able to isolate showed highly specific gene expression. CG10725 was enriched in A1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), along with many other genes involved in chitin metabolism, where it likely encodes a component of the peritrophic membrane. Although their levels of spatial specificity were not previously known, Beta-galactosidase (Gal) mRNA was selectively found in the A2-A3 sample, the ZIP1 iron transporter mRNA in the Fe region, and the CG3106 acyl transferase mRNA in P1. This high specificity proves that cross-contamination was minimal and that gene expression boundaries correspond to the regional boundaries used in tissue isolation, while the correspondence of the RNAseq data to previous studies of gene expression validates the reliability of this large new body of information.</p><p>Many genes were expressed in previously unappreciated regional patterns, suggesting they are relevant to diverse aspects of midgut function. For example, PGRPs are membrane proteins that mediate interactions between the midgut and the microbiome that are essential for normal digestion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cash et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ryu et al., 2008</xref>). <italic>PGRP-SC1b</italic> and <italic>PGRP-SC2</italic> expression was found to be highly enriched in the LFC and Fe regions, respectively, along with their regulator, <italic>caudal</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). The localized expression of these and other PGRP family members (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) suggest that the microbiome interacts with enterocytes in a highly organized way and that some bacterial species may be localized to specific regions of the gut lumen by the selective expression of host factors.</p><p>Regionally expressed genes were surprisingly common and specific. Each isolated subregion expressed 50–150 genes 10 times higher than in any other selected subregion of the midgut (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1B</xref>). The anterior, middle and posterior zones each expressed 259–474 genes at least five times more highly than in the other two zones, and differentially expressed mRNAs represented some of the most highly expressed genes in each region (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1B</xref>). Many differentially expressed genes were annotated as enzymes likely to be relevant to digestion or metabolism, or their expression had previously been mapped specifically to larval or adult midgut by the Fly Atlas microarray project (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chintapalli et al., 2007</xref>). Interestingly, many regionally expressed midgut genes reside in genomic clusters like highly expressed genes in many other differentiated cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43a">Spellman and Rubin, 2002</xref>). These included trypsins, lysozymes, serine proteases, alpha-glucosidases, lipases and Jonah genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akam and Carlson, 1985</xref>).</p><p>We carried out gene ontology analyses of the differentially expressed genes and abundant genes from each region and identified candidate biochemical pathways to which they likely contribute using the Database for Annotation, Visualization, and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Huang et al., 2008a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">2008b</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> shows GO terms enriched in the anterior, middle or posterior midgut, as well as in each of the individual regions that were isolated. These findings suggest several general insights into midgut function. Food entering the anterior midgut from the proventriculus begins to break down due to the action of enzymes expressed in the anterior midgut. In addition to digestive enzymes, anterior enterocytes may secrete other substances such as lipids to aid in nutrient solubilization. Antibacterial activity is also important in this region. In the three middle midgut regions food is further digested releasing sugars, amino acids, fatty acids, etc aided by the low pH. Additionally, metal ions that must be reduced before they can be absorbed, and other micronutrients are likely taken up for storage or metabolism. Finally, upon entry into the posterior midgut, nutrients begin to be massively absorbed by enterocytes and transported to other regions of the body for storage, modification or utilization. The lipid-rich zone in the P1 region probably represents such nutrient uptake. The large flux of ready-to-use nutrients in the posterior region may explain why their stem cells divide more rapidly than other regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4S</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ohlstein and Spradling, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Micchelli and Perrimon, 2006</xref>). Both the middle and posterior regions likely maintain large populations of commensal microorganisms to aid in carrying out their functions.<fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00886.007</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Regional gene expression.</title><p>Pathways and gene ontology analysis using DAVID (see ‘Materials and methods’) enriched in the anterior (A1–3 pooled sample), middle (Cu-LFC-Fe pooled sample), and posterior (P1–4 pooled sample) midgut are listed in the upper panel.

ISCs can be recognized in electron micrographs due to their basal location, extensive basement membrane contact, and triangular shape (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). In A1, where enterocytes are more squamous and shorter than in other regions, the stem cells were flatter than the upward-directed triangular shape seen in all other regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Additionally, in the most lipid-rich region, P1, ISCs often contained many lipid droplets and reported lipid synthesis using the SREBP-GAL4 reporter line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Matthews et al., 2009</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). We verified that these cells were ISCs by staining for Delta and with Nile red (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Lipid droplets were also observed in A2 ISCs but in much fewer numbers (not shown). Two lines uncovered in the screen, R42G03 (Pdp1) and R44E05 (Stat92E), were differentially expressed in ISCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>), and the boundaries of expression coincided with regional boundaries. Thus, stem cells can be regionally distinctive, but it remained unclear if these differences were a cause or effect of other regional features.</p><p>Studies of stem cell behavior throughout the midgut uncovered further regional differences. The frequency of ISCs was investigated by staining for Delta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F–O</xref>). Using improved staining conditions (‘Materials and methods’), we detected Dl+ cells with the characteristics of ISCs in all 10 regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F–O</xref>), including the Cu region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref>), where Delta expression in ISCs was previously reported to be absent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Strand and Micchelli, 2011</xref>). However, ISCs divided at different rates in different regions based on clonal marking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4S</xref>). While it has been reported that heat shock can alter ISC division rates measured by lineage labeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Strand and Micchelli, 2011</xref>), we minimized these effects by using a single brief heat shock and a marking system that lacks GAL4. Moreover, all subregions should have been affected equally, and the data should be accurate as relative measurements. The most rapidly dividing ISCs are found in P1-P3, which divide about once per day, while ISC division is slightly less frequent in the anterior midgut, and much slower in the middle region. However, in contrast to a previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Strand and Micchelli, 2011</xref>), Cu region ISCs were not entirely quiescent but divided regularly every 4–5 days. ISCs in different regions maintain differing numbers of enteroendocrine cells and enterocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4R</xref>). Interestingly, in P1 (and to a lesser extent in P3 and A2), the enteroblast and even the youngest EC continued to stain for Dl (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4L′</xref>). Although ISCs generated the same cells as elsewhere in the midgut, the persistent Delta in enteroblasts in the P1 region likely leads to persistent Notch activation during early enterocyte differentiation; the Notch activity reporter GbeSu(H)-lacZ was expressed in young ECs in P1 and P3, but not in other regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4Q vs 4P</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Most stem cells generate progeny only within their starting region</title><p>If ISCs are intrinsically different in different subregions, then their progeny might only be able to differentiate into cells from that subregion. In contrast, if regional differences are induced by signals received from the gut lumen, muscle, enteric nerves or other sources, then ISCs near a border should on occasion generate daughter cells from both regions. We noticed that clones in the midgut sometimes run for a considerable distance perpendicular to the a/p axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), but rarely if ever parallel to the axis. To investigate quantitatively whether there are restrictions on cell movement and/or differentiation along the a/p axis, we marked stem cells at a relatively low frequency to avoid generating two adjacent clones derived from different regions. Progeny of individual clones were then analyzed with respect to particular regional boundaries defined using appropriate GAL4 lines or other region-specific markers. Among more than 3000 sparse clones generated throughout the midgut, we identified rare ‘boundary clones’ that contained a single stem cell, at least four total cells and that contacted a marked boundary from one side or the other. Each boundary clone was carefully analyzed by confocal microscopy so that the location of its stem cell (marked by Delta), the number, cell type and location of the downstream cells (marked by lacZ and DAPI) and their precise relationship to the boundary in question (marked by GFP) could be determined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). We then recorded clone size, the number of cells that contacted the boundary, and the number of cells, if any, that crossed the boundary and successfully differentiated into cells of the adjacent region as defined by regional marker expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B,C</xref>). It was difficult to obtain large numbers of valid boundary clones due to the low rate of clone induction, regional differences in stem cell activity, and the difficulty of analyzing boundary clones accurately using different regional markers.

Boundary clones that resulted from stem cell labeling within A1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D,D′</xref>) or A2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E,E′</xref>) contacted the border zone defined by R45D10::UAS-GFP expression, but never included cells from the opposite side. Either the clones did not cross the boundary, or they crossed but were unable to differentiate properly and rapidly died. Since the boundaries are not smooth or precisely perpendicular to the a/p axis at the cellular level, it is also possible that cells from an A1 stem cell that pushed into the anterior edge of the A2 zone simply caused a bulge in the boundary at that location (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D,D′</xref>). Over time such cell movement might cause the boundary between the two regions to fluctuate slightly in shape as cells die and are replaced by cells from one side or the other. Similarly, clones failed to differentiate heterologously across four other studied boundaries (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>), including Fe/P1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H,I</xref>) and P1/P2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J,K</xref>). In P1/P2, we verified clonal behavior using more than one boundary marker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J,K</xref>).</p><p>Clones readily crossed one boundary, between LFC and Fe, and differentiated or transformed into cells characteristic of the opposite side. We induced ISC clones and identified 17 boundary clones touching the LFC/Fe border, using Fe region-specific expression of Ferritin-GFP to mark the boundary. The behavior of clones at this boundary was very different than at A1/A2. 15 of 17 clones crossed the boundary, and did so readily from either direction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F,G</xref>). This was not an artifact of Ferritin-GFP expression because crossing was also observed using R46B08 to mark the LFC/Fe boundary, whereas clones failed to cross from Fe into P1 using Ferritin-GFP. Thus, despite the regional differences in enterocyte morphology and gene expression described earlier, the stem cells within LFC and Fe can each generate at least some cells characteristic of the other region. We concluded that our method efficiently identified clones that produced cells from two different regions across a boundary when such behavior occurred.</p><p>Since the average size and border contact of boundary clones was similar in all the regions (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>), the behavior of clones in the other regions could be compared quantitatively to clones at the LFC/Fe boundary to determine if their failure to differentiate across a boundary was statistically significant. For example, 88% of boundary clones on the LFC/Fe boundary crossed and generated cells on the other side (N = 17). In comparison, 0% of boundary clones crossed the A1/A2 border (N = 6), 0% of boundary clones crossed the A3/Cu border (N = 3), 0% of boundary clones crossed the Cu/LFC border (N = 4), 0% of boundary clones crossed the Fe/P1 border (N = 7), and 0% of boundary clones crossed the P1/P2 border (N = 12). These differences are all statistically significant, since the probability that even three boundary clones would fail to cross a junction equivalent to the LFC/Fe boundary is only (1–0.88)<sup>3</sup> = 0.0017. To further test the significance of the results, we reasoned that there should be a correspondence between the number of boundary cells and the number of boundary-crossing cells, on average, in the absence of a constraint. In boundary clones at the LFC/Fe border, there were 0.63 crossing cells for every boundary cell (N = 115). In contrast, there were 0 crossing cells for 22 boundary cells at the A1/A2 border, 0 crossing cells for 14 boundary cells on the A3/Cu border, 0 crossing cells for 10 boundary cells on the Cu/LFC border, 0 crossing cells for 21 boundary cells on the Fe/P1 border, and 0 crossing cells for 53 boundary cells on the P1/P2 border. The absence of crossing cells differs significantly from expectation based on LFC/Fe (e.g., at the Cu/LFC border with ten boundary cells, p=0.014; χ<sup>2</sup> = 6.15). However, the limited number of clones and boundary cells that could be obtained at the Cu/LFC and A3/Cu borders does limit our ability to detect cell crossing is inhibited in both directions. At the Cu/LFC border, Cu stem cell progeny cannot cross, but it is not possible to conclude that LFC progeny lack this capacity. The restriction at the A3/Cu border also is known to apply only from the A3 side.

We investigated whether these tumors arise with the same frequency throughout the midgut by knocking down Notch signaling in ISCs and EBs using the esg-GAL4 driver, or by feeding flies the Notch inhibitor DAPT. Several days after reducing Notch activity, clusters of diploid tumor cells began to appear in the tissue. Surprisingly, tumorous cells arose and proliferated much more extensively in some midgut subregions than in others (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). The P1 region consistently had the largest tumors and earliest onset, although tumors also arose rapidly in P3 and the posterior part of A2. In contrast, we never observed tumors within A1, even after long periods of exposure to these agents. As the tumor cells expanded they appeared to respect the cellular boundaries with adjacent midgut regions. For example, the anterior border of P1 tumor cells corresponded closely with the Fe/P1 boundary based on counts of cell diameters from the Cu region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D–E</xref>). The posterior boundary of P1 tumor expansion mapped near or at the P1/P2 border (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>), while the anterior and posterior boundaries of P3 tumors also corresponded with their normal junctions with P2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>) and P3/P4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>). The same regional specificity was observed when Notch signaling was inhibited using N[RNAi], treatment with the Notch inhibitor DAPT, or by expressing a Notch-dominative negative allele N<sup>DN</sup>.

Some of these steps are associated with an array of bacterial species that constitute the normal intestinal microbiome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ryu et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Shin et al., 2011</xref>). Our work will allow the function of genes, pathways, cells and regions within the midgut to be tested in digestion, tissue maintenance, microbiome function and immunity.</p><p>After this work was submitted for publication, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Buchon et al. (2013)</xref> also described midgut regionalization; they classified five major midgut divisions (R1–R5), 13 total subregions (e.g., R1a and R1b), and 2 microregions (B<sub>R2–3</sub>, B<sub>R3–4</sub>). Converting our counts of cell number within the 10 regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) to the fractional length coordinates used by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Buchon et al. (2013)</xref> suggests a close correspondence between the studies: A1 = R1a + R1b; A2 = R2a + R2b; A3 = R2c; Cu = R3a + R3b; LFC = R3c; Fe = B<sub>R3–R4</sub>, P1 = R4a + R4b; P2 = R4c; P3 = R5a; P4 = R5b. In the case of single regions in our system that Buchon et al. split in two, we had also usually noted differences in gene expression; for example, between the anterior and posterior Cu region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Strand and Micchelli, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Buchon et al., 2013</xref>) or the subregions of A2 and P1 that differ in lipid accumulation. We emphasized enterocyte morphology and qualitative gene expression differences in defining subregions. In contrast to our study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Buchon et al. (2013)</xref> view constrictions to be of primary importance and define two constrictions as micro-regions in their own right. We found that enterocyte subregions abut directly, and favor the view that constrictions are mesodermal features, not microregions.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Differences in ISCs contribute to Drosophila midgut regionalization</title><p>Our results argue strongly that the striking regionalization of structure and gene expression within the midgut is maintained at least in part by regional differences between their resident stem cells. In the midgut subregions surrounding five different boundaries, we did not detect a single stem cell that produced differentiated cells on the opposite side of the boundary, that is from a region different from the one in which it resided. All the ‘non-crossing’ clones contacted the regional boundary, and in 78% the founder stem cell was located on or within one cell of the boundary, such that progeny cells could have reached the adjacent region prior to differentiation. In contrast, boundary clones with the same general properties almost always crossed the LFC/Fe boundary, showing that ‘non-crossing’ behavior would not occur by chance. Consistent with the existence of epigenetic differences in stem cells that limit trans-regional differentiation, clones frequently pushed into adjacent regions at the boundary, but retained their autonomous identity based on marker expression. Mechanical and/or adhesive forces may also contribute to maintaining some regional boundaries. Indeed, the tendency of tumor cells to respect regional boundaries suggests that cell–cell interactions at boundaries are likely to be important as well as stem cell programming.</p><p>The behavior of ISC clones at regional boundaries is reminiscent of the behavior of clones in developing imaginal discs at ‘compartment’ boundaries (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dahmann et al., 2011</xref>). In the developing Drosophila embryo and imaginal discs, the <italic>engrailed</italic> gene and <italic>hedgehog</italic> signaling play important roles in defining posterior compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dahmann and Basler, 2000</xref>). We did not detect expression of <italic>engrailed</italic> or the closely related gene <italic>invected</italic> in any midgut region, and expression of <italic>hedgehog</italic> pathway components was similar on both sides of non-crossing boundaries such as Fe/P1. Dorsal ventral compartments in the developing wing are mediated by <italic>apterous</italic> and by Notch signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Milan and Cohen, 2003</xref>). <italic>Apterous</italic> was expressed only at very low levels throughout all regions and <italic>Serrate</italic> was found at significant levels only in posterior regions 2–4 where the gene is dispensable for cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ohlstein and Spradling, 2007</xref>). In the developing vertebrate brain, Hox genes are important in specifying developmental compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kiecker and Lumsden, 2005</xref>). However, Hox genes are only expressed at very low levels in endodermal cells during embryogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hoppler and Beinz, 1994</xref>) and these genes were very weakly expressed in our RNAseq studies, perhaps due to expression in non-endodermal cells within these samples. Consequently, the genetic basis for adult midgut compartmentalization probably differs from previously studied examples of tissue regionalization.</p><p>The homeotic transcription factor <italic>labial (lab)</italic> is an outstanding candidate for a regional regulatory factor. In the embryonic and larval gut, <italic>lab</italic> is required for Cu cell specification, differentiation and maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hoppler and Beinz, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dubreuil et al., 2001</xref>). The gene is expressed in copper cells, but not elsewhere in the larval midgut, and we observed similar specificity of <italic>lab</italic> expression in the adult. When <italic>lab</italic> is mis-expressed during embryonic development in other midgut regions, the copper region can expand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hoppler and Bienz, 1994</xref>). Endodermal cell identity along the a/p axis may be determined by signals from adjacent mesoderm during embryogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bilder and Scott, 1998</xref>), and then fixed by the induction of secondary factors such as <italic>lab</italic>. Gene expression within the midgut muscles might play a similar role in the adult midgut, however, expression boundaries of muscle genes were frequently offset with respect to endodermal regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Whether this bears any relationship to the documented offset in homeotic gene expression between the ectoderm and visceral endoderm in embryonic development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lawrence and Morata, 1994</xref>) remains unclear. A key question is whether individual or combinations of differentiation regulators analogous to <italic>lab</italic> specify other midgut subregions in which the ISCs fail to generate cells across regional boundaries. The RNAseq data should provide a valuable resource in identifying such factors. For example, one potential candidate, the homeotic gene <italic>defective proventriculus (dve)</italic>, functions in copper cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nakagawa et al., 2011</xref>) and its expression was observed to fall sixfold between Fe and P1.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Origin of regional differences within the midgut</title><p>One remaining question is whether a pre-existing pattern of larval midgut subdivision plays any role in the origin of adult midgut organization. The larval gut has a middle acidic region containing copper cells and an iron region like the adult tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Poulson and Bowen, 1952</xref>), and EM studies show additional morphological differences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Shanbhag and Tripathi, 2009</xref>). However, it is not known whether regions analogous to other eight midgut domains described here exist in larvae. The larval midgut contains nests of diploid intestinal precursors that proliferate following pupariation to build the adult gut and establish its ISCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19a">Jiang and Edgar, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Mathur et al., 2010</xref>). Larval midgut domains might serve as a template for adult regionalization if gut precursor cells within each region already differ autonomously and do not mix during pupal development. However, cells do cross boundaries between the hindgut and midgut during pupal gut development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Takashima et al., 2013b</xref>). Identical regionalization within larval and adult guts might be disadvantageous to species with very different larval and adult diets, hence many adult midgut regions are likely to be established de novo or to be re-specified during pupal development.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Stem cell regionalization may be widespread</title><p>Many mammalian tissues such as skin, muscle, lung, liver, and intestine contain thousands of spatially dispersed stem cells, like the Drosophila midgut. Our studies raise the question of whether these tissues exhibit finer grained regional patterns of gene expression than has been previously recognized, patterns that might be supported by small autonomous differences in their stem cells. Currently, the strongest indication for such regionalization comes from studies of the intestine. Lineage labeling shows that similar stem cells expressing Lgr5 exist along the mammalian gut (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barker et al., 2007</xref>) despite the fact that enterocytes, enteroendocrine cells and bacterial symbionts differ regionally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rindi et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bradley et al., 2011</xref>). For example, iron absorption in mammals takes place primarily in the duodenum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fuqua et al., 2012</xref>), a specialized subregion of the small intestine located just downstream from the acidic stomach. This is similar to the position of the midgut iron region just downstream from the acid-producing parietal cells of the Cu and LFC regions. The antibacterial lectin RegIIIγ, which like Drosophila PGRPs recognizes bacterial peptidoglycans, is expressed most prominently in the distal region of the small intestine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cash et al., 2006</xref>). The existence of tissue and stem cell regionalization in other mammalian tissues deserves further detailed investigation.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Regionalization and cancer</title><p>The human large intestine is much more prone to cancer than the small intestine. Our studies suggest that regional differences in the properties of apparently similar stem cells and tissue cells contribute to such differences. The midgut zones most favorable for the expansion of Notch-deficient cells showed pre-existing differences in Notch signaling within the early enterocyte lineage. Delta expression did not decrease shortly after ISC division, as in other regions, and Notch signaling persisted throughout enterocyte development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4Q</xref>). Curiously, same tumor-prone regions with persistent Notch signaling also were enriched in lipid droplets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). At present it is not clear how the altered signaling, regional metabolic activity and tumor susceptibility are related. Additionally, regional differences in the microbiome, as suggested by our observation of domain-specific expression of PGRP proteins, may also influence the occurrence of cancer. Gastric bacteria such as <italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic> contribute to stomach cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Uemura et al., 2001</xref>), while colonic <italic>Bacteroides fragilis</italic> likely promote gut cell DNA damage and colon cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wu et al., 2009</xref>). Regional tissue differences likely also affect rates of tumor progression and metastasis. These observations emphasize the importance of understanding tissues region by region.</p><p>In sum, the Drosophila midgut provides an outstanding tissue in which to explore and understand the significance of intrinsic stem cell differences. We identified GAL4 drivers that allow gene expression to be manipulated in all intestinal cell types, including cells such as circular muscle and enteric neurons that are thought to contribute to niche function. Will altering the expression of genes that normally differ between regions cause ISCs to generate cells with heterotypic characteristics? Such studies might eventually make it possible to stimulate medically useful responses from the endogenous stem cells that remain within a diseased tissue.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Strains and crosses</title><p>Strains of <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> were obtained from Bloomington Stock Center (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://flystocks.bio.indiana.edu/">http://flystocks.bio.indiana.edu/</ext-link>) unless otherwise indicated.

Clones containing a single ISC, at least four total cells, and contained at least one cell that contacted the boundary under study were termed ‘boundary clones’ and were analyzed further to determine the number and location of all cells relative to the boundary. A ‘boundary cell’ is any cell in the clone that neighbors midgut cell in a different subregion. A ‘crossed cell’ is any cell in the clone that is located past the boundary and that displays the marker expression of a midgut subregion different from that of its founder stem cell. A crossed clone is a clone that contains at least one crossed cell. Several classes of potentially ambiguous clones were not included in our tabulation to ensure accuracy.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor and 3 reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. One of the reviewers, Bruce Edgar, has agreed to reveal his identity.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The manuscript describes an extensive and careful characterization of regionalization of the adult Drosophila gut. The authors identify ten sub-regions based on differential gene expression, combining the expression patterns of GAL4 driver lines and RNA seq. of dissected segments of the gut. The data on regionalized expression is extensive and of good quality, and will be essential for future functional studies of regionalized gut functions in these different cell subtypes. The authors investigate whether the stem cells in all sub-regions are equivalent and demonstrate apparent lineage restricted compartment boundaries. They include some clonal analysis that reveals, potentially, the presence of clonal restriction boundaries that partition different subsets of stem cells. They observe that different regions of the gut are more susceptible to tumorigenesis upon inhibition of Notch signalling, suggesting regional differences in stem cell behavior. Although the authors have not addressed the mechanisms underlying these differences, documenting them is an important first step towards elucidating the mechanisms that control differential stem cell activity. Overall this is an impressive amount of work and will be useful for researchers working with this interesting system. It overlaps somewhat with recent “atlas” type papers from Tripathi and Lemaitre, but has unique aspects and different gene expression and Gal4 databases, so it will serve to complement these other studies.</p><p>Major comments:</p><p>1) The suggestion of regional compartment boundaries within the midgut, derived from clonal analysis, is one of the paper's more interesting discoveries. However the clonal data supporting this is a very small data set and cannot be considered comprehensive or even conclusive for a few boundaries. Far too few clones were assayed, and the data provided is just text, without tables, a proper statistical treatment, or a map (text and a figure are provided). This aspect of the paper could be vastly improved if hundreds of clones were assayed, a statistical treatment was applied, and a map was provided. As is, the data are merely suggestive of an interesting phenomenon.</p><p>2) In the Introduction the authors make the intriguing suggestion that intestinal stem cells may “differ regionally in their ability to replace damaged cells and to spawn tumors”. However, there are no experiments on damage and replacement. Does susceptibility to tumors necessarily reflect the ability to replace cells after damage?</p><p>3) The graph of ISC cell cycle times in different regions is probably not an accurate assessment of normal ISC division times. This is because the times were derived by clonal analysis using a heat shock-flip, and heat shock causes a long-term increase in ISC division rates in the adult midgut. A number of labs have confirmed this effect of heat shock. This issue has confounded earlier conclusions regarding timing of ISC cell cycles. The caveat needs at least to be mentioned here.</p><p>4) The authors should cite the recent similar paper published in Cell Reports from Buchon, et al. (2013), and comment on the differences in the regional map provided in that paper with theirs. If possible, this new paper should provide a revised map that covers both papers. The differences in the two maps are small and should be reconcilable.</p><p>5) The paper provides a very useful resource to labs studying Drosophila intestinal development and physiology. More data to support the concept of compartment boundaries and the contention that there are regional differences in the ability to replace damaged cells would broaden its interest.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00886.015</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) The suggestion of regional compartment boundaries within the midgut, derived from clonal analysis, is one of the paper's more interesting discoveries.

This aspect of the paper could be vastly improved if hundreds of clones were assayed, a statistical treatment was applied, and a map was provided. As is, the data are merely suggestive of an interesting phenomenon</italic>.</p><p>The original clonal data comprised more than 1200 clones, of which 24 contacted one of two different regional boundaries. The conclusions drawn, though limited to these two boundaries, were valid and statistically sound. However, we agree with the reviewers’ main points that these data were not presented in sufficient detail, and moreover that this aspect of the work should be expanded to encompass more boundaries. We have now addressed these issues. From more than 2000 additional clones we have characterized 25 more boundary clones contacting 4 additional boundaries. Interestingly, the clones do not cross any of these new boundaries. So, instead of one crossable boundary and one non-crossable boundary, we now show that clonal crossing is not observed at 5 of 6 boundaries. Thus, compartmentalization is the rule, not the exception, further enhancing the interest of these experiments.</p><p>We revised the manuscript to make the clonal experiments easier to follow and analyze in detail, as requested. The experiments now have their own section in the Materials and methods section, detailing the genotypes needed to separately score both clones and regional boundaries. They now have their own figure, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, which contains two new panels explaining exactly how clones were scored (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B,C</xref>). We added a new <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref> that tabulates all the clonal data scored as described, including the number of boundary clones, boundary cells and cells crossing the boundary for every tested region. We show examples of clones from multiple regions and diagrams illustrating their interpretation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). We added a figure (Figure 5–figure supplement 3) showing separated channels to document the accuracy of our clonal mapping relative to subregional borders. Finally, we added a new figure panel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>), summarizing the outcomes at the six borders analyzed.</p><p>Additionally we present a completely new and clearer statistical analysis showing that the compartmentalization results are significant at all the boundaries, relative to the LFC/Fe boundary. This is true despite the difficulty of obtaining large numbers of boundary clones. For example, 88% of boundary clones on the LFC/Fe boundary cross to the other side (N = 17). In comparison, 0% of boundary clones on the A1/A2 border cross (N = 6), 0% of clones on the A3/Cu border cross (N = 3), 0% of clones on the Cu/LFC border cross (N = 4), 0% of clones on the Fe/P1 border cross (N = 7), and 0% of clones on the P1/P2 border cross (N = 12). Since the large clones analyzed almost always cross at LFC/Fe, and were of similar size and border touching characteristics in all regions (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>), clonal behavior at the other boundaries is significantly different (even for N = 3, p=0.0017). Another way to demonstrate this significance is to note that for Cu/LFC, there are 0.63 crossing cells for every boundary cell (N = 115). In contrast, there are 0 crossing cells at A1/A2 border (N = 22), 0 crossing cells on the A3/Cu border (N = 14), 0 crossing cells on the Cu/LFC border (N = 10), 0 crossing cells on the Fe/P1 border (N = 21), and 0 crossing cells on the P1/P2 border (N = 53). All these numbers are significantly different from expectation based on LFC/Fe (e.g., even with N = 10 boundary cells, the chance of zero crossing cells is just p=0.014; χ<sup>2</sup> = 6.15). However, the number of clones and boundary cells available does limit certain conclusions, and these are now spelled out in detail. For example, at the Cu/LFC border, it is not possible to conclude that the restriction applies in both directions, rather than just from Cu stem cells. The restriction at the A3/Cu border also is known to apply only from the A3 side. These limitations are indicated in the text and the diagram in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>.</p><p>This new data solidifies and extends our previous conclusions about compartmentalization, as requested. It was not possible to exhaustively test every boundary because an appropriate GAL4 line demarking every boundary is not currently available, and scorable boundary clones arise at variable rates due to differences in stem cell activity and marker quality in the different subregions. However, we feel strongly that the clonal data presented, which represents a large amount of effort, establishes that in multiple regions of the midgut, cells are normally replaced only by the local ISCs from that region. This is further supported by the tumor data. It would be unreasonable to expect that the same paper that (co-)discovered the existence of midgut subregions, characterized them sufficiently to even contemplate such experiments, and established the existence of compartmentalization, would exhaustively analyze their clonal properties.</p><p><italic>2) In the Introduction the authors make the intriguing suggestion that intestinal stem cells may “differ regionally in their ability to replace damaged cells and to spawn tumors”. However, there are no experiments on damage and replacement. Does susceptibility to tumors necessarily reflect the ability to replace cells after damage</italic>?</p><p>We were referring to the routine day-to-day activity of midgut stem cells that generate new cells in order to replace cells damaged by the stressful environment digestion produces, even in the absence of exogenous pathogens or toxins. We found that ISCs differ in their ability to carry out this routine replacement of damaged cells because in at least 7 of the 10 subregions our experiments show that ISCs are unable to replace cells in an adjacent region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). The many regional differences in transcription factor expression that we uncovered may help explain this regional specificity, as has been documented already for labial and the Cu region. Despite the fact that the statement seems justified, we modified it to avoid any misunderstanding.</p><p><italic>3) The graph of ISC cell cycle times in different regions is probably not an accurate assessment of normal ISC division times. This is because the times were derived by clonal analysis using a heat shock-flip, and heat shock causes a long-term increase in ISC division rates in the adult midgut. A number of labs have confirmed this effect of heat shock. This issue has confounded earlier conclusions regarding timing of ISC cell cycles. The caveat needs at least to be mentioned here</italic>.</p><p>Stresses that transiently induce the heat shock response, including brief elevated temperature, are part of the normal environment of Drosophila in the wild. Most of the claims that heat shock induces artifacts (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Strand and Micchelli, 2011</xref>) are based on cell marking systems that involve the GAL4 system, which is itself affected by heat. The artifact may be the effect of heat shock on such marking systems rather than on the gut; e.g., a transient heat-induced increase in GAL4 activity could cause extra flip-out cell marking. Our experiments used a simple, reliable marking system that does not involve GAL4, has zero-background and is inactive in postmitotic cells; we applied only a single brief heat shock. Moreover, our interest here is primarily in documenting the <italic>relative</italic> differences in ISC activity between subregions, which were all treated the same. We now mention heat shock as an issue and so qualify our experiment. However, we believe that these data remain important and valuable as another way to document subregional differences.</p><p><italic>4) The authors should cite the recent similar paper published in Cell Reports from Buchon, et al. (2013), and comment on the differences in the regional map provided in that paper with theirs. If possible, this new paper should provide a revised map that covers both papers. The differences in the two maps are small and should be reconcilable</italic>.</p><p>Our manuscript describes work carried out over a four-year period that was entirely independent of the work of Buchon, et al. (2013). The existence of their study became known to us only when they began to publicize their data at the same time we began presenting our studies in seminars; we both made poster presentations at the National Drosophila meeting. We did not examine their data in detail prior to preparing our manuscript and we submitted our paper prior to the publication of their <italic>Cell Reports</italic> paper. Credit for the discovery of detailed midgut regionalization deserves to be shared equally between the two groups.</p><p>We do agree that the existence of two independent co-discoveries of the highly regionalized nature of the midgut are valuable for the field. We are very positive about their work, which we view as complementary to our own, and we want to assist the field in “digesting” all this new information as efficiently as possible. Consequently, we have added a text section in the revised Discussion that briefly compares the two analyses of midgut regionalization. Based on our reading of their paper, the two studies are in fairly close but not complete agreement. We highlight the few differences, such as the nature and importance of the constrictions. Buchon, et al. (2013) present two of them as mini-regions in their own right lying between the other regions, whereas we locate the constrictions as features (caused mostly likely by overlying muscle) lying within or spanning regions whose cells directly contact each other. We sought to maintain the previously published regional names as much as possible, in order to facilitate access to the earlier literature, which goes back to the 1950s. Buchon, et al. (2013) renamed all regions based on the idea that the constrictions are the truly fundamental landmarks. In the end, the differences between the regions defined by the two groups are small, and workers in the field will decide which terms are most appropriate and useful.</p><p><italic>5) The paper provides a very useful resource to labs studying Drosophila intestinal development and physiology. More data to support the concept of compartment boundaries and the contention that there are regional differences in the ability to replace damaged cells would broaden its interest</italic>.</p><p>Our paper goes beyond just describing regionalization, important as that is, and establishes a cellular mechanism–stem cell regional independence–that has great relevance and interest for all stem cell researchers, biologists, and doctors. Thus, similar-appearing stem cells in large tissues can no longer be assumed to be equivalent at the level of cell programming or gene expression, even though they make basically the “same” cell types. This new understanding will accelerate studies of stem cell biology, cell therapy, as well as work related to multiple aspects of gut physiology including the burgeoning field of the gut microbiome.</p><p>The work reported here appeals strongly to a wide variety of scientists, based on my experience presenting the data publically for the last seven months. It resonates with clinicians and mammalian researchers as strongly as any Drosophila work of which we are aware. Surgeons wonder whether similar stem cell regionalization might explain their own observations transplanting skin and blood vessels from one part of the human body into another. GI doctors are intrigued with the implications of this work for surgery on the human gut, which often has unexpected consequences. To further highlight the general significance of the principles revealed by our experiments, additional references were added describing data consistent with sub-regionalization in the mammalian small intestine. Some of these data suggest that even specific subregions (such as the iron region) might themselves be conserved between mammals and insects.</p><p>We are pleased the reviewers recognize that the manuscript also contains substantial new gene expression and genetic (GAL4 line) tools as a side benefit, and agree that these tools will facilitate future work on the midgut, along with complementary tools and data generated by the Buchon, et al. (2013). All the information and tools generated as part of this study are being shared. We have made all the expression analyses and the sequence data publically available via the NIH GEO site (accession number <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE47780">GSE47780</ext-link>). The GEO site is transferring the raw sequence data to the NIH short read archive, and linking it to the GEO summary. All the Janelia lines whose expression patterns we report are publicly available in the Bloomington stock center. We plan to send image files of the patterns to Janelia for inclusion on their GAL4 line website and have received verbal agreement that this can be arranged. No expression data were held back, including the rare lines expressing in subsets of ISCs.</p></body></sub-article></article>
