Necessary for long-term survival, quiescent chromatin is compact, hypoacetylated, and transcriptionally inactive. How transcription activates upon cell-cycle re-entry is undefined. Here we report robust, widespread transcription within the first minutes of quiescence exit. During quiescence, the chromatin-remodeling enzyme RSC was already bound to the genes induced upon quiescence exit. RSC depletion caused severe quiescence exit defects: a global decrease in RNA polymerase II (Pol II) loading, Pol II accumulation at transcription start sites, initiation from ectopic upstream loci, and aberrant antisense transcription. These phenomena were due to a combination of highly robust Pol II transcription and severe chromatin defects in the promoter regions and gene bodies. Together, these results uncovered multiple mechanisms by which RSC facilitates initiation and maintenance of large-scale, rapid gene expression despite a globally repressive chromatin state.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>quiescence</kwd><kwd>chromatin</kwd><kwd>transcription</kwd><kwd>chromatin remodeling</kwd><kwd>RSC</kwd><kwd>quiescence exit</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>NCI</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32CA009657</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cucinotta</surname><given-names>Christine E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>NIGMS</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F32GM131554</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cucinotta</surname><given-names>Christine E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>NIGMS</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 GM111428</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tsukiyama</surname><given-names>Toshio</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>NIGMS</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35GM139429</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tsukiyama</surname><given-names>Toshio</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Multiple mechanisms, by which a highly conserved chromatin-remodeling factor RSC facilitates initiation and maintenance of large-scale, rapid gene expression upon exit from quiescent state, have been discovered.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>For decades, scientists have used budding yeast to uncover mechanisms of chromatin regulation of gene expression, and the vast majority of these studies were performed in exponentially growing (hereafter log) cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Rando and Winston, 2012</xref>). Log phase, however, is not a common growth stage in unicellular organism lifecycles. Furthermore, many cell populations in multicellular organisms, such as in humans, are not actively dividing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sagot and Laporte, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Rittershaus et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cheung and Rando, 2013</xref>). Indeed, the majority of ‘healthy’ cells on earth are not sustained in a persistently dividing state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Rittershaus et al., 2013</xref>). Non-proliferating cells reside in a G<sub>0</sub> state, which generally means that these cells are either terminally differentiated, senescent, or quiescent. The quiescent state provides advantages to organisms: quiescence allows cells to remain dormant for long periods of time to survive harsh conditions or to prevent over-proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Rittershaus et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cheung and Rando, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Tümpel and Rudolph, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sagot and Laporte, 2019</xref>). Notwithstanding this so-called ‘dormant state’, quiescent cells can exit quiescence and re-enter the mitotic cell-cycle in response to growth cues or environmental stimuli, which distinguishes quiescence from other G<sub>0</sub> states. A major hallmark of quiescence is the chromatin landscape – vast histone de-acetylation and chromatin compaction occur during quiescence entry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">McKnight et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Young et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Swygert et al., 2019</xref>). These events happen alongside a global narrowing of nucleosome-depleted regions (NDRs) and increased resistance to micrococcal nuclease (MNase) digestion, indicating a repressive chromatin environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">McKnight et al., 2015</xref>). Together, these features of quiescent cells point to a critical role for chromatin regulation of the quiescent state. However, the role of chromatin regulation upon exit from quiescence is unknown.</p><p>Reversibility is a conserved hallmark of quiescent cells and is required for proper stem-cell niche maintenance, T-cell activation, and wound healing in metazoans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cheung and Rando, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chapman et al., 2020</xref>). We sought to elucidate molecular mechanisms by which cells can overcome this repressive chromatin environment to re-enter the mitotic cell cycle. Given its genetic tractability, the ease by which quiescent cells can be purified, and high level of conservation among chromatin and transcription machinery, we turned to the budding yeast, <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gray et al., 2004</xref>). We can easily isolate quiescent yeast cells after 7 days of growth and density-gradient centrifugation. In this context, we can study pure populations of quiescent yeast, a cell fate that is distinct from other cell types present in a saturated culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Allen et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>Since DNA is wrapped around an octamer of histone proteins in increments of ~147 bp to form nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Luger et al., 1997</xref>), enzymes must move nucleosomes to give access to transcription initiation factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lorch et al., 1987</xref>). One such enzyme is the SWI/SNF family member, RSC, which is a 17-subunit chromatin-remodeling enzyme complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hainer and Kaplan, 2020</xref>). RSC contains an ATP-dependent translocase, Sth1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cairns et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Du et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Saha et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Zofall et al., 2006</xref>), multiple subunits with bromodomains (more than half of all bromodomains in the yeast genome are in RSC) and two zinc-finger DNA-binding domains, which allow RSC to target and remodel chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kasten et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Angus-Hill et al., 2001</xref>). Many components of the RSC complex are essential for viability in budding yeast and the complex is conserved in humans, where it is named PBAF. In humans, mutations in PBAF genes are associated with 40% of kidney cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Varela et al., 2011</xref>), and 20% of all human cancers contain mutations within SWI/SNF family genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kadoch et al., 2013</xref>), underscoring the importance of such complexes in human health.</p><p>The best-described role for RSC in regulating chromatin architecture and transcription is its ability to generate NDRs, by sliding or evicting nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Badis et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hartley and Madhani, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Prajapati et al., 2020</xref>). Moving the +1 nucleosome allows for TATA binding protein (TBP) promoter binding and transcription initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kubik et al., 2018</xref>). To this end, RSC mostly localizes to the −1, +1, and +2 nucleosomes in log cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ng et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Yen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Ramachandran et al., 2015</xref>). However, RSC has also been implicated in the transcription elongation step where it tethers to RNA polymerase and can localize to gene bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Soutourina et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Spain et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Biernat et al., 2021</xref>). Additionally, RSC binds nucleosomes within the so-called ‘wide NDRs’, where there are MNase-sensitive nucleosome-sized fragments, known as ‘fragile’ nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Xi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Knight et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Teif et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kubik et al., 2015</xref>). These RSC-bound nucleosomes are likely partially unwrapped to aid in rapid gene induction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kubik et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Floer et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brahma and Henikoff, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Schlichter et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we investigated how genes are transcribed during the first minutes of quiescence exit. We were particularly interested in uncovering mechanisms to overcome highly repressive chromatin found in quiescent cells. Unexpectedly, ~50% of the yeast genome was transcribed by RNA polymerase II (Pol II) by the first 10 min of exit, despite the highly repressive chromatin architecture present in quiescence. We found that this hypertranscription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Percharde et al., 2017</xref>) event is RSC dependent and that RSC binds across the genome to ~80% of NDRs in quiescent cells. Upon RSC depletion, we observed canonical abrogation of transcription initiation, defects in Pol II clearance past the +1 nucleosome, and gross Pol II mislocalization, resulting in abnormal upstream initiation and aberrant non-coding antisense transcripts. We further showed that RSC alters chromatin structure to facilitate these processes. Taken together, we propose a model in which RSC is bound to NDRs in quiescent cells to facilitate robust and accurate burst of transcription upon quiescent exit through multiple mechanisms.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Hypertranscription occurs within minutes of nutrient repletion post-quiescence</title><p>To determine the earliest time at which transcription reactivates during quiescence exit, we fed purified quiescent cells YPD medium and took time points to determine the kinetics of Pol II C-terminal domain (CTD) phosphorylation by western blot analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Unexpectedly, Pol II CTD phosphorylation occurred within 3 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, compare lanes 1 and 2), which was our physical limit of isolating cells during this time course. To determine which transcripts were generated during these early quiescence exit events, we performed nascent RNA-seq using 4-thiouracil (4tU) to metabolically label new transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Miller et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Duffy et al., 2015</xref>). In agreement with the western blot analysis, we observed a high level of transcriptional activation within a few minutes of nutrient repletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Based on our western blot result, the highest Pol II CTD phosphorylation is observed ~10 min after refeeding. Consistent with this result, we observed the highest level of nascent transcripts at the 10 min time point, where 3202 RNAs (~50% of annotated loci) were statistically significantly increased by twofold compared to the 0 min time point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Given how quickly Pol II was phosphorylated and transcripts were generated, we sought to determine whether high levels of Pol II were already bound to the early exit genes in the quiescent state, as was observed previously in a heterogenous population of stationary phase cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Radonjic et al., 2005</xref>). To this end, we performed spike-in-normalized ChIP-seq analysis of Pol II in quiescent cells and at several time points following refeeding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Low Pol II occupancy levels (compare heatmaps 1 and 5) were detected in quiescent cells, which agrees with our western blot and RNA-seq analyses and previously published literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">McKnight et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Young et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Swygert et al., 2019</xref>). This implied that Pol II is not paused (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, compare heatmaps 1 and 2) in quiescent cells and suggested that Pol II needs to be recruited de novo for rapid initiation and elongation. In support of this conclusion, we detected only low levels of the pre-initiation complex subunit TFIIB bound to genes in quiescent cells, which increased approximately threefold by 5 min of exit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>), despite no changes in the abundance of the protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Rapid hypertranscription occurs upon nutrient repletion of quiescent cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Western blots were probed with antibodies to detect Ser5p and Ser2p of the CTD of Rpb1 subunit of Pol II.

Indeed, when the data were sorted into k-means clusters across the time course, we noticed that many of the genes expressed in the 240 min time point were similar, but still not identical, to those expressed in log cells, suggesting a recovery to log-like gene expression profile takes hours post refeeding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, compare columns 4 and 5, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).

To this end, we performed ChIP-seq analysis of H3 to measure nucleosome occupancy levels genome wide over time. Global H3 patterns during the early exit time points, especially at the 5 min time point, were more similar to that of the quiescent state than to the 240 min time point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, compare columns 1–3), despite higher transcription levels.

To test this, we performed ChIP-seq analysis of H4ac using an antibody that recognizes penta-acetylated H4. Similar to nucleosome occupancy and positions, a modest increase in histone H4 acetylation occurred, but the levels did not reflect that of log cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D,E</xref>). This suggests that, while there was a strong transcriptional response during refeeding, histone acetylation was delayed. This is consistent with a previous study of a mixed population of saturated cultures where histone acetylation was found to occur later in exit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mews et al., 2014</xref>). Together, our results are in agreement with a recent study demonstrating that histone acetylation takes place mostly as a consequence of transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Martin et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>To assess a biological readout of the repressive chromatin environment, we turned to phenotypic analysis of TFIIS disruption. TFIIS is a general elongation factor that rescues stalled Pol II, and nucleosomal barriers have been shown to increase stalled Pol II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Noe Gonzalez et al., 2021</xref>). Given that Pol II stalling is common across the genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Churchman and Weissman, 2011</xref>), it is paradoxical that the gene encoding TFIIS is not essential for viability in actively dividing cells, and its deletion does not cause strong growth defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hubert et al., 1983</xref>). Since Pol II must achieve a high level of transcription in the repressive chromatin environment during early quiescence exit, we hypothesized that TFIIS may play more critical roles during this period than during log culture. Indeed, in the absence of TFIIS (<italic>dst1∆</italic>), quiescent yeast cells exhibited defects in cell-cycle re-entry, where cells lacking TFIIS stall at the first G1 during exit, which is not the case during the mitotic cell cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>).

Additionally, it was proposed that RSC-bound nucleosomes are remodeling intermediates that render such nucleosomes more MNase sensitive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brahma and Henikoff, 2019</xref>). Thus, RSC was a strong candidate for regulating rapid transcription activation during quiescence exit. We performed ChIP-seq analysis of the RSC catalytic subunit Sth1 in quiescent cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</xref>).

In contrast to the heat shock response, however, we observed a stable, strong binding pattern of RSC in NDRs regardless of NDR width (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Another obvious distinction of RSC binding patterns between log and quiescence was observed at tRNA genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>).

In quiescence, RSC was occluded from tRNAs genes. Whereas upon exit, RSC rapidly targeted tRNAs, mimicking the log pattern.

To this end, we compared localization of RSC and Pol II in quiescence and exit. We first found that the presence of RSC at NDRs in quiescent cells and strong transcription in exiting cells co-localized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3A</xref>). Next, we examined RSC occupancy changes during quiescence exit at Pol II-transcribed genes. During quiescence exit, RSC began to move out of NDRs and into gene bodies as transcription increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>).

As is the case in log cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Parnell et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kubik et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Klein-Brill et al., 2019</xref>), Pol II occupancy decreased in the absence of an intact RSC complex in Q cells and upon nutrient repletion thereafter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Pol II occupancy did eventually increase over time in the RSC-depleted samples. However, even after 30 min, Pol II did not reach the peak level of occupancy seen at the 10 min mark in the +RSC condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, compare heatmaps 3 and 8, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). This suggests that the defect in Pol II occupancy during quiescence exit was not solely due to slower kinetics during the initial exit stage.</p><p>As shown earlier in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>, we observed RSC leaving the NDRs and moving into gene bodies during quiescence exit. Therefore, we examined the impact of RSC depletion on nucleosome occupancy and positioning. H3 ChIP-seq showed that RSC is required for removal of histones within NDRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>), which is consistent with RSC’s role as the ‘NDR creator’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hartley and Madhani, 2009</xref>). We then plotted the data into the same k-means clusters shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and cross compared TFIIB and RSC occupancy with RSC depletion on Pol II, nucleosome positions, and H3 occupancy at these sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Genes across all clusters showed decreased Pol II occupancy, indicating Pol II loading defects shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>. However, genes that had high TFIIB levels and were strongly expressed (clusters 1 and 2) still exhibited detectable Pol II occupancy when RSC was depleted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). This coincided with a reduction in MNase-sensitive nucleosomes even in the absence of RSC. While H3 levels increased at clusters 1 and 2, these genes had the lowest H3 occupancy even in the absence of RSC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Together, these data suggest that chromatin regulation by RSC is the key contributor to Pol II occupancy defects during quiescence exit when RSC is depleted. We, however, note that transcriptional defects upon RSC depletion, rather than the loss of RSC itself, can be at least partly responsible for chromatin defects observed upon RSC depletion.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>RSC is required for Pol II passage through gene bodies</title><p>Given that RSC moves from NDRs into gene bodies during quiescence exit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>), we next tested whether RSC could aid transcription after initiation.

First, consistent with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, the robust increase in the amount of Pol II over genes is strongly decreased upon RSC depletion. In addition, upon RSC depletion, Pol II sharply accumulates at transcription start sites (TSSs) at the 5 min mark, which continued to the 10 min mark. In sharp contrast, PoI II accumulates at slightly more downstream at the 5 min mark and moves mostly to downstream regions at the 10 min time point in the presence of RSC. At these loci, NDRs are relatively shallow in quiescence but histone density rapidly decreases upon quiescence exit in the presence of RSC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). In the absence of RSC at these sites, however, histone density is unexpectedly lower at NDRs in quiescence but does not change during quiescence exit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>), suggesting defective chromatin structure at and downstream of the NDR.

These results suggest that RSC facilitates selection of accurate transcription initiation sites through proper NDR formation upstream of protein coding genes during the burst of transcription during quiescence exit.

We found antisense transcripts arising in the absence of RSC, particularly at clusters I and IV.

Most genes had RSC bound at the promoters of the sense genes in quiescence, with highest RSC binding in the cluster I genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). Strikingly, nucleosome positioning and occupancy were heavily impacted in the cluster I and IV genes upon RSC depletion in the sense direction, where NDRs became more resistant to MNase and nucleosomes in gene bodies were shifted toward the 5′-ends of genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C,D</xref>).

In both clusters of genes, RSC signals and RSC-dependent chromatin changes are not apparent around the start sites of antisense transcripts. Therefore, suppression of antisense transcripts is unlikely to be a direct role for RSC.

NDRs that are open despite RSC depletion become cryptic promoters and are utilized by transcription machinery to generate aberrant lncRNAs and antisense transcripts (<bold>E</bold>).</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-67033-fig8-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Quiescent yeast must downregulate their transcriptional program and generate a repressive chromatin environment in order to survive harsh conditions for extended time periods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gray et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">McKnight et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Spain et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Poramba-Liyanage et al., 2020</xref>). How, then, do cells rapidly escape the quiescent state when conditions are favorable? In this study, we show that there is a broad and robust transcriptional response to nutrient repletion after quiescence, notwithstanding a relatively repressive chromatin environment that persists until the first G2/M phase after quiescence. Indeed, we identified a previously unknown phenotype for the deletion of the gene encoding yeast TFIIS, <italic>dst1∆</italic>. High numbers of stalled Pol II are present in cycling cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Churchman and Weissman, 2011</xref>) despite the little impact of deleting <italic>DST1</italic> on cycling cell growth. We speculate cells exiting quiescence may rely more heavily on TFIIS to transcribe through repressive chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kireeva et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bondarenko et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>During quiescence, RSC re-locates to NDR upstream of Pol II-transcribed genes that are transcribed in exit. Although RSC binds and regulates chromatin around Pol III genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ng et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Parnell et al., 2008</xref>), RSC is depleted at tRNA genes in quiescence and only returns during quiescence exit, further supporting the notion that RSC is globally re-targeted in quiescence. This is distinct from the transient NDR re-localization observed in heat shock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Vinayachandran et al., 2018</xref>), as what we observed in quiescence was a sustained and rather stable localization. How RSC binds to these new locations in quiescence is unknown. Given the distinct structure of quiescent chromatin there are several, non-mutually exclusive, explanations for RSC’s binding pattern in quiescence. (1) The genome is hypoacetylated and thus RSC can no longer bind to acetylated nucleosomes in quiescence via its bromodomains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kasten et al., 2004</xref>). However, given the highly robust response to refeeding, RSC activity must be poised to be active in this state. An intriguing possibility could be that histone acetylation inhibits RSC activity to some extent as was recently reported in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lorch et al., 2018</xref>). This would be consistent with the rapid changes in nucleosome positioning at many genes during quiescence exit in the absence of high levels of histone acetylation. (2) Recent structural studies have shown that the nucleosome acidic patch is in direct contact with subunits of the RSC complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Ye et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Patel et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Wagner et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Baker et al., 2021</xref>). If the acidic patch is occluded by hypoacetylated H4 tails in quiescence for example (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Luger et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Shogren-Knaak et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Robinson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allahverdi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Swygert et al., 2020</xref>), it is possible that RSC can no longer interact with this region of the nucleosome, rendering its binding abilities different in quiescence. Finally, (3) a lack of Pol II activity in quiescent cells could prevent RSC from moving out of NDRs and into gene bodies. Indeed, transcription appears to play a prominent role in RSC localization: RSC moves into gene bodies during transcription activation and this movement is blocked when transcription is inhibited, as we have reported above. It is likely that a combination of transcription and histone acetylation helps pull RSC into gene bodies, given recent work showing that acetylation is a consequence of transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Martin et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>An additional model we favor is one in which RSC’s activity is reduced in quiescence, in part, due to reduced ATP levels during glucose starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Özalp et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Laporte et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Joyner et al., 2016</xref>). It is possible, then, that we could infer RSC activity from its binding pattern at NDRs versus at the +1 nucleosome and beyond. According to this model, RSC sitting at NDRs in quiescence is inactive or has low biochemical activities. RSC-dependent chromatin remodeling could then be greatly aided by high levels of Pol II upon quiescence exit. Pol II is known to disrupt nucleosomes, which facilitates binding of other chromatin regulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kireeva et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Schwabish and Struhl, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kulaeva et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Martin et al., 2018</xref>). Nucleosome disruption by Pol II could thus allow RSC to function more readily in low ATP conditions during early stages of quiescence exit. Consistent with this model, we see high Pol II activity relative to other sites at a subset of genes in quiescent cells, where RSC localizes to fragile nucleosomes and outside the NDR at the +1 nucleosomes. Additionally, at these sites, RSC moves more readily toward gene bodies during quiescence exit as Pol II occupancy increased.</p><p>In a separate study, we recently found that the SWI/SNF remodeling enzyme promotes transcription of a subset of hypoacetylated genes during quiescence entry, implying a specialized transcription regulation program for essential genes in the wake of widespread transcriptional shutdown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Spain et al., 2018</xref>). In cycling cells, it was recently shown that RSC and SWI/SNF cooperate at a subset of genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Rawal et al., 2018</xref>). Our results suggested that cooperation between the two SWI/SNF class remodeling factors may also occur during quiescence entry.</p><p>Consistent with co-transcriptional re-localization, our data suggest that RSC plays an active role in helping Pol II transcribe past the +1 nucleosome in addition to initiating transcription. Supporting this idea was our observation of a subset of genes where RSC depletion caused a Pol II enrichment around the +1 nucleosome. Previous reports showed that RSC can bind gene bodies and impact elongating and terminating Pol II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Spain et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ocampo et al., 2019</xref>), and one study showed interactions between the Rsc4 subunit and all three RNA polymerases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Soutourina et al., 2006</xref>). An intriguing possibility could be that RSC directly interacts with Pol II to facilitate transcription past the first few nucleosomes.</p><p>The transcriptional response during quiescent exit was dampened by depleting the essential chromatin remodeler, RSC, but it did not diminish completely. Pol II occupancy was globally decreased approximately twofold at the 10 min time point in RSC-depleted cells. However, in some cases, we found reduced sense transcription and increased antisense transcription. This was largely due to a nearby NDR susceptible to transcription initiation that could be co-opted for antisense transcription. The mechanism that allows for this cryptic transcription is still unknown. Chromatin-remodeling enzymes are vastly important for repressing antisense lncRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Han and Chang, 2015</xref>). Different chromatin-remodeling enzymes function to repress lncRNA transcripts in cycling cells, including RSC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alcid and Tsukiyama, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Marquardt et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gill et al., 2020</xref>). We speculate RSC is particularly suitable to regulate global transcriptome during quiescence exit due to its high abundance, which allows it to function through multiple mechanisms. The mouse embryonic stem-cell-specific BAF complex was also recently shown to globally repress lncRNA expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hainer et al., 2015</xref>). This raises the possibility that some of our observations in yeast quiescent cells could be conserved in mammalian quiescent cells. Given the robust transcriptional response that occurs during quiescence exit, it is likely that chromatin structure is crucial for maintaining the quality of the transcriptome. Indeed, we noted cases where transcription occurred upstream of the canonical TSS when an NDR was not generated, highlighting the defects in Pol II initiation and start site selection due to chromatin defects in the absence of RSC. Hypertranscription events similar to the one observed during quiescence exit occur throughout all organisms, particularly during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Percharde et al., 2017</xref>). Therefore, it is quite possible that we will see similar, multifaceted roles for RSC homologs or other abundant chromatin-remodeling factors in facilitating proper hypertranscription in many other systems.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or <break/>reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (<italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>)</td><td valign="top">WT;

We also include an acceptance summary that explains what the editors found interesting or important about the work.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Acceptance summary:</bold></p><p>Cucinotta et al. describe the transcription that occurs within minutes of nutrient repletion as <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> yeast cells emerge from quiescence, noting an unexpected, intense burst of expression from much of the genome. They focus primarily on the role of the nucleosome remodeler RSC in managing chromatin architecture over promoters during quiescence and as cells re-enter the cell cycle using a broad range of genome-wide measurements that strongly support the conclusions. This important process of cell cycle re-entry from the quiescent state is understudied but impacts a range of phenomena from development and carcinogenesis in multicellular organisms to adaptation of microorganisms to environmental cues, so the results will be of interest to a broad audience.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;RSC primes the quiescent genome for hypertranscription upon cell cycle re-entry&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Tim Formosa as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Jessica Tyler as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Note that while the reviewers felt strongly that more integration of, and cross-correlation among the datasets would improve the impact of this work, the suggestions for ways to do that listed below are individually optional. The long list of recommendations may look daunting, but the authors are encouraged to view them as potential options, not as a list that has to be completed.</p><p>1. Integration and correlation of different datasets should be enhanced. For example, a heatmap of the MNase-seq, TFIIB-seq, and RSC ChIP-seq data using the gene clusters in Figure 1C could be used to correlate induction of transcription with RSC occupancy, favorable NDR width, and binding of TFIIB. Another example would be to examine whether genes with transcription defects due to RSC depletion show greater changes in promoter nucleosome occupancy when compared to unaffected genes. Some attempt at this was made in Figures 6 and 7, but more analysis of this type would provide better support for the key conclusions.</p><p>2. Improvements should be made to the bioinformatic and statistical handling of the data. The existing bioinformatic tools employed are appropriate, but they are not consistently applied for different experiments. How specific gene groups were chosen or clustered should be more carefully explained, and, if appropriate, cut-offs listed. Similar information should be included to support statements in the text (i.e. ~1000 genes have fragile nucleosomes, Sth1 bound to ~80% of NDRs). Some of the data is &quot;normalized&quot; but it isn't always clear what it is normalized to (spike-ins? Input?). Statistical analyses should be used to back up key results.</p><p>3. Authors should acknowledge the impact of the delayed exit from quiescence following RSC depletion on their results. Cells that were able to exit are likely those with subtle differences in chromatin packing over a handful of genes required for exit. Cells that do not exit are left with quiescence signatures, which could be due to the lack of transcription as opposed to lack of RSC.</p><p>4. The authors Pol II occupancy data via ChIP-seq with and without RSC depletion. Could these locations be compared with the transcription changes shown in Figure 1 to demonstrate which groups of genes are altered?</p><p>5. In Figure 1, it is interesting that some of the clusters show sustained expression (Cluster 1), but some have hyper-transcription that is then reduced to log levels (Clusters 2 and 3). Is there a difference between these and RSC occupancy; or specific changes to one of these clusters when RSC is depleted? Furthermore, what genes make up these clusters?</p><p>6. In Figure 3a, the authors show a decrease in fragile nucleosome occupancy through low MNase upon exit from quiescence. Is the effect more pronounced in a subset of genes such as just quartile 1, with the widest NDR? Similarly, does an analysis of MNase data at only those locations with the highest RSC occupancy produce a different outcome?</p><p>7.

In Figure 4, the authors find that Pol II occupancy never reaches the 10-minute hyper-transcription enrichment when RSC is depleted. Do the cells ever reach this peak, or are they unable to obtain this hyper-transcription in the absence of RSC?</p><p>9. Figure 5A shows that RSC occupancy changes to decrease over NDRs and increase over gene bodies. The authors then follow with inhibiting Pol II, and show an accumulation of Pol II at NDRs and decreasing over gene bodies. Do these data correlate? For example, does an ROC curve show correlation? Or if you compare the datasets do they show that the largest changes in Pol II distribution occur at the locations where RSC redistributes?</p><p>10. Does the increased aberrant transcription shown in Figure 7 correlate with the level of RSC occupancy or the change in occupancy of Pol II?</p><p>11. While Figure 8 accurately summarizes the key results of this study, more molecular insight either here or in the discussion would be helpful. One model is that RSC has a preference for &quot;easy to remodel&quot; nucleosomes, such as fragile nucleosomes. In quiescence, due to lack of ATP, RSC might be less able to evict these nucleosomes and becomes stuck at NDRs. Following the eviction of fragile nucleosomes at cells exit quiescence, RSC might move onto other &quot;easy to remodel&quot; nucleosomes, such as those partially disrupted by Pol II. This, or some mechanism preferred by the authors, might be discussed to help the reader.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1) In the abstract, the authors state that ~60% of the genome is transcribed during the first 10 minutes after exit, but the data in figure 1 state that ~20% of genes are transcribed above the cutoff. It would be useful to reconcile this apparent discrepancy, and also to state whether the percentage of transcription is based on gene number or the total fraction of the genome.</p><p>2) On line 156, the authors note a result in &quot;Fig. 2-supplement 1B&quot; but there is no figure that matches this description or seems to be related to the statement being supported.</p><p>3) On line 169, the authors state that &quot;the MNase-sensitivity of the +1 and +2 nucleosomes increased at the 10-minute time point&quot; but this conclusion is not evident in Fig 3. The effect on the left side of the NDR in 3A-3B is clear, but the reader will need more guidance with seeing the change that supports the statement above.</p><p>4) The flow cytometry result in Fig 4A +RSC seems like it should be similar to the results in Fig1-Sup-D and 2F, but instead it looks like a fully occupied G2 delay/arrest. Can the authors explain the difference?</p><p>5) In Fig 5C, the authors describe the rise in Pol II ChIP signal at +1 Kb as a termination delay. It seems more appropriate to perform gene-averaging (TSS to TTS) or to align all termination sites instead of looking at 1 Kb past the TSS, which is early in some genes and late in others.</p><p>6) The basis for placing genes in Class I and II in Fig 7 is not clear. The text says that Class I has high antisense and &quot;generally reduced sense&quot; transcripts. This seems mostly true, although about 20% of the Sense levels are up significantly. Class II, however, is described as having &quot;modest changes in both sense and antisense transcript levels,&quot; but sense ranges from significantly up to significantly down, and antisense from down to strongly down. The authors should describe the rationale for defining these classes more clearly; are they based initially on levels of antisense transcripts? Without a clearer understanding of how these classes are defined, it is difficult to determine whether or not the conclusions drawn are supported.</p><p>7) On line 327, it is not clear what an &quot;incredibly strong&quot; transcriptional response would be, so another adjective might be more appropriate.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I find the data very compelling and complete in the description of RSC regulating exist from quiescence. As mentioned in the public review, some aspects of data comparisons could be made. Some examples are listed below. While some may not be necessary, some of these may help to strengthen conclusions:</p><p>1) The authors Pol II occupancy data via ChIP-seq with and without RSC depletion. Could these locations be compared with the transcription changes shown in Figure 1 to demonstrate which groups of genes are altered?</p><p>2) In Figure 1, it is interesting that some of the clusters show sustained expression (Cluster 1), but some have hypertranscription that is then reduced to log levels (Clusters 2 and 3). Is there a difference between these and RSC occupancy; or specific changes to one of these clusters when RSC is depleted? Furthermore, what genes make up these clusters?</p><p>3) In Figure 3a, the authors show a decrease in fragile nucleosome occupancy through low MNase upon exit from Q. This is a metaplot of all genes, and I am curious if the authors see more pronounced results if they show just quartile 1, with the widest NDR.

It is surprising that little attempt was made to integrate the results from the various analyses. For example, a heatmap of the MNase-seq, TFIIB-seq, and RSC ChIP-seq data using the gene clusters in Figure 1C would show that gene induction following Q exit is linked to RSC occupancy, favorable NDR width, and binding of TFIIB. Another example would be to examine whether genes with transcription defects due to RSC depletion show greater changes in promoter nucleosome occupancy when compared to unaffected genes. Some attempt at this was made in Figures 6 and 7, but I thought that more connections would better support the key results of this study.</p><p>2. Improvements should be made to the bioinformatic and statistical handling of the data. The existing bioinformatic tools employed are fine, but they are not consistently applied for different experiments. How specific gene groups were chosen or clustered should be more carefully explained, and, if appropriate, cut-offs listed. Similar information should be included to support statements in the text (i.e. ~1000 genes have fragile nucleosomes, Sth1 bound to ~80% of NDRs). Some of the data is &quot;normalized&quot; but it isn't always clear what it is normalized to (spike-ins? Input?). Statistical analyses should be used to back up key results.</p><p>3. Authors should acknowledge the impact of the delayed Q-exit following RSC depletion on their results. Cells that were able to exit are likely those with subtle differences in chromatin packing over a handful of genes required for Q exit (down the road identifying these might be possible using SGA?). Cells that do not exit are left with Q signatures, which could be due to the lack of transcription upon Q exit as opposed to lack of RSC.</p><p>4.

Integration and correlation of different datasets should be enhanced.

In summary, we found the following: genes with widest NDRs (clusters 1 and 2) have high levels of TFIIB (Figure 4—supplement 1A) and Pol II during early exit. While these two clusters were impacted by RSC depletion, some level of Pol II occupancy remained (Figure 4—supplement 1B). We believe redundant factors may enable transcription to occur at these genes (ex: other remodelers or transcription factors). Furthermore, these genes (clusters 1 and 2) also had the widest NDRs and lowest H3 occupancy regardless of RSC, although we did see H3 occupancy rise in the absence of RSC (Figure 4—supplement 4C). RSC occupancy levels did not correlate with transcription levels or NDR width (highest RSC occupancy present at clusters 2 and 4; Figure 4—supplement 4D), with cluster 1 transcription and NDR width deviating from RSC occupancy the most. We again believe this could be due to redundant factors at loci in cluster 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

We have added a heatmap of RSC occupancy in Q cells and during early exit at these loci (new Figure 4—supplement 1), and discuss in page 12, lines 261-270. We note differences in the RSC profile: specifically striking to us was how much RSC remains in the NDR vs the gene body. Genes showing more RSC movement into the gene body (clusters 1 and 2) also had the highest binding of Pol II in exit. All genes had reduced Pol II occupancy however clusters 1 and 2 still had detectable levels of Pol II occupancy. We included a new figure showing the top five GO terms for each cluster (new Figure 1—supplement 2), and discuss on page 7, lines 129-131. Cluster 1 had the highest enrichment of GO terms and contained genes involved in rRNA processing and translation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6.

We believe that this illustrates the difference of RSC localization with and without phenanthroline, as there are further differences at different clusters. The most striking changes are in clusters 1 and 2, where Pol II is normally highly bound. At these sites, RSC movement is dramatically sequestered to the NDR when phenanthroline is added, supporting our conclusion that RSC co-transcriptionally moves into gene bodies.

Does the increased aberrant transcription shown in Figure 7 correlate with the level of RSC occupancy or the change in occupancy of Pol II?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this question. While it would have been very interesting if so, we did not observe any correlation with the levels of RSC occupancy or Pol II occupancy. We believe that increased aberrant transcription occurs when an unaffected or “wide-enough” NDR is present and increased transcription is thus an indirect effect of RSC depletion rather than direct action of RSC at these loci (discussed on page 16, lines 404-410).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11.
