heterogeneous population of mesenchymal cells supporting tumor progression, whose origin remains to be fully elucidated. Osterix (Osx) is a marker of osteogenic differentiation, expressed in skeletal progenitor stem cells and bone-forming osteoblasts. We report <italic>Osx</italic> expression in CAFs and by using Osx-cre;TdTomato reporter mice we confirm the presence and pro-tumorigenic function of TdT<sup>OSX</sup>+ cells in extra-skeletal tumors. Surprisingly, only a minority of TdT<sup>OSX</sup>+ cells expresses fibroblast and osteogenic markers. The majority of TdT<sup>OSX</sup>+ cells express the hematopoietic marker CD45, have a genetic and phenotypic profile resembling that of tumor infiltrating myeloid and lymphoid populations, but with higher expression of lymphocytic immune suppressive genes. We find <italic>Osx</italic> transcript and Osx protein expression early during hematopoiesis, in subsets of hematopoietic stem cells and multipotent progenitor populations. Our results indicate that <italic>Osx</italic> marks distinct tumor promoting CD45- and CD45+ populations and challenge the dogma that Osx is expressed exclusively in cells of mesenchymal origin.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>osterix</kwd><kwd>cancer</kwd><kwd>TME</kwd><kwd>CAF</kwd><kwd>bone</kwd><kwd>HSC</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 CA235096</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Faccio</surname><given-names>Roberta</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 AR066551</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Faccio</surname><given-names>Roberta</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Shriners Hospital</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P19-07408CR</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Faccio</surname><given-names>Roberta</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Siteman Cancer Center</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Civitelli</surname><given-names>Roberto</given-names></name><name><surname>Faccio</surname><given-names>Roberta</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>JIT Award by Washinghton University Institute for Clinical and Translational Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>TR000448</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fontana</surname><given-names>Francesca</given-names></name><name><surname>Civitelli</surname><given-names>Roberto</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Osterix, a transcription factor regulating osteoblast differentiation and bone formation, is expressed in subsets of CAFs with osteogenic features and marks tumor infiltrating immune populations enriched in immune suppressive markers.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In the past couple of decades the common beliefs of how an incipient tumor grows and progresses to a metastatic stage have drastically changed due to the increasing findings of a tight crosstalk between tumor cells and the surrounding stroma, known as the tumor microenvironment (TME) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hanahan and Weinberg, 2011</xref>). Tumor stroma comprises a variety of different cells from the mesenchymal and hematopoietic compartments, with pro- and anti-tumor functions. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are cells of the mesenchymal lineage involved in supporting various stages of tumorigenesis from growth to metastatic dissemination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kalluri and Zeisberg, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen and Song, 2019</xref>). Their abundance and phenotypic markers differ among the various types of cancers. CAFs support tumor growth by stimulating tumor cell proliferation, inhibiting apoptotic signals and anti-tumor immune responses, altering the extra-cellular matrix (ECM) to favor invasiveness, and by offering protection from chemotherapeutic approaches. Their heterogeneity probably accounts for the different tumor promoting effects and reflects the fact that CAFs can originate from multiple cellular sources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen and Song, 2019</xref>). Several studies indicate that CAFs derive from bone marrow mesenchymal stem and progenitor cells recruited at the tumor site. Additional evidence indicates that they can also derive from myofibroblasts, as well as from the trans-differentiation of local pericytes, endothelial and epithelial cells. In breast cancer, subsets of bone marrow-derived CAFs can exhibit a unique inflammatory profile depending on the location to which they are recruited, thus being functionally distinct from the resident CAFs and having better tumor-promoting functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Raz et al., 2018</xref>). Adding more complexity to the origin of CAFs, an additional population expressing several markers commonly found in fibroblasts and CAFs, is the fibrocyte (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abe et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">McDonald and LaRue, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">van Deventer et al., 2013</xref>). Fibrocytes originate from the bone marrow, where they have been described to contribute to bone marrow fibrosis under pathological conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ohishi et al., 2012</xref>). These cells have also been implicated in supporting tumor progression, but they differ from the bone marrow-derived CAF populations in that they also express the hematopoietic marker CD45, along with markers associated with the monocyte/macrophage lineage populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abe et al., 2001</xref>). Fibrocytes support tumor growth by making collagen, albeit at lower levels than the CAFs, releasing growth factors, commonly produced by immune suppressive myeloid cells, and by modulating resistance to anti-angiogenic therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Goto and Nishioka, 2017</xref>). Recent single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) studies further confirmed the complexity of the CAF populations, suggesting tumor specificity as well as functional differences among the various subsets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bartoschek et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Costa et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Elyada et al., 2019</xref>). However, these studies did not directly address the origin of the various subsets, which could account for their specific cellular phenotype.</p><p>Because of their ability to produce collagen and other extracellular matrix proteins, we sought to determine whether a subset of bone marrow-derived CAFs could share markers of committed osteolineage cells. Osteolineage cells derive from bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and their differentiation program is driven by sequential activation of two specific transcription factors, <italic>Runx2</italic> and <italic>Sp7(Osx gene)</italic>, and subsequent acquisition of a phenotype characterized by the ability to produce bone matrix, primarily type I collagen, and to mineralize (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nakashima et al., 2002</xref>). Although Osx is largely thought as a marker of differentiated osteoblasts, emerging data demonstrate that in the embryonic and perinatal bone marrow <italic>Sp7</italic> is expressed in definitive MSCs that give rise to the marrow stroma, including osteoblasts and adipocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Liu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mizoguchi et al., 2014</xref>). Furthermore, during embryogenesis, Osx is present in extra-skeletal tissues, including the olfactory bulb, the intestine and the kidney (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jia et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Based on the above observations, we hypothesized that a subset of CAFs, derived from Osx+ cells in the bone marrow, contributes to ECM (i.e. collagen) production at the tumor site, thereby creating a tumor supporting stroma. Using a cell tracking system, we found the presence of cells targeted by the Osx promoter within the TME; these TdT<sup>OSX</sup>+ cells favor tumor growth when co-injected with tumor cells in mice. Surprisingly, only a minority of tumor-resident cells derived from Osx+ cells expresses fibroblast markers, extracellular matrix and matrix remodeling genes. The majority of these newly identified TdT<sup>OSX</sup>+ tumor infiltrating cells are also positive for CD45, a marker of hematopoietic lineage, and share markers expressed by tumor-infiltrating immune cells. Importantly, we confirmed <italic>Sp7</italic> transcripts and Osx protein in a subset of hematopoietic stem cells (HSC), giving rise to TdT<sup>OSX</sup>+;CD45+ tumor infiltrating immune populations. This study further identifies new populations of TME cells targeted by Osx and challenges the use of Osx-cre driven lineage tracing mouse models to exclusively study mesenchymal lineage cell fate.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Embryonic and adult-derived osteolineage Osx+ cells are present in extra-skeletal tumors</title><p>To determine whether osteolineage cells may be present in the TME, we crossed the established tetracycline-dependent <italic>Tg(Sp7-tTA,tetO-EGFP/cre)1Amc/J</italic> (Osx-cre) to the <italic>B6.Cg-Gt(ROSA)26Sortm9(CAG-tdTomato)Hze/J</italic> (TdT) to generate the Osx-cre;TdT reporter mouse model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rodda and McMahon, 2006</xref>). When constitutively activated, TdT marks the entire osteolineage, including bone surface osteoblasts, osteocytes and bone marrow cells with mesenchymal stem and osteoprogenitor cell features; while delaying Osx-cre expression until postnatally restricts TdT targeting to committed osteoblasts and osteocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mizoguchi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fontana et al., 2017</xref>). Therefore, Osx-cre;TdT mice and control animals carrying only the TdT transgene (WT;TdT) were kept on standard chow to allow constitutive embryonic transgene activation, or fed a doxycycline (doxy)-containing diet until weaning to suppress transgene activation until one month of age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We previously reported that doxy-fed mice display less than 1% of spontaneous recombination in the bone residing osteoblasts at weaning, but full transgene activation 1 month thereafter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fontana et al., 2017</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Embryonic and adult-derived Osx+ cells are present in primary tumors at extra-skeletal sites.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Doxycycline (doxy)-repressible Sp7-cre/loxP mouse model used to activate Ai9/TdTomato expression for lineage tracing experiments.

To account for the possible growth delay sometimes observed in no-doxy fed Osx-cre mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Davey et al., 2012</xref>), tumor cells were injected at 12 weeks of age, when the growth delay is fully recovered. Importantly, no differences in tumor growth were observed in age and sex matched Osx-cre;TdT and WT;TdT mice, excluding any potential confounding effect of the Osx-cre (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). To assess the presence of osteolineage Osx+ derived cells within the tumor stroma of no doxy-fed mice, we performed flow cytometry analysis on B16-F10 and PyMT tumors isolated 2 weeks post-inoculation, and found that about 10–18% of the total cells were TdT<sup>OSX</sup>+ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and D</xref>). Histological analysis of frozen sections from the same tumors confirmed the presence of TdT<sup>OSX</sup>+ cells. These cells had either round or elongated shape, indicating morphologic heterogeneity within the TdT<sup>OSX</sup>+ population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and E</xref>). These TdT<sup>OSX</sup>+ cells within the tumor stroma of no-doxy mice may derive from resident Osx-expressing embryonic progenitors or from mobilization of bone marrow Osx+ cells.</p><p>Remarkably, TdT<sup>OSX</sup>+ cells were also present in the B16-F10 and PyMT TME of doxy-fed animals 4 weeks post weaning, although their numbers were lower than in tumors isolated from no doxy-treated mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F and H</xref>). Fluorescence micrographs also confirmed the presence of TdT<sup>OSX</sup>+ cells in the stroma in both tumor models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G and I</xref>), with the same pleiotropic morphology as seen in no doxy-treated mice. Thus, embryonic and adult-derived osteolineage Osx+ cells are present in the stroma of extra-skeletal tumors.

Interestingly, among the top genes upregulated in the TdT<sup>OSX</sup>+ CD45+ subsets versus the CD45 single positive populations (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>), we found many genes expressed by tumor promoting immune cells, such as regulatory T cells (i.e. <italic>Foxp3</italic>) and gamma-delta T cells (i.e. <italic>Tcrg-C1</italic>). The most upregulated gene in the TdT<sup>OSX</sup>+;CD45+ subset (&gt;80 fold versus CD45 single positive) was <italic>Cd163l1</italic>, a marker of gamma-delta IL-17 producing cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tan et al., 2019</xref>) and M2 macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">González-Domínguez et al., 2015</xref>), two tumor-promoting immune populations.

The second most expressed gene was Lymphotoxin beta (<italic>Ltb</italic>), a cytokine produced by lymphocytes and NK cells and associated with carcinogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wolf et al., 2010</xref>). The third one, <italic>Klrg1</italic>, negatively regulates cytotoxic lymphocytes and is associated with lymphocyte senescence and dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Henson and Akbar, 2009</xref>).

To standardize the comparison between the TdT<sup>OSX</sup>+;CD45+ and TdT<sup>OSX</sup>-;CD45+ (single positive) populations within each sample, data were represented as percentage of either total TdT<sup>OSX</sup>+;CD45+ or total CD45 single positive cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C and D</xref>). TdT<sup>OSX</sup>+;CD45+ subset expressed both myeloid and lymphoid markers, with a similar pattern as the CD45 single positive cells. In both subsets, the majority of the tumor immune infiltrate included myeloid populations, which represented about 60% of the TdT<sup>OSX</sup>+;CD45+ and over 70% of the total CD45 single positive cells. Lymphoid cells appeared to be more abundant among the TdT<sup>OSX</sup>+;CD45+ (32.3 ± 6.5%), compared to the TdT<sup>OSX</sup>-;CD45+ cells (23.3 ± 4.3%).

In skeletal metastases, crosstalk between bone residing cells, osteoblasts and osteoclasts, and tumor cells drives tumor growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Weilbaecher et al., 2011</xref>). Recent studies also suggest that osteoblasts and their secretory products stimulate the expansion of bone marrow-derived myeloid populations, which in turn escape the bone marrow and reach distant sites to support tumor growth by inhibiting anti-tumor immune responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">D'Amico et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Engblom et al., 2017</xref>). Our study demonstrates that a transcription factor required for osteoblast differentiation, Osterix, marks pro-tumorigenic stromal cells infiltrating extra-skeletal tumors. A possible role of Osx in tumorigenesis is emerging from human studies as well showing that presence of <italic>Sp7</italic> in the tumor is associated with poor patient survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yao et al., 2019</xref>). Our own analysis of published gene microarray data of breast cancer stroma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Finak et al., 2008</xref>), reveals higher <italic>Sp7</italic> expression in tumor stroma relative to healthy tissue from the same subject, corroborating the notion that Osx+ stromal cells regulate tumor growth. Therefore, Osx function may well extend beyond its known role in bone development and homeostasis.</p><p>Osterix has been primarily studied in the context of osteoblast differentiation and regulation of bone mass. <italic>Sp7</italic> deficient mice die within 1 hr of birth with a complete absence of intramembranous and endochondral bone formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nakashima et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baek et al., 2009</xref>). During embryogenesis and perinatally, <italic>Sp7</italic> is expressed in MSCs in the bone marrow, and it is necessary for the full osteogenic program. In adult mice, <italic>Sp7</italic> is mainly confined to committed osteoblasts and osteocytes. There is increasing evidence of <italic>Sp7</italic> expression in cells residing outside the skeleton, including synovial fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Miura et al., 2019</xref>), dental pulp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Monterubbianesi et al., 2019</xref>), olfactory glomerular cells, gastric and intestinal epithelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen et al., 2014</xref>), and kidney (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Strecker et al., 2013</xref>). Here we demonstrate that <italic>Sp7</italic> is also present in a CAF subset, and in hematopoietic precursors, thus challenging the dogma that <italic>Sp7</italic> is exclusively expressed by mesenchymal cells. Our cell tracking studies using the repressible Tet-OFF Osx-cre;TdT reporter and the tamoxifen-inducible Osx-creER<sup>T2</sup>;TdT model demonstrate the presence of TdT<sup>OSX</sup>+;CD45+ cells in the bone marrow of adult mice. At least two other independent studies have also shown abundant and persistent Osx+ cells in the bone marrow when the reporter gene is activated either embryonically or neonatally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Liu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mizoguchi et al., 2014</xref>), and at 3 weeks of age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Strecker et al., 2013</xref>), but no signal in the bone marrow when the Osx-cre is activated after 8 weeks of age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mizoguchi et al., 2014</xref>). Notably, most of the studies with Osx-cre reporter mice have excluded the hematopoietic marker CD45 in the analysis of the Osx+ populations, and no report to date has shown <italic>Sp7</italic> expression in the hematopoietic compartment. Importantly, we also report that bone marrow residing TdT<sup>OSX</sup>+ populations expand during tumor progression. Such result is highly unlikely linked to systemic factors released from extra-skeletal tumors enhancing the Tet-transactivator in the Tet-OFF;Osx-cre;TdT mice. In fact, we observed increased TdT<sup>OSX</sup>+ cells (CD45- and CD45+ subsets) also in the bone marrow of tumor bearing Osx-creER<sup>T2</sup>;TdT animals. Our findings are instead consistent with previous observations reporting increased numbers of bone marrow residing MSCs and osteoblast precursors in mice and patients with lung adenocarcinomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Engblom et al., 2017</xref>), and with the reprogramming of hematopoiesis towards increased myelopoiesis during tumor progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Capietto et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Meyer et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Here, we report for the first time that a subset of hematopoietic lineage cells in the bone marrow and at tumor site derives from an Osx+ progenitor, which is present embryonically and persists until 7–8 weeks of age. Importantly, we detected <italic>Sp7</italic> transcripts and Osx nuclear localization in a subset of HSCs. These results support the observation that TdT<sup>OSX</sup>+;CD45+ cells are very heterogeneous and express monocyte, macrophage, granulocyte, T cell and NK cell markers. The heterogeneity of the TdT<sup>OSX</sup>+;CD45+ populations is most likely derived from expression of <italic>Sp7</italic> in HSC and MPP subsets. These precursors can give rise to the lineage committed common lymphoid (CLP) and myeloid (CMP) progenitors that differentiate into all the mature immune cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pietras et al., 2015</xref>). <italic>Sp7</italic> transcripts are also detected in CLP but not in CMP or mature immune populations, indicating that Osx is activated early during hematopoiesis, with higher expression in cells committed to the lymphoid lineage. Despite expressing both myeloid and lymphoid markers, we noted increased in lymphoid over myeloid ratio in the TdT<sup>OSX</sup>+;CD45+ tumor infiltrating cells relative to the TdT<sup>OSX</sup>-;CD45+ cells. TdT<sup>OSX</sup>+;CD45+ subset is also enriched in genes expressed by immunosuppressive or exhausted lymphocytes. Such result is consistent with the functional tumor co-injection studies showing that TdT<sup>OSX</sup>-;CD45+ cells reduce tumor growth while the TdT<sup>OSX</sup>+;CD45+ subset does not.</p><p>Co-injection of tumor cells with cells sorted from the primary tumor has been used to validate the pro-tumorigenic roles of CAFs and certain immune suppressive CD45+ populations. Here, we show that tumor-derived TdT<sup>OSX</sup>+ cells, comprising both CD45 positive and negative subsets, increase tumor growth compared to tumor cells injected alone. By contrast, co-injection of bone marrow-derived TdT<sup>OSX</sup>+ cells with the tumor cells does not exert any pro-tumor effect suggesting that bone marrow-derived TdT<sup>OSX</sup>+ cells are functionally distinct from tumor-derived TdT<sup>OSX</sup>+ cells. Hence, if tumor-derived TdT<sup>OSX</sup>+ cells originate from the bone marrow in response to an incipient tumor, as it would be anticipated by their increase in the circulation of tumor-bearing mice, they must undergo a conditioning process within the TME to acquire a pro-tumorigenic function. Because Osx regulates expression of proteins required for the generation of the bone tissue, it is likely that a main role of Osx+ mesenchymal cells (TdT<sup>OSX</sup>+;CD45-) in the TME is to produce and remodel extracellular matrix. Fibroblasts with an osteoblast signature involved in matrix production have been recently identified by single cell RNA sequencing in rheumatoid arthritis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Croft et al., 2019</xref>). ECM accumulation is quite frequent within the TME, causing in more severe cases an intense fibrotic response, or desmoplasia, and tumor stiffening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gkretsi and Stylianopoulos, 2018</xref>). Stiffening is not only required for a primary tumor to displace the host tissue and grow in size, but also contributes to cell–ECM interactions and can promote cancer cell invasion to surrounding tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gkretsi and Stylianopoulos, 2018</xref>). As noted earlier, upregulation of <italic>Sp7</italic> in breast cancer cells is associated with increased invasion and bone metastasis, and this may occur by upregulation of ECM modifying metalloproteinases, MMP9 and MMP13, and other factors that increase vascularization, and affect bone cell function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yao et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Since <italic>Sp7</italic> is not expressed in mature immune populations, it is difficult to envision a role for Osx in modulating anti-tumor immune responses. Co-injection experiments indicate that TdT<sup>OSX</sup>+;CD45+ cells have better pro-tumorigenic function than TdT<sup>OSX</sup>–;CD45+ cells. However, only the co-injection of the bulk TdT<sup>OSX</sup>+ cells increases tumor growth over the B16-F10 tumor cells alone, suggesting that the Osx+ mesenchymal population (TdT<sup>OSX</sup>+;CD45-) is responsible for enhancing tumor growth. This finding is intriguing since the TdT<sup>OSX</sup>+;CD45- mesenchymal cells represent only 5% of the total tumor infiltrating TdT<sup>OSX</sup>+ populations. One could speculate that TdT<sup>OSX</sup>+;CD45- cells represent a subset of highly pro-tumorigenic CAFs, which can support tumor progression even when present in very limited numbers. Another possibility is that the TdT<sup>OSX</sup>+;CD45- mesenchymal cells might be required to create and maintain an immune suppressive environment where the CD45+ populations fail to exert anti-tumor effects.</p><p>In conclusion, we demonstrate that <italic>Sp7</italic> is expressed in a subset of tumor infiltrating mesenchymal cells with CAF and osteogenic cell features. Surprisingly, <italic>Sp7</italic> expression is also found in hematopoietic precursors, and marks tumor infiltrating immune populations enriched in immune suppressive markers. Considering the emerging data that <italic>Sp7</italic> expression in the tumor cells is linked to tumor progression, our results emphasize the importance of Osx in the TME and the need to evaluate the prognostic value of stromal <italic>Sp7</italic> expression in the patients.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource"

RNA-seq reads were then aligned to the <italic>Mus musculus</italic> Ensembl release 76 top-level assembly with STAR version 2.0.4b (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dobin et al., 2013</xref>). Gene counts were derived from the number of uniquely aligned unambiguous reads by Subread:featureCount version 1.4.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Liao et al., 2014</xref>). Isoform expression of known Ensembl transcripts were estimated with Sailfish version 0.6.13 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Patro et al., 2017</xref>). Sequencing performance was assessed with RSeQC version 2.3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wang et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>All gene counts were then imported into the R/Bioconductor package EdgeR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Robinson et al., 2010</xref>) and TMM normalization size factors were calculated to adjust for samples for differences in library size. Ribosomal genes and genes not expressed in at least two samples greater than one count-per-million were excluded from further analysis. The TMM size factors and the matrix of counts were then imported into the R/Bioconductor package Limma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ritchie et al., 2015</xref>) and weighted likelihoods based on the observed mean-variance relationship of every gene and sample were then calculated with Limma’s voomWithQualityWeights (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Liu et al., 2015</xref>). The data were then fitted to a Limma generalized linear model to test for changes in a single cell population relative to the mean of all other populations to find only genes that were uniquely up-regulated with Benjamini-Hochberg false-discovery rate adjusted p-values less than or equal to 0.05. For each group of cells, global perturbations in known Gene Ontology (GO) terms were then measured using the R/Bioconductor package GAGE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Luo et al., 2009</xref>) to quantify the mean log two fold-changes of ll genes in a given term versus the background log two fold-changes of all genes found outside the respective term. Only globally up-regulated GO terms with Benjamini-Hochberg false-discovery rate adjusted p-values less than or equal to 0.05 were considered for comparison across populations.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank the Musculoskeletal Histology Core of Musculoskeletal Research Center supported by the National Institutes of Health P30 Grants AR057235 and P30 AR074992, and the Siteman Flow Cytometry Core at Washington University in St Louis.

They utilized osterix-Cre/TdTomato lineage tracing approach to identify subpopulations of CAF that are fibroblastic in nature versus hematopoietic/immune cells. These population are distinct and they promote tumor expansion. In addition, they provide evidence that osterix is expressed very early in hematopoietic stem cells as proven by lineage tracing and absence of the mRNA transcripts for Osterix in mature hematopoietic cells that are labeled as Osx/TdTomato+ cells. Although comprehensive in nature, authors should provide additional evidence to strengthen the main hypothesis. This manuscript is well written, the data presented are extensive and novel. Its findings should be interesting for both the fields of stem cells, tumor and bone biology. However, this study does not challenge the dogma that osteogenic and hematopoietic markers are exclusive. But the study proves that Osterix is expressed in hematopoietic lineage and only at early stage of HSC stem/progenitor cells. There is no evidence provided that CD45+ cells are fibroblastic or osteogenic, and therefore the main focus is &quot;non-specific&quot; expression of osterix-Cre in CD45+ population. The paper challenges dogma that Osx is expressed only in mesenchymal cells, as indicated in the Discussion.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>– Reviewers agree that a more definitive evidence should be provided that Osx transcripts/protein are expressed in CD45+ cells at a single cell level with an appropriate positive control, (including immunocytochemistry for OSX in TdT+ cells) and/or in situ hybridization. Maybe confocal imaging of CD45 immunostaining is required on the samples from tumors from OsxCre/TdTomato mice to assure that CD45 cells are not just attached to larger Osx-Cre/TD tomato;CD45- population.</p><p>– It is concerning that the number of Osx-cre/TdT+ cells increase drastically in a distant location of bone marrow after inoculating tumors. Do Osx-creER/TdT+ cells increase similarly in bone marrow in tumor bearing mice? An alternative explanation would be that systemic factors released from extra-skeletal tumors can enhance tet-transactivator or its operon activities in an Osx promoter independent manner, leading to increased cre expression.

We and others have previously demonstrated increased immature myeloid populations in bone marrow of animals bearing B16-F10 tumors (Capietto et al., 2013; Meyer et al., 2018). Similarly, bone marrow residing MSCs also increase during tumor progression and higher numbers of osteoblast precursors have been reported in lung cancer (Engblom et al., 2017). Thus, the increase in Osx-cre;TdT+ cells in bone marrow of animals bearing a primary tumor was expected and is consistent with previous observations.</p><p>To further allay the concern that systemic factors released from extra-skeletal tumors can enhance Tet-transactivator in the TET-OFF;OsxCre/TdT mice, we analyzed the % of Osx-cre/TdT+ cells in bone marrow of OsxCreER<sup>T2</sup>;TdT animals. Tam was administered at 8 weeks of age, 3 days before tumor injection and then again 1, 6 and 9 days thereafter. Bone marrow was collected and analyzed on day 14. The relative % of TdT+ cells (including CD45- and CD45+ subsets) to total bone marrow cells from tumor bearing OsxCreER<sup>T2</sup>;TdT animals is significantly higher than in naïve mice (Figure 3E). These observations in Osx-creER<sup>T2</sup>/TdT mice, where Cre is driven by a promoter that does not contain the TET operon, along with direct evidence of Osx protein expression at a single cell level in HSCs, make it highly unlikely that TdT expression in Osx-Cre mice is independent of the Osx promoter. We have included this point in the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– To confirm that this osterix expression is not an artefact of particular transgenic line, authors have utilized sp7CreER<sup>T2</sup> mice and presented in SF2, consider expanding data on this line, and moving it to a primary figure section.</p></disp-quote><p>While we were eager to expand our data using the OsxCreER<sup>T2</sup>;TdT mouse line, our laboratory has been on a locked down for over 2 months and we had to drastically reduce our mouse colony, thus limiting the number of OsxCreER<sup>T2</sup>;TdT mice available to us for experiments.</p><p>Nevertheless, we were able to secure a cohort of mice to confirm an increase in TdT+ cells in bone marrow of tumor bearing mice compared to no tumor controls (new Figure 3, new Figure 4—figure supplement 1) and show presence of TdT+ HSC subsets (new Figure 7).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– To better define the phenotype of the TdT-Osx+ cells additional markers of the osteoblastic lineage such as TNAP, BSP and Runx2 should be analyzed in Figure 2.</p></disp-quote><p>We added analysis of TNAP, BSP and Runx2 as requested (new Figure 2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– To strengthen the point that the TdT-Osx+ cells are different in tumor-injected compared to naïve specimen, the latter should be included in Figure 2.</p></disp-quote><p>We included RT-PCR analysis of TdT-Osx+ cells from naïve mice isolated from the bone marrow (new Figure 3—figure supplement 2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Figure 4 should include no tumor controls for the analysis of bone marrow specimen.</p></disp-quote><p>No tumor controls are shown in Figure 3C, D, E.</p></body></sub-article></article>
