neuroplasticity in songbirds has focused on the male song control system and testosterone. We longitudinally monitored the song behavior and neuroplasticity in male and female starlings during multiple photoperiods using Diffusion Tensor and Fixel-Based techniques. These exploratory data-driven whole-brain methods resulted in a population-based tractogram confirming microstructural sexual dimorphisms in the song control system. Furthermore, male brains showed <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/brain-asymmetry">hemispheric asymmetries</ext-link> in the pallium, whereas females had higher interhemispheric connectivity, which could not be attributed to brain size differences. Only females with large brains sing but differ from males in their song behavior by showing involvement of the hippocampus. Both sexes experienced multisensory neuroplasticity in the song control, auditory and visual system, and cerebellum, mainly during the photosensitive period. This period with low gonadal hormone levels might represent a ‘sensitive window’ during which different sensory and motor systems in the cerebrum and cerebellum can be seasonally re-shaped in both sexes.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>European starling</kwd><kwd>neuroplasticity</kwd><kwd>sexual dimorphism</kwd><kwd>diffusion tensor imaging</kwd><kwd>birdsong</kwd><kwd>cerebellum</kwd><kwd><italic>Sturnus vulgaris</italic></kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002749</institution-id><institution>Belgian Federal Science Policy Office</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>&quot;PLASTOSCINE&quot;: P7/17</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Van der Linden</surname><given-names>Annemie</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003130</institution-id><institution>Research Foundation Flanders</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>G030213N</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Van der Linden</surname><given-names>Annemie</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003130</institution-id><institution>Research Foundation Flanders</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>115217N</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Orije</surname><given-names>Jasmien</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003130</institution-id><institution>Research Foundation Flanders</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>12R1917N</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jonckers</surname><given-names>Elisabeth</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Despite the structural sexual dimorphism in the song control system, both male and female starlings experience similar seasonal neuroplasticity in multisensory systems and cerebellum during the photosensitive phase, which acts as a sensitive window of plasticity.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Although various songbird species demonstrate different levels of female song, in one of the most studied song bird species, the zebra finch, female song is absent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Odom et al., 2014</xref>). Observations like these led to the discovery of one of the largest sexual dimorphisms in the brain of vertebrate species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Bernard et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Nottebohm and Arnold, 1976</xref>). Such sexual dimorphisms in singing behavior and brain structure drove a bias in research of the song control system toward male songbirds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Besides the large sexual dimorphism in song and song control nuclei, seasonal songbirds expose an additional peculiarity as they display naturally re-occurring seasonal cycles of singing and neuroplasticity of the song control system. However, the male focus proceeded in the research of seasonal neuroplasticity, since this process was shown to be largely driven by photoperiod-induced increases in testosterone, which results in a pre-optic area (POA)-mediated increase in motivation to sing and subsequent singing activity-induced neuroplasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alward et al., 2013</xref>). The largest differences in song control nuclei volumes are found between breeding and non-breeding season (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Riters et al., 2002</xref>). This led seasonal neuroplasticity studies to focus mainly on the breeding season or photostimulated phase, which they often compare to the non-breeding season or photorefractory and photosensitive phases. The main emphasis on the role of photoperiodic-induced increase in testosterone has led to many manipulation studies involving castration and/or testosterone implantation and its effect on song production and the song control system (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hall and Macdougall-Shackleton, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Orije et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Stevenson and Ball, 2010</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Simplified overview of the experimental setup.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>).

Although little research is devoted to brain neuroplasticity during this state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Larson et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Riters et al., 2002</xref>), multiple studies have shown that during the photosensitive period, testes size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Cornez et al., 2017</xref>) and GnRH expression in the POA slowly start to increase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Bentley et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hurley et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Stevenson et al., 2012</xref>), while some song control nuclei slowly start to grow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Riters et al., 2002</xref>). The photosensitive period might be seen as a sensitive window, defined as a period in which experiences lead to long-lasting changes (that remain in the subsequent photostimulated phase or breading season) in the brain and song behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Knudsen, 2004</xref>). The photosensitive period plays a crucial role in creating permissive circumstances for enhanced neuroplasticity resulting in enlarged song control nuclei as observed during the photostimulated stage.</p><p>The studies on sexual dimorphisms and seasonal neuroplasticity in songbirds have been preoccupied with vocal control areas as the neural substrate for the behavioral sexual dimorphism in song performance. However, in vivo Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) allows us to visualize the entire brain and study the involvement of other structures like the hippocampus and cerebellum, which recently have been shown to be involved in song preference and song processing, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bailey et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Person et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Pidoux et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Striedter, 2016</xref>). Prior MRI studies from our team focusing on the entire songbird brain have demonstrated seasonal neuroplasticity and functional changes in both auditory and olfactory systems of starlings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">De Groof et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">De Groof et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">De Groof et al., 2013</xref>). This outcome hints toward a seasonal re-occurring cycle of multisensory neuroplasticity and raises the question whether the photosensitive stage perhaps represents a renewed ‘sensitive window’ for heightened neuroplasticity and rewiring of various sensory and sensorimotor systems.</p><p>The current study aims to fill the gaps highlighted above and answers the following questions with an extensive data-driven exploratory brain-wide structural MRI study of both male and female starlings throughout different seasons: (1) Is the sexual dimorphism limited to the song control system in starlings, as in zebra finches where only the male sings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hamaide et al., 2017</xref>) or does this dimorphism extend to other sensory systems? Can it be attributed to a difference in total brain size between the sexes, similar to what has been observed in mammals? (2) Do female and male starlings display parallel or different seasonal structural neuroplasticity? Is this neuroplasticity limited to the song control system or does it extend to other neural circuits? When do these (neuroplasticity) changes take place, already during the photosensitive period when gonadal hormone levels are still very low? (3) How does seasonal neuroplasticity correlate – at the group and individual level – with gonadal hormone levels and with song-production?</p><p>Since MRI is an in vivo method, we were able to measure the same subjects repeatedly and monitor the structural neuroplasticity longitudinally in 13 male and 12 female starlings as they undergo different subsequent photoperiodic phases: at baseline photorefractory state (PR), after 4, 8, and 12 weeks of short days during the photosensitive state (SD4, SD8, SD12), after 4 weeks of photostimulation (LD4) and after 16 weeks on long days when the birds are photorefractory again (LD16) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). At each time point we: collected blood samples; measured body weight; recorded song; and acquired structural MRI data including 3D anatomical scans and diffusion weighted images (DWI). Using voxel-based diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and fixel-based analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">De Groof et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Raffelt et al., 2017</xref>), we could visualize different sensory and sensorimotor circuits and their mutual connections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). We established spatio-temporal statistical maps revealing microstructural changes in gray and white matter, specifically in fiber connections throughout the different seasons in the entire brain in both sexes. To learn specifically about the contribution of singing activity-induced neuroplasticity in the seasonal neuroplasticity, a voxel-based multiple regression between seasonal song rate and corresponding DTI parameter maps was performed to identify the neuronal correlates of song behavior in both sexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hamaide et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Sagi et al., 2012</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Population-based tractogram of the starling brain using fixel-based analysis</title><p>In the current study, we analyzed the DWI scans in two distinct ways: (1) using the common approach of diffusion tensor derived metrics such as fractional anisotropy (FA) and; (2) using a novel method of fiber orientation distribution (FOD)-derived fixel-based analysis. Both techniques infer the microstructural information based on the diffusion of water molecules, but they are conceptually different (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Common DTI analysis extracts for each voxel several diffusion parameters, which are sensitive to various microstructural changes in both gray and white matter specified in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>. Fixel-based analysis on the other hand explores both microscopic changes in apparent fiber density (FD) or macroscopic changes in fiber-bundle cross-section (log FC) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>).

We recognize many of the white matter structures such as the different lamina, occipito-mesencephalic tract (OM) and optic tract (TrO) among others. Interestingly, many of the nuclei within the song control system (i.e. HVC, robust nucleus of the arcopallium (RA), lateral magnocellular nucleus of the anterior nidopallium (LMAN), and Area X), auditory system (i.e. intercollicular nucleus complex, nucleus ovoidalis) and visual system (i.e. entopallium, nucleus rotundus) are identified by the empty spaces between tracts. The applied fixel-based approach is inherently sensitive to changes in white matter and cannot report on the microstructure within gray matter like brain nuclei; but rather sheds light on the fiber tracts surrounding and interconnecting them. As such, it provides an excellent tool to investigate neuroplasticity of different brain networks, and in the case of a nodular song control system focusing on changes in the fibers surrounding the song control nuclei, referred to as HVC surr, RA surr, and Area X surr.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Overview of the population-based tractogram of male and female starlings over the seasons created for the fixel-based analysis with indications of different lamina, interconnecting tracts, nuclei, and brain regions displayed on axial (<bold>A</bold>) and coronal slices (<bold>B</bold>) throughout the brain.</title><p>The different intervals of the coronal and axial sectioning are indicated on the saggittal inset in the left corner of each panel.

In addition, females have higher fractional anisotropy within the cerebellum and caudal part of the lateral striatum (CSt) compared to males. These findings are further confirmed by fixel-based analysis; as many of the sexual dimorphisms in fractional anisotropy match with the fiber density statistical analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B</xref>). Certain subregions of the cerebellum, the molecular layer of cerebellar lobules II, III, IV have higher fiber density in females, whereas the cerebellar lobule VIII has higher fiber density in males. This diversifies the finding of increased fractional anisotropy in the cerebellum of female starlings. The molecular layer of the cerebellum consists of parallel fibers emitted by the granule cells of the cerebellar cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">D'Angelo, 2018</xref>). Fixel-based analysis is able to detect significant changes in this highly organized fiber structure, which is depicted as the red parallel fibers running left to right in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>. In addition to these microscopic changes, fiber-bundle cross-section statistical analysis revealed some macroscopic differences between male and female starlings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C,D</xref>). Male starlings generally have a larger volume in the rostral part of the left hemisphere at the level of the hyperpallium apicale, which further supports the asymmetry toward the left hemisphere. Furthermore, the left HVC surroundings and cerebellar lobule VIII are larger in males compared to females. However, certain regions within the superior frontal lamina (LFS), nidopallium and mesopallium are larger in females, compared to males. Extracted values from the identified clusters are plotted to demonstrate the extent of the sex difference in the respective diffusion parameters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplements 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">3</xref>).</p><p>Alongside the well-established difference in the song control system, the applied data-driven approach sheds new light on sexual dimorphisms in the rest of the starling brain, including a microstructural hemispheric asymmetry toward the left hemisphere in males and a more structurally organized cerebellum as well as several white matter tracts in females.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Role of brain size in the general sexual dimorphism</title><p>The hypothesis of neuronal interconnectivity is used to explain some of the sexual dimorphisms in brain structure of mammals and postulates that larger brains have relatively stronger intrahemispheric connections, resulting in stronger lateralization in larger brains, whereas smaller brains benefit more from higher interhemispheric connectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hänggi et al., 2014</xref>). To ensure that the general sexual dimorphisms are attributed to a genuine sex difference and not to a difference in brain size, we examined: (1) whether there is a difference in brain size between males and females and; (2) if this difference in brain size can explain sexual dimorphisms like the higher interhemispheric interconnectivity found in females. Even though there was a small difference in brain size between male and female starlings (respectively, Mean male = 1815, SE = 8 mm³ and Mean female = 1770, SE = 13 mm³), it was not significant (F(1, 23)=1.78, p=0.195). Next, we artificially divided each sex in two groups based on their brain size using a median split similar to the analysis in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Kurth et al., 2018</xref>.</p><p>These artificially generated groups were used for a voxel-based analysis with brain size as a fixed factor to assess the effect of brain size on the fractional anisotropy, fiber density and fiber-bundle cross-section analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>). This analysis could not explain the hemispheric asymmetry in males nor the increased interhemispheric connections in females. Only a few sex differences matched with the voxel-based analysis for brain size. Large brain male and female starlings had higher fractional anisotropy values in specific sections of the song control system including the caudal surroundings of the right Area X, surroundings of RA and HVC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). The brain size difference in fractional anisotropy in right Area X surroundings and cerebellum was matched with a difference in fiber density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>), whereas the higher fractional anisotropy in the surroundings of HVC of large brain starlings, is complemented by a higher fiber-bundle cross-section in the surroundings of HVC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Overview of general structural difference between large and small brain starling in fractional anisotropy (FA).</title><p>The statistical parametric maps are displayed on axial and coronal sections throughout the brain (upper and lower row, respectively).

Furthermore, some regions such as the hippocampus in large brain starlings and ventricle in small brain birds were not detected in the voxel-based sex difference analysis and are solely attributed to a difference in brain size. In the fiber-bundle cross-section analysis for brain size differences, more regions unrelated to a sex difference showed a significant larger fiber-bundle cross-section value in large brains compared to smaller brains, including parts of the pallial-subpallial lamina, lateral forebrain bundle, medial and lateral surroundings of the entopallium.</p><p>Interestingly, many of the fiber tracts that had a pronounced sex difference, such as the anterior and posterior commissure, TSM and OM, were not found in the brain size statistical maps. Furthermore, the microstructural hemispheric asymmetry covering the nidopallium and mesopallium detected in the voxel-based sex difference analysis can also not be attributed to a mere difference in brain size.

These results are summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4">Table 4</xref>. We extracted the mean fractional anisotropy values from the significant clusters and plotted them to determine how fractional anisotropy changes over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Fractional anisotropy changes can be caused by a multitude of underlying microstructural changes, however fractional anisotropy is most sensitive to changes in axon number and density, axon diameter and myelination (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Additionally, we extracted the mean of the other diffusion parameters (mean, axial and radial diffusion) and fixel-based measures from these ROIs to provide more insight into the basis of the fractional anisotropy change (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s4">4</xref>).

In males, fractional anisotropy increases significantly in specific parts of the surroundings of main song control nuclei (HVC and left RA surroundings) and of the auditory system (left NCM), in females fractional anisotropy values remain constant or even decrease over time. Male fractional anisotropy increase during the photosensitive period in NCM and HVC surroundings is reflected in increased diffusion in all directions (mean, axial, and radial diffusivity increase over time) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4-2"><title>Similar seasonal neuroplasticity in both sexes mostly occurs in the photosensitive stage</title><p>While some specific regions of the song control and auditory circuit present sexually dimorphic neuroplasticity, most neuroplasticity occurs in parallel in males as in females, not only in regions related to song control but also in the auditory and visual system and the cerebellum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figures 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref>). Within the song control system, sexually analogous neuroplasticity occurs in the surroundings of right rostral HVC, RA, Area X (rostral and caudal surroundings) and within left LMAN. Some of the white matter tracts involved in song behavior such as the OM, LaM, and CSt also display neuroplasticity. OM conveys projections from the arcopallium, including connections from RA to downstream regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Avian Brain Nomenclature Forum et al., 2004</xref>), whereas CSt holds projections going to the auditory system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Vates et al., 1996</xref>). LaM is the dividing lamina between the mesopallium and nidopallium and caries connections of HVC to Area X and of LMAN to RA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Nottebohm et al., 1982</xref>). After 4 weeks of short days, our earliest time point of the photosensitive period, females presented a significant fractional anisotropy change in the OM, rostral, and caudal Area X surroundings and the CSt, whereas males only had significant fractional anisotropy changes in the left OM, left RA surroundings (interaction cluster) and caudal surroundings of right Area X at that time point. Most of the neuroplasticity of song control nuclei like HVC and Area X surroundings in males occurred only after eight weeks of short days. It seems as if the song-related seasonal neuroplasticity occurs slightly sooner in females compared to males, especially in the rostral surroundings of Area X, which is a part of the anterior forebrain pathway, and the CSt, which is an auditory region. Both structures could play a role in the auditory feedback loop that is associated with vocal learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Bosíková et al., 2010</xref>). In many song control nuclei, fractional anisotropy values remain high during photostimulated and photorefractory period, only in some parts of the Area X and right HVC surroundings females show a slight dip in fractional anisotropy during the photostimulated phase, before increasing again during the photorefractory phase. The LMAN is one of the last song control nuclei to change with increased fractional anisotropy levels from SD12 onward.</p><p>Furthermore, many of the seasonal changes in brain structures related to the singing behavior do not return to baseline levels after sixteen weeks of long days. In males, the surroundings of HVC, left RA, and left NCM were not different between the two sample points in the photorefractory phases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>). Some structures such as the left OM show a gradual decrease in fractional anisotropy values at LD16 compared to their peak at SD12. A potential explanation is that these singing-related structures require more time to return to baseline levels. Alternatively, certain regions related to song behavior may never fully regress to baseline photorefractory levels, but instead increase year after year. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Bernard et al., 1996</xref> demonstrated that in yearling starlings, HVC and RA volume was lower compared to older adult starlings, which was linked to the increasing song repertoire of starlings over the years. Furthermore, CSt related to the auditory system distinguishes itself from other structures as it keeps on increasing in fractional anisotropy over subsequent photoperiods. This could represent a maturation upon aging, independent of the seasonal changes.</p><p>In other white matter structures, such as the TrO, TSM, and tFA; most neuroplastic changes in fractional anisotropy and fiber density start during the photosensitive phase around SD12 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s4">Figure 8—figure supplement 4</xref>). As the name indicates, the optic tract is involved in visual processing. TSM is also involved in the visual pathway as it conveys projections from the wulst to sites within the brain stem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Avian Brain Nomenclature Forum et al., 2004</xref>). tFA holds projections of the trigeminal sensorimotor pathway between the basorostral nucleus (in the rostral pallium) and arcopallium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Avian Brain Nomenclature Forum et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Wild and Farabaugh, 1996</xref>). Neuroplasticity of the visual system could be relevant to prepare the birds for the breeding season, where visual cues like ultraviolet plumage colors are important for mate selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bennett et al., 1997</xref>). Interestingly, cerebellar lobules VII-VIII, which are part of the oculomotor cerebellum, follows a similar temporal profile of neuroplasticity as other cerebral structures, with significantly increased fractional anisotropy values by the end of the photosensitive period. This shows that multisensory neuroplasticity is not limited to the cerebrum, but also involves the cerebellum, something that has not yet been observed in songbirds.</p><p>Male neuroplastic changes in fractional anisotropy are mostly attributed to changes in axial diffusivity, sensitive to changes in axon number or axon density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplements 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s3">3</xref>). Female starlings conversely demonstrated decreased radial diffusivity during the photosensitive period in right HVC, Area X surroundings, LaM and cerebellar lobule VII-VIII, indicating changes in myelin content or axon diameter, which was minimal in males (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplements 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s4">4</xref>).</p><p>In line with the voxel-based analysis for sex difference, the hemispheric asymmetry in males and increased interhemispheric connectivity is also reflected in the extracted diffusion parameters of these clusters. Female starlings have higher fractional anisotropy and fiber density in tracts like OM and CSt compared to male starlings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s3">Figure 8—figure supplement 3</xref>). Males present higher fractional anisotropy in clusters of the left hemisphere, like NCM, RA and Area X surroundings. However, both left and right Area X surroundings of males have lower diffusion in all directions (mean, axial and radial diffusivity) compared to females, suggesting a higher tissue density or fiber organization in males (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2</xref>). Both left and right RA surroundings have lower radial diffusivity in males compared to females, suggesting males have more myelin content or smaller axon diameter (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). However, in the right RA surroundings, axial diffusivity is also significantly lower in males, suggesting a lower axon number or axon density.</p><p>Overall, neuroplasticity in structures related to song and auditory processing starts early into the photosensitive period (SD4 and SD8). Structures related to other sensory systems, such as the TrO, TSM, tFA, and cerebellum, only show significant increases by the end of the photosensitive stage (SD12) and often have again decreased fractional anisotropy values by the next photorefractory phase. Even though the majority of these neuroplastic changes occur similarly in males and females, they sometimes differ in their approach. Fractional anisotropy changes in males are mostly due to changes in axial diffusivity, however females show changes in radial diffusivity over time.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Photoperiodic variation in hormone levels and song behavior</title><p>In order to determine how the changes in neuroplasticity are related to changes in hormones and singing behavior across the different photoperiods, we collected blood samples and recorded songs at each time point.

Interestingly, the song rate of female starlings presented a significant effect of brain size and interaction between brain size and time respectively (F(1, 10.8)=5.74, p=0.0358; F(5, 37.6)=3.14, p=0.0181). Post hoc analysis quickly revealed that female starlings with a small brain rarely sing during any of the time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10C</xref>). Large brain females were most responsible in determining the seasonal change in song rate and song bout length. Further analysis revealed that the brain size of the female birds is proportional to their body weight, evident by positive Pearson’s correlation between the averaged brain size and averaged body weight, which is not the case in the male starlings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10D</xref>). Female starlings with a large brain have a higher body weight and are capable of singing with a high song rate during the photosensitive period unlike their smaller female counterparts. Importantly, the interpretation of the sexual dimorphisms attributed to brain size is further complicated, since the difference between large and small brain female starlings is confounded by their difference in singing behavior.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Neural correlates of song behavior</title><p>Having established the seasonal changes in neuroplasticity and song behavior, we performed a voxel-based multiple regression analysis to determine the neural correlate of song behavior.

This correlation was not only linked to the overall difference between singing and non-singing females, but also to the increase of song rate within a subject as evidenced by the significant repeated measures correlation with fractional anisotropy of the caudal surroundings of Area X and left hippocampus.

These data also lead to new findings, including the observation that females have stronger tracts interconnecting hemispheres and nuclei, while males have a microstructural asymmetry toward the left hemisphere. Interestingly, brain size does not completely explain the sexually dimorphic hemispheric asymmetry of males or increased interconnectivity of female brains; only some of the sex differences in certain song control nuclei could be attributed to brain size. However, the difference in brain size is confounded by the difference in singing behavior of female starlings. Female starlings with small brains rarely sing during any of the time points. In contrast, females with large brains are capable of singing at a high song rate and strengthen their song control network during the photosensitive period. In general, both male and female starlings display similar structural neuroplasticity not only in the surrounding fibers of the song control system, but also in tracts related to other sensory systems such as the auditory and visual network. Even specific parts of the cerebellum, related to the processing of sensory information, display seasonal neuroplasticity. However, males and females show slight differences in the way neuroplasticity is displayed. Male starlings, for example, demonstrated significant neuroplasticity in HVC surroundings and left NCM, which was absent in female starlings. Importantly, most of these neuroplastic changes already start during the photosensitive period, when circulating testosterone levels are low but gradually begin to increase in both sexes.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>General sexual dimorphism in the starling brain’s tractogram</title><p>In vivo DTI and fixel-based analysis could capture the well-established structural sexual dimorphism at the level of the song control system in songbirds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Bernard et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hamaide et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Nottebohm and Arnold, 1976</xref>). Even though the sexual dimorphism in the song control system is bilateral, we demonstrated a strong asymmetry toward the left nidopallium and mesopallium in male starlings. Furthermore, analysis of seasonal neuroplasticity confirmed this lateralization, as many clusters found in the left hemisphere (i.e. surroundings of left HVC, RA, rostral and caudal surroundings of Area X) had higher fractional anisotropy values in males compared to females. In general, fractional anisotropy provides a correlate for a set of underlying microstructural characteristics related to structural and spatial organization of axons, dendrites and even cells. Other diffusion parameters can help the interpretation but cannot pinpoint a single underlying cellular event (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Sagi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Zatorre et al., 2012</xref>). However, our observations might guide histological studies to shed more light on the underlying structural sexual dimorphisms. Left-right differences are not always examined in histological studies. Most of the studies concerning hemispheric asymmetry or lateralization focus on the lateralization of functions involved in the processing of auditory, visual, and olfactory information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Rogers, 2012</xref>). Often these studies use electrophysiology or functional MRI (fMRI) to quantify the neural response to certain stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">De Groof et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Yang and Vicario, 2015</xref>). Human imaging studies have combined fMRI and tract-tracings and found that white matter asymmetries may be one of the factors underlying functional hemispheric asymmetries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Ocklenburg et al., 2013</xref>). Our study contributes to this hypothesis, showing a large microstructural hemispheric asymmetry of the male starling brain, which might be underlying some of the functional hemispheric asymmetries in starlings. Furthermore, this lateralization might be species-specific; zebra finches by contrast exhibit no left-right difference in the volume of song control nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Nixdorf-Bergweiler, 1996</xref>), nor did prior DTI studies in zebra finches report a sex difference in cerebral asymmetry of song control nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hamaide et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Unexpectedly, females have higher fractional anisotropy in several tracts interconnecting nuclei of the visual and song control system and in interhemispheric connections such as the commissure anterior and posterior. This is in contrast to zebra finches where males have a larger white matter volume compartment compared to females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hamaide et al., 2018a</xref>). However, stronger interhemispheric connectivity is present in female mammals, although this has been attributed to brain size rather than a real effect of sex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hänggi et al., 2014</xref>). Even though male starlings had a slightly -but not significantly- larger brain compared to females, matching our findings in zebra finches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hamaide et al., 2018a</xref>), our study could not confirm the hypothesis of neuronal interconnectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hänggi et al., 2014</xref>), which states that smaller brains are stronger connected interhemispherically, while larger brains exhibit more hemispheric asymmetry caused by relatively stronger interhemispheric connectivity. The voxel-based analysis for brain size could not explain the hemispheric asymmetry in males or the increased interhemispheric connections in females. Brain size could only explain some sexual dimorphisms in specific parts of the song control system, such as the caudal surroundings of the right Area X, surroundings of RA and HVC. However, in females, the difference in brain size is confounded by the difference in song behavior. Our data reveal that female starlings with a large brain sing more, especially during the photosensitive phase, compared to female starlings with a relatively smaller brain. Furthermore, female song rate is correlated to fractional anisotropy in the same song control regions, for example the surroundings of Area X and RA. Brain size is affected by multiple factors including age, circulating hormone levels, environment and experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Healy and Rowe, 2007</xref>). Of note, because we used wild caught starlings we cannot control for their exact age or developmental history. The larger females could be older compared to the smaller female starlings. In summation, these confounding factors make it unlikely that the brain size difference is the sole explanation for the sexual dimorphisms.</p><p>Sexual structural dimorphisms of the brain might also be explained by sexual differences in behavior. Take, for example, the sexual dimorphism of the TrO and TSM that carries projections to the wulst (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Avian Brain Nomenclature Forum et al., 2004</xref>). Enhancement of the visual system in females could be related to the visual cues like ultraviolet plumage colors female starlings take into consideration during mate selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bennett et al., 1997</xref>). Moreover, this role of the visual system during the breeding season is further corroborated by the neuroplastic changes in the visual system, which occur at the end of the photosensitive period, right before the onset of the photostimulated period and return to baseline levels after sixteen weeks of long days. This is consistent with one of our prior DTI studies, where the optic chiasm of male starlings had lower fractional anisotropy values during the photorefractory state compared to the breeding season (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">De Groof et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, because of the limited research in the cerebellum of songbirds, we are the first to report clear sexual dimorphisms in the fiber characteristics of specific lobules of the cerebellum. Females had higher fractional anisotropy values in a large part of the cerebellum covering both anterior and posterior lobules IV-VIII, and higher fiber density in anterior lobules II-IV. In males, mostly the posterior lobule VII had higher fractional anisotropy, whilst lobule VIII had higher fiber density and fiber-bundle cross-section. The avian cerebellum has a strict topographic organization where each cerebellar lobule has a distinct input and output (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arends and Zeigler, 1991</xref>). Anterior lobules (I-V) contain the somatotopic representation of the tail, leg, and wings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Whitlock, 1952</xref>) and are more pronounced in avian species with strong hind limbs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Iwaniuk et al., 2007</xref>). Cerebellar lobules VII and VIII are part of the oculomotor cerebellum (VI-VIII) and receive visual input (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Clarke, 1977</xref>), input from the pretecto-ponto-cerebellar system involved in flight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Wylie et al., 2018</xref>) and have a somatotopic representation of the cochlea and retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Whitlock, 1952</xref>). The pronouncement of the oculomotor cerebellum in males versus females could reflect the integration of visual and auditory sensory input, including the more developed song behavior of males. Language tasks in humans mostly involve the lateral lobules VI and crus I/II, which are implicated in initiating the motor sequence of phonological content, whereas VIIb/VIII support the phonological storage during the maintenance of verbal information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Mariën et al., 2014</xref>). However, there is only limited information on the specific cerebellar lobules implicated in song production of songbirds. Recently a cerebello-thalamic-basal ganglia pathway was identified that influences song processing, where lateral cerebellar nucleus (CbL) projects to dorsal thalamic regions and coincides with retrograde labeling of Area X and medial striatum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Person et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Pidoux et al., 2018</xref>). Furthermore, lesioning Area X caused structural remodeling within the cerebello-thalamo-basal ganglia pathway including the dorsal thalamic zone, CbL and extended further in cerebellar lobules VIb and VII (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hamaide et al., 2018b</xref>). These lesions independently affected the duration of syllables (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hamaide et al., 2018b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Pidoux et al., 2018</xref>), which indicates the importance of the cerebello-thalamo-basal ganglia pathway in the timing of birdsong (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Konopka and Roberts, 2016</xref>). The cerebellum generally works as a forward controller, where it compares intention with execution and uses the error information to correct future events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">D'Angelo, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Strick et al., 2009</xref>). This conceptualization of the cerebellum as a learning machine was developed as a model for motor control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Miall and Reckess, 2002</xref>), but can also be applied in other learning behaviors, such as vocal learning in birds, since the forward control process of the cerebellum is especially implicated in the timing of combined stimuli. Moreover, the oculomotor cerebellum exhibits neuroplasticity with a similar temporal profile as the multisensory neuroplasticity observed in the cerebrum. The molecular layer of the cerebellum contains the parallel fibers emitted by the granule cells and is known to maintain a high level of neuroplasticity throughout life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ito, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Medina et al., 2002</xref>). Furthermore, steroids can affect cerebellar Purkinje firing related to locomotor activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Dean and McCarthy, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Smith, 1995</xref>). Together, these findings imply that the plasticity in song control system is not limited to the known song circuitry but also involves the cerebellum.</p><p>The general sexual dimorphism in the starling brain extends well beyond the song control system, and whilst for mammals this was suggested to be related to the difference in brain size, we do not find evidence for that in avian species. The few sex differences in the song control system that could be attributed to brain size are confounded by song behavior. Furthermore, many of the other sexual dimorphisms involving the visual system and cerebellum could be explained by behavioral differences between sexes. It can thus be reasonably assumed that the general structural sexual dimorphisms in starlings are related to differences in behavior rather than brain size.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Seasonal variation in gonadal hormones song behavior and its Neural correlates</title><p>The seasonal variation in hormone levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Dawson, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Riters et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Williams et al., 2004</xref>) and song behavior during artificial photoperiod switching is in good agreement with the seasonal changes observed in natural conditions. In male starlings on a natural cycle, hypothalamic GnRH expression is already high in February under short days, which coincides with the start of the testes growth and results in a gradual increase of circulating testosterone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Bentley et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Dawson, 1983</xref>). Female birds also produce testosterone, mainly in the ovaries and the adrenal gland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Tanabe et al., 1979</xref>). Circulating testosterone levels are high in female starlings in the pre-laying phase and decrease after ovulation, whereas estrogens are high during the breeding season in March and peak around ovulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Dawson, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Williams et al., 2004</xref>). It is well known that estrogens are fundamental in the regulation of female reproduction, whereas the role of testosterone in female reproduction is less studied. However, female starlings are most aggressive during the pre-laying period, when their testosterone levels are high (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Williams et al., 2004</xref>). Our study confirms that both male and females present a gradual increase in circulating testosterone during the late photosensitive phase. In males, this was shown to coincide with an increase in hypothalamic GnRH expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Bentley et al., 2013</xref>). Furthermore, the current study showed that male testosterone plasma levels were positively correlated to the song bout length on a within-subject level. We suggest that beside the effect of testosterone on reproductive functions, it could also be important in the regulation of neuroplasticity observed during the photosensitive phase.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Male and female starlings both experience neuroplasticity in their song control system, but display differential underlying mechanisms and song behavior</title><p>Although structural neuroplasticity of the song control system is broadly similar in males and females, there are some notable differences. We revealed that seasonal neuroplasticity differs between males and females in specific parts of the HVC surroundings and left NCM, where only males experienced seasonal neuroplasticity. Females by contrast only showed a fractional anisotropy increase in the more rostral part of the right HVC surroundings after 12 weeks of short days. During photostimulation, when the female singing behavior becomes less, fractional anisotropy values in the right HVC surroundings dropped slightly. In other structures related to song and auditory processing, neuroplasticity starts early into the photosensitive period (SD4 and SD8) in both males and females. Furthermore, fractional anisotropy values in the Area X surroundings and hippocampus were positively correlated to the female song rate on a within-subject level. The hippocampus receives input from various parts of the pallium and dorsal thalamus that process somatosensory, olfactory, visual, and auditory information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Striedter, 2016</xref>). The role of hippocampus in song behavior is not widely understood. Previous work has mainly focused on the role of the hippocampus in spatial memory performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Macphail, 2002</xref>). Prior studies demonstrated that males generally outperform females in spatial memory performance tasks, but rely on different strategies in learning such cognitive tasks in both mammals and songbirds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Kosarussavadi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Rensel et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Tropp and Markus, 2001</xref>). Sexually different learning mechanisms have also been suggested in vocal learning in songbirds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Riebel, 2016</xref>). Few studies have looked at the role of the hippocampus in song behavior in zebra finches. Hippocampal lesions during song learning and adulthood in male zebra finches did not affect song learning, singing or song structure. However, in females, hippocampal lesions affected preference for their father’s song (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bailey et al., 2009</xref>). Interestingly, the hippocampus has a high aromatase expression and is a site of immediate early gene expression in response to conspecific zebra finch song, predominantly in female zebra finches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bailey and Saldanha, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bailey and Wade, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Gobes et al., 2009</xref>). These findings suggest that the hippocampus might play a role in specific characteristics of song perception, like identity and temporal context. To our knowledge, we are the first to report on a potential role of the hippocampus in the song behavior of female starlings.</p><p>Together these findings suggest that males and females use different vocal learning strategies relying on different parts of the song control system and displaying differential neuroplasticity mechanisms. Female starlings relied particularly on the auditory feedback loop and showed involvement of the hippocampus. Males, on the other hand, display greater activity-induced neuroplasticity in the NCM, left RA and HVC surroundings.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>The photosensitive phase is a sensitive window where both sexes experience multisensory neuroplasticity</title><p>One of the most important findings of this study is that most of the neuroplastic changes start during the photosensitive phase. Despite widespread structural sexual dimorphism, the majority of the structural seasonal neuroplasticity occurs similarly in males and females. A second major observation is that besides the SCS, various sensory systems and the cerebellum display neuroplasticity in both sexes. This finding could only be partially confirmed with a prior histological study that reported volume changes in song control nuclei during the photosensitive phase of male starlings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Riters et al., 2002</xref>) as immunohistochemistry is invasive and does not allow dynamic observations of changes in the same animal. These changes in neuroplasticity are a circannual observation driven by the shortening day length, as is the case for several other behaviors and mechanisms in different species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Stevenson et al., 2015</xref>). The exact mechanism behind these circannual rhythms remains unclear. Of note is that during the photosensitive period, aromatase expression is increased and 5β-reductase (which inactivates testosterone) is decreased in the telencephalon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Riters et al., 2001</xref>). This indicates that local changes in testosterone metabolism in the brain, could contribute to singing behavior and the observed neuroplasticity during the photosensitive period, even though circulating testosterone levels are still low. In line with male starlings, male photosensitive canaries’ HVC volume was not significantly different from photostimulated males, which the authors related to a gradual increase in GnRH expression in the POA during the photosensitive period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hurley et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Just like starlings, canaries are open-ended learners. However, canaries modify their song between breeding seasons (when their testosterone levels are low); once they reach a stable song it remains stable for the rest of the breeding season (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Nottebohm et al., 1986</xref>). Recently, it was shown that this song stabilization is associated with an increase in the perineuronal nets (PNN) expression in RA and Area X of adult male canaries prior to the breeding season (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Cornez et al., 2020</xref>). They hypothesized that the changes in PNN expression were associated with the closing and re-opening of a sensitive period for vocal learning. We hypothesize that a similar pattern of closing and re-opening of sensitive windows exists in starlings. Among open-ended learners, starlings are more plastic compared to canaries, that is, they can learn new song elements throughout the year and can incorporate them in their song up to eighteen months after first hearing them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Böhner et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Marler et al., 1994</xref>). However, these experiences only result in long-lasting structural changes in the brain during the photosensitive period, persisting during the photostimulated phase and dissipating in the photorefractory state. As in canaries, male starlings have higher percentage of PNN surrounding PV in the HVC during the late photosensitive and photostimulated phase compared to the photorefractory state, the early photosensitive stage was not investigated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Cornez et al., 2017</xref>). This indicates that PNNs could play a role in closing sensitive periods. However, compared to other open-ended learners (canaries) and closed-ended learners (zebra finches), starlings exhibit far less PNN expression in their song control system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Cornez et al., 2017</xref>). This could be linked to the starling’s ability to change its repertoire throughout the year. The relatively low PNN density in the starling brain does not necessarily mean that they cannot use other mechanisms to end their sensitive period. Myelination is another relevant candidate for brain circuitry consolidation when a sensitive window closes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Knudsen, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Xin and Chan, 2020</xref>). Using in vivo DTI, which is sensitive to changes in myelination, we demonstrated that both sexes experienced differential and parallel heightened multisensory neuroplasticity in auditory and visual system and cerebellum mainly during the photosensitive period. This often-neglected period in which gonadal hormones are still very low might represent a ‘sensitive window’, during which permissive circumstances for activity-induced neuroplasticity re-occur and different sensory and motor systems in both cerebrum and cerebellum are seasonally re-shaped. These findings open new vistas for investigating reopening of sensitive or critical periods of neuroplasticity.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type (species) <break/>or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Strain, strain background (Sturnus vulgaris, male and female)</td><td>Starlings</td><td>Wild caught</td><td/><td>See Materials and methods, Section 1</td></tr><tr><td>Commercial assay or kit</td><td>estradiol RIA</td><td>MP Biomedicals, Solon, Ohio</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_013308">SCR_013308</ext-link> <break/>SKU: 0723810-CF</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Commercial assay or kit</td><td>testosterone RIA</td><td>MP Biomedicals, Solon, Ohio</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_013308">SCR_013308</ext-link> <break/>SKU: 0718910-CF</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>Raven Pro</td><td>Cornell Lab of Ornithology, Ithaca, NY</td><td/><td>Version 1.5</td></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>MrTrix3</td><td>MrTrix3 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.mrtrix.org">https://www.mrtrix.org</ext-link>)</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_006971">SCR_006971</ext-link></td><td>version 3.0</td></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>SPM</td><td>SPM (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm">https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm</ext-link>)</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_007037">SCR_007037</ext-link></td><td>Version 12</td></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>Rmcorr</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bakdash and Marusich, 2017</xref><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2017.00456">10.3389/fpsyg.2017.00456</ext-link></td><td/><td>Version 0.4.3</td></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>JMP Pro 15</td><td>JMP (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.jmp.com">https://www.jmp.com</ext-link>)</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_014242">SCR_014242</ext-link></td><td>Version 15.1</td></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>GraphPad prism</td><td>GraphPad Prism (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://graphpad.com">https://graphpad.com</ext-link>)</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_002798">SCR_002798</ext-link></td><td>Version 6</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Subjects and experimental setup</title><p>All experiments were performed on 13 male and 12 female starlings (<italic>Sturnus vulgaris</italic>). The males were wild caught as adults in Normandy (France) in November 2014 and the females were caught in Nicosia (Cyprus) in March 2017. All subjects were housed in large indoor aviaries (L x W x H: 2.2 × 1.4×2.1 m) at the University of Antwerp with food and water available ad libitum and an artificial light-dark cycle mimicking the natural photoperiod. All birds were kept on a long day photoperiod (16 hr light: 8 hr dark, 16L:8D) in order to induce photorefractory state at the start of experiment. When all birds molted and were fully photorefractory, a first baseline measurement was made. This was in May 2015 for the male starlings, and December 2017 for the female starlings. Both males and females followed the same photoperiodic regime: after the photorefractory baseline scan, they were switched from long to short (8L:16D) days to induce photosensitivity. After 12 weeks of short days, the photosensitive starlings were switched back to long days (16L:8D) to induce photostimulation. They remained on long days, so that they became photorefractory once more. We monitored neuroplasticity repeatedly at six different time points. The first time point was at the end of the photorefractory state (PR). After switching to short days, we measured every four weeks to follow up the seasonal plasticity during the photosensitive period (SD4, SD8, SD12). Additionally, we measured after four weeks on long days (LD4), when starlings were fully photostimulated. Finally, we measured after sixteen weeks on long days (LD16), when starlings are photorefractory again. At each time point, birds were weighed, songs were recorded, blood samples were taken, and MRI (DTI and 3D scans) was acquired. The housing and experimental procedures were performed in agreement with the European directives, Belgian and Flemish laws and were approved by the Committee on Animal Care and Use of the University of Antwerp, Belgium (2014–52).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Testosterone and estrogen assay</title><p>Blood samples were collected to quantify plasma testosterone concentration in all birds. In female starlings, we also assayed estradiol in addition to testosterone, since this is one of the primary female sex hormones. At each time point, blood collection occurred within a 2 hr window at noon between 11:30 hr and 13:00 hr in order to limit variation of plasma levels due to a daily rhythm. Starlings were housed individually for song recording, which allowed fast capture and blood sampling (within 5 min. of capture) to minimize the increase in testosterone as a result of acute stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Van Hout et al., 2010</xref>). The alar wing vein was punctured with a 25-gauge needle to collect 300–500 μl of blood into heparin-coated capillary tubes. The blood was transferred to tubes and centrifuged for 10 min at 2060 g while cooling to 4°C. Plasma was collected and stored at −20°C prior to assay. Estradiol and testosterone concentrations were quantified by Radioimmunoassay (RIA) using a commercial double antibody system (MP Biomedicals, Solon, Ohio). The estradiol RIA does not cross-react significantly with other estrogens beside estradiol-17β (Estrone: 20% and Estriol 1.51%; all other steroids:&lt;1%) and the intra-assay coefficient of variation is 4.7–10.6%. The testosterone RIA does not significantly cross-react with other androgens beside testosterone (5α-dihydrotestosterone: 3.4%; 5α-androstane-3β, 17β-diol: 2.2%; 11-oxo-testosterone: 2%; all other steroids:&lt;1%) and the intra-assay coefficient of variation is 4.6–9.1%.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Song recording and analysis</title><p>At each MRI imaging time point, songs of all birds were recorded for 2 days, so that we could accurately monitor the evolution of the song behavior in relation to the hormone and neuroplastic changes. Since isolated starlings do not sing as they would do in groups, we temporarily housed the starlings individually in cages that were placed next to the aviary. Each cage was equipped with a Behringer C-2 condensator microphone placed on top, which was connected to a PR8E multi-channel preamplifier (SM Pro audio), ‘Delta Series’ Breakout box (M-audio) and personal computer with Sound Analysis Pro (SAP) software version 2011.104 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://soundanalysispro.com/">http://soundanalysispro.com/</ext-link>) for automated song detection. Due to technical issues, songs of PR and SD12 of male birds were lost.</p><p>For each bird at each time point, song recordings of 4 consecutive hours in the morning were analyzed using Raven Pro 1.5 (Cornell Lab of Ornithology, Ithaca, NY). We created sonograms that were acoustically and visually inspected to identify individual songs (N = 881) from background noise of the aviary based on their intensity and the spectral definition. In line with prior song processing studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Eens, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Van Hout et al., 2012</xref>), we defined a song bout as a period of at least 5 s of song with pauses no longer than 1.5 s. Starling song consists of a series of distinct song elements or phrases, which can be allocated to four categories of phrase types that are mostly performed in a fixed order. The song often starts with one or several whistles (whistle phrase type), followed by a section of complex phrases (variable phrase type) and rapid series of clicks or rattles (rattle phrase type), before ending the song with high frequency song elements (high-frequency phrases type). Song bouts containing at least three different phrase types were labeled as ‘complete song bouts’.</p><p>The number of complete song bouts sung per hour within the 4 hr period was taken as a measure of the song rate. We used the first 20 complete song bouts sung within this 4 hr period to calculate the song bout length. This way, we avoided the overrepresentation of songs during time points where the song rate was high.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>MRI data acquisition</title><p>The birds were initially anesthetized using 2% Isoflurane (Isoflo , Abbot Laboratories Ltd.) with a mixture of oxygen and nitrogen at flow rates of 100 and 200 cm³/min, respectively. Throughout the imaging procedure, the anesthesia was gradually reduced to 1% Isoflurane in response to their respiration rate, which was monitored with a small pneumatic sensor (SA Instruments, NY, USA) positioned under the bird. Body temperature was monitored with a cloacal temperature probe and kept within a narrow physiological range ([41.0 ± 0.2] °C) using a warm air system with a feedback unit (SA Instruments, NY, USA).</p><p>All MRI measurements were performed on a 7T horizontal MR system (Pharmascan 70/16 US, Bruker Biospin, Germany). In each imaging session, we acquired a T2-weighted 3D anatomical Rapid acquisition with relaxation enhancement (RARE) scan (3D; TR: 2000 ms; TE<sub>eff</sub>: 44 ms; RARE factor: 8; acquisition matrix of (256 × 92×64) giving a voxel resolution of (0.089 × 0.250×0.250) mm³). Subsequently, a four shot spin-echo echo-planar imaging (SE-EPI) diffusion weighted (DW) scan (TR: 7000 ms; TE: 23 ms; δ 4 ms, Δ 12 ms; b-value 670 s/mm²; 60 diffusion gradient directions; spatial resolution: (0.179 × 0.179×0.350) mm³; 28 coronal slices) was acquired. The 60 diffusion gradient directions were divided over three scans, each starting with the acquisition of 7 b0 images. Total acquisition time of all MRI scans amounted to 50 min. After the scanning session, birds were left to recover in a warmed recovery box before returning to the song recording cages next to the aviary.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>MRI data processing</title><p>Whole brain volume was manually delineated on the T2-weighted 3D anatomical RARE scan, which covered the entire brain, including telencephalon, diencephalon, mesencephalon, and metencephalon.

We used an in-house algorithm to convert the Bruker 2dseq files to nifti files, which are compatible with other software programs such as SPM and MRtrix3. This step includes a signal scale correction, since the DWI data is acquired in three separate sequential scans. Furthermore, all DW-images were scaled by factor a 10 in three dimensions, to enable proper processing of small brains in software programs designed to process human data like SPM and MRtrix3. Voxel-based analysis requires that all images are spatially normalized to the same template, to enable voxel-wise comparisons. A simplified overview of the different MRI data processing steps is given in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12A–D</xref>.</p><fig id="fig12" position="float"><label>Figure 12.</label><caption><title>Schematic overview of the various processing steps of the DTI and fixel-based analysis.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Using the DWI, we performed a common DTI analysis and a fixel-based analysis.

First, diffusion gradient orientations were checked and automatically corrected to match the coordinate frame of MRtrix3 and ensure the best global ‘connectivity’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Jeurissen et al., 2014a</xref>). Since the DTI data is acquired in three separate sequential scans, we further corrected for intensity differences between scans by rescaling the diffusion scans based on their b0 images. Preprocessing of the individual DW-images included following steps: denoising (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Veraart et al., 2016</xref>), correction for Gibbs ringing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kellner et al., 2016</xref>), motion and distortion correction using FSL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andersson and Sotiropoulos, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Jenkinson et al., 2012</xref>), bias field correction using ANTS (Advanced Normalization Tool; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Avants et al., 2010</xref>), creating automated whole brain mask for whole brain extraction that were manually checked, upsampling to isotropic voxels of 1.75 mm. These preprocessed diffusion weighted images were used to calculate individual diffusion maps (fractional anisotropy, mean, axial and radial diffusivity). The transformation parameters derived from building the FOD template (see 5.5.2) were applied to the diffusion maps to warp them into the template space to perform voxel-based analysis. Next, these images were smoothed to double voxel size (3.5 × 3.5×3.5 mm³). Finally, all normalized diffusion maps were averaged to create a fractional anisotropy template that is used as background to display the statistical results.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5-2"><title>Fixel-based analysis</title><p>For calculation of the fiber-based metrics, we followed the preprocessing steps as defined in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Raffelt et al., 2017</xref>. Fixel-based analysis follows the same preprocessing steps as DTI processing up until the bias field correction. Apparent fiber density analysis differs from DTI analysis by the fact that it is related to the diffusion weighted signal intensity within a given voxel. Therefore, global intensity normalization is performed to ensure robust voxel-wise comparison across subjects. Within this step we used the default fractional anisotropy threshold of 0.4 to create an approximate WM mask, which is used to normalize the median white matter b = 0 intensity across all subjects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Raffelt et al., 2012</xref>). For each image, a white matter response function was estimated for spherical deconvolution using the unsupervised Dhollander algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Dhollander et al., 2019</xref>). Next, the average of all individual response functions was calculated and used for constrained spherical deconvolution to estimate FOD images (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Jeurissen et al., 2014b</xref>). These FOD images were normalized to create a unbiased study-based FOD template, which involves linear and non-linear registration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Raffelt et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Next, the fixels in the FOD template are thresholded at 0.15, identifying the template white matter fixels to be included in further analysis. This threshold is lower than the default threshold of 0.25 for human brain, as this threshold is too high for the songbird brain and excludes many of the genuine white matter fibers. Unlike the mammalian brain which has a laminar organization with large white matter tracts, the avian cerebrum has a nuclear organization with distinct white matter tracts organized in lamina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Avian Brain Nomenclature Consortium et al., 2005</xref>). Certain connections between avian nuclei cross the gray matter like pallium and organize in bundles such as the HVC-RA tract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Karten et al., 2013</xref>). We are aware that choosing a lower threshold comes with the risk of introducing noisy fixels, especially within gray matter, which is a downside of the methodology.</p><p>The estimated transformation parameters or warps of each subject to the template were used to transform the individual FOD maps into template space without FOD reorientation, so that the apparent fiber density can be estimated prior to reorienting the fixels. In the next step, we compare the fixels within a spatially matching voxel of the individual subject and the template white matter fixels, to identify which fixels correspond to each other and subsequently assign the corresponding fiber density value (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Raffelt et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Next to FD, we also computed a fixel-based metric related to the macroscopic morphology in fiber bundle cross-section (FC). Fiber bundle cross-section (FC) information relies solely on the transformation parameters or Jacobian determinants generated during the construction of the population template, similar to other morphometry analyses like voxel-based morphometry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ashburner and Friston, 2000</xref>). Morphological differences in the plane perpendicular to the fixel orientation could reflect differences in the number of axons, myelination or the spacing between axons. For group statistical analysis, the FC values were logarithmically transformed to fiber-bundle cross-section to ensure that the data are centered around zero and normally distributed. Positive values indicate then expansion, whereas negative values reflect shrinkage of a fiber bundle relative to the template (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Raffelt et al., 2017</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5-3"><title>Tractography</title><p>A whole-brain tractogram was generated from the FOD template, which is required for statistical analysis using connectivity-based fixel enhancement (CFE) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Raffelt et al., 2015</xref>). We created 20 million tracks using dynamic seeding, and maximum angle of 45°. We used Spherical-deconvolution informed filtering (SIFT) to filter our tractogram to ensure that the streamline densities approximate the biological fiber densities estimated by spherical deconvolution. SIFT2 creates for each streamline a weighting coefficient based on the underlying FOD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Smith et al., 2015</xref>). Currently, track-weights created in SIFT2 cannot be implicated in statistical analysis. Therefore, in our statistical analyses, we used SIFT, which selectively filters out streamlines based on the spherical deconvolution to reduce the tractogram to 2 million tracks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Smith et al., 2013</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Voxel-based statistical analyses allow for unbiased determination of sexual dimorphisms, longitudinal changes over time and the neural correlates of song behavior (performed using SPM12).

Effects of sex and brain size are assessed using full factorial design, whereas the effect of time and the interaction between sex and time are assessed using a flexible factorial design in SPM.</p><p>Voxel-based clusters are further explored by extracting the average values from these statistical ROI clusters and investigate either their change over time or their correlation to a certain song parameter. Traditional correlation techniques like Pearson correlation require independence of data. Since we have repeated measures, this assumption of independence is violated when performing a multiple regression on longitudinal data. Traditionally, this is solved by using data from only one time point. However, a lot of information on temporal changes is lost this way. Therefore, we use repeated measures correlation instead of traditional correlation techniques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bakdash and Marusich, 2017</xref>). This way, we can assess the within-subject correlation, which gives a meaningful interpretation of how testosterone, song and diffusion parameters correlate to each other on a within-subject level.</p><p>Hormone levels, brain size, and song parameters were analyzed using linear mixed model in JMP Pro 15 (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC, 1989–2007) to assess the main effect of time, sex and their interaction.</p><sec id="s4-6-1"><title>Song analysis and plasma testosterone and estrogen concentrations</title><p>We investigated whether brain size, song behavior, testosterone, and estrogen levels changed significantly over time using linear mixed model (‘time point’, ‘sex’ and the interaction ‘sex * time point’ as fixed factors and ‘subject ID’ as a random factor) via JMP Pro 15 (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC, 1989–2007).

Birds with a brain size larger than the median brain size of 1805 mm³ were considered as large brain starlings. This way, we divided females in large and small brain groups (respectively, females: N = 6 large and N = 6 small, males N = 6 large, N = 7 small). In order to test whether song or testosterone change differently in large versus small brain birds, we performed a linear mixed model analysis for each sex separately with time, brain size (categorical factor of 2 levels) and their interaction as fixed factors and subject as a random factor. Post hoc testing in the linear mixed model analysis was corrected with HSD for multiple comparison using JMP Pro 15. Brain size (continuous variable), body weight, and song parameters were averaged over time to perform a Pearson correlation between these factors for each sex separately in JMP Pro 15.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6-3"><title>Voxel-based analyses</title><p>To identify the general sexual dimorphisms between male and female starlings, we first performed a full factorial voxel-based analysis within the entire brain using SPM12. The same full factorial design was used in the voxel-based analysis for categorical brain size difference with the caveat that brain size was substituted as a factor instead of sex. In a separate analysis, we determined the longitudinal neuroplastic changes over time within the song control system, auditory system and their interconnecting tracts using a flexible factorial analysis. To investigate where within the starling brain microstructural properties relate to song behavior parameters, we executed voxel-based multiple regression analyses for fractional anisotropy. To this end, the averaged song behavior parameters were used for this analysis. Clusters were only considered significant if their peak value reached the significance level of p&lt;0.05 corrected for the familywise error rate (FWE) and contained at least (k<sub>E</sub>) 10 (contiguous) voxels. Flexible factorial and multiple regression analyses were performed with a small volume mask including the song control nuclei, auditory system and their interconnecting tracts. This way, we ensured we did not miss significant changes in relevant regions that might be obscured by the stringent correction for multiple comparisons in whole brain analysis. Results shown are from the voxel-based analysis with the latter small volume correction.

A fixel-based analysis was performed to assess the difference between sexes and brain size, both examined in separate tests. In the CFE statistical test, we used whole block exchangeability to look for changes between subjects and included the time point information in a variance group. Similarly to the voxel-based DTI analysis, statistical results were visualized with a significance threshold of p&lt;0.001 (uncorrected for multiple comparison) and color-coded according to their significance T-value or the physical direction of the tract.</p></sec></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors wish to thank Ben Jeurissen (Vision Lab of the University of Antwerp) and Robert Smith (The Florey Institute of Neuroscience and Mental Health) for their help with MRtrix3.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Timothy Behrens as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Tyler Stevenson (Reviewer #1); Alessandro Gozzi (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers were very impressed with this study. They have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission. These are detailed as possible revisions below for you to consider</p><p>Possible revisions (for the authors):</p><p>1. Referee #1 suggest a reconsideration of the title.</p><p>2. Please state if any other measures of song complexity were used.</p><p>3. Age and sex of birds needs clarification.</p><p>4. Referee #2 makes a number of suggestions regarding technical exposition in their public review.</p><p>5. Referee #3 raises some question about how the data relate to the known song system in European starlings and suggests an additional figure.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. The Raven Pro software is a powerful tool to analyse the complexities of song. The main measures used to evaluate song are rate and bout length. The song rate is primarily driven by hypothalamic structures not highlighted in the manuscript. Bout length is a good measure of song quality, but not complexity. The study would be strengthened if the authors included other measures (e.g. entropy) and then relate any variation to known brain structures (e.g. HVC, Area X).</p><p>2. The sex and age of the birds should be clarified. There are a couple statements on this issue in the manuscript (i.e. lines 615-617 and lines 743-745). The interpretation is also slightly limited as the location and time of year for bird capture is not clear. We both males and female collected in France and Cyprus, or were males collected in France and females in Cyprus? The 'respectively' on line 798 does not clearly resolve the confusion. Based on later text, it seems that males were collected in 2014 and females in 2017. The difference in female brain size and body mass is likely due to age and the authors might want to compare their data with Sockman et al., 2004 Biol Reprod. 71:979-986.

Then some of the main figures could go to the supplementary information and the paper itself will be clearer.</p><p>3. It shows that the authors put a great amount of effort in the study, and the analysis is very impressive. I believe that the paper in this form may be a little bit too long and it misses the emphasis of novel results (like the involvement of the hippocampus in singing female starling), which could set as ground for further studies. A better introduction of the brain region that will later be described as significant together with some modification to the figures, will make the paper much more appealing to the broader neuroscience community, in my opinion.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.66777.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1.

We included the different phrase types (wistles, variables, rattles and high frequency phrase) used within each song, and a measure for phrase diversity within a song (the different phrase types used within a song bout). Unfortunately, we could not analyze entropy, since song recordings had to be done next to the large aviary (in order for the birds to actually sing) which results in background noise that compromises the entropy calculations.</p><p>The finding that the brain size difference was confounded by the difference in singing behavior of female starlings was important for the interpretation of the brain size and sex differences. Which is why we included the song analysis and the neural correlates in this paper. Initially we added the complete and extended song analysis dataset in the paper but it further elongated this already extensive paper, without contributing to the main message. That’s why we opted to have the extended song analysis on song complexity in a separate paper, since the original paper was already becoming quite long and the extra analysis could distract further from the main message. The further extended analysis of female song compared to male song deserves a separate paper on its own, as these findings are relevant for the songbird research community.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

Since both sexes were caught as adults, we do not have their exact age. None of them had brown plumage so they all were at least one year old. We want to clarify that even though both sexes were caught at different times, they all went through the same artificial photoperiodic and MRI acquisitions occurred within a year after catching them. Any age differences that are present within the groups, are out of our control, as we do not know the age of the birds upon catching them in the wild.</p><p>We do believe that age is a contributing factor to the difference in brain size as explained in the discussion.</p><p>“Brain size is affected by multiple factors including age, circulating hormone levels, environment and experience (Healy and Rowe 2007). Of note, because we used wild caught starlings we cannot control for their exact age or developmental history. The larger females could be older compared to the smaller female starlings.”</p><p>We clarified the origin of the animals as follows in line 816:</p><p>“All experiments were performed on thirteen male and twelve female starlings (<italic>Sturnus vulgaris</italic>). The males were wild caught as adults in Normandy (France) in November 2014 and the females were caught in Nicosia (Cyprus) in March 2017.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.

Some hot areas in the figures are not labeled, what is the reason for it?</p></disp-quote><p>We tried to label as many areas as possible, without making the figures too loaded with information. We added some extra labels in figures 3-6, to further clarify some areas. However, labeling is sometimes difficult, since significant clusters blend from one region to the next. For this reason we included the population-based template with the anatomical location of the most important structures in the original manuscript. This can be used as a look up figure to situate the location of a cluster relative to known regions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

Then some of the main figures could go to the supplementary information and the paper itself will be clearer.</p></disp-quote><p>We asked some further explanation about this recommendation:</p><p>To which figures does this statement apply?</p><p>Does the reviewer suggest we only select 1 area (with a sex difference, brain size difference, time difference or correlation) to visualize and have the rest of the statistics in table format and supplementary figures?</p><p>And if so it might be difficult to choose which area to show, since there are many interesting regions. Furthermore, one of the points we make is that MRI has a whole-brain approach, and we do not want to limit ourselves to for example only the song control system as so many papers before did.</p><p>We could for example select HVC, and show all the statistics for that region, but this would maybe bias the message of the paper. And while most areas follow a similar change over time in FA for example, there are subtle differences in when the first changes are notable, and what are the contributing factors.</p><p>We understand that there is a balance too be made, so that the paper does not become overwhelming, but this is a difficult one.</p><p>This was the reviewer’s response: I accept the authors' answer to my comment, and I think it is reasonable to keep the figures as is. Since I am not an expert in fMRI, I was interested in knowing how the raw data looks like (from which you derive your metrics). If that is something you could easily add as a supplemental figure, it would be great.</p><p>An example of the raw images is depicted in figure 12, where we show how an image is processed at each different step. The extracted metrics are now supplied in supplementary figures to figure 3-6 as suggested by reviewer 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. It shows that the authors put a great amount of effort in the study, and the analysis is very impressive. I believe that the paper in this form may be a little bit too long and it misses the emphasis of novel results (like the involvement of the hippocampus in singing female starling), which could set as ground for further studies. A better introduction of the brain region that will later be described as significant together with some modification to the figures, will make the paper much more appealing to the broader neuroscience community, in my opinion.</p></disp-quote><p>We now added a few lines to the introduction to introduce the role of other regions like the cerebellum and hippocampus.</p><p>However, in vivo Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) allows us to visualize the entire brain and study the involvement of other structures like the hippocampus and cerebellum, which recently have been shown to be involved in song preference and song processing, respectively (Person, Gale et al. 2008, Bailey, Wade et al. 2009, Striedter 2016, Pidoux, Le Blanc et al. 2018).</p><p>In addition we added a schematic overview in figure 1 that visualized the connections of the cerebellum and hippocampus together with the scheme of the auditory and song control system.</p></body></sub-article></article>
