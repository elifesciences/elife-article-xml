PM results from accumulation of <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic>-infected erythrocytes (IE) that express the surface antigen VAR2CSA and bind to chondroitin sulfate A (CSA) in the placenta. Women become PM-resistant over successive pregnancies as they develop anti-adhesion and anti-VAR2CSA antibodies, supporting VAR2CSA as the leading PM-vaccine candidate. However, the first VAR2CSA subunit vaccines failed to induce broadly neutralizing antibody and it is known that naturally acquired antibodies target both variant-specific and conserved epitopes. It is crucial to determine whether effective vaccines will require incorporation of many or only a single VAR2CSA variants. Here, IgG from multigravidae was sequentially purified on five full-length VAR2CSA ectodomain variants, thereby depleting IgG reactivity to each. The five VAR2CSA variants purified ~0.7% of total IgG and yielded both strain-transcending and strain-specific reactivity to VAR2CSA and IE-surface antigen. In two independent antibody purification/depletion experiments with permutated order of VAR2CSA variants, IgG purified on the first VAR2CSA antigen displayed broad cross-reactivity to both recombinant and native VAR2CSA variants, and inhibited binding of all isolates to CSA. IgG remaining after depletion on all variants showed significantly reduced binding-inhibition activity compared to initial total IgG. These findings demonstrate that a single VAR2CSA ectodomain variant displays conserved epitopes that are targeted by neutralizing (or binding-inhibitory) antibodies shared by multiple parasite strains, including maternal isolates. This suggests that a broadly effective PM-vaccine can be achieved with a limited number of VAR2CSA variants.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>P. falciparum</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006492</institution-id><institution>Division of Intramural Research, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Doritchamou</surname><given-names>Justin YA</given-names></name><name><surname>Renn</surname><given-names>Jonathan P</given-names></name><name><surname>Jenkins</surname><given-names>Bethany</given-names></name><name><surname>Fried</surname><given-names>Michal</given-names></name><name><surname>Duffy</surname><given-names>Patrick E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group></article-meta></front><back><sec id="s1" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interest</title><fn fn-type="conflict" id="conf1"><p>The authors declare that no competing interests exist.</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Human subjects: For this study, a plasma pool was prepared using samples from multigravid women participating in the previously described Immuno-epidemiology (IMEP) study (Fried et al., 2018). Briefly, pregnant women aged 15-45 years without clinical evidence of chronic or debilitating illness were enrolled from 2010-2013 into a longitudinal cohort study of mother-infant pairs conducted in Ouélessébougou, Mali. All participants provided signed informed consent after receiving a study explanation form and oral explanation from a study clinician in their native language. The study protocol and study procedures were approved by the institutional review board of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the US National Institutes of Health (ClinicalTrials.gov ID NCT01168271), and the Ethics Committee of the Faculty of Medicine, Pharmacy and Dentistry at the University of Bamako, Mali.</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional Files</title><sec id="s3" sec-type="data-availability"><title>Data availability</title><p>All data generated or analysed during this study are included in the manuscript and supporting file; Source Data files have been provided for all figures.</p></sec><supplementary-material><ext-link xlink:href="elife-76264-supp-v1.zip">Download zip</ext-link><p>Any figures and tables for this article are included in the PDF.
