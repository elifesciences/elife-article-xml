degradation. While microtubular transport is crucial for the proper function of autophagy, the exact roles of factors responsible for positioning autophagosomes remain incompletely understood. In this study, we performed a loss-of-function genetic screen targeting genes potentially involved in microtubular motility. A genetic background that blocks autophagosome-lysosome fusions was used to accurately analyze autophagosome positioning. We discovered that pre-fusion autophagosomes move towards the non-centrosomal microtubule organizing center (ncMTOC) in <italic>Drosophila</italic> fat cells, which requires a dynein-dynactin complex. This process is regulated by the small GTPases Rab7 and Rab39 together with their adaptors: Epg5 and ema, respectively. The dynein-dependent movement of vesicles toward the nucleus/ncMTOC is essential for efficient autophagosomal fusions with lysosomes and subsequent degradation. Remarkably, altering the balance of kinesin and dynein motors changes the direction of autophagosome movement, indicating a competitive relationship where normally dynein-mediated transport prevails. Since pre-fusion lysosomes were positioned similarly to autophagosomes, it indicates that pre-fusion autophagosomes and lysosomes converge at the ncMTOC, which increases the efficiency of vesicle fusions.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>autophagosome</kwd><kwd>dynein</kwd><kwd>microtubular

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Macroautophagy is an essential self-degradation pathway in eukaryotic cells, during which double-membrane-bound autophagosomes transport materials to lysosomes for degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Parzych and Klionsky, 2014</xref>). Defects in autophagy are associated with multiple pathologies, prompting extensive study of its molecular players over the past decades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lei and Klionsky, 2021</xref>). During macroautophagy, a double-membrane structure called an autophagosome is formed in an <italic>atg</italic> gene-dependent manner. This autophagosome then fuses with a lysosome or late endosome in a process dependent on the small GTPases Rab7, Rab2, and Arl8, the HOPS tethering complex, and the SNARE proteins Syntaxin17, Ubisnap/SNAP29, and Vamp7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lőrincz and Juhász, 2020</xref>).</p><p>Autophagosomes are suggested to form at random locations within the cytoplasm and are subsequently transported toward the cell center (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jahreiss et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kimura et al., 2008</xref>). Establishing proper proximity between autophagosomes and lysosomes is essential for their ability to fuse. The microtubular network and associated motor proteins are crucial for most vesicular transport. Thus, the involvement of the microtubular system has been suggested in various aspects of autophagosome dynamics, including biogenesis, transport, amphisome formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Köchl et al., 2006</xref>), and autophagic clearance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ravikumar et al., 2005</xref>). It is proposed that while microtubules are necessary for the maturation of autophagosomes, their fusion capacity is independent of microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fass et al., 2006</xref>). Nevertheless, dynein-regulated autophagosomal motility appears indispensable for efficient lysosomal fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jahreiss et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kimura et al., 2008</xref>). How autophagosomes gain the ability to move along microtubules remains unclear. It is suggested that autophagic vesicles acquire dyneins by endosomal fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cheng et al., 2015</xref>); however, autophagosomes still appear to be motile upon Syx17 loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Neisch et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Most of our knowledge about autophagosome positioning and movement comes from studies on neurons, where autophagosomes form in the terminal part of axons and then travel toward the soma by dynein-dynactin-regulated bulk retrograde transport during basal autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ikenaka et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lee et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Maday et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wang et al., 2015</xref>). During their route, they fuse with endosomes and lysosomes, resulting in gradual acidification and the acquisition of lysosomal markers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kargbo-Hill and Colón-Ramos, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lee et al., 2011</xref>). Degradation takes place in the cell body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Maday et al., 2012</xref>). Inhibited retrograde transport leads to neurodegeneration and defective removal of synaptic autophagosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lee et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ravikumar et al., 2005</xref>), highlighting the importance of axonal transport in the acidification and degradation processes.</p><p>Autophagosomes are suggested to use both dyneins and kinesins in neuronal cells. Initially, they exhibit bidirectional motility at the axon tip, later shifting to dynein-regulated retrograde transport directed toward the soma, where the already mature autolysosomes again show bidirectional motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Maday et al., 2012</xref>). Various scaffolding proteins have been found to regulate autophagosome transport, including CKA as part of the STRIPAK complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Neisch et al., 2017</xref>), JIP1, JIP3, and JIP4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cason et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cason and Holzbaur, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fu et al., 2014</xref>), as well as Huntingtin and HAP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cason et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kargbo-Hill and Colón-Ramos, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wong and Holzbaur, 2014</xref>). It is important to note that before autophagosome closure, phagophores are not able to be transported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fass et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>However, most of our knowledge about autophagosome motility comes from experimental methods and tools that do not distinguish between non-acidic autophagosomes and autophagic structures that have already undergone some endolysosomal fusion and acidification. For example, several studies used reporters such as LC3 fused to red fluorescent proteins, which also label post-fusion autolysosomes. Consequently, autophagic organelles that have acidified are sometimes still considered autophagosomes, when in fact they could be autolysosomes.</p><p>We and our colleagues have previously identified and characterized several key players in autophagosome-lysosome fusion in starved <italic>Drosophila</italic> fat cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boda et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hegedűs et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lőrincz et al., 2017b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Takáts et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Takáts et al., 2014</xref>). During these studies, we observed an intriguing phenomenon: despite being generated at random positions in the cytosol, autophagosomes accumulated around the nucleus when either the HOPS tethering complex or the SNARE fusion machinery was inhibited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boda et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lőrincz et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Takáts et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Takáts et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>This observation led us to employ a novel and unique approach by examining autophagosome positioning in cells where autophagosome-lysosome fusion was inhibited using HOPS RNAi. This method allowed us to exclude the confounding effects of ongoing vesicle fusions, which could otherwise obscure the accurate determination of the roles of different factors in vesicle positioning. These cells were utilized in an RNA interference screen to identify and characterize the molecular participants involved in autophagosome positioning. Our work represents the first comprehensive description of the transport machinery involved in pre-fusion autophagosomes and its significance during autolysosome formation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>We began our investigations by performing an RNA interference screen to identify genes potentially involved in the microtubular positioning of autophagosomes, including MT proteins and motors (such as dynein, dynactin, and kinesin subunits), Rab small GTPases, and their effectors (for the complete list of tested genes and results, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1 supp2">Supplementary files 1 and 2</xref>). We used larval fat cells of the fruit fly (<italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>) as a model system, in which bulk macroautophagy was induced by starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Scott et al., 2004</xref>). The fat tissue contained GFP-positive mosaic cells, in which we silenced the gene of interest together with the Vps16A central subunit of the HOPS complex. This RNAi effectively impairs autophagosomal fusion, leading to the accumulation of autophagosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Takáts et al., 2014</xref>). Fat cells also expressed an mCherry-Atg8a reporter driven by a <italic>UAS</italic>-independent fat body-specific <italic>R4</italic> promoter. This reporter marks both autophagosomes and autolysosomes in control cells, due to the stability of mCherry in acidic environments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). However, in <italic>vps16a</italic> RNAi cells, which also expressed a control (<italic>luciferase</italic>) RNAi, we observed the accumulation of small mCherry-Atg8a puncta—representing autophagosomes—in the perinuclear region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A, B and F</xref>), consistent with previous observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Takáts et al., 2014</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Autophagosomes move towards the non-centrosomal microtubule organizing center (ncMTOC) in fat cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic drawing of the experimental design for screening.

Although Atg8a signal intensity detected by immunohistochemistry is higher in fusion-incompetent cells than in adjacent control cells due to the accumulation of non-degraded Atg8a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>), the signal of the mCherry-Atg8a reporter appears slightly weaker in <italic>vps16a</italic> RNAi cells compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).

To exclude the possibility that the perinuclear accumulation of autophagosomes and unfused lysosomes is due to the overall disorganization of organelles in Vps16A-depleted cells, we immunostained the cells against Gmap, which revealed that the positions of the Golgi apparatuses remained similar to control upon Vps16A silencing. Additionally, the fluorescent signal of Gmap was increased in Vps16A-depleted cells, which is consistent with the fact that the Golgi apparatus is a substrate of golgiphagy in flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rahman et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C, G and H</xref>).</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>The transport of autophagosomes is microtubule-dependent and minus-end directed</title><p>As microtubule (MT)-associated autophagosome transport has been suggested to be more prominent compared to the actomyosin network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lőrincz and Juhász, 2020</xref>), we first silenced the microtubule subunits α- and β-tubulin in <italic>vps16a</italic> RNAi cells to clarify whether the perinuclear localization of autophagosomes is indeed established by the MT network.

Taking into consideration that Epg5 was found to regulate the positioning of autophagosomes but not lysosomes, we utilized garland nephrocytes to study its effect on endolysosome maturation. Nephrocytes maintain a constant rate of endocytosis, making them ideal tools to study the endolysosomal system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lőrincz et al., 2016</xref>).

Their overlap represents autolysosomes, while 3xmCherry-Atg8a-positive, Lamp1-negative structures are considered pre-fusion autophagosomes. Conversely, Lamp1-positive, 3xmCherry-Atg8a-negative structures indicate lysosomes of non-autophagic origin. Thus, reduced colocalization indicates a fusion defect. In control cells, Lamp1 or GFP-Lamp1 overlaps with mCherry-Atg8a, indicating that these organelles are indeed autolysosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A and H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">Figure 10—figure supplement 1A, G</xref>).

This indicates that impaired motility alone does not directly block fusion, but rather reduces its probability.

However, the positioning of autophagosomes is less understood. Autophagosome transport has been primarily studied in highly polarized neurons under basal conditions. In neuronal cells, dynein-mediated transport, regulated by several suggested adaptor molecules, has been described. However, most reporters and reagents used for studying autophagosome transport cannot differentiate between pre-fusion and post-fusion autophagic vesicles. Therefore, the regulation of non-fused autophagosome motility remains unclear. We propose that an autophagosome should not be considered as such once its lumen has started to acidify or undergo fusion, transitioning to a maturing autolysosome.</p><p>To address this issue, we established a genetic system generating mosaic cells where Vps16A, a central HOPS subunit, is silenced. Without Vps16A, cells are unable to fuse autophagosomes with lysosomes or late endosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Takáts et al., 2014</xref>), thus preventing the formation of autolysosomes. This system allowed us to study autophagosome positioning without misidentifying autolysosomes as autophagosomes. Given that fat cells have perinuclear non-centrosomal MTOCs, we hypothesized that non-fused autophagosomes move in a minus-end direction, likely driven by dyneins. This hypothesis was supported by our observation that relocating the ncMTOC using <italic>shot</italic> RNAi also relocated autophagosomes to this region.</p><p>Loss of dyneins and dynactins not only blocked perinuclear autophagosome positioning but also redistributed them to the cell periphery, suggesting that kinesin-regulated motility becomes available for starvation-induced autophagosomes in these conditions. Importantly, we showed that not all dyneins or dynactins are required for this transport. A dedicated cytosolic dynein complex, composed of Dhc64 (a heavy chain subunit), sw (an intermediate chain subunit), Dlic (a light intermediate chain subunit), and robl (a light chain subunit), activated by a dynactin complex, is required for autophagosome transport. This is consistent with observations that autophagosomes can move bidirectionally in neurons and that purified autophagosome fractions contain both dyneins and kinesins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Maday et al., 2012</xref>). Our results also reinforce findings that microtubule inhibitors block centrosome-directed autophagosome transport in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fass et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>Taking these observations into consideration, we investigated the relationship between dyneins and kinesins in autophagosome transport. Overexpression of kinesin motors blocked minus-end transport, while autophagosomes in kinesin and dynactin double knockdown cells appeared immobile. Moreover, expressing a recombinant minus-end kinesin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Clark et al., 1997</xref>) partially rescued the peripheral relocation of autophagosomes upon dynactin silencing, indicating a competitive relationship between minus- and plus-end motors in autophagosome positioning. The possibility of plus-end transport as a secondary mechanism raises questions about its physiological role. Besides enabling bidirectional movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jahreiss et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Maday et al., 2012</xref>), it is possible that autophagosomes transport kinesins to autolysosomes, similar to endosomes, which are suggested to transport dyneins to autophagic vacuoles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cheng et al., 2015</xref>). Therefore, if kinesins are present but are downregulated on autophagosomes, the absence of dyneins could potentially release them from inhibition. Autophagic vesicles are suggested to move towards the plus end (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mauvezin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pankiv et al., 2010</xref>), and loss of various kinesins leads to autophagosome accumulation in the cell center in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cardoso et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Korolchuk et al., 2011</xref>). The plus-end transport of autophagic vesicles by the Klp98A kinesin in <italic>Drosophila</italic> promotes autophagosome-lysosome fusion and degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mauvezin et al., 2016</xref>). However, our tests indicated that Rab14 and its interactor Klp98A likely transport autolysosomes, not autophagosomes, as evidenced by the non-autophagosomal localization of YFP-Rab14 and that their RNAi-s had no effect on autophagosome positioning in starved, HOPS-depleted cells. Since neither kinesin RNAi altered the perinuclear accumulation of autophagosomes in Vps16A-depleted cells, we propose that the default direction is towards the MTOC at the minus-ends of microtubules.</p><p>Among Rab small GTPases, we identified Rab7 and Rab39 as regulators of autophagosome positioning. Rab7, crucial for autophagosome-lysosome fusion, appears on autophagosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hegedűs et al., 2016</xref>). Its knockdown resulted in autophagosomes remaining randomly positioned in the cytosol, highlighting its importance in bidirectional motility. Consistent with our findings, Rab7 regulates both minus- and plus-end directed motility of lysosomes or endosomes, involving several adaptors such as Plekhm1 and FYCO1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fujiwara et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jordens et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ma et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pankiv et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tabata et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">van der Kant et al., 2013</xref>). However, only one Rab7 interactor, the autophagy adaptor Epg5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gillingham et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wang et al., 2016</xref>), produced a similar phenotype to Rab7 in our tests. Additionally, we demonstrated that Epg5 coprecipitates with Dhc64C, and localizes to Rab7 and Atg8a-positive vesicles in cultured fruit fly cells. As Epg5 loss did not significantly impact the endolysosomal system, it appears to function in the autophagic pathway. Epg5 interacts with Rab7 and LC3 to mediate autophagosome-lysosome fusion in fly, worm, and mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hori et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wang et al., 2016</xref>), and its mutations are linked to Vici syndrome, a severe neurodegenerative disorder in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Balasubramaniam et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Byrne et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Meneghetti et al., 2019</xref>). We thus identify a potential new role for Epg5 in autophagosome positioning.</p><p>Silencing Rab39 and its interactor ema (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gillingham et al., 2014</xref>) produced a phenotype similar to Rab7 or Epg5 loss. Rab39 regulates lysosomal function and interacts with HOPS in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lakatos et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zhang et al., 2023</xref>). Ema promotes autophagosome biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kim et al., 2012</xref>) and endosomal maturation through HOPS interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kim et al., 2010</xref>). Our results suggest that Rab7-Epg5 and Rab39-ema interactions are both necessary for bidirectional autophagosome motility. Further studies are required to clarify their exact roles and interrelations. YFP-tagged Rab7 and Rab39 both colocalized with autophagosomes, supporting their role in motility. Rab2, Rab7, and Arl8 are known lysosomal fusion factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boda et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hegedűs et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lőrincz et al., 2017b</xref>), but unlike Rab7, neither Rab2 nor Arl8 knockdown affected autophagosome positioning. Since YFP-Rab2 was also found to colocalize with autophagosomes, our results suggest that its sole role on autophagosomes is to regulate maturation. Although our RNAi screen identified a molecular machinery potentially sufficient for autophagosome transport, other small GTPases, adaptors, or motor subunits may also influence this process. Because validating the proper loss-of-function effect for every RNAi line used in the screen was impractical, we cannot exclude the possibility that some negative results were due to inefficient silencing. It is also important to note that <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells exhibit a wide variety of microtubule-organizing centers (MTOCs) during development, including both centrosomal and non-centrosomal types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tillery et al., 2018</xref>). A key future direction will be to examine autophagosome motility in additional cell types to determine whether the same positioning machinery operates universally, or whether cell-type–specific mechanisms exist.</p><p>Given the small Arl8-positive lysosomes in the perinuclear region upon Vps16A silencing, we hypothesized that pre-fusion lysosomes might exhibit similar motility to autophagosomes. This was largely confirmed, as minus-end transport of immature lysosomes depended on dyneins, Rab7, Rab39, and ema. However, Epg5 did not influence lysosome positioning, indicating that its function is likely exerted at the surface of autophagosomes. Conversely, Rab2 was identified as a regulator of minus-end-directed lysosome transport. These findings suggest similar but distinct regulatory mechanisms for pre-fusion organelle transport, possibly to enhance fusion efficiency by converging them towards the cell center. Rab2’s interaction with motor adaptors such as Bicaudal D (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gillingham et al., 2014</xref>) likely regulates lysosome motility.</p><p>Moreover, mature autolysosomes, but not pre-fusion ones, redistributed to the cell periphery upon Rab39 silencing, similar to dynein-depleted cells, suggesting that Rab39 exclusively regulates minus-end movement at the post-fusion level. Considering that plus-end directed lysosome motility is regulated by Arl8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bagshaw et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boda et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hofmann and Munro, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Marwaha et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rosa-Ferreira and Munro, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Rosa-Ferreira et al., 2018</xref>), which is dispensable for autophagosome motility, it is plausible that Rab39 promotes bidirectional transport of pre-fusion organelles, while its role post-fusion is restricted to minus-end directed motility.</p><p>An important question is why pre-fusion autophagosomes and lysosomes travel to the same destination. It is feasible to think this is because they need to fuse with each other. We found that loss of minus-end directed motility reduced autolysosome maturation; in dynein- or dynactin-depleted cells, only smaller autolysosomes were produced, and autophagosome-lysosome fusion decreased. This aligns with previous observations that dynein-regulated autophagosomal motility is indispensable for efficient lysosomal fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jahreiss et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kimura et al., 2008</xref>). Conversely, inhibiting kinesins did not impede autophagosome-lysosome fusion, and concentrating autophagosomes and lysosomes to a smaller ectopic ncMTOC via <italic>shot</italic> RNAi resulted in enlarged lysosomes, allowing autophagosome-lysosome fusion to proceed.</p><p>Therefore, we propose a model in which pre-fusion organelles travel towards the MTOC in a cytosolic dynein-dependent manner regulated by small GTPases and their adaptors (Rab7-Epg5 and Rab39-ema on autophagosomes; Rab7, Rab39-ema, and Rab2 on lysosomes) to enhance fusion probability. After fusion, autolysosomes can move to the periphery in an Arl8-dependent manner and back, regulated by Rab39 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>).</p><fig id="fig11" position="float"><label>Figure 11.</label><caption><title>Model of the transport of autophagosomes and lysosomes in starved fat cells.</title><p>Before fusion, autophagosomes and lysosomes are transported towards the perinuclear non-centrosomal microtubule organizing center (ncMTOC) by a cytosolic dynein complex in starved fat cells to ensure proper fusion and effective degradation. This process requires Rab7, Rab39, and their interactors Epg5 and ema on autophagosomes, and Rab2, Rab7, Rab39, and the Rab39 interactor ema, but not Epg5, on lysosomes. After fusion, Arl8 mediates the plus-end transport of autolysosomes, while Rab39 promotes dynein-regulated minus-end directed transport. Thus, the motility of pre-fusion and post-fusion organelles is differently regulated: pre-fusion organelles generally move towards the MTOC, while post-fusion organelles exhibit bidirectional motility. This spatial regulation ensures proper fusion rates and degradation efficiency.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-102663-fig11-v1.tif"/></fig></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Fly work and RNAi-based screen</title><p>We raised the fly stocks and crosses in glass vials, on standard food at 25 °C.

Images from eleven consecutive focal planes (section thickness: 0.35 µm in case of the 40× objective, and 0.25 µm in case of the 63×objective) were merged into one image. In case of S2<italic>R</italic>+ cells, fluorescent images were obtained with an Olympus IX83 inverted fluorescent microscope, equipped with an Orca FusionBT CMOS camera (Hamamatsu), using a Universal Plan Extended Apochromat 60×/1.42 NA objective (Olympus), and cellSens Dimension 4.1 software (Olympus). Images were taken with full optical sectioning of the cells; the focal planes were merged into one image and deconvolution was applied. Figures were produced in Photoshop CS5 Extended (Adobe).</p><p>Fluorescent structures were quantified either using ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health) or, in case of some types of experiment, manually. The signal threshold of the fluorescent channel of interest was set by the same person during quantifying one type of experiment with ImageJ. The fat cells, S2R+ cells, and garland nephrocytes were randomly selected for quantification.</p><p>Structure distributions were quantified using ImageJ. In all cases, only cells with their nuclei in the focal plane were selected to ensure that both perinuclear and peripheral regions were included in quantifications. To quantify structure distribution, we divided the fat cells into a perinuclear and a peripheral domain that were measured to be equal and calculated the area of the fluorescent signal in both domains. Then the difference in signal areas of the perinuclear and peripheral domains was divided by the signal area of the entire cell, thus obtaining a ratio that represents the distribution of structures (1 – perfectly perinuclear, 0 – evenly dispersed, –1 – perfectly peripheral). In case of distribution of non-colocalizing 3xmCherry-Atg8a or GFP-Lamp1-positive structures, overlapping dots were removed from each channel using Photoshop CS5 Extended.</p><p>The counts of cells with ectopic ncMTOC (<italic>shot</italic> RNAi lines) and the Rab7/Arl8 ring counts (<italic>epg5</italic> RNAi) were determined manually by the same person. For quantifying Gmap or mCherry-Atg8a signal intensities, mean gray values of neighboring control and RNAi cells were calculated by ImageJ. Colocalizations were quantified manually by the same person in case of fat body cells. Dot plots and Pearson’s coefficients were calculated by ImageJ for evaluating colocalization in S2<italic>R</italic>+ cells.</p><p>To evaluate data from garland nephrocyte experiments, we used ImageJ to quantify fluorescent structures from unmodified single focal planes. To quantify the size of the Rab7 and FYVE-GFP-positive endosomes, we measured the area of individual vesicles in the given focal plane of the cells. After setting the threshold for the fluorescent signal, we used the Watershed function of ImageJ coupled with manual segmentation when it was necessary to properly separate endosomes. For each genotype, we used 5 animals and measured the size of endosomes from a total of 10 cells. To quantify Lamp1 antibody staining signal in nephrocytes, we measured the area fraction of the cells covered by the given fluorescent signal at proper and uniform threshold settings. For each genotype, we used 5 late L3 stage animals and measured 15 cells.</p><p>Data were statistically evaluated using Prism 9.4.1 (GraphPad). The distribution of the datasets was determined using the D'Agostino &amp; Pearson normality test. Parametric, unpaired, two-tailed t-test or one-way ANOVA (with Dunnett multiple comparisons test) was used to compare two or more samples, respectively, all showing normal distribution. When comparing two or more samples that contained at least one variable showing non-Gaussian distribution, we used non-parametric Mann-Whitney test or Kruskal-Wallis test (with Dunn’s multiple comparisons test), respectively. We showed the data as violin plots in the figures and represented p-values as asterisks (&lt;0.0001 ****; 0.0001–0.001 ***; 0.001–0.01 **; 0.01–0.05 *; 0.05&lt;non-significant). Samples that are significantly different from the control are marked by green on the violin plots.

However, as these previous studies did not distinguish between autophagosomes and autolysosomes, it remains unknown whether autophagosomes begin to move after fusion with lysosomes or even before fusion. In this manuscript, the authors show using fusion-deficient vps16a RNAi cells that both pre-fusion autophagosomes and lysosomes can move along the microtubules towards the minus end. This was confirmed in snap29 RNAi cells. By screening motor proteins and Rabs, the authors found that autophagosomal traffic is primarily regulated by the dynein-dynactin system and can be counter-regulated by kinesins. They also show that Rab7-Epg5 and Rab39-ema interactions are important for autophagosome trafficking.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>This study uses reliable Drosophila genetics and high-quality fluorescence microscopy. The data are properly quantified and statistically analyzed. It is a reasonable hypothesis that gathering pre-fusion autophagosomes and lysosomes in close proximity improves fusion efficiency.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>(1) This study investigates the behavior of pre-fusion autophagosomes and lysosomes using fusion-incompetent cells (e.g., vps16a RNAi cells). However, the claim that these cells are truly fusion-incompetent relies on citations from previous studies. Since this is a foundational premise of the research, it should be rigorously evaluated before interpreting the data. It's particularly awkward that the crucial data for vps16a RNAi is only presented at the very end of Figure 10-S1; this should be among the first data shown (the same for SNAP29). It would be important to determine the extent to which autophagosomes and lysosomes are fusing (or tethered in close proximity), within each of these cell lines.</p><p>(2) In the new Figures 8 and 9, the authors analyze autolysosomes without knocking down Vps16A (i.e., without inhibiting fusion). However, as this reviewer pointed out in the previous round, it is highly likely that both autophagosomes and autolysosomes are present in these cells. This is particularly relevant given that the knockdown of dynein-dynactin, Rab7, and Epg5 only partially inhibits the fusion of autophagosomes and lysosomes (Figure 10H). If the goal is to investigate the effects of fusion, it would be more appropriate to analyze autolysosomes and autophagosomes separately. The authors mention that they can differentiate these two structures based on the size of mCherry-Atg8a structures. If this is the case, they should perform separate analyses for both autophagosomes and autolysosomes.</p><p>(3) This is also a continued Issue from the previous review. The authors suggest that autophagosome movement is crucial for fusion, based on the observed decrease in fusion rates in Rab7 and Epg5 knockdown cells (Fig. 10). However, this conclusion is not well supported. It is known that Rab7 and Epg5 are directly involved in the fusion process itself. Therefore, the possibility that the observed decrease is simply due to a direct defect in fusion, rather than an impairment of movement, has not been ruled out.</p><p>(4) The term &quot;autolysosome maturation&quot; appears multiple times, yet its meaning remains unclear. Does it refer to autolysosome formation (autophagosome-lysosome fusion), or does it imply a further maturation process occurring after autolysosome formation? This is not a commonly used term in the field, so it requires a clear definition.</p><p>(5) In Figure 1-S1D, the authors state that the disappearance of the mCherry-Atg8a signal after atg8a RNAi indicates that the observed structures are not non-autophagic vacuoles. This reasoning is inappropriate. Naturally, knocking down Atg8 will abolish its signal, regardless of the nature of the vacuoles. This does not definitively distinguish autophagic from non-autophagic structures.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.102663.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript by Boda et al. describes the results of a targeted RNAi screen in the background of Vps16A-depleted Drosophila larval fat body cells. In this background, lysosomal fusion is inhibited, allowing the authors to analyze the motility and localization specifically of autophagosomes, prior to their fusion with lysosomes to become autolysosomes. In this Vps16A-deleted background, mCherry-Atg8a labeled autophagosomes accumulate in the perinuclear area, through an unknown mechanism.</p><p>The authors found that depletion of multiple subunits of the dynein/dynactin complex caused an alternation of this mCherry-Atg8a localization, moving from the perinuclear region to the cell periphery. Interactions with kinesin overexpression suggest these motor proteins may compete for autophagosome binding and transport. The authors extended these findings by examining potential upstream regulators including Rab proteins and selected effectors, and they also examined effects on lysosomal movement and autolysosome size. Altogether, the results are consistent with a model in which specific Rab/effector complexes direct movement of lysosomes and autophagosomes toward the MTOC, promoting their fusion and subsequent dispersal throughout the cell.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>Although previous studies of the movement of autophagic vesicles have identified roles for microtubule-based transport, this study moves the field forward by distinguishing between effects on pre- and post-fusion autophagosomes, and by its characterization of the roles of specific Dynein, Dynactin, and Rab complexes in regulating movement of distinct vesicle types. Overall, the experiments are well controlled, appropriately analyzed, and largely support the authors' conclusions..</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>One limitation of the study is the genetic background that serves as basis for the screen. In addition to preventing autophagosome-lysosome fusion, disruption of Vps16A has been shown to inhibit endosomal maturation and to block trafficking of components to the lysosome from both the endosome and Golgi apparatus. Additional effects previously reported by the authors include increased autophagosome production and reduced mTOR signaling. Thus Vps16A-depleted cells have a number of endosome, lysosome and autophagosome-related defects, with unknown downstream consequences. Additionally, the cause and significance of the perinuclear localization of autophagosomes in this background is unclear. Thus, interpretations of the observed reversal of this phenotype are difficult, and have the caveat that they may apply only to this condition, rather than to normal autophagosomes. Additional experiments to observe autophagosome movement or positioning in a more normal environment would improve the manuscript.</p><p>Comments on revision:</p><p>The revised manuscript and author responses have satisfactorily met my concerns. I have no further issues and congratulate the authors on this work.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.102663.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Summary:</p><p>In multicellular organisms, autophagosomes are formed throughout the cytosol, while late endosomes/lysosomes are relatively enriched in the perinuclear region. It is known that autophagosomes gain access to the lysosome-enriched region by microtubule-based trafficking. The mechanism by which autophagosomes move along microtubules remains incompletely understood. In this manuscript, Péter Lőrincz and colleagues investigated the mechanism driving the movement of nascent autophagosomes along microtubule towards non-centrosomal microtubule organizing center (ncMTOC) using fly fat body as a model system. The authors took an approach by examining autophagosome positioning in cells where autophagosome-lysosome fusion was inhibited by knocking down the HOPS subunit Vps16A. Despite being generated at random positions in the cytosol, autophagosomes accumulate around the nucleus when Vps16A is depleted. They then performed an RNA interference screen to identify the factors involved in autophagosome positioning. They found that the dynein-dynactin complex is required for trafficking of autophagosomes toward ncMTOC. Dynein loss leads to the peripheral relocation of autophagosomes. They further revealed that a pair of small GTPases and their effectors, Rab7-Epg5 and Rab39-ema, are required for bidirectional autophagosome transport.

However, the extent to which fusion is actually inhibited by knockdown of Vps16A is not shown. The co-localization rate of Atg8 and Lamp1 should be shown (as in Figure 8). Then, after identifying pre-fusion autophagosomes and lysosomes, the localization of each should be analyzed.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this insightful comment. We analyzed the colocalization of 3xmCherry-Atg8a and GFP-Lamp1, which label autophagic structures and lysosomes, respectively, in Vps16A RNAi fat body cells. As expected, Vps16A silencing markedly reduced the overlap between these two signals, indicating a strong block in autophagosome–lysosome fusion. Moreover, both 3xmCherry-Atg8a and GFP-Lamp1 became more perinuclearly localized compared to the control (luciferase RNAi) cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It is also possible that autophagosomes and lysosomes are tethered by factors other than HOPS (even if they are not fused). If this is the case, autophagosomal trafficking would be affected by the movement of lysosomes.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for raising this possibility. While we cannot fully exclude that autophagosomes might be indirectly transported via tethering to lysosomes, we consider this unlikely. We believe that in Drosophila fat cells, autophagosomes and lysosomes rapidly fuse once in close proximity. Therefore, even if alternative tethering mechanisms exist, they are unlikely to permit prolonged joint trafficking without fusion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The authors analyze autolysosomes in Figures 6 and 7. This is based on the assumption that autophagosome-lysosome fusion takes place in cells without vps16A RNAi. However, even in the presence of Vps16A, both pre-fusion autophagosomes and autolysosomes should exist. This is also true in Figure 8H, where the fusion of autophagosomes and lysosomes is partially suppressed in knockdown cells of dynein, dynactin, Rab7, and Epg5. If the effect of fusion is to be examined, it is reasonable to distinguish between autophagosomes and autolysosomes and analyze only autolysosomes.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this careful observation. The 3xmCherry-Atg8a reporter is well suited to identify both autophagosomes and autolysosomes, as the mCherry fluorophore is resistant to degradation in the acidic environment of autolysosomes. Notably, mCherry-Atg8a–positive autolysosomes appear larger and brighter than pre-fusion autophagosomes, which are typically smaller and dimmer, especially under fusion-deficient conditions (e.g., Figure 4). Therefore, we use these morphological differences as a proxy to distinguish between the two.</p><p>To improve structural assignment, we incorporated endogenous Lamp1 staining (Figure 10) and a Lamp1-GFP reporter (Figure 10—figure supplement 1). Vesicles positive for mCherryAtg8a but negative for Lamp1 are considered pre-fusion autophagosomes. Structures double-positive for mCherry-Atg8a and Lamp1 represent autolysosomes, while Lamp1positive, Atg8a-negative vesicles correspond to non-autophagic lysosomes. To clarify these interpretations, we revised the Results section and explained these reporters in more detail.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) In this study, only vps16a RNAi cells were used to inhibit autophagosome-lysosome fusion. However, since HOPS has many roles besides autophagosome-lysosome fusion, it would be better to confirm the conclusion by knockdown of other factors (e.g., Stx17 RNAi).</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this valuable suggestion. We initially considered using Syntaxin17 RNAi; however, our recent findings indicate that loss of Syx17 results in a HOPS-dependent tethering lock between autophagosomes and lysosomes (DOI: 10.1126/sciadv.adu9605). In this case, tethered vesicles would likely move together, confounding the interpretation of autophagosome-specific trafficking.</p><p>Therefore, we turned to other SNAREs such as Vamp7 and Snap29. One Snap29 RNAi was located on the appropriate chromosome needed for our genetic experiments. We generated a transgenic fly line expressing both Snap29 RNAi and the mCherry-Atg8a reporter under a fat body-specific R4 promoter. When we tested our key trafficking hits in this background, we observed similar autophagosome localization phenotypes as in Vps16A RNAi cells. These results, now included in the revised manuscript (see Figure 6), confirm that the observed transport phenotypes are not specific to Vps16A or HOPS complex loss.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Figure 8: Rab7 and Epg5 are also known to be directly involved in autophagosomelysosome tethering/fusion. Even if the fusion rate is reduced in the absence of Rab7 and Epg5, it may not be the result of defective autophagosome movement, but may simply indicate that these molecules are required for fusion itself. How do the authors distinguish between the two possibilities?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this important point. While Rab7 and Epg5 indeed participate in autophagosome–lysosome tethering and fusion, our data suggest they also contribute to autophagosome movement. This is evident from the distinct phenotypes observed upon Rab7 or Epg5 RNAi compared to Vps16A or SNARE RNAi. Depletion of Vps16A, Syx17, Vamp7, or Snap29 (factors involved specifically in fusion) results in perinuclear accumulation of autophagosomes. In contrast, Rab7 or Epg5 RNAi leads to a dispersed autophagosome pattern throughout the cytoplasm.</p><p>These differences suggest that Rab7 and Epg5 play additional roles in positioning autophagosomes. Supporting this, our co-immunoprecipitation experiments show that Epg5 interacts with dynein motors. Therefore, we propose that Rab7 and Epg5 influence both autophagosome fusion and their microtubule-based transport.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p><p>One limitation of the study is the genetic background that serves as the basis for the screening. In addition to preventing autophagosome-lysosome fusion, disruption of Vps16A has been shown to inhibit endosomal maturation and block the trafficking of components to the lysosome from both the endosome and Golgi apparatus. Additional effects previously reported by the authors include increased autophagosome production and reduced mTOR signaling. Thus Vps16A-depleted cells have a number of endosome, lysosome, and autophagosome-related defects, with unknown downstream consequences. Additionally, the cause and significance of the perinuclear localization of autophagosomes in this background is unclear. Thus, interpretations of the observed reversal of this phenotype are difficult, and have the caveat that they may apply only to this condition, rather than to normal autophagosomes. Additional experiments to observe autophagosome movement or positioning in a more normal environment would improve the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for highlighting this limitation. We have tried to conduct time-lapse imaging of live fat body cells expressing 3xmCherry-Atg8a and GFP-Lamp1 to visualize the movement and fusion events of pre-fusion autophagosomes (3xmCherry-Atg8a positive and GFP-Lamp1 negative) and lysosomes (GFP-Lamp1 positive). Despite different experimental setups and durations of starvation, no vesicle movement was observed at all, so live imaging of larval Drosophila fat tissue will require time-consuming optimizations of in vitro culture conditions. Consistent with this, we did not find any literature data where organelle motility in fat body cells was successfully observed. Nuclear positioning in fat body cells was investigated in detail in an excellent study, however the authors were able to observe only very little movement of the nuclei by live imaging (Zheng et al. Nat Cell Biol. 2020 Mar;22(3):297-309. doi: 10.1038/s41556-020-0470-7), further highlighting the technical difficulties of live or timelapse imaging in this tissue type.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Specific comments</p><p>(1) Several genes have been described that when depleted lead to perinuclear accumulation of Atg8-labeled vesicles. There seems to be a correlation of this phenotype with genes required for autophagosome-lysosome fusion; however, some genes required for lysosomal fusion such as Rab2 and Arl8 apparently did not affect autophagosome positioning as reported here. Thus, it is unclear whether the perinuclear positioning of autophagosomes is truly a general response to disruption of autophagosome-lysosome fusion, or may reflect additional aspects of Vps16A/HOPS function. A few things here would help. One would be an analysis of Atg8a vesicle localization in response to the depletion of a larger set of fusionrelated genes. Another would be to repeat some of the key findings of this study (effects of specific dynein, dynactin, rabs, effectors) on Atg8a localization when Syx17 is depleted, rather than Vps16A. This should generate a more autophagosome-specific fusion defect.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this insightful suggestion. We recently discovered that Syx17 depletion induces a HOPS-dependent tethering lock between autophagosomes and lysosomes (DOI: 10.1126/sciadv.adu9605), making it unsuitable for modeling autophagosome-specific fusion defects. In contrast, Vamp7 and Snap29 knockdowns do not appear to cause such tethering lock. We were able to generate a suitable Drosophila line using a Snap29 RNAi transgene located on a compatible chromosome. Upon testing key hits from our screen in this background, we found that autophagosomes redistributed similarly, supporting our conclusions. These new results have been included in the revised manuscript (see Figure 6)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Third, it would greatly strengthen the findings to monitor pre-fusion autophagosome localization without disrupting fusion. Such vesicles could be identified as Atg8a-positive Lamp-negative structures. The effects of dynein and rab depletion on the tracking of these structures in a post-induction time course would serve as an important validation of the authors' findings.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this helpful suggestion. As described above, we attempted time-lapse imaging of 3xmCherry-Atg8a and GFP-Lamp1-expressing fat body cells under various conditions to identify motile pre-fusion autophagosomes. However, we did not observe any vesicle movement, regardless of the starvation duration or experimental setup. As this likely reflects technical limitations of ex vivo fat body imaging, we were unable to achieve live tracking of autophagosome dynamics without introducing perturbations. This limitation is now discussed in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The authors nicely show that depletion of Shot leads to relocalization of Atg8a to ectopic foci in Vps16A-depleted cells; they should confirm that this is a mislocalized ncMTOC by colabeling Atg8a with an MTOC component such as MSP300. The effect of Shot depletion on Atg8a localization should also be analyzed in the absence of Vps16A depletion.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this positive comment. We co-labeled Atg8a with the minus-end microtubule marker Khc-nod-LacZ in both shot single knockdown and shot; vps16A double knockdown cells. Ectopic Khc-nod-LacZ-positive MTOC foci were clearly visible in both conditions, and Atg8a-positive autophagosomes accumulated around these structures. These findings confirm that Shot depletion induces ectopic MTOC formation, which correlates with autophagosome relocalization. The new data have been incorporated into the revised manuscript (see Figure 1O-S).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) The authors report that depletion of Dynein subunits, either alone (Figure 6) or codepleted with Vps16A (Figure 2), leads to redistribution of mCherry-Atg8a punctae to the &quot;cell periphery&quot;. However, only cell clones that contact an edge of the fat body tissue are shown in these figures. Furthermore, in these cells, mCherry-Atg8a punctae appear to localize only to contact-free regions of these cells, and not to internal regions of clones that share a border with adjacent cells. Thus, these vesicles would seem to be redistributed to the periphery of the fat body itself, not to the periphery of individual cells. Microtubules emanating from the perinuclear ncMTOC have been described as having a radial organization, and thus it is unclear that this redistribution of mCherry-Atg8a punctae to the fat body edge would reflect a kinesin-dependent process as suggested by the authors.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this detailed observation. We frequently observe autophagosomes accumulating in contact-free peripheral regions of dynein-depleted cells, resulting in an asymmetric distribution. While previous studies describe a radial microtubule organization in fat body cells, none of them directly label MT plus ends, the direction of kinesin-based transport.</p><p>To further explore this, we overexpressed a HA-tagged kinesin, Klp98A-3xHA, in both control and Vps16A RNAi backgrounds. Immunolabeling revealed that Klp98A localizes to the contact-free peripheral regions in both conditions, consistent with the distribution of autophagosomes in dynein knockdown cells. This supports our interpretation that kinesindependent transport drives autophagosome redistribution in the absence of dynein, and that fat body cells exhibit subtle asymmetries in MT polarity that influence this transport. These new results have been included in the revised manuscript (see Figure 3G, H).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) To validate whether the mCherry-Atg8a structures in Vps16A-depleted cells were of autophagic origin, the authors depleted Atg8a and observed a loss of mCherry- Atg8a signal from the mosaic cells (Figure S1D, J). A more rigorous experiment would be to deplete other Atg genes (not Atg8a) and examine whether these structures persist.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the suggestion to further validate our reporter. We depleted Atg1, a key kinase required for phagophore initiation, in the Vps16A RNAi background. This completely abolished the punctate mCherry-Atg8a distribution in knockdown cells (see Figure 1—figure supplement 1E, K), confirming that the labeled structures are indeed of autophagic origin.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) The authors found that only a subset of dynein, dynactin, rab, and rab effector depletions affected mCherry-Atg8a localization, leading to their suggestion that the most important factors involved in autophagosome motility have been identified here. However, this conclusion has the caveat that depletion efficiency was not examined in this study, and thus any conclusions about negative results should be more conservative.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this constructive feedback. We agree that negative results must be interpreted conservatively due to potential differences in knockdown efficiency. We have revised our conclusions accordingly, clarifying that the factors identified are key for autophagosome motility, while acknowledging the possibility of false negatives.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Major concerns:</p><p>(1) The localization of EPG5 should be determined. The authors showed that EPG5 colocalizes with endogenous Rab7. Rab7 labels late endosomes and lysosomes. Previous studies in mammalian cells have shown that EPG5 is targeted to late endosomes/lysosomes by interacting with Rab7. EPG5 promotes the fusion of autophagosomes with late endosomes/lysosomes by directly recognizing LC3 on autophagosomes and also by facilitating the assembly of the SNARE complex for fusion. In Figure 5I, the EPG5/Rab7colocalized vesicles are large and they are likely to be lysosomes/autolysosomes.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for suggesting to improve our Epg5 localization data. We performed triple immunostaining for Atg8a, Lamp1-3xmCherry, and Epg5-9xHA in S2R+ cells. In addition to triple-positive structures—likely representing autolysosomes—we observed Atg8a and Epg59xHA double-positive vesicles that lacked Lamp1-3xmCherry signal, which likely correspond to pre-fusion autophagosomes. Based on these results, we propose that in addition to arriving via the endocytic route, Epg5 may also reach lysosomes through autophagosomes. These findings have been included in the revised manuscript (see Figure 5K).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The experiments were performed in Vps16A RNAi KD cells. Vps16A knockdown blocks fusion of vesicles derived from the endolysosomal compartments such as fusion between lysosomes. The pleiotropic effect of Vps16A RNAi may complicate the interpretation. The authors need to verify their findings in Stx17 KO cells, as it has a relatively specific effect on the fusion of autophagosomes with late endosomes/lysosomes.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this valuable suggestion. We initially considered Syntaxin17 for validation; however, we recently found that loss of Syx17 leads to a HOPS-dependent tethering lock between autophagosomes and lysosomes, which would confound interpretation, as autophagosomes remain tethered to lysosomes (DOI: 10.1126/sciadv.adu9605). Therefore, Syntaxin17 loss is not suitable for our purpose. Among the remaining fusion SNAREs, one RNAi line targeting Snap29 was available on a compatible chromosome for generating Drosophila lines equivalent to those used in the screen. We established this Snap29 RNAicontaining tester line and crossed it with our top hits. We observed that autophagosome motility was comparable to that in the Vps16A RNAi background, further supporting our conclusions. These results have been incorporated into the revised manuscript (see Figure 6)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Quantification should be performed in many places such as in Figure S4D for the number of FYVE-GFP labeled endosomes and in Figures S4H and S4I for the number and size of lysosomes.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing this out. We performed the suggested quantifications and statistical analyses for FYVE-GFP labeled endosomes, as well as for the number and size of lysosomes. The updated data are now presented in the revised Figure 5—figure supplement 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) In this study, the transport of autophagosomes is investigated in fly fat cells. In fat cells, a large number of large lipid droplets accumulate and the endomembrane systems are distinct from that in other cell types. The knowledge gained from this study may not apply to other cell types. This needs to be discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for raising this important point. We agree that our findings may not be fully generalizable to all cell types. Given that the organization of the microtubule network depends on both cell function and developmental stage, it is plausible that the molecular machinery described here operates differently elsewhere. We now mention this limitation in the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor concerns:</p><p>(5) Data in some panels are of low quality. For example, the mCherry-Atg8a signal in Figure 5C is hard to see; the input bands of Dhc64c in Figure 5L are smeared.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing this out. We repeated the experiment shown in Figure 5C and replaced the panel with a clearer image. The smeared Dhc64C input bands in Figure 5L result from the unusually large size of this protein, which affects its electrophoretic migration. We mentioned this point in the corresponding figure legend.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) In this study, both 3xmCherry-Atg8a and mCherry-Atg8a were used. Different reporters make it difficult to compare the results presented in different figures.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this comment. Both 3xmCherry-Atg8a and mCherry-Atg8a are well-established reporters that behave similarly as autophagic markers. Nevertheless, to avoid confusion, we ensured that each figure uses only one type of reporter consistently, which is now clearly indicated in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) The small autophagosomes presented in Figures such as in Figure 1D and 1E are not clear. Enlarged images should be presented.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your suggestion. We repeated these experiments and replaced the relevant panels with higher-quality images, including enlarged insets to better visualize small autophagosomes. These updated figures are now included in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(8) The authors showed that Epg5-9xHA coprecipitates with the endogenous dynein motor Dhc64C. Is Rab7 required for the interaction?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this insightful question. We tested this by co-transfecting S2R+ cells with Epg5-9xHA and different forms of Rab7: wild-type, GTP-locked (constitutively active), and GDP-locked (dominant-negative). Our results indicate that the strength of Epg5-Dhc interaction does not change in the presence of either GTP-locked or GDP-locked Rab7. However, we believe that Epg5 and dynein are recruited to the vesicle membranes via Rab7 in vivo, so we did not include these results in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(9) The perinuclear lysosome localization in Epg5 KD cells has no indication that Epg5 is an autophagosome-specific adaptor.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this important comment. Accordingly, we have toned down our statements about Epg5 functions throughout the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>(1) Figure 6: What do &quot;autolysosome maturation&quot; and &quot;small autolysosomes&quot; mean? Do different numbers of lysosomes fuse to a single autophagosome?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for highlighting this point. We concluded that the formation of smaller autolysosomes—compared to controls—is likely due to a defect in autolysosome maturation, as is often the case. We had not explicitly considered whether a different number of lysosomes fuse with each autophagosome during this process. We clarified this issue in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Figure 5A shows that the localization of endogenous Atg8 requires Epg5, but the data is not as clear as for mCherry-Atg8 (Figure 4B). Why the difference?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this question. The difference arises because the mCherry-Atg8a reporter strongly labels autolysosomes, as the mCherry fluorophore remains stable in acidic compartments. As a result, mCherry-Atg8a labels both autophagosomes and autolysosomes, but the strong autolysosomal signal originating from the surrounding GFP negative, nonRNAi cells can make accumulated autophagosomes appear fainter in fusion-defective cells (as in Figure 4). In contrast, endogenous Atg8a is degraded in lysosomes, and therefore labels only autophagosomes. This means that the appearance of these two experiments can be slightly different, but since in both cases autophagosomes no longer accumulate in the perinuclear region of Vps16A,Epg5 double RNAi cells we can conclude that Epg5 is required for autophagosome positioning. We explained this difference of the two methods in the revised manuscript where it first appears (Figure 1B and Figure 1—figure supplement 1A).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Blue letters on the black micrographs are hard to see. Some of the other letters are also small and hard to read.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this suggestion.
