causal variants likely have gene regulatory effects. However, only a small number of loci have been linked to expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) detected currently. To better understand the potential reasons for many trait-associated loci lacking eQTL colocalization, we investigated whether chromatin accessibility QTLs (caQTLs) in lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) explain immune-mediated disease associations that eQTLs in LCLs did not. The power to detect caQTLs was greater than that of eQTLs and was less affected by the distance from the transcription start site of the associated gene. Meta-analyzing LCL eQTL data to increase the sample size to over a thousand led to additional loci with eQTL colocalization, demonstrating that insufficient statistical power is still likely to be a factor. Moreover, further eQTL colocalization loci were uncovered by surveying eQTLs of other immune cell types. Altogether, insufficient power and context specificity of eQTLs both contribute to the ‘missing regulation’.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>chromatin accessibility</kwd><kwd>eQTL</kwd><kwd>caQTL</kwd><kwd>immune-mediated diseases</kwd><kwd>lymphoblastoid cell lines</kwd><kwd>missing regulation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/00baak391</institution-id><institution>National Human Genome Research Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 HG010501</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bulyk</surname><given-names>Martha L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Analyzing population-level chromatin accessibility data shows added benefit over utilizing only gene expression data in elucidating the genetic mechanism of disease-associated variants.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>More than a decade of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) has revealed several properties of the genetic architecture of complex traits and diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Visscher et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Claussnitzer et al., 2020</xref>). Most (~93%) of the genetic associations are detected in the noncoding portion of the genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Maurano et al., 2012</xref>), and disease heritability is concentrated in putative regulatory regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Gusev et al., 2014</xref>). Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs), which are loci associated with gene expression levels, are enriched for trait associations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Nicolae et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hormozdiari et al., 2018</xref>). Complex traits are also characterized by their extreme polygenicity, where individual genetic association has only a small effect on the trait (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">O’Connor et al., 2019</xref>). Altogether, these observations have led to a prevalent theory that causal genetic variants affect regulation of key genes across the genome, where each gene explains a modest proportion of trait variation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Boyle et al., 2017</xref>). There are experimental strategies aimed at nominating putative causal genes at noncoding GWAS loci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Nasser et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Weeks et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Morris et al., 2023</xref>). As an alternate approach, an eQTL signal colocalizing with the GWAS signal illustrates the effect of the causal variant on gene expression and suggests that the affected gene contributes to the trait. Detection of disease-associated eQTLs thus can identify putative disease genes, helping to elucidate disease mechanisms and develop therapeutics targeting them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Plenge et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p> Although it has become expected that eQTLs will be discovered in most noncoding GWAS loci, only a minority of trait-associated loci have been explained by eQTLs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chun et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Barbeira et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Connally et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Yao et al., 2020</xref>). The Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) eQTL study across 49 human tissues recognized that, for a typical complex trait, about 20% of GWAS loci contained a colocalized eQTL in the <italic>cis</italic> region (i.e. 1 Mb) around the gene (<italic>i.e</italic>. <italic>cis</italic>-eQTL) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Barbeira et al., 2021</xref>). Even when focusing just on putatively causal genes, the rate of colocalization was very low (8%) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Connally et al., 2022</xref>). Furthermore, the proportion of trait heritability mediated by <italic>cis</italic>-eQTLs (<italic>h</italic><sup>2</sup><sub>med</sub>/<italic>h</italic><sup>2</sup><sub>SNP</sub>) of assayed gene expression was estimated to be only about 11% on average (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Yao et al., 2020</xref>). We will call the missing link between genetic association to traits and regulatory function of the associated noncoding variants as ‘missing regulation’, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Connally et al., 2022</xref>, introduced. To be able to detect eQTLs in the unexplained disease-associated loci, a better understanding of the possible reasons for why they have been missing is essential.</p><p>There are many possible explanations for why disease-associated loci are missing colocalized eQTLs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Connally et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Umans et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Mostafavi et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Hukku et al., 2021</xref>) and for why <italic>h</italic><sup>2</sup><sub>med</sub>/<italic>h</italic><sup>2</sup><sub>SNP</sub> estimates for eQTLs are relatively low (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Yao et al., 2020</xref>). First, statistical power to detect disease-associated eQTLs may be insufficient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Hukku et al., 2021</xref>). For example, negative selection against gene expression variation may lead to challenges in detecting eQTLs for trait-relevant genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Mostafavi et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Glassberg et al., 2019</xref>). Since disease genes are likely to be dosage sensitive, there would be selection against their having large eQTL effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Glassberg et al., 2019</xref>). Consequently, the negative selection induces a ‘flattening’ effect, in which weak eQTL variants, often in regions distal to the gene’s promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Dimas et al., 2009</xref>), may reach high enough frequency, whereas strong eQTL variants remain at low frequency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">O’Connor et al., 2019</xref>). In fact, eQTL-mediated heritability was enriched in genes showing mutational constraint and those with lower <italic>cis</italic>-heritability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Yao et al., 2020</xref>). These weaker or low-allele-frequency eQTL effects would require larger sample sizes to be detected with statistical significance and to show colocalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Hukku et al., 2021</xref>). Second, causal eQTL effects may be specific to cell types that have not been assayed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Umans et al., 2021</xref>). For example, immune cell eQTLs are highly cell-type specific, and eQTL effects specific to some immune cell types may mediate immune disease risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Schmiedel et al., 2018</xref>). Specificity of eQTL effects can also be limited to specific cell states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alasoo et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Nathan et al., 2022</xref>). Detecting cell-type or cell-state-specific eQTL effects requires the necessary gene expression datasets from the relevant cell types and states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Umans et al., 2021</xref>), which has been a limiting resource for such analyses.</p><p>To investigate why disease-associated eQTL signals have been missing, we focused on immune-mediated diseases (IMDs) as a model set of complex traits. We aimed to collect IMD-associated loci that are expected to show eQTL signals in some cell type. Since active regulatory elements coordinate target gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Field and Adelman, 2020</xref>), we reasoned that variants that affect chromatin phenotypes at regulatory elements, such as transcription factor (TF) binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kasowski et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kilpinen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Waszak et al., 2015</xref>) and chromatin accessibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Degner et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Kumasaka et al., 2019</xref>), have the potential to impact gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Albert and Kruglyak, 2015</xref>). These chromatin phenotypes may show detectable genetic effects even when an eQTL effect in the same cell type was not identified in the locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Wu et al., 2023</xref>). For example, only about 20% of lymphoblastoid cell lines’ (LCLs’) PU.1 binding QTLs (bQTLs) that colocalized with blood cell traits’ association showed an eQTL effect for a nearby gene in LCLs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Jeong and Bulyk, 2023</xref>).</p><p>Here, we analyzed genetic and functional genomic (i.e. ATAC-seq and RNA-seq) data in LCLs. LCLs are derived from B lymphocytes, and their <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements were enriched for variants associated with some IMDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Kundaje et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Farh et al., 2015</xref>). We evaluated whether chromatin accessibility QTLs (caQTLs) in LCLs potentially explain IMD associations using mediated heritability analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Yao et al., 2020</xref>) and colocalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Giambartolomei et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Pickrell et al., 2016</xref>). Then, we searched for disease-associated loci that were significant caQTLs, but not eQTLs.</p><p>We examined whether the various potential reasons for missing eQTLs can account for IMD-associated loci that are explained by caQTLs but not eQTLs. First, we explored the extent to which eQTLs may have been missed because of limited statistical power. We compared <italic>cis</italic>-heritability of colocalized caQTLs and eQTLs stratified by distance between the accessible region and the transcription start site (TSS) of the associated gene. We also investigated whether meta-analysis of published LCL eQTL summary statistics, in order to effectively increase the sample size, can uncover previously missed eQTLs. Second, we surveyed whether cell-type specificity of regulatory variant effect may account for the missing regulation. We surveyed various immune cell eQTL data to identify loci with which they colocalize even if LCL eQTLs did not colocalize with those loci.</p><p>Through this study, we present how regulatory QTLs beyond eQTLs, such as caQTLs, can be effective in detecting the potential molecular consequences of disease-associated variants. Moreover, results from inspecting disease-associated loci where genetic effects are detected on chromatin accessibility but not on expression suggest reasons why the effects on gene expression may have been missed. These results provide insights on which strategies may be effective in uncovering more genes that underlie diseases.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Accessible chromatin in LCLs explains a significant proportion of immune-mediated disease heritability</title><p>We aimed to evaluate whether variants that alter chromatin accessibility in LCLs may explain genetic associations to IMD.

First, LCL caQTLs may correspond to gene regulatory elements that exert their effects on gene expression in a different cellular context. For instance, monocyte H3K27ac levels in the ‘caQTL-only’ loci where monocyte eQTLs colocalized were higher than those with no monocyte eQTLs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Second, some examples, such as for <italic>TNFSF15</italic>, were due to cell-type-specific gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>): despite a significant colocalization of IBD with a caQTL in LCLs in the <italic>TNFSF15</italic> locus, disease-associated eQTL signal was detected only in monocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>).

There have been various hypotheses presented from disease genes showing more complex gene regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Wang and Goldstein, 2020</xref>), context specificity of gene regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Umans et al., 2021</xref>), and a combination of both, due to selective constraints against damaging eQTLs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Mostafavi et al., 2023</xref>). A better evaluation of the potential reasons for the missing regulation will guide future data generation projects to elucidate disease-associated loci. To determine why some loci might lack colocalized eQTLs, we focused on chromatin accessibility, which is a molecular phenotype affected by regulatory variants more directly than are eQTLs. We approached this question with mediated heritability analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Yao et al., 2020</xref>) and colocalization analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Giambartolomei et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Pickrell et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>We found that caQTLs in LCLs mediate a significant proportion of heritability for many autoimmune diseases. In contrast, LCLs did not appear to be an effective cell type to model gene regulatory effects in allergic diseases. The <italic>h<sup>2</sup></italic><sub>med</sub>/<italic>h<sup>2</sup></italic><sub>SNP</sub> estimates for caQTLs were higher than those of eQTLs in most autoimmune diseases, even though the smaller sample size of caQTL data (i.e. 100 vs 373) could bias caQTLs’ estimates toward zero (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Yao et al., 2020</xref>). We also showed that disease-associated chromatin accessibility effects often share the genetic signal with gene expression effects but that there are also many loci without an eQTL detected in LCLs.</p><p>By focusing on disease-associated caQTL that lacked significant eQTLs, we explored how additional colocalized eQTL effects could be uncovered. First, increasing the sample sizes for the eQTL statistics via meta-analysis demonstrated that more eQTL colocalizations can be detected with increased statistical power and robustness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Hukku et al., 2021</xref>). These results are consistent with the hypothesis that disease-associated eQTLs are typically weaker and distal due to negative selection against large expression changes for causal genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Mostafavi et al., 2023</xref>). Second, many caQTLs in LCLs without eQTLs in LCLs showed eQTL colocalization in other immune cell types. Context specificity of eQTLs has been widely considered to be the primary explanation for the difficulty of pinpointing disease-associated eQTLs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Umans et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Schmiedel et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alasoo et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Soskic et al., 2022</xref>). Our observation that many IMD-colocalized caQTLs in LCLs show eQTLs in other immune cell types suggests that caQTL effects may be shared across cell types, whereas eQTL effects are more context-specific (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alasoo et al., 2018</xref>). If a shared set of transcription factors is expressed in similar yet distinct cell types, like the immune cells, genetic variants affecting their DNA binding would affect chromatin accessibility similarly. On the other hand, regulation of gene expression is a result of multiple regulatory elements, each binding multiple transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kim and Wysocka, 2023</xref>), so the measured effect of a regulatory variant on gene expression likely depends much more on the cellular context. In such cases, eQTL data for the specific cellular contexts need to be generated in future studies to uncover genetic signal shared with a complex trait or disease. All in all, our results suggest that both increasing the sample size and generating gene expression data from more relevant cellular contexts would be useful strategies for discovering more disease-associated eQTLs.</p><p>Finally, we demonstrated that caQTLs can reveal the regulatory variant effect of disease-associated variants that may have been difficult to detect with eQTLs, particularly in TSS-distal regions. Although caQTLs cannot directly identify the target gene or the causal cellular context, we anticipate that integrated analyses can improve the power to detect weaker eQTL signals, as multi-trait GWAS analyses have shown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Turley et al., 2018</xref>). Moreover, integrating multiple molecular QTL data, like transcription factor bQTLs and histone mark QTLs, may highlight the regulatory elements associated with the GWAS phenotype, which may ultimately contribute to identifying the causal gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Jeong and Bulyk, 2023</xref>). Therefore, we anticipate the generation of data across the various molecular phenotypes upstream of gene expression for QTL analyses will be informative.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Limitations of the study</title><p>The <italic>h<sup>2</sup></italic><sub>med</sub>/<italic>h<sup>2</sup></italic><sub>SNP</sub> estimates can be biased because of insufficient sample size of the QTL data. Thus, the proportion of mediated IMD heritability could change based on the specific caQTL and eQTL data. Colocalization analysis tests whether the QTL and GWAS data likely share genetic signal, and such shared signal could arise from either causal mediation or pleiotropy. Therefore, further experiments are needed to establish causality of colocalized eQTL genes. Lastly, we hypothesized that caQTL effects are often shared across cell types, but we did not have access to relevant data to test this hypothesis.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>ATAC-seq data processing and peak calling</title><p>We downloaded LCL ATAC-seq data of British (GBR) samples (n=100) from European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) under accession ERP110508 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Kumasaka et al., 2019</xref>).

For each sample, the read counts were normalized for library size using trimmed mean of M-values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Robinson and Oshlack, 2010</xref>) so that the values are comparable across the samples. Then, the phenotype values were further normalized to follow a standard normal distribution across the samples, using quantile normalization. Peaks with counts per million (CPM)&lt;0.8 or counts &lt;10 for more than 20% of the samples were discarded.</p><p> Next, we performed a principal component analysis (PCA) on the phenotype matrix to derive potential latent covariates. We selected the number of principal components (PCs) to incorporate in the regression model based on the Buja and Eyuboglu algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Buja and Eyuboglu, 1992</xref>) that is implemented in PCAForQTL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Zhou et al., 2022</xref>). Ultimately, we accounted for sex, library size, 3 genotype PCs, and 13 phenotype PCs in the QTL analysis. We performed genetic association tests on variants within 200 kilobases (kb) of the peak using tensorQTL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Taylor-Weiner et al., 2019</xref>).

We used the baselineLD v2.2 annotation in hg38 and the European LD reference from the 1000 Genomes Project (downloaded from the S-LDSC website, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://alkesgroup.broadinstitute.org/LDSCORE/GRCh38/">https://alkesgroup.broadinstitute.org/LDSCORE/GRCh38/</ext-link>).

We analyzed the same set of peaks and accounted for the same covariates as we did for the QTL analysis above. For mediated heritability estimation, we accounted for baseline LD v2.2 annotation in hg38 without the QTL annotations, as they could be redundant. The estimand of interest is the proportion of heritability mediated by caQTLs (<italic>h</italic><sup>2</sup><sub>med</sub>/<italic>h</italic><sup>2</sup><sub>SNP</sub>).</p><p> To evaluate whether certain peak sets are enriched for mediated heritability, we utilized the gene set analysis functionality. For peak strength, we considered the 95% percentile CPM value of each peak and stratified the peaks into quintiles. For histone marks, we first generated histone ChIP-seq peaks using data from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Delaneau et al., 2019</xref>. Similar to calling ATAC-seq peaks, we sampled 3 million reads per sample and merged them before applying MACS2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>). We downloaded three control ChIP-seq data from ENCODE to use as input (File IDs: ENCFF066RCS, ENCFF159XTB, and ENCFF850RIE) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Dunham, 2012</xref>). Then, we curated sets of ATAC-seq peaks that overlapped H3K27ac, H3K4me1, and H3K4me3 ChIP-seq peaks by at least 1 bp. ATAC-seq peaks that overlapped H3K27ac but not H3K4me3 regions were labeled as ‘enhancer-like signature’, while those that overlapped H3K27ac and H3K4me3 regions were labeled as ‘promoter-like signature’. The estimand of interest is the proportion of mediated heritability explained by the peak set (peak set <italic>h</italic><sup>2</sup><sub>med</sub>/total <italic>h</italic><sup>2</sup><sub>med</sub>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7-2"><title>Comparison with eQTL-mediated heritability</title><p>First, we estimated <italic>h</italic><sup>2</sup><sub>med</sub>/<italic>h</italic><sup>2</sup><sub>SNP</sub> of eQTLs (i.e. <italic>h</italic><sup>2</sup><sub>med; eQTL</sub>/<italic>h</italic><sup>2</sup><sub>SNP</sub>) the same way as we did for that of caQTLs.

This meta-analyzed estimate is effectively the amount of heritability mediated by either caQTLs or eQTLs in LCLs. This estimate reveals the overall relationship between heritability mediated by caQTLs and eQTLs.

The foreground list comprised all of the genes whose eQTL signal colocalized with one of the seven autoimmune diseases (CD, IBD, MS, PBC, RA, SLE, and UC). The background list of genes was all of the genes within 500 kb of each IMD lead variant for which we observed colocalization. Moreover, we tested whether colocalized caQTLs without eQTLs are closer to genes related to immune processes than expected by chance. For this, we used Genomic Regions Enrichment of Annotations Tool (GREAT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">McLean et al., 2010</xref>).

As Reviewer #1 noted, whether our and others' observation extends to other diseases or traits is an open question. For instance, Figure 2b in Mostafavi et al., Nat. Genet. (2023) demonstrated that there was a spectrum of depletion of eQTLs and enrichment of GWAS signals in constrained genes across various tissues and traits, respectively. Therefore, gene expression constraint may play a larger or smaller role in different diseases or traits. That immune cell types and cell states are extremely diverse (Schmiedel et al., Cell (2018) and Calderon et al., Nat. Genet.

We analyzed those data to identify open chromatin regions (i.e., ATACseq peaks) in LCLs and merged the regions with open chromatin regions identified with 100 GBR LCL samples from two studies by Kumasaka et al. Nature Genetics (2016)</p><p>PMID: 26656845 and Nature Genetics (2019) PMID: 30478436. However, we restricted the caQTL analysis to only the 100 GBR samples because of possible ancestry effects and batch effects. We attempted caQTL analysis with the 20 YRI samples as well, but the result was noisy, likely due to smaller sample size and lower read depth of the ATAC-seq data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>caQTL is described as having better power than eQTL despite having fewer samples. How does the number of ATAC peaks used in caQTL compare to the number of gene expressions used in eQTL?</p></disp-quote><p>The number of ATAC peaks used in caQTL (99,320) is ~6.7 times greater than the number of genes (14,872) used in the eQTL analysis. Therefore, there is a higher chance of detecting a significant caQTL signal and a significant colocalization signal than there is for eQTLs. However, we reasoned that since distal eQTLs are more easily detected as caQTLs and since increasing the sample size of eQTLs through meta-analysis uncovered additional eQTL colocalization at loci with caQTL colocalization only, colocalized caQTLs are likely capturing disease-relevant regulatory effects.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Details about RNA expression data: In the method section, it states that raw data (ERP001942) was accessed, and in data availability, processed data (E-GEUV-1) was used. These need to be consistent.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing this out. We used the processed data from Expression Atlas (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/experiments/E-GEUV-1/Results">https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/experiments/E-GEUV-1/Results</ext-link>), and that's what we meant by &quot;We downloaded RNA expression level data of the LCL samples from the Expression Atlas.&quot; We have revised the “RNA expression data preparation” section in our manuscript to make the text clearer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>How many samples were used (the text states 373, but how was it reduced from the original 465, and the total genotype is said to be 493 samples while ATAC has n=100; what are the 20 others?), and it mentions European samples, but does this exclude YRI?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out these points of confusion. Our reported count of 493 samples included YRI samples with RNA-seq data or ATAC-seq data that we ultimately did not use for QTL analyses. There were 373 European samples with RNA-seq data that we used for eQTL analysis, and 100 GBR samples (including some that overlap with the 373 European samples) that we used for caQTL analysis. We have revised the text to clarify these points.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Experimental results determining which TFs might bind to the representative signals of caQTL are required.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that caQTL colocalization is just the start of elucidating the regulatory mechanism of a GWAS locus. Determining which TFs are bound and which TFs' binding is altered would be necessary to describe the causal regulatory mechanism. For this, we utilized the Cistrome database to search for TFs whose binding overlaps the colocalized caQTL peaks. We present the results of this analysis in Supplementary Table 3 and Supplementary Figure 4, both of which we have added in our revised manuscript. Overall, protein factors associated with active transcription, such as POL2RA, and several immune cell TFs, including RUNX3, SPI1, and RELA, were frequently detected in those peaks. Detecting these factors in most peaks supports the likelihood that the colocalized caQTL peaks are active cis-regulatory elements. These results are consistent with our observation of enriched caQTL-mediated heritability in regions with active histone marks (Figure 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) It is stated that caQTL is less tissue-specific compared to eQTL; would caQTL performed with ATAC-seq results from different cell types, yield similar results?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the question. Calderon et al. (PMID: 31570894) observed that &quot;most effects on allelic imbalance (of ATAC-seq) were shared regardless of lineage or condition&quot;. Yet, there were regions where a different cell type or state would show inaccessibility (Figure 4d in Calderon et al.). Thus, we expect that ATAC-seq results from different cell types (e.g., T cells, B cells, monocytes, etc.) would lead to additional caQTLs showing colocalization at cell-typespecific open chromatin. However, if a region is accessible in both cell types, caQTL may be detected in both. Moreover, Alasoo et al., Nature Genetics (2018) (PMID: 29379200) observed that “many disease-risk variants affect chromatin structure in a broad range of cellular states, but their effects on expression are highly context specific.” In both studies, the authors investigated immune cell types, and there could be different observations in non-immune cell types and other diseases and traits.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>I think it would strengthen the paper to explore gene-level differences in the discovery of caQTLs and eQTLs. For example, complex disease-relevant genes, on average, have more/longer regulatory domains (as shown by Wang and Goldstein, AJHG 2020; Mostafavi et al., Nat. Genet. 2023). Therefore, it is plausible that for such genes, caQTLs are much more easily discoverable than eQTLs due to (i) a larger mutational target size for caQTLs, and (ii) dispersion of expression heritability across multiple domains, which hampers the discovery of eQTLs but not caQTLs, which are studied independently of other domains in the region. In other words, discovered caQTLs and eQTLs likely vary in terms of their distance to genes (as the authors report), as well as their target genes.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestion to explore gene-level differences. We expect that the effects of complex disease-relevant genes having more / longer regulatory domains, on average, to explain our observations. We agree on both of your points that there are many more regulatory elements that are captured as accessible regions than expressed genes and that genes often have multiple independent eQTLs leading to dispersion of heritability. The genelevel trend that we described was the distance of the regulatory element from the genes. Additional analyses would be a relevant future direction.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also considering gene-level analysis, Mostafavi et al. show that the types of biases they report for eQTLs also apply to other molecular QTLs. It would be valuable to compare GWAS hits with versus without caQTL colocalization. Similarly, it would be insightful to compare GWAS hits with both colocalized caQTLs and eQTLs to GWAS hits with colocalized caQTLs but no eQTLs in any of the cell types.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the comment. Investigating for potential biases in the colocalized caQTL would be useful, but we considered it beyond the scope of this work. In terms of biological factors, we demonstrated through mediated heritability analyses that more accessible chromatin (based on ATAC-seq read coverage) and regions with active histone marks were enriched for autoimmune disease associations (Figure 1). Furthermore, as greater distance of the regulatory variant from the transcription start site significantly reduced the cis-heritability, we would expect that distance would play a major role, similar to Mostafavi et al.’s conclusions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I don't think the argument for the role of natural selection contributing to the &quot;missing regulation&quot; is presented accurately. Specifically, large eQTLs acting on top trait-relevant genes are under stronger selection and thus, on average, segregate at lower frequencies. This makes them difficult to discover in eQTL assays. However, if not lost, they contribute as much, if not more, to trait heritability than weaker eQTLs at the same gene because their larger effects compensate for their lower frequency. At the most extreme, selection should have a &quot;flattening&quot; effect (e.g., see Simons et al., PLOS Biol 2018; O'Connor et al., AJHG 2019): weak and strong eQTLs at the same gene are expected to contribute equally to heritability. Therefore, the statement &quot;Consequently, only weak eQTL variants, often in regions distal to the gene's promoter, may remain and affect traits&quot; is not correct. If this turns out to be empirically true, other models, such as pleiotropic selection, need to explain it.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the correction. We agree with the comment and have revised the sentences in the introduction accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It is worth speculating why caQTLs may be more consistent across cell types than cis-eQTLs. Additionally, readers may infer from the paper that the focus should shift from eQTLs to caQTLs, which may not be the authors' intention. Perhaps these approaches are complementary: caQTLs can help with TSS-distal disease variants, while finding the target gene and regulatory context is more straightforward with eQTL colocalization. Addressing these points in the discussion will be helpful.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer's suggestion to clarify the advantages of incorporating cis-eQTLs and caQTLs. Our argument is exactly as you put it, and we added a paragraph on this in the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I believe the authors could do more to contextualize their findings within the existing literature on the subject, particularly Umans et al., Trends in Genetics 2021; Connally et al., eLife 2022; and Mostafavi et al., Nat. Genet. 2023. For instance, Umans et al. suggest that &quot;if most standard eQTLs are generally benign, increasing sample size and adding more tissue types in an effort to identify even more standard eQTLs may not help us to explain many more disease risk mutations&quot;. Conversely, Mostafavi et al. argue for a multipronged approach, which appears more aligned with the authors' conclusions.</p></disp-quote><p>We followed the reviewer’s suggestion to place our work in the context of existing literature on this topic.
