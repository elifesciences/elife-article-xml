Our lineage mapping revealed that neurons born late in the embryonic phase show axonal morphology and transcription factor profiles that are similar to the neurons born post-embryonically from the same neuroblast. Moreover, we identified three thorax-specific neuroblasts not previously characterized and show that HOX genes confine them to the thoracic segments.

These two life stages look and behave differently and appear to have strikingly different nervous systems. The relationship between the two nervous systems has been most extensively studied in the ventral nerve cord (which is the equivalent to the spinal cord in humans). Although the ventral nerve cords of a larva and an adult fly look quite different, they are generated by the same set of stem cells known as neuroblasts. This is made possible because the neuroblasts proliferate in two separate phases: the first phase occurs in the embryo to generate the neurons of the larval nervous system, and the second phase occurs in the larva to generate neurons for the adult’s nervous system.</p><p>Now, Lacin and Truman have paired each of the neurons in the adult fruit fly’s nerve cord with their corresponding neurons in the nerve cords of fruit fly larvae. This involved identifying the original neuroblasts that gave rise to each of the neurons in both larval and adult fruit flies. The results suggest that most neurons that arise from a given neuroblast produce a similar set of molecules and extend similar nerve fibers, even though they work in two different nervous systems. Since neuroblasts in non-metamorphosing insects proliferate continuously, these findings also suggest that, when metamorphosis evolved, a pause was introduced to create the two separate phases of proliferation without a big effect on the types of neurons generated.</p><p>Lacin and Truman then went on to discover three neuroblasts that appear to be unique to the middle (or thoracic) segments of a fruit fly. The experiments reveal that the presence of these neuroblasts depended on specific genes that control the development of animal body plans. Two of these neuroblasts generate the so-called motor neurons that control the movement of a fly’s legs. Flies only have legs on their thoracic segments, so this indicates that the development of new neurons is coordinated with the development of the body plan at the stem cell level. The third neuroblast generates neurons that connect with the leg motor neurons, and Lacin and Truman propose that this neuroblast arose from a copy of a neighboring stem cell. The resulting extra neurons may have enabled finer control over the leg movements required for activities such as walking and grooming.</p><p>Following on from this work, it is now possible to investigate how molecular events that occur from the embryonic to the adult stages of a fruit fly’s life control the formation and function of its nervous system.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.13399.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.13399.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>neuroblast</kwd><kwd>neuronal lineages</kwd><kwd>neuronal development</kwd><kwd>HOX genes</kwd><kwd>transcription factors</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>&lt;i&gt;D. melanogaster&lt;/i&gt;</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Truman</surname><given-names>James W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Mapping individual neural stem cells to their corresponding embryonic and postembryonic progeny shows that these sets of neurons have profound molecular and anatomical similarities despite building different central nervous systems.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The embryonic ventral nerve cord (VNC) of <italic>Drosophila</italic> has been used as a model system for over three decades to understand how a small number of neuronal stem cells, called neuroblasts (NBs), generate a highly complex but organized tissue in which almost all cells adopt unique fates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Jimenez and Campos-Ortega, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cabrera et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Doe, CQ 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Skeath and Carroll, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bossing et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Schmidt et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Rickert et al., 2011</xref>). Patterning of the neural ectoderm is the first step in promoting neuronal diversity. The orthogonal interaction of segment-polarity genes [e.g., <italic>runt (run), wingless (wg)</italic> and <italic>gooseberry (gsb)</italic>] and columnar genes [e.g., <italic>ventral nervous system defective (vnd), intermediate neuroblasts defective</italic> (<italic>ind</italic>), and <italic>muscle specific homeobox</italic> (<italic>msh;</italic> also referred to as Drop)] divides the neuroectoderm into a Cartesian grid system, in which each NB acquires a unique identity based on its position within the grid (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Skeath, 1999</xref>). About 30 distinct NBs form in a segmentally repeated bilateral pattern through most of the VNC segments, although the number of NBs is reduced in the anterior gnathal and terminal abdominal segments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bossing et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Schmidt et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Technau et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Birkholz et al., 2013</xref>). Each NB undergoes multiple rounds of asymmetric cell division. During each division it renews itself and generates a secondary precursor cell, called a ganglion mother cell (GMC), which terminally divides to generate a pair of neurons or glia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Campos-Ortega, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Goodman and Doe, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Rhyu et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Spana et al., 1995</xref>). Through successive cell divisions, the number of which depends on the NB identity, each NB produces unique and highly diverse progeny (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bossing et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Schmidt et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">1999</xref>). Recent studies have shown that many NBs in the embryonic VNC undergo the following temporal changes of the transcription factor expression: Hunchback → Kruppel→ Pdm→ Castor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kambadur et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Brody and Odenwald 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Isshiki et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Pearson and Doe 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Grosskortenhaus et al. 2005</xref>). Each of these factors defines a temporal identity window for the NB, and each is maintained in the GMC, establishing different transcriptional states. The GMC then divides via Notch-mediated asymmetric cell division to produce two sibling cells with distinct identities: the Notch-ON “A” cell and the Notch-OFF “B” cell (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Jan and Jan, 2000</xref>). Consequently, diversity within a NB lineage is produced through two main mechanisms: transcriptional changes in the NB that occur as the stem cell divides and Notch mediated asymmetric cell fates of the daughters of the GMC.</p><p>Towards the end of embryogenesis, most NBs in the thoracic and gnathal segments enter a mitotically quiescent state, whereas most NBs in the abdominal segments and a few in the thoracic segments die through apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Peterson et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Cenci and Gould, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Baumgardt et al., 2009</xref>). The quiescent NBs re-enter the cell cycle at the beginning of the second larval instar stage and continue to generate progeny from the Castor (Cas) window (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Tsuji et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Maurange et al., 2008</xref>). This quiescent state divides the neurogenesis of <italic>Drosophila</italic>, and other insects that undergo complete metamorphosis, into two phases: an embryonic phase, which generates the neurons of the larval nervous system, and a postembryonic phase, which generates adult-specific neurons. Because of the NB quiescence and the anatomical changes that occur in the CNS during late embryogenesis, it has been difficult to establish the correspondence between the embryonic and postembryonic lineages. Recently, using the technique of Flybow, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Birkholz et al. (2015)</xref> reported the correspondence between the embryonic and postembryonic lineages. We attempted a similar linkage using a suite of genetic and molecular tools to identify individual NB lineages in the embryo and then used these tools to bridge the postembryonic lineages to their embryonic origins. While we have concordance with most of the findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Birkholz et al. (2015)</xref>, we differ on eight of the lineages. We also find that within a lineage, the postembryonically born neurons show significant similarities to neurons that are born in the embryonic Cas window in terms of axonal projection and transcription-factor expression. Moreover, our findings complete previous work on identifying embryonic and postembryonic progeny of NBs by characterizing thorax-specific NBs, NB2-3 and NB3-4, which produce leg motor neurons and identifying a novel NB, NB5-7. Our complete lineage map, and the reagents we generated to follow individual lineages throughout development, lay the groundwork for investigating how neural patterning and NB identity in the embryonic CNS direct the formation of neural circuits in the adult.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Relationship of the embryonic and postembryonic lineages for the VNC</title><p>We linked the embryonic NBs to their postembryonic progeny via a recently developed technique, which irreversibly marks the complete progeny of a NB after the onset of GAL4 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Awasaki et al., 2014</xref>). To use this technique (which we call here “reporter immortalization”), we visually screened publicly available databases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Manning et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kvon et al., 2014</xref>) to identify GAL4 lines whose reporter expression is restricted to one or a few embryonic NBs. We identified over 100 such GAL4 lines. Only a few of them marked an individual NB, while most marked a few NBs with or without their progeny (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>).

postembryonic lineages 18, 17, 9 and 19, respectively in the dorsal part of the nerve cord</title><p>The postembryonic lineages that are located dorsal to the neuropil include an anterior triplet, consisting of lineages 9, 17 and 18, and the posteriorly located lineage 19 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Truman and Bate, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Truman et al.,

In the late embryonic CNS, Dpn staining, which marks all NBs, shows the same “3+1” pattern, suggesting that these NBs generate the dorsal postembryonic lineages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). A Dichaete (D)-expressing NB is always located medially in the anterior NB triplet. We identified this NB as NB2-4 based on morphological and molecular criteria: it is marked by <italic>eagle (eg</italic>)-GAL4, <italic>mirror</italic>-lacz and Msh (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> and not shown), which are co-expressed in NB2-4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Higashijima et al, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Broadus et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Isshiki et al., 1997</xref>). The morphology of lineage clones from this NB also matches the previously published features of the NB2-4 lineage: dorsolateral location, presence of a motor neuron with contralateral projection across the Anterior Commissure (AC) and into the anterior root of the Intersegmental Nerve (ISN), and the presence of interneurons that bundle with this motor neuron to cross the midline. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C,J</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Schmidt et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">1999</xref>). R65G02-GAL4 marks NB2-4 and occasionally a couple other NBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> and not shown). Reporter immortalization of the progeny of NB2-4 consistently labels lineage 18 (21 of 30 hemisegments) showing that NB2-4 generates lineage 18 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). In addition, D and Msh coexpress in NB2-4 embryonically and in NB 18 postembryonically. Moreover, Unc-4 expression marks both the embryonic progeny of NB2-4 and the postembryonic neurons of lineage 18 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lacin et al., 2014b</xref>). Finally, lineage 18 is missing from T1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Truman et al., 2004</xref>), and NB2-4 disappears from the anterior triplet by late embryogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B</xref>). Our conclusion that NB2-4 is the parent NB for lineage 18 differs from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Birkholz et al. (2015)</xref>, who concluded NB3-4 generates lineage 18. The embryonic lineage clone that was used in their study to link NB3-4 to lineage 18 appears to be a partial NB2-4 clone that lacks early-born motor neurons. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Birkholz et al. (2015)</xref> identified lineage 8 as the postembryonic progeny of NB2-4. However, our findings based on lineage tracings and molecular markers show that the neurons of lineage 8 arise from NB3-3 (see below).<fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.13399.008</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>NB2-4, NB2-5, NB3-5 and NB6-2 generate lineage 18, 17, 9 and 19, respectively.</title><p>Images on panels B, E, I, and M are from the larval CNS; the rest are from the embryonic CNS.

One of these lines, R59E09, uniquely marks NB3-5, and the immortalization of its expression labels lineage 9 in the larval VNC (30 of 30 hemisegments; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>). Moreover, we found that Ems expression is maintained in NB3-5 from embryonic to larval stages, and we also detected Msh, Islet (Isl) and Lim3 in both embryonic and postembryonic progeny of NB3-5 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lacin et al., 2014b</xref>).</p><p>The remaining NB in the anterior triplet is NB2-5.

Reporter immortalization of R19B03 labels cells of both lineage 17 and lineage 18 in the dorsal nerve cord (not shown and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). Thus, NB2-5 generates lineage 17 since NB2-4 generates lineage 18.</p><p>Flip-out clones generated by <italic>engrailed (en)</italic>-GAL4 contained the most posterior NB in the dorsal part of the nerve cord.

Indeed, using the R76D11 reporter, we detected NB6-2 in a ventral position in stage-12 embryos, becoming more dorsal as the embryos aged. In both embryonic and larval nerve cords, the NB of this lineage expresses <italic>gsb</italic>-LacZ, En, and D, and the embryonic and postembryonic neurons express Dbx and Unc-4 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lacin et al., 2014b</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-1-2"><title>A lineage map of all NBs in the VNC</title><p>Using the same approaches as detailed for the dorsally located NBs, we unambiguously identified the postembryonic progeny of all the NBs except NB1-1 and NB5-2, for which we failed to identify specific GAL4 lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). To identify the postembryonic progeny of these last two NBs, we used a fact that emerged during our lineage-tracing experiments: in almost all lineages, embryonic and postembryonic progeny of a NB showed significant similarities in how they extended their axons and in the molecular markers they expressed. For example, a subset of the embryonic progeny of NB1-2 send axons ipsilaterally to the next anterior segment while others extend contralateral axons that turn with a characteristic posterior hook (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4Aii</xref>). The same pattern is seen in the postembryonic progeny of this NB, with the set of 1B interneurons projecting anteriorly into the next ipsilateral neuropil and their 1A sibs crossing the midline and showing the posterior hook (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4Aiii</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Truman et al., 2004</xref>).

Since NBs appear to retain their relative positions between stage-16 embryos and larval stages (e.g., dorsal NBs in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), we expected that the postembryonic progeny of NB1-1 would lie medial to NB1-2 progeny (lineage 1). Lineage 16 resides medial to lineage 1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Truman et al., 2004</xref>), and in agreement with this, we found that embryonic interneurons from NB1-1 express Hb9 and Lim3 and extend their axons laterally in a similar manner to lineage 16 postembryonic interneurons that are also Hb9<sup>+</sup> Lim3<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Moreover, using NB-specific GAL4 lines we had assigned all of the surrounding NBs to other postembryonic lineages. Thus, we concluded that NB1-1 generates lineage 16. With a similar strategy we identified lineage 6 as the postembryonic progeny of NB5-2. We found that both NB5-2 embryonic progeny and lineage 6 neurons express En, Twin of eyeless (Toy), and Vestigial (Vg), and their axons use the same routes in the posterior commissures to cross the midline (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2B</xref>).</p><p>We failed to find postembryonic progeny of NB5-1, NB5-5, NB5-6, NB6-4, or NB7-3, suggesting these NBs lack the second, postembryonic neurogenic phase. Indeed, NB5-6 is eliminated by apoptosis during embryogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Baumgardt et al., 2009</xref>), and a similar fate was concluded for NB7-3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Karcavich and Doe, 2005</xref>). To verify these findings and determine the fates of the other NBs, we surveyed the VNC by TUNEL staining, which marks dying cells. In the thoracic segments, NB7-3, NB6-4 and NB5-6 were TUNEL-positive in stage-14, -15 and -16 embryos, respectively, and could no longer be found in stage-17 embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3C–G</xref>; not shown). Hence, these three NBs die late in embryogenesis. Further, while we detected NB5-1 and NB5-5 in stage-13 embryos by <italic>gsb</italic>-lacZ and/or <italic>unplugged (unpg)</italic>-lacZ expression, we could not identify them at stage 17 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3A</xref> and not shown). However, we did not observe any TUNEL staining in either NB. Either they died and we missed their TUNEL-positive window, or they lost their progenitor and underwent terminal differentiation as is seen in some of the other NBs at the end of their postembryonic phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Maurange et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>The lineage map that we determined based on the above approaches is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and differs for eight of the lineages from the map by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Birkholz et al., (2015)</xref> based on the flybow approach (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>).

This conclusion is supported by our detection of the Ems protein, which marks embryonic NB3-3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hartmann et al., 2000</xref>), in the NB of lineage 8 and the presence of common transcription factors in both embryonic progeny of NB3-3 and postembryonic lineage 8 neurons (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). In addition, the axonal morphology of thoracic NB3-3 embryonic progeny is virtually identical to the morphology of postembryonic lineage 8 neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1L</xref>). Thus, we concluded NB3-3 generates lineage 8 neurons. This designation differs from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Birkholz et al. (2015)</xref> who concluded that NB2-4 was the progenitor of lineage 8. We think their designation is unlikely since NB2-4 is located in the dorsal surface of the nerve cord (unlike NB3-3 and lineage 8), does not express Ems and generates the dorsally located lineage 18 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C–E</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-1-5"><title>Postembryonic lineage 11 is produced by NB7-2</title><p>Reporter immortalization of R35B12<sup>AD</sup>-R28H10<sup>DBD</sup> marks specifically lineage 11 (12 of 30 hemisegments; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>).

To find the identity of this NB, we assayed a panel of molecular markers and found that <italic>mirror</italic>-lacZ, Runt, and Msh label this NB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>; not shown). Based on previous studies, NB2-3 is the only NB that delaminates from Msh<sup>+</sup> neuroectoderm and expresses mirror-lacZ and Runt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Doe, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Broadus et al, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Dormand and Brand, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Isshiki et al., 1997</xref>). Also, the NB marked by R10C12 typically resided in row two and column three of the NB layer (Supp. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Little is known about NB2-3 and its progeny, but it was previously suggested that it produced leg motor neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Schmid et al., 1999</xref>). Two previous studies attempted to find embryonic progeny of NB2-3 via DiI labeling; both experienced difficulties and observed unusual rates of cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Schmidt et al, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">1999</xref>). One study was able to label NB2-3 progeny only in the thoracic segments and showed that NB2-3 progeny comprise a few extraordinarily large cells without axons (9 microns in diameter) and a few interneurons with contralateral projections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Schmid et al., 1999</xref>). To visualize NB2-3 embryonic progeny with a less invasive approach, we generated lineage clones with R10C12 and three additional independent lines (R11B05, R28H10 and R77B09<sup>AD</sup>-R28H10<sup>DBD</sup>), all of which label NB2-3. We recovered lineage clones containing this NB only from the thoracic segments (n&gt;50). The largest clones, presumably the entire embryonic lineage, contained 10 cells in addition to the NB (n=8), and the only axonal projection was into the periphery unlike the previously documented NB2-3 progeny (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Schmid et al., 1999</xref>). These axons exited the CNS in two bundles via the segmental nerve but did not innervate any muscles in stage-17 embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). We obtained similar-looking clones with pan-neuronal <italic>elav</italic>-GAL4, indicating that embryonic progeny of NB2-3 extend only efferent axons (n=3; not shown). Like postembryonic lineage 15 neurons, NB2-3 embryonic progeny express Lim3, Isl and Nkx6. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Birkholz et al.

We observed lineage 25 when we immortalized reporter expression of R19B03<sup>AD</sup>-R16H11<sup>DBD</sup>, <italic>eg</italic>-GAL4, and R77B09<sup>AD</sup>-R28H10<sup>DBD</sup> lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I,K</xref>; not shown). It also appeared in MARCM clones generated with <italic>elav</italic>-GAL4 and <italic>actin</italic>-GAL4 lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5L,M</xref>; not shown). At the wandering larval stage, lineage 25 is located lateral to lineage 15 (NB2-3), and includes the NB, a small cluster of closely adhering cells expressing Msh, and two motor neurons expressing Nkx6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I,L, and M</xref>). It is similar to lineage 15 in several ways: (i) neurons in both postembryonic lineages extend their axons towards leg discs, indicating they are leg motor neurons (not shown); (ii) both lineages contain glial cells located around the leg neuropil (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C,K</xref>); and (iii) both NBs express Msh and Runt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I</xref>; not shown). To find the embryonic origin of lineage 25, we generated lineage clones in the embryo with the lines mentioned above. Common to all lines, we identified a thoracic specific NB, which is located ventrolaterally. For example, reporter immortalization of R77B09<sup>AD</sup>-R28H10<sup>DBD</sup> results in lineage 15 and more laterally lineage 25 in addition to medially residing lineage 2 neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E,I</xref>; lineage 2 not shown). Based on the lineage clones generated with this line in the embryonic CNS, we found that R77B09<sup>AD</sup>-R28H10<sup>DBD</sup> marks NB2-1 (the stem cell for lineage 2; not shown), NB2-3 (stem cell for lineage 15; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E,F</xref>), and a more lateral NB (the stem cell for lineage 25; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E,G</xref>). The lateral NB had five progeny in their lineage clones and their axons exit the CNS in the segmental nerve but do not extend as far as the NB2-3 motor neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). This NB and its progeny in the embryo expressed Msh, Runt, Eg, and Eyless (Ey) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D,E</xref>; not shown), and it was the only NB found in common to all of the GAL4 lines whose reporter immortalization marks lineage 25 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5I</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7J-K</xref>; not shown). Hence, we concluded that it is the stem cell of lineage 25.</p><p>The embryonic designation of this stem cell was difficult to determine because no NB expressing Msh, Runt, Eg, and Ey and giving rise to progeny with this morphology, has been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Schmidt et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Birkholz et al., 2013</xref>). Among these transcription factors, Eg has been used in many studies because it marks only four NBs: NB2-4, NB3-3, NB6-4, and NB7-3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Higashijima et al, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Dittrich et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Mettler et al. 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Tsuji et al., 2008</xref>). However, when we analyzed <italic>eg</italic>-lacZ, eg-Gal4, or Eg protein expression in the nerve cords of stage-12 embryos, when NB delamination was complete, we observed four Eg<sup>+</sup> NBs in abdominal segments, but five such NBs in the thoracic segments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B-C</xref>). The extra Eg<sup>+</sup> NB in the thorax is the lineage 25 stem cell, since it is also labeled by Msh, Runt, and Ey (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>; not shown). This NB resides in the third row and third column of the thoracic NB array. This position is perplexing because we find NB3-3, which is characterized by being Msh<sup>-</sup> and Eg<sup>+</sup>, in the fourth position in the third row of the thoracic array, although it occupies the third position in the abdominal array (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Although misplaced, we propose this thoracic-specific NB is NB3-4 because: (i) NB3-4 is the only NB in the vicinity that has not been well characterized, and previous studies failed to identify its progeny with confidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Schmidt et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">1999</xref>); and (ii) in both abdominal and thoracic segments, only three NBs reside near but lateral to NB3-3: the Msh<sup>+</sup> NBs 2–4 and NB2-5, and the EMS<sup>+</sup> NB3-5, indicating that NB3-4 cannot be lateral to NB3-3. Earlier studies may have confused NB3-3 and NB3-4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Doe, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Higashijima et al., 1996</xref>). In agreement with our findings, a recent study in <italic>T. castaneum</italic> identified an Msh<sup>+</sup> NB in the third row and third column of the NB array in the thoracic segments. However, the authors identified this NB as NB3-3 and explained the discrepancy in Msh expression as a difference between two species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Biffar and Stollwerk, 2015</xref>). Since lineage 25 is first described here, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Birkholz et al.

As discussed above, the molecular markers argue that lineage 18 is produced by NB2-4, and we conclude that NB3-4 gives rise to the newly described lineage 25.</p></sec><sec id="s2-1-8"><title>Lineage 20 is generated by NB5-7</title><p>Lineage 20 and lineage 22 are postembryonic lineages with very similar morphological and molecular features.

Previous studies identified only one NB, NB5-4, with such molecular expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Birkholz et al., 2013</xref>) and proposed that lineage 20 and lineage 22 both arise from NB5-4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Birkholz et al., 2015</xref>). Indeed, we identified one of these NBs as NB5-4 based on embryonic clones generated with the R19B05<sup>AD</sup>-R45D04<sup>DBD</sup> line. These clones contained a single NB and several motor neurons exiting the CNS via the SN as previously shown for the progeny of NB5-4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6A—figure supplement 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Schmidt et al., 1997</xref>). However, clones from the other NB always appeared as a single large cell without any associated progeny. This pattern of one NB with progeny and the other without was evident in clones generated with R19B05<sup>AD</sup>-R45D04<sup>DBD</sup> and the GAL4 driver R17A10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6B—figure supplement 1C</xref>).

Finally, we found the isolated NB only in the thoracic segments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). We believe this NB has not been previously described, so we named it NB5-7.

HOX proteins specify segment identity and control segment-specific structure formation. We used R77B09 line, which marks NB2-3 and NB3-4, to examine whether HOX genes control formation of these NBs. Antennapedia (Antp) is necessary for the proper development of thoracic segments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Wakimoto and Kaufman, 1981</xref>). In <italic>antp</italic> mutant embryos, NB2-3 and NB3-4 lineages formed normally, but their axons failed to exit the CNS, especially in the T2 and T3 segments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B,C</xref>). In agreement with this phenotype, in wild-type animals, we detected significantly higher level of Antp protein in the T2-T3 segments compared to the T1 segment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Although there is an overall reduction of Antp in the T1 segment, Antp levels in these lineages are higher than in surrounding lineages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). During postembryonic development, Antp function is similarly necessary to direct leg motor neurons to innervate their target muscles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baek et al., 2013</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.13399.018</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Hox genes restrict NB2-3 and NB3-4 lineages to the thoracic segments.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>-<bold>G</bold>) 77B09-lexAp65 driven GFP marks NB2-3 and NB3-4 lineages in wild type embryos (<bold>A</bold>, <bold>B</bold>, <bold>D</bold> and <bold>E</bold>) and embryos mutant for <italic>antp</italic> (<bold>C</bold>), <italic>ubx</italic> (<bold>F</bold>), and double mutant for <italic>abd-A</italic> and <italic>ubx</italic> (<bold>G</bold>).

With the evolution of metamorphosis, this single phase of neurogenesis was split into two, with the embryonic phase producing the neurons of the larva and the postembryonic phase dedicated to making adult neurons.

In the larva, these neurons arrest after extending their axons into the periphery towards the leg discs and wait until metamorphosis before invading the developing leg disc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Truman et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baek and Mann, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Brierley et al., 2009</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">2012</xref>). Like their postembryonic counterparts, the embryonic progeny of NB2-3 are primarily arrested motor neurons that lack muscle targets at hatching. We identified two lines, R77B09<sup>AD</sup>-R28H10<sup>DBD</sup> and VT006878, which mark ventrally and dorsally located NB2-3 embryonic progeny, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9D</xref>). These arrested motor neurons are evident in these lines at hatching. By feeding larvae on food containing EDU from hatching and then examining the clusters just prior to metamorphosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A,E</xref>), we found that all of the arrested motor neurons lacked EDU incorporation, showing that these lines do not add any of the postembryonic members of this lineage. Their axons split into two bundles after exiting the larval CNS. One bundle extends across the body wall, and, in T1 only, includes one functional motor neuron that innervates a muscle field while the rest of the axons appear to stall in their peripheral nerve (not shown). The other bundle extends towards the leg disc but its axons also stall out on the nerve (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C,F</xref>). Except for the T1 motor neuron, these stalled neurons are also negative for vGLUT expression (a marker of mature motor neurons) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>).

A similar pattern is also seen for one of the flight motor neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Consoulas et al., 2002</xref>). The vast majority of embryonic interneurons, though, become functional neurons in the larva, but some of these neurons still share characteristics with their postembryonic-born siblings (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). For example, axons of a subset of NB6-1 embryonic progeny bundle with the lineage 12A neurons (the postembryonic progeny of NB6-1), and both populations of neurons express Unc-4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A</xref> and not shown). Interestingly, in complex embryonic lineages with several different axonal projections, the postembryonic born neurons followed only one or two of these projections. For example, the embryonic progeny of NB4-1 are quite complex, with four main types of neurons: (i) efferent neurons, (ii) intersegmental interneurons, (iii) local interneurons that cross the midline via the posterior commissure, and (iv) local interneurons that cross the midline via the anterior commissure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bossing et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Schmid et al., 1999</xref>). The last class can be further subdivided based on whether they cross in dorsal or ventral neuropil (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B</xref>). The postembryonic progeny of NB4-1 conform to the two subclasses of the type-iv interneurons: axons from the 14A hemilineage cross the midline via the ventral anterior commissure, whereas axons of the 14B hemilineage use the dorsal anterior commissure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10D</xref>). We suspected that the postembryonic cells shared features with the last class of embryonic neurons to be born. To identify when these embryonic neurons are born, we roughly mapped their birth order of the NB4-1 progeny based on clone induction time and clone size. The smallest embryonic clones consistently contained only the two type-iv subtypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10C</xref>), showing that they are the last type of neurons that are produced in the embryo. Cells with these two projection patterns then continue to be made through the entire postembryonic phase to generate the 14A and 14B hemilineages.

As expected, embryonic-born Unc-4<sup>+</sup> interneurons do not form in <italic>cas</italic> mutant embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10H–I</xref>), indicating that these neurons indeed arise in the Cas temporal window and that Cas function is necessary for their formation. However, the larval-born Unc-4<sup>+</sup> interneurons in <italic>cas</italic>-null MARCM clones formed and extended their contralateral axon similar to those of wild type (not shown), indicating that larval born neurons do not require Cas function for their identity and that temporal identity in these two phases of neurogenesis may be regulated differently.</p><p>We found a similar scenario in the lineages of NB5-3 and NB5-6, where neurons born in the Cas<sup>+</sup> embryonic window extend axons whose route is then later followed by the postembryonic progeny of these NBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">Figure 10—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Thus our findings suggest that NBs generate similar types of neurons before and after the quiescent state, although these become incorporated into circuitry to control very different types of bodies, larval versus adult.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3-3"><title>Late-born embryonic neurons and postembryonic lineages show similar patterns of transcription factor expression</title><p>As noted above for a few lineages, embryonic and postembryonic progeny of a given NB express similar transcription factors and show similar axonal projections. Moreover, the late-born embryonic neurons are the most similar to the postembryonic group. We examined whether this pattern of common transcription factor expression is universal, by assaying all lineages for the expression of transcription factors at both embryonic and postembryonic stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lacin et al., 2014b</xref>, data in this study). We performed antibody staining against these transcription factors in embryos with FLP-out clones that marked specific embryonic lineages. As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>, we found that, in almost all lineages, transcription factors that mark a specific postembryonic lineage are also expressed in some of the embryonic progeny of the same lineage. Moreover, neurons expressing these transcription factors in the embryo tended to be located nearest to the NB, indicating they are born late in the embryonic lineage. For example, the first division of NB4-2 generates Eve<sup>+</sup> RP2 and Dbx<sup>+</sup> RP2-sib neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lacin et al., 2009</xref>). Later divisions generate Hb9<sup>+</sup> CoR motor neurons with their Dbx<sup>+</sup> sibling interneurons, followed by more interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Landgraf et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Schmid et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lacin et al., 2009</xref>). Based on our lineage clones, we found that these late-born neurons express D and Dbx (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11A–C</xref>). Interestingly, the expression of D and Dbx in these late-born neurons is restricted to thoracic lineages and is carried over to the postembryonic progeny of NB4-2, with Dbx being expressed in hemilineage 13A and D expressed in hemilineage 13B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11D–E</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lacin et al., 2014b</xref>).<fig id="fig11" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.13399.024</object-id><label>Figure 11.</label><caption><title>Dicheaete and Dbx marks both embryonic ands postembryonic NB4-2 progeny.</title><p>Nerve cord images from the embryo (<bold>A</bold>-<bold>D</bold>) and larva (<bold>E</bold>).

Interestingly, some of these transcription factors are expressed exclusively in the NB of some lineages while in other lineages they are expressed in the progeny but not in the NB. For example, Dbx is expressed in NB3-2 during embryonic and postembryonic neurogenesis but not in its progeny. On the other hand, Dbx expression in the NB4-2 lineage is restricted to the progeny. Moreover, we also found that expression of NB patterning genes such as Gsb, Mirror, Ey, and Unpg is maintained from embryonic to larval development (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The segmental NB array in <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos has been the focus of many studies to investigate neurogenesis. Individual NBs have been identified based on their large size and location in the array, by molecular marker expression including genetic handles such as lacZ and GAL4 lines, or by the morphology of their progeny. Only a few NBs have been studied comprehensively including all these features [e.g., NB5-6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Baumgardt et al., 2009</xref>). Here, we have used a suite of molecular markers and a library of GAL4 lines, many of which are specific to individual NBs, to characterize the entire set of thoracic NBs, including their embryonic and postembryonic progeny.</p><p>We found that 26 of 30 (+1 medial) thoracic NBs survive into larval stages to generate neurons for the adult nervous system. We found that three of these NBs appear to be confined to the thorax, and two of them (NB2-3 and NB3-4) are dedicated to producing motor neurons for the leg. The third NB, NB5-7, had not been previously described and is unique in that it appears to have only a postembryonic neurogenic phase. Although the segmental NB array has been highly conserved through insect evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Thomas et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Truman and Bate, 1988</xref>), we think that NB5-7 is a recent addition, likely by a duplication of NB5-4.</p><p>This two-phase pattern of neurogenesis evolved from a simpler scheme, such as seen in grasshoppers, in which all neurons were generated during an extended embryonic phase (Bate 1976; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Shepherd and Bate, 1990</xref>). The similarity of the neurons just before and after quiescence in flies suggests that the insect NBs dealt with metamorphosis by simply suspending their ongoing fate determination through the arrest period and then resuming from that point once neurogenesis was restarted. In other words, metamorphosis did not likely require the resetting of a fate determination clock on the development of a novel postembryonic system.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Fly Stocks</title><p>We used the following fly strains with indicated genotypes during this study Canton-S as wild type, <italic>gsbn-lacZ.4z1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Li and Noll, 1994</xref>), <italic>lbe</italic>(K)-<italic>GAL4</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Baumgardt et al., 2009</xref>), <italic>mirror-lacZ</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Broadus et al., 1995</xref>), <italic>unpg-lacZ</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Doe, CQ 1992</xref>), <italic>5172J-GAL4</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lacin et al., 2014a</xref>), <italic>elav-GAL4</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">DiAntonio et al., 2001</xref>), <italic>en- GAL4</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brand and Perrimon, 1993</xref>), <italic>ems-GAL4</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Estacio-Gomez et al., 2013</xref>), <italic>eg</italic>-kinesin-lacZ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Higashijima et al., 1996</xref>), <italic>eg-GAL4</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ito et al., 1995</xref>), <italic>antp<sup>25</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abbott and Kaufman, 1986</xref>), <italic>Df(3L)H99</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Abbott and Lengyel, 1991</xref>), <italic>Df(3R)Ubx109</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lewis, 1980</xref>), <italic>cas<sup>24</sup>/TM6b</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Cui and Doe, 1992</xref>), pJFRC19-13XLexAop2-IVS-myr::GFP, pJFRC7-20XUAS-IVS-mCD8::GFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Pfeiffer et al. 2010</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>TUNEL and EDU labeling</title><p>Cell death was detected by TUNEL labeling (Roche, in situ cell death detection kit, TMR red).

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by K VijayRaghavan as the Senior Editor and the Reviewing Editor.

It links <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryonic neuroblasts (eNB; which have a long history of descriptive and mechanistic studies) with larval neuroblasts (lNB; that also have a long history of descriptive and mechanistic studies). In this paper Haluk Lacin and James Truman present a range of new reagents, primarily Gal4 and split-Gal4 expression lines, that have allowed them to address key questions of <italic>Drosophila</italic> nervous system development. The authors identify three new neuroblasts that were previously missed. The manuscript corrects several eNB – lNB assignments made last year by Birkholz et al. (which was also very nice work). It shows that the last born eNB progeny are molecularly and morphologically similar to the lNB progeny, and thus the period of quiescence does not dramatically 'reprogram' the progenitor lineage. It describes the role of Hox genes and apoptosis in shaping the segment-specific lNB array (not super novel, but nice data).</p><p>In addition to having generated and mapped with molecular markers driver lines that will allow the wider community to work on specific neuroblast lineages in ways previously not possible, Lacin and Truman focus on several very interesting questions.</p><p>For example, working with expression lines, as opposed to manual or stochastic labelling approaches, they were able to determine the completeness of the neuroblast maps as published to date and discovered as yet uncharted neuroblasts: NB 5-7, which has the hallmarks of having potentially arise by duplication of NB 5-4 in thoracic neuromeres. Both the NB 5-4 and NB 5-7 postembryonic lineages (Lin22 and Lin20, respectively) are associated with leg motor control, suggesting this to be potentially a relatively late evolutionary modification of the groundplan of the neuroblast map.</p><p>In another example, they asked how the evolution of complete metamorphosis might have impacted on neuroblast division patterns. Here, the evidence presented suggest that with metamorphosis a temporal break has been inserted into the cell division pattern: late embryonic neurons are often similar in marker gene expression pattern and neurite trajectory to the early postembryonic cells. This suggests that postembryonically lineages resume where they left off, as opposed to starting generally with a novel programme of differentiation.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The main issue that needs to be addressed with the manuscript is that it still leaves the reader somewhat uncertain as to precisely where the discrepancies lie between this work and the study previously studied by the Technau lab. The authors present detailed data for 3 of these, but very little for the remaining 5. The authors certainly must have detailed data on these 5 and they should present it in the manuscript, especially since further experiments are not required for this. It will be important for the field that both in the text and in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref> discrepancies in interpretation are clearly outlined. For example, for lineage 15 it would be helpful to read explicitly that this study identifies its embryonic origin as NB 2-3, while Birkholz and colleagues had suggested lineage 15 as being generated by NB 3-2. While the authors give a clear account of why they think NB 2-3 as the correct assignment, it would help to also read as to why they think lineage 7 the postembryonic product of NB 3-2. In other words, it could be most helpful to the field if the authors could find a way of constructively reconciling discrepancies where possible, and to point to those where reasonable doubts remain. Before final acceptance it is essential that the authors discuss each of the 8 neuroblast lineage assignments, in which the authors differ from Birkholz et al., in detail. If they wish the authors could reduce the description of neuroblast lineages in which both studies concur.</p><p>The only 'negative' to this nice paper is the fact that a similar paper was published last year. However, this paper confirms most of their data using an independent method, corrects a few errors, and provides a wealth of new reagents that will be extremely valuable to the field. Thus, we feel the paper is a major advance. In summary, this is an impressive study that fills an important gap in our understanding, and is executed and presented with care.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.13399.026</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>The main issue that needs to be addressed with the manuscript is that it still leaves the reader somewhat uncertain as to precisely where the discrepancies lie between this work and the study previously studied by the Technau lab.

To address the main concern of the reviewers, we included sections of detailed explanations for each lineage, whose NB assignment differs from Birkholz et al. (2015). Further, we added <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref> to the manuscript to summarize these explanations for an easier identification and comparison of these differences for the readers.</p><p>The following paragraph was added to the section”NB2-4, NB2-5, NB3-5 and NB6-2 generate postembryonic lineages 18, 17, 9 and 19, respectively in the dorsal part of the nerve cord.”</p><p>“Our conclusion that NB2-4 is the parent NB for lineage 18 differs from Birkholz et al. (2015), which concluded NB3-4 generates lineage 18. The embryonic lineage clone that was used in their study to link NB3-4 to lineage 18 appears to be a partial NB2-4 clone, which lacks early-born motor neurons. Birkholz et al. (2015) identified lineage 8 as the postembryonic progeny of NB2-4. However, our findings based on lineage tracings and molecular markers show that NB3-3 is responsible for the lineage 8 neurons (see below).”</p><p>The following three sections were added to the manuscript.</p><p>1) “Postembryonic lineages 7 and 13 are produced by NB3-2 and NB4-2, respectively”</p><p>“NB3-2 and NB4-2 generate progeny with similar morphologies: both generate ipsilateral motor neurons and contralateral interneurons. […] Moreover, immortalization of another driver R21E09<sup>AD</sup>-R28H10<sup>DBD</sup>, which marks NB3-2 in the embryo, identifies lineage 7 as its progeny (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>).”</p><p>2) “Postembryonic lineage 8 is produced by NB3-3”</p><p><italic>“ems</italic>-GAL4 marks NB2-2, NB3-3, and NB3-5 and its immortalization labels lineages 10, 8, and 9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1L</xref>; Estacio-Gomez et al., 2013; Moris -Sanz et al., 2014). […] We think their designation is unlikely since NB2-4 is located in the dorsal surface of the nerve cord (unlike NB3-3 and lineage 8), does not express Ems and generates the dorsally located lineage 18 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C–E</xref>).”</p><p>New panels were added to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1L</xref> during the revisions to show that lineage clones we identified are indeed NB3-3 clones and Ems is expressed in lineage 8 NB. Moreover, we corrected a mistake in this figure: A lineage clone from eg-GAL4 was mislabeled as ems-GAL4. In the revised version, we included NB3-3 lineage clones from both eg-GAL4 and ems-GAL4. Nonetheless, correcting this mistake did not change the content of this figure.</p><p>3) “Postembryonic lineage 11 is produced by NB7-2”</p><p>“Reporter immortalization of 35B12<sup>AD</sup>-R28H10<sup>DBD</sup> marks specifically lineage 11 (12 of 30 hemisegments; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>).
