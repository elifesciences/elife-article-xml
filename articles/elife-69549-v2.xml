observation of phenotype remain central to biological discovery. Current methods enable either on/off or imprecisely controlled graded gene expression. We developed a 'well-tempered' controller, WTC<sub>846</sub>, for precisely adjustable, graded, growth condition independent expression of genes in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>. Controlled genes are expressed from a strong semisynthetic promoter repressed by the prokaryotic TetR, which also represses its own synthesis; with basal expression abolished by a second, 'zeroing' repressor. The autorepression loop lowers cell-to-cell variation while enabling precise adjustment of protein expression by a chemical inducer. WTC<sub>846</sub> allelic strains in which the controller replaced the native promoters recapitulated known null phenotypes (<italic>CDC42, TPI1</italic>), exhibited novel overexpression phenotypes (<italic>IPL1</italic>), showed protein dosage-dependent growth rates and morphological phenotypes (<italic>CDC28, TOR2, PMA1</italic> and the hitherto uncharacterized <italic>PBR1</italic>), and enabled cell cycle synchronization (<italic>CDC20</italic>).

During the 20th century, workhorse methods to ensure the presence or absence of gene products have included use of temperature-sensitive (<italic>ts</italic>) and cold-sensitive (<italic>cs</italic>) mutations within genes, for example to give insight into ordinality of cell biological events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Hereford and Hartwell, 1974</xref>). After the advent of recombinant DNA methods, conditional expression of genes into proteins, for example by derepression of <italic>lac</italic> promoter derivatives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Goeddel et al., 1979</xref>), also found application in biotechnology for production of therapeutics and industrial products (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Sochor et al., 2015</xref>). In 2021, contemporaneous approaches to conditional expression in wide use include construction of transgenes activated by chimeric activators controlled by promoters whose expression is temporally and spatially restricted to different cell lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brand and Perrimon, 1993</xref>), hundreds of approaches based on production of DNA rearrangements by phage-derived site specific recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Sauer, 1987</xref>), and triggered induction of engineered genes by chimeric transcription regulators with DNA-binding moieties based on derivatives of TetR from Tn10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Gossen et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Garí et al., 1997</xref>). Most of these approaches are all-or-none, in the sense that they are not intended to bring about expression of intermediate levels of protein; and the observations they enable are often qualitative.</p><p>But it has long been recognized that adjustment of protein dosage can provide additional insight into function that cannot be gained from all-or-none expression. For example, controlled expression of the bacteriophage λ cI and cro gene products was key to understanding how changes in the level of those proteins regulated the phage’s decision to undergo lytic or lysogenic growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Maurer et al., 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Meyer et al., 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Meyer and Ptashne, 1980</xref>). In <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, contemporaneous means to tune dosage include metabolite induced promoters, such as <italic>P<sub><italic>GAL1</italic></sub></italic>, <italic>P<sub><italic>MET3</italic></sub></italic>, <italic>P<sub><italic>CUP1</italic></sub></italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Maya et al., 2008</xref>), in which expression is controlled by growth media composition, and small molecule induced systems, such as the β-estradiol-induced LexA-hER-B112 system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Ottoz et al., 2014</xref>). Many of these depend on fusions between eukaryotic and viral activator domains and prokaryotic proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Garí et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Ottoz et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">McIsaac et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">McIsaac et al., 2014</xref>) that bind sites on engineered promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Brent and Ptashne, 1985</xref>). These methods suffer from a number of drawbacks, including basal expression when not induced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bellí et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Garí et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Ottoz et al., 2014</xref>), deleterious effects on cell growth due to sequestration of cellular components by the activation domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Gill and Ptashne, 1988</xref>) induction of genes in addition to the controlled gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">McIsaac et al., 2013</xref>), and high cell-to-cell variation in expression of the controlled genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Meurer et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Elison et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Ottoz et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>These inducible systems rely on 'activation by recruitment' (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Ptashne and Gann, 1997</xref>); the activator binds a site on DNA upstream of a yeast gene and recruits general transcription factors and regulators of the Pre-Initiation Complex (PIC). These assemble downstream at the 'core promoter’ and recruit RNA polymerase II to induce transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hahn and Young, 2011</xref>). An alternative to inducible activation would be to engineer reversible repression of yeast transcription by prokaryotic repressors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brent and Ptashne, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Hu and Davidson, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Brown et al., 1987</xref>). For TATA-containing promoters, binding of prokaryotic proteins such as LexA and the lac repressor near the TATA sequence can repress transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brent and Ptashne, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Murphy et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Wedler and Wambutt, 1995</xref>), presumably by interference with the formation of the PIC, transcription initiation, or early elongation. It has long been recognized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brent, 1985</xref>) that prokaryotic repressors likely work through different mechanisms than mechanisms used by repressors native to eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Wang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gaston and Jayaraman, 2003</xref>).</p><p>We envisioned that an ideal conditional expression system to support genetic and quantitative experimentation would: (1) function in all growth media, (2) be inducible by an exogenous small molecule with minimal other effects on the cell, (3) manifest no basal expression of the controlled gene in absence of inducer, allowing generation of null phenotypes, (4) enable a very large range of precisely adjustable expression, and (5) drive very high maximum expression, allowing generation of overexpression phenotypes. Moreover, since differences in global ability to express genes into proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Colman-Lerner et al., 2005</xref>) lead to differences in allelic penetrance and expressivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Burnaevskiy et al., 2019</xref>), the ideal controller should (6) exhibit low cell-to-cell variation at any set output, facilitating detection of phenotypes that depend on thresholds of protein dosage, and other inferences of single-cell behaviors from population responses.</p><p>Here, we describe the development of a prokaryotic repressor-based transcriptional controller of gene expression, Well-tempered Controller<sub>846</sub> (WTC<sub>846</sub>), that fulfils the criteria outlined above. This development had three main stages. We first engineered a powerful eukaryotic promoter that is repressed by the prokaryotic repressor TetR and induced by the chemical tetracycline and its analogue Anhydrotetracycline (aTc), to use as the promoter of the controlled gene. Next, we used instances of this promoter to construct a configuration of genetic elements that show low cell-to-cell variation in expression of the controlled gene, by creating an autorepression loop in which TetR repressed its own synthesis. Third and last, we abolished basal expression of the controlled gene in the absence of the inducer, by engineering a weakly expressed 'zeroing' repressor, a chimera between TetR and an active yeast repressor Tup1. With WTC<sub>846</sub>, adjusting the extracellular concentration of aTc can precisely set the expression level of the controlled gene in different growth media, over time and over cell cycle stage. The gene is then 'expression clamped' with low cell-to-cell variation at a certain protein dosage, which can range from undetectable to greater abundance than wild type. We showed that strains carrying WTC<sub>846</sub> allelic forms of essential genes recapitulated known knockout phenotypes, and one demonstrated a novel overexpression phenotype. We constructed strains bearing WTC<sub>846</sub> alleles of genes involved in size control, growth rate, and cell cycle state and showed that these allowed precise experimental control of these fundamental aspects of cell physiology. We expect that WTC<sub>846</sub> alleles will find use in biological engineering and in discovery research, in assessment of phenotypes now incompletely penetrant due to cell-to-cell variation of the causative gene, in hypothesis directed cell biological research, and in genome-wide studies such as gene-by-gene epistasis screens.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Construction of a repressible <italic>P<sub><italic>TDH3</italic></sub></italic> promoter</title><p>Our goal was to engineer efficient repression of eukaryotic transcription by a bacterial repressor. We started with a strong (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ho et al., 2018</xref>), well-characterized, constitutive, and endogenous yeast promoter. This promoter, <italic>P<sub><italic>TDH3</italic></sub></italic>, has three key Transcription Factor (TF) binding sites, one for Rap1 and two for Gcr1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Yagi et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kuroda et al., 1994</xref>) in its Upstream Activating Region (UAS), and a TATA sequence at which PIC assembles on the core promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Based on earlier work, we knew that binding of prokaryotic repressors to sites flanking the TATA sequence of <italic>P<sub><italic>TDH3</italic></sub></italic> repressed activity of this promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Wedler and Wambutt, 1995</xref>), presumably by interfering with PIC formation, transcription initiation, or early elongation. We therefore placed well characterized, 15 bp long TetR-binding sites (<italic>tetO<sub>1</sub></italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bertram and Hillen, 2008</xref>) immediately upstream and downstream of the <italic>P<sub><italic>TDH3</italic></sub></italic> TATA sequence to create <italic>P<sub><italic>2tet</italic></sub></italic>. To determine whether repressor binding could also block function in the UAS, we placed a single <italic>tetO<sub>1</sub></italic> directly upstream of each Rap1 and Gcr1-binding site to create <italic>P<sub><italic>3tet</italic></sub></italic>. We also combined the operators in these constructs to generate <italic>P<sub><italic>5tet</italic></sub></italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).

To do so, we constructed otherwise-isogenic strains with these architectures in which <italic>P<sub><italic>7tet.1</italic></sub></italic> directed Citrine expression (Y2663, Y2674, and Y2741). We used flow cytometry to quantify Citrine fluorescence signal from all strains 7 hr after addition of different concentrations of aTc and fitted a log logistic model to the median fluorescence (see Materials and methods) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B&amp;C</xref>).</p><p>Compared to the SR architecture, the AR architecture showed a more gradual dose response curve and a larger input dynamic range (the range of input doses for which the slope of the dose response curve was non-zero), from 3 to 400 ng/mL vs. 5–80 ng/mL aTc. This same flattening of the response curve and increased input dynamic range in autorepressing, synthetic TetR based eukaryotic systems has been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Nevozhay et al., 2009</xref>), and we believe it operates in evolved prokaryotic systems including Tn10 and the <italic>E. coli</italic> SOS regulon, in which the TetR and LexA repressors repress their own synthesis (see Discussion). A broader input dynamic range allows more precise adjustment of protein levels, since small differences in inducer concentration (due for example to experimental errors, or differences in aTc uptake among cells) have smaller effects.</p><p>In these experiments, we also measured cell-to-cell variation (CCV) in the expression of the controlled gene. Many existing inducible gene expression systems show considerable variation in expression of the controlled gene, making it difficult to achieve homogenous phenotypes at the population level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Meurer et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Elison et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Ottoz et al., 2014</xref>). In <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>C. elegans</italic>, comparison of signals from strains with different constellations of reporter genes allows quantification of different sources of variation in protein dosage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Colman-Lerner et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Pesce et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Mendenhall et al., 2015</xref>). Here, we quantified overall variation in protein dosage by measuring the Coefficient of Variation (CoV) in fluorescent output from a single reporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), and we developed a second measure called Volume Independent Variation (VIV) (explained in Appendix 2) that normalized variation in dosage with respect to a key confounding variable, cell volume, to correct for its effect on protein concentration. In VIV, we estimated cell volume by a vector of forward and side scatter signals, and calculated the remaining (Residual) Standard Deviation of the single reporter output after normalization with this estimated volume (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). By both measures, strains carrying the SR architecture showed high variation throughout the input dynamic range, with a peak around the mid-point (12 ng/mL aTc). Strains bearing the AR architecture showed low overall CCV, and no peak at intermediate aTc concentrations. This diminution of CCV in synthetic, autorepressing TetR based eukaryotic systems has previously been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Becskei and Serrano, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Nevozhay et al., 2009</xref>). In the SR architecture, variations in the amount of TetR in different cells cannot be buffered. In the AR architecture, such variations in repressor concentration are corrected for (see Discussion) and variation in expression of the controlled gene is at or around the same level as seen for constitutive expression driven by a number of native promoters (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref> for variation of commonly used promoters). This reduced cell-to-cell variation is useful for inferring single cell behaviors by observing population level responses (see Discussion).</p><p>Compared with cells bearing the SR architecture, otherwise-isogenic cells bearing the AR architecture showed increased basal expression (6.3 vs. 4.1-fold over autofluorescence background). The increased basal expression was a consequence of the fact that in the AR architecture <italic>P<sub><italic>7tet.1</italic></sub></italic> directs the synthesis of both the controlled Citrine gene and of TetR itself, so that, in uninduced cells, the steady state abundance of TetR was lower than in cells in which synthesis of TetR was driven by <italic>P<sub><italic>ACT1</italic></sub></italic>. More important, in the AR architecture, the fact that some amount of TetR expressed from <italic>P<sub><italic>7tet.1</italic></sub></italic> was needed to repress its own synthesis meant that it would not be possible to abolish <italic>P<sub><italic>7tet.1</italic></sub></italic>-driven expression of the controlled gene completely. Since ability to abolish basal expression of the controlled gene was an important design goal, we constructed strains with a third architecture, cAR, in which a different constitutive promoter drove expression of a second TetR gene in order to drive basal expression lower. Compared to otherwise-isogenic AR strains, strains expressing Citrine controlled by the cAR architecture showed reduced basal expression (4.1-fold over autofluorescence), and, compared to the otherwise isogenic SR strain, showed reduced CCV and a more gradual dose response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C&amp;D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>).

Initially, we followed an approach that increased the size and nuclear concentration of TetR by fusing it to other inert bacterial proteins and nuclear localization sequences, but this approach was not enough to abolish all basal expression (see Appendix 3).</p><p><italic>P<sub><italic>3tet</italic></sub></italic> bears <italic>tetO<sub>1</sub></italic> sites only in its UAS. The fact that <italic>P<sub><italic>3tet</italic></sub></italic> SR strains only showed weak repression (1.5-fold) suggested that TetR, and other inert derivatives described in the Appendix 3, exerted their effects on <italic>P<sub><italic>7tet.1</italic></sub></italic> mostly by their action at the <italic>tetO<sub>1</sub></italic> sites flanking the TATA sequence. We thus hypothesized that TetR derivatives that carried native, active yeast repressors might more effectively repress from sites in the UAS. The yeast repressor Tup1 complexes with Ssn6 (also called Cyc8) with a ratio of 4:1, forming a complex of 420 kDa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Varanasi et al., 1996</xref>), and this complex represses transcription through a number of mechanisms. These include repositioning and stabilizing nucleosomes to form an inacessible chromatin structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Zhang and Reese, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ducker, 2000</xref>). Tup1 also blocks chromatin remodeling, masks activation domains, and excludes TBP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Wong and Struhl, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Zhang and Reese, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Mennella et al., 2003</xref>). LexA-Tup1 fusion proteins repress transcription when bound upstream of the Cyc1 promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Tzamarias and Struhl, 1994</xref>), and TetR-Tup1 fusions reduce uninduced expression in a dual TetR activator-repressor controller (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bellí et al., 1998</xref>). For <italic>P<sub><italic>7tet.1</italic></sub></italic>, we imagined that as many as seven TetR-Tup1 dimers might bind to the promoter, potentially recruiting two additional Tup1 and one Ssn6 molecules per <italic>tetO<sub>1</sub></italic> site. The resulting ∼3mDa of protein complexes might block activation by one or more of the above mechanisms. We therefore measured the ability of a TetR-nls-Tup1 fusion to repress <italic>P<sub><italic>7tet.1</italic></sub></italic>-driven Citrine signal in SR strains. When its expression was directed from <italic>P<sub><italic>ACT1</italic></sub></italic> (Y2669), TetR-nls-Tup1 decreased uninduced fluorescence signal to background levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Because fusion of TetR to a mammalian repressor domain in mammalian cells had shown very slow induction kinetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Deuschle et al., 1995</xref>), we checked whether the TetR-nls-Tup1 fusion showed increased induction time compared to TetR alone but found no such effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Additionally, TetR-nsl-Tup1 abolished uninduced expression driven by <italic>P<sub><italic>3tet</italic></sub></italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>) (77-fold repression), compared to repression in otherwise isogenic strains by TetR, which showed basal expression reduced by only 1.5-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). By contrast, TetR-nls-Tup1 fusion repressed <italic>P<sub><italic>2tet</italic></sub></italic>, where <italic>tetO<sub>1</sub></italic> flank only the TATA sequence, more strongly than TetR alone, but still showed basal expression.

Without aTc, there was no signal above background. After induction, signal appeared within 30 min.

Direct observation of Citrine and TetR expression by Western blotting showed no expression of Citrine in absence of aTc, adjustable Citrine levels over the same input dynamic range and TetR expression synchronized with Citrine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). In all eight growth media tested, WTC<sub>846</sub><italic>::citrine</italic> expression was precisely adjustable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>), and even very high induction of the WTC<sub>846</sub> system in a strain where only the control plasmid bearing tetR and tetR-nls-tup1 was integrated (Y2761) had no significant effect on growth rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>To better characterize the system, we also measured the shutoff speed of WTC<sub>846</sub> driven expression. We reasoned that the time to observable phenotypic effect of WTC<sub>846</sub> shutoff would depend on the speed of five processes: (i) aTc diffusion out of the cell, (ii) TetR binding to its operators, (iii) aTc sequestration by newly synthesized TetR, (iv) degradation and dilution of citrine mRNA, and (v) degradation and dilution of Citrine protein. Processes i-iii would lead to the cessation of transcript production by WTC<sub>846</sub>, and their speed would be the same for all WTC<sub>846</sub> controlled genes, whereas the speed of processes iv and v determine perdurance of the gene product and will be different for different mRNAs and proteins.</p><p>To measure shutoff, we grew the WTC<sub>846</sub><italic>::citrine</italic> strain (Y2759) to early exponential phase and then induced with a high concentration (600 ng/mL) of aTc and measured fluorescence signal every 30 min in flow cytometry. Additionally, after 30, 90, 150, and 210 min, we removed, washed, and resuspended a sample in (a) medium without aTc (to shut off expression from WTC<sub>846</sub>) and (b) medium without aTc but with cyclohexamide (to shut off both WTC<sub>846</sub> and new protein synthesis). After shutoff, we expected to see an initial increase in signal, followed by decline from this peak. Increase in fluorescence after shutoff in (a) would depend on the time it took for WTC<sub>846</sub> to stop producing new mRNA (processes i-iii), the time it took for the existing mRNA to be degraded (process iv), and on continued fluorophore formation by already synthesized but immature Citrine proteins, which has a maturation time of around 30 min (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Nagai et al., 2002</xref>). Whatever increase in fluorescence in (a) observed above that baseline found after shutoff in cycloheximide (b) would be due to WTC<sub>846</sub> shutoff speed and mRNA degradation speed.</p><p>As expected, we observed an initial increase of fluorescence in the shutoff samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s8">Figure 4—figure supplement 8A</xref>), which peaked for the samples in (a) (without cycloheximide) at around 60 min. A single-cell division takes 90 min and we therefore conclude that WTC<sub>846</sub> shutoff (events i-iii) is rapid and occurs within one cell division, and likely within 30 min given that the time between Citrine production and observable fluorescence is around 30 min. Subsequent reduction in fluorescence, which fell to half after 120 min in all samples, is an estimation of process v, that is, Citrine degradation + dilution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s8">Figure 4—figure supplement 8B</xref>), and is consistent with the idea that the continued reduction in Citrine signal is caused by dilution by cell division. Overall, we conclude that WTC<sub>846</sub> shutoff is rapid, but the time required to see the phenotypic effects of the absence of the controlled gene product will primarily depend on the stability of the mRNA and expressed protein.</p><p>We also quantified the cell-to-cell variation in Citrine expression using the single reporter VIV measure for the WTC<sub>846</sub><italic>::citrine</italic> strain (Y2759) grown in YPD, and compared it to variation in a β-estradiol (LexA-hER-B112) activation based transcriptional control system we previously described, and the commonly used galactose activated P<sub><italic>GAL1</italic></sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s6">Figure 4—figure supplement 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s9">Figure 4—figure supplement 9</xref>). At increasing concentrations of aTc, VIV initially rose to 0.63 at 8 ng/mL, similar to the VIV measured for Citrine expression repressed by <italic>P<sub><italic>RNR2</italic></sub></italic>-driven TetR-nls-Tup1 in an SR strain (Y2717, RSD of 0.67, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">Figure 4—figure supplement 5</xref>). At higher aTc inputs, VIV rapidly dropped below that seen in Y70, an otherwise-isogenic autofluorescence control strain, and reached the same low level (0.18) observed for Citrine whose expression was driven by <italic>P<sub><italic>TDH3</italic></sub></italic> (Y2683). Because the autofluorescence varied so greatly, absolute VIV for cells grown in different media could not be directly compared. However, under all growth conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s7">Figure 4—figure supplement 7</xref>), VIV was highest at the similarly low concentrations of aTc and decreased at higher concentrations to the levels shown by the <italic>P<sub><italic>TDH3</italic></sub></italic>-<italic>citrine</italic> strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). We interpret the peak of VIV in the input dynamic range as arising from the fact that the WTC<sub>846</sub> architecture combines Simple Repression and Autorepression of the <italic>P<sub><italic>7tet.1</italic></sub></italic>-controlled gene (here, Citrine). At low concentrations of inducer, in the SR regime, most repression of <italic>P<sub><italic>7tet.1</italic></sub></italic> was due to the constitutively expressed TetR-nls-Tup1, and the peak VIV was similar to that found for the strain where <italic>P<sub><italic>7tet.1</italic></sub></italic> was repressed by constitutively expressed TetR-nls-Tup1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">Figure 4—figure supplement 5</xref> and see previous Results section). At higher concentrations of aTc, in the AR regime, <italic>P<sub><italic>7tet.1</italic></sub></italic> is derepressed, the concentration of TetR and the ratio of TetR to TetR-nls-Tup1 is large. At these inducer concentrations, TetR controls its own synthesis and variation is suppressed by this negative feedback, resulting in much lower cell-to-cell variation throughout the dynamic range compared to routinely used transcriptional controllers. Taken together, these results indicated that WTC<sub>846</sub> fulfilled our initially stated criteria for an ideal conditional expression system.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>WTC<sub>846</sub> alleles allow precise control over protein dosage and cellular physiology</title><p>We then assessed the ability of WTC<sub>846</sub> to direct conditional expression of endogenous genes.

These genes encoded proteins with a variety of functions: stable (Cdc28) and unstable (Cdc20 and Cdc42) cell cycle regulators, a spindle assembly checkpoint kinase (Ipl1), a metabolic regulator (Tor2), a putative oxidoreducatase (Pbr1), and a high abundance membrane proton pump (Pma1). The encoded proteins spanned a range of abundance from ∼1000 (Tor2 and Ipl1) to &gt;50,000 (Pma1) molecules per cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ho et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>We constructed strains in which WTC<sub>846</sub> controlled the expression of these genes.

To make these strains, we integrated a single plasmid-borne TetR-nls-Tup1 and autorepressing TetR construct into the <italic>LEU2</italic> locus in a BY4741 background, and replaced sequences upstream of the ATG of the essential gene with a ∼1940 bp casette carrying an antibiotic selection marker and <italic>P<sub><italic>7tet.1</italic></sub></italic>, without altering the sequence of the upstream gene or its terminator. In most cases we removed between 20 and 200 bp of the endogenous gene promoter. The cassette carried one of three different 15 bp translation initiation sequences (extended Kozak sequences; K1, K2, K3) as the last 15 bases before the ATG. These were designed to enable different levels of translation of the gene’s mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Li et al., 2017</xref>). The predicted efficiency of the sequences was K1&gt; K2&gt; K3.

Names of the genes are given on the left, which correspond to the ‘Name’ column in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> - Table S1. Spotting protocol is explained in Materials and methods. Briefly, cells were grown in liquid medium that supported growth (YPD with aTc), followed by media allowing WTC<sub>846</sub> shutoff (YPD without aTc). Cells were grown in YPD without aTc for 6 hr to allow WTC<sub>846</sub> to fully shut off and any residual gene products to be degraded or diluted. Cells were then spotted onto different plates, such that the leftmost spot on each plate had 2.25x10<sup>6</sup> cells and each subsequent spot was a 1:10 dilution. The aTc concentration in each plate is indicated below each image. 'Parent' refers to strain Y2769, which only has the <italic>P<sub><italic>7tet.1</italic></sub></italic> directed TetR and <italic>P<sub><italic>RNR2</italic></sub></italic> directed TetR-nls-Tup1 expression from the <italic>LEU2</italic> locus. Plates were imaged after 24 hr for SD, and 42 hr for YPE, S Glycerol and SD Proline. For all but one strain, no growth (as assayed both by increase in optical density of cells in spots and formation of single colonies) was observed without induction. That exception was the WTC<sub>846</sub><italic><sub>-K3</sub>::PBR1</italic> strain, which showed slight increase in optical density of the most concentrated spot, indicating very slow growth or residual protein activity. This could be either due to slow degradation kinetics of the protein upon aTc removal, or very low, residual expression even without induction. No single colonies were observed. The fact that strains bearing WTC<sub>846</sub> controlled essential genes did not grow without aTc confirms that in the absence of the inducer, these WTC<sub>846</sub> alleles are operationally nulls. In all media tested, growth as assayed by increase in density of the spot and increased frequency of formation of single colonies increased with increasing aTc concentration, indicating titratability of the protein dosage in these alleles. In one strain (i.e. WTC<sub>846</sub><italic><sub>-K2</sub>::IPL1</italic>), decreased growth at high-protein dosage was observed as indicated by lighter spots and reduced single colony formation.</p><p><supplementary-material id="fig5s1sdata1"><label>Figure 5—figure supplement 1—source data 1.</label><caption><title>Raw plate images for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>.</title></caption><media mime-subtype="zip" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-69549-fig5-figsupp1-data1-v2.zip"/></supplementary-material></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-69549-fig5-figsupp1-v2.tif"/></fig><fig id="fig5s2" position="float" specific-use="child-fig"><label>Figure 5—figure supplement 2.</label><caption><title>WTC<sub>846</sub>-driven overexpression of Ipl1 prolongs G2/M and produces cells with &gt;2 n ploidy.</title><p>We grew WTC<sub>846</sub><italic><sub>-K2</sub>::IPL1</italic> (Y2789) and an otherwise isogenic parent strain (Y2769), where Ipl1 was under the control of its native promoter, in YPD with 400 ng/mL aTc for 18 hr.

spotted serial dilutions of cultures of the final seven strains on YPD, YPE, SD, S Glycerol and SD Proline plates with and without inducer, and assessed the strains’ ability to grow into visible colonies at a single time point, at which cells of the parent strain formed colonies in all serially diluted spots (24 hr for YPD and SD, 42 hr for others.) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). On all these media, no strain formed colonies without aTc and at intermediate concentrations of aTc all strains did. This result showed that WTC<sub>846</sub> alleles can produce null phenotypes.</p><p>At high aTc concentrations, the WTC<sub>846</sub><italic><sub>-K2</sub>::IPL1</italic> strain formed colonies with lower plating efficiency than the parent strain. Ipl1 is a component of the kinetochore and is required for correct sister chromatid separation during mitosis. In mouse embryonic fibroblasts, overexpression of the orthologous Aurora B kinase causes aberrant chromosome segregation and increases duration of mitosis by activating the Spindle Assembly Checkpoint, which stops mitosis until correct spindle attachments to sister chromatids can be formed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">González-Loyola et al., 2015</xref>). In a previous study in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, however, <italic>P<sub><italic>GAL1</italic></sub></italic>-driven overexpression of Ipl1 did not decrease plating efficiency, did not cause accumulation of cells with 2 n DNA content unable to complete mitosis, and did not cause aberrant chromosome segregation as assessed by microscopy, unless Ipl1 was overexpressed simultaneously with another kinetochore component (Sli15) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Muñoz-Barrera and Monje-Casas, 2014</xref>). We asked whether WTC<sub>846</sub>-driven Ipl1 overexpression alone could cause missegregation phenotypes in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>. We cultured WTC<sub>846</sub><italic><sub>-K2</sub>::IPL1</italic> cells for 18 hr in YPD with a high concentration of aTc (400 ng/mL), and measured total DNA content in flow cytometry to assess cell cycle state. In these cultures compared to the parent with WT Ipl1, many cells were in the G2/M phase with 2 n DNA content, indicative of an inability to complete mitosis, and a significant portion of the population showed aberrant chromosome numbers above 2 n (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). That is, WTC<sub>846</sub>-driven Ipl1 overexpression in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> caused a previously undescribed phenotype, which resembled that caused by Aurora B overexpression in mammalian cells. To determine why WTC<sub>846</sub>-driven Ipl1 overexpression caused this phenotype while <italic>P<sub><italic>GAL1</italic></sub></italic>-driven overexpression did not, we compared WTC<sub>846</sub>-driven Citrine expression with Citrine driven by <italic>P<sub><italic>GAL1</italic></sub></italic> carried on a centromeric plasmid. Compared with WTC<sub>846</sub>-driven expression, centromeric <italic>P<sub><italic>GAL1</italic></sub></italic> plasmid expression was twofold lower, and cell-to-cell variation was ∼4.5-fold higher (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s7">Figure 5—figure supplement 7</xref>). Either the lower expression or the higher variation, or both, might account for the fact that <italic>P<sub><italic>GAL1</italic></sub></italic> driven Ipl1 overexpression does not result in the mammalian Aurora B phenotype in <italic>S. cerevisiae.</italic></p><p>We tested whether adjustable expression of metabolic and essential genes could be used to titrate growth rates. We constructed strains with WTC<sub>846</sub> alleles of Tor2, a low abundance, stable, essential protein necessary for nutrient signalling and actin polarization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bartlett and Kim, 2014</xref>), Pma1, an abundant, essential proton pump that regulates the internal pH of the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ambesi et al., 2000</xref>), and Tpi1, a highly abundant, non-essential glycolytic enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Fraenkel, 2003</xref>) (Y2773, 2828, 2849). We cultured WTC<sub>846</sub><italic>::TOR2</italic>, WTC<sub>846</sub><italic>::PMA1</italic>, and WTC<sub>846</sub><italic>::TPI1</italic> cells in different liquid media over a large input dynamic range of aTc, and measured growth by scattered light intensity in a growth reader as a proxy for culture density (Biolector or GrowthProfiler) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> for Tor2 and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref> for all three proteins). All strains showed distinct growth rates at different aTc concentrations. For all strains, we identified an aTc concentration that resulted in the same growth rate as the otherwise-isogenic strain bearing the native gene promoter. In order to assess whether the WTC<sub>846</sub><italic>::PMA1</italic> strain showed the expected hypomorphic phenotype of defective daughter cell separation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cid et al., 1987</xref>), we used flow cytometry and Sytox Green staining to quantify DNA content. At low aTc concentrations, cells showed an apparent increase in ploidy and cell size and microscopic observation showed that each mother had multiple daughters attached to it (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4</xref>). Observation of WTC<sub>846</sub><italic>::TOR2</italic> strains revealed a novel overexpression phenotype: at high aTc concentrations, cells bearing the higher translational efficiency <italic>TOR2</italic> allele (WTC<sub>846</sub><italic><sub>-K1</sub>::TOR2</italic>) grew more slowly than the otherwise-isogenic control parent strain with WT <italic>TOR2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3D</xref>, compare 600 ng/mL line to blue dashed line). The strain with the less efficient WTC<sub>846</sub><italic><sub>-K3</sub>::TOR2</italic> allele did not show this overexpression phenotype. These results demonstrate that researchers can adjust input to WTC<sub>846</sub> alleles to tune protein levels and different growth rates with a level of precision not achievable until now, and that the dynamic range of phenotypic outputs can be further expanded by the ability to construct WTC<sub>846</sub> alleles with alternative Kozak sequences to observe phenotypes at the two dosage extremes.</p><p>We then tested whether adjustable gene expression could precisely regulate cell size. In <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, Whi5 regulates the volume at which unbudded cells commit to a round of division and start forming buds. <italic>whi5Δ</italic> cells are smaller, and cells expressing Whi5 under <italic>P<sub><italic>GAL1</italic></sub></italic> control are larger than otherwise-isogenic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">de Bruin et al., 2004</xref>). Whi5 controls cell volume by a complex mechanism and unlike most other proteins, its abundance does not scale with cell volume (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Schmoller et al., 2015</xref>). Whi5 mRNA and protein are expressed during S/G2/M (in haploids, at about 2500 molecules), and Whi5 is imported into the nucleus in late M phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Taberner et al., 2009</xref>), where it suppresses transcription of the G1 cyclins needed to commence a new round of cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">de Bruin et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Taberner et al., 2009</xref>). During G1, as cells increase in volume, the nuclear concentration of Whi5 falls due to dilution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Schmoller et al., 2015</xref>) and slow nuclear export (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Qu et al., 2019</xref>) until a threshold is reached, after which Whi5 is rapidly exported from the nucleus, and cells enter S phase. To test whether we could control cell volume by controlling Whi5, we constructed haploid and diploid WTC<sub>846</sub><italic>::WHI5</italic> strains (Y2791, Y2929). In these strains, we expected Whi5 to be expressed throughout the cell cycle, but that import of the protein into the nucleus during late M phase, and diminution of nuclear concentration to below the threshold needed to START as cell volume increased in G1, should remain unaffected. We expected that the volume of these cells should scale with the concentration of the aTc inducer. We grew these strains along with otherwise isogenic control strains in S Ethanol to exponential phase at different aTc concentrations, and measured cell volume using a Coulter counter. Increasing Whi5 expression resulted in increasingly larger cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Without aTc, diploid WTC<sub>846</sub><italic>::WHI5</italic> cells were about the same volume as haploid controls (median 27fL vs 25fL), whereas haploid WTC<sub>846</sub><italic>::WHI5</italic> cells were only slightly smaller at 24fL. At around 10 and 12 ng/mL aTc, both haploid and diploid strains had about the same volume as controls. At full induction, both WTC<sub>846</sub><italic>::WHI5</italic> strains had a median volume of around 60fL, almost twice as large as the diploid control, yielding a more than twofold range of possible cell volumes attainable using WTC<sub>846</sub> for both haploid and diploid cells. We also calculated the CoV of cell volume to assess cell-to-cell variation of this WTC<sub>846</sub> directed phenotype. For most of the volume range, the CoV was around the same level as for the control strains with WT Whi5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s5">Figure 5—figure supplement 5A&amp;B</xref>). Both diploid and haploid cells (especially haploids) expressing high levels of Whi5 showed increased variation in volume. We quantified DNA content of the haploid strain in a high aTc concentration using Sytox staining and found an increase in the number of aneuploid cells (&gt;2n) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s5">Figure 5—figure supplement 5C</xref>). We therefore believe that overexpression of Whi5 leads to endoreplication, and the increased variation in volume at high aTc concentrations in the haploid strain originates from these endoreplicated cells.</p><p>Finally, we tested the ability of WTC<sub>846</sub> to exert dynamic control of gene expression by constructing a WTC<sub>846</sub><italic><sub>-K3</sub>::CDC20</italic> strain (Y2837) and using this allele to synchronize cells in batch culture by setting Cdc20 expression to zero and then restoring it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Juanes, 2017</xref>). Cdc20 is an essential activator of Anaphase Promoting Complex C, which once bound to Cdc20, initiates the mitotic metaphase to anaphase transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Pesin and Orr-Weaver, 2008</xref>), and is then degraded during anaphase. Upon depletion of Cdc20, for example by shift of <italic>ts</italic> strains to the restrictive temperature, or transcriptionally controlled alleles to non-inducing medium, cells arrest in metaphase with large buds and 2 n DNA content. When Cdc20 is restored by switching to the permissive condition, cells enter the next cell cycle simultaneously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Cosma et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Shirayama et al., 1998</xref>). For an investigator to be able to use WTC<sub>846</sub><italic><sub>-K3</sub>::CDC20</italic> to synchronize the cells in a culture, the investigator would need to shut off Cdc20 expression completely, and then re-express it in all the cells in a population. To test the feasibility of this, we diluted exponentially growing WTC<sub>846</sub><italic><sub>-K3</sub>::CDC20</italic> cells into YPD medium without aTc (0.5 million cells/mL) and took samples for Sytox staining and flow cytometry analysis for DNA content at fixed intervals. Within 480 min, the entire culture had arrested at the G2/M phase with 2 n DNA content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). Microscopic inspection confirmed that cells had arrested with large buds, as is expected upon a G2/M arrest. We next added 600 ng/mL of aTc. As assayed by Sytox staining and flow cytometry and confirmed by microscopy, cells then re-entered the cell cycle within 35 min and went through one cell cycle completely synchronously. Induction of WTC<sub>846</sub> is thus rapid, indicating that diffusion of aTc into the cell, and TetR unbinding of <italic>tetO</italic> are also rapid.</p><p>We also determined the arrest time of cells pre-cultured with a lower concentration (3 ng/mL) of aTc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s6">Figure 5—figure supplement 6</xref>). These cells had a lower concentration of Cdc20 before aTc was removed, and therefore required less time to reach complete arrest (∼210 min as opposed to ∼480 min). This suggests that the predominant contribution to the time to reach complete arrest is the concentration and stability of Cdc20. Given this, and the rapid shutoff kinetics of WTC<sub>846</sub> presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s8">Figure 4—figure supplement 8</xref>, we conclude that the shutoff dynamics of WTC<sub>846</sub> controlled phenotypes depend mostly on the speed of degradation of the controlled protein. Additionally, when compared to published data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Tavormina and Burke, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Cosma et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ewald et al., 2016</xref>), arrest at G2/M using the WTC<sub>846</sub><italic><sub>-K3</sub>::CDC20</italic> strain is more penetrant than that obtained using temperature-sensitive (∼25% unbudded cells) and transcriptionally controlled (∼10% unbudded) alleles of <italic>CDC20</italic>. Release is at least just as fast as that observed for the temperature-sensitive (∼35 min) and the transcriptionally controlled allele (∼40 min).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Conditional expression of genes and observation of phenotype remain central to biological discovery. Many methods used historically, such as suppression of nonsense mutations, or conditional inactivation of temperature sensitive mutations, do not facilitate titration of graded or intermediate doses of protein. More current methods for graded expression do not allow experimenters to adjust and set protein levels and show high cell-to-cell variation of protein expression in cell populations, limiting their utility for elucidating protein-dosage-dependent phenotypes. Moreover, most such methods also have secondary consequences including slowing of cell growth. In order to overcome these limitations, we developed for use in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> a 'Well-tempered Controller'. This controller, WTC<sub>846</sub>, is an autorepression-based transcriptional controller of gene expression. It can set protein levels across a large input and output dynamic range. As assessed by Citrine fluorescence readout, WTC<sub>846</sub> alleles display no uninduced basal expression, and uninduced WTC<sub>846</sub> alleles of poorly expressed proteins display complete null phenotypes. WTC<sub>846</sub> alleles also exhibit high maximum expression, low cell-to-cell variation, and operation in different media conditions without adverse effects on cell physiology.</p><p>The central component of WTC<sub>846</sub> is an engineered TATA containing promoter, <italic>P<sub><italic>7tet.1</italic></sub></italic>. We and others had shown that prokaryotic repressors including LexA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brent and Ptashne, 1984</xref>), TetR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Murphy et al., 2007</xref>), λcI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Wedler and Wambutt, 1995</xref>) and LacI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Hu and Davidson, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Figge et al., 1988</xref>) can block transcription from engineered TATA-containing eukaryotic promoters, when those promoters contain binding sites between the UAS (or, for vertebrate cells, the enhancer) and the TATA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brent and Ptashne, 1984</xref>) or downstream of or flanking the TATA. To develop <italic>P<sub><italic>7tet.1</italic></sub></italic>, we placed seven <italic>tetO<sub>1</sub></italic> TetR-binding sites in the promoter of the strongly expressed yeast gene <italic>TDH3</italic>. Two of the sites flank the TATA sequence, the other five abut binding sites for an engineered UAS that binds the transcription activators Rap1 and Gcr1. In WTC<sub>846</sub>, one instance of <italic>P<sub><italic>7tet.1</italic></sub></italic> drives expression of the controlled gene, while a second instance of <italic>P<sub><italic>7tet.1</italic></sub></italic> drives expression of the TetR repressor, which thus represses its own synthesis.</p><p>We believe that repression of <italic>P<sub><italic>7tet.1</italic></sub></italic> by TetR is due mainly to its action at the two <italic>tetO<sub>1</sub></italic> sites flanking the TATA sequence, because TetR represses a precursor promoter that only carries such sites to the same extent. The mechanism(s) by which binding of repressors near the TATA might interfere with PIC formation, transcription initiation, or early elongation remain unknown, as well as why binding of larger presumably transcriptionally inert TetR fusion proteins results in stronger repression. However, examination of the Cryo-EM structure of TBP and TFIID bound to mammalian TATA promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Nogales et al., 2017</xref>) suggests that binding of TetR and larger derivatives of it to these sites might simply block PIC assembly. Studies of repression of native <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> promoters by the <italic>en</italic> and <italic>eve</italic> homeobox proteins show that a similar, steric occlusion based mechanism can block eukaryotic transcription by binding of the repressors to sites close to the TATA sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Ohkuma et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Austin and Biggin, 1995</xref>).</p><p>In WTC<sub>846</sub>, when inducer is absent, measured basal expression of the controlled gene is abolished by a second TetR derivative, a fusion bearing an active repressor protein native to yeast. Because the same TetR-nls-Tup1 fusion protein fully represses a precursor promoter that only carries TetR operators in the UAS, we believe that the main zeroing effect of TetR-nls-Tup1 is manifested through binding the <italic>tetO<sub>1</sub></italic> sites in the UAS. Native Tup1 repressor complexes with Ssn6 (also called Cyc8) to form a 420 kDa protein complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Varanasi et al., 1996</xref>), and TetR binds DNA as a dimer. In <italic>gcr1Δ</italic> cells, in which transcription from <italic>P<sub><italic>TDH3</italic></sub></italic> is severely diminished, the native <italic>P<sub><italic>TDH3</italic></sub></italic> promoter has two nucleosomes positioned between the UAS and the transcription start site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Pavlović and Hörz, 1988</xref>). It is thus possible that in the UAS as many as five very large dimeric TetR-nls-Tup1 complexes block binding of Gcr1 and Rap1, mask their activating domains, or some combination of these, resulting in similar placement of two nucleosomes in <italic>P<sub><italic>7tet.1</italic></sub></italic>. One of these nucleosomes could then be positioned at the 294nt stretch between the UAS and the TATA sequence. It also seems possible that binding of the TetR-nls-Tup1 repressor might shift the position of the second nucleosome further downstream, so that it obscures the transcription start site.</p><p>Both the increased input dynamic range and the lower cell-to-cell variation in expression from WTC<sub>846</sub> arise from the fact that the TetR protein that represses the controlled gene also represses its own synthesis. This autorepression architecture is common in prokaryotic regulons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Smith and Magasanik, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brent and Ptashne, 1980</xref>) including Tn10, the source of the TetR gene used here, and it has been engineered into eukaryotic systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Becskei and Serrano, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Nevozhay et al., 2009</xref>). In self-repressing TetR systems, the input (here, aTc) and TetR output together function as a comparator-adjustor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andrews et al., 2016</xref>). In such systems, aTc diffuses into the cell. Intracellular aTc concentration is limited by entry. Inside the cell, aTc and TetR<sup>free</sup> concentrations are continuously compared by their binding interaction. If TetR<sup>free</sup> is in excess, it represses TetR expression, and total intracellular TetR concentration is reduced by dilution, cell division, and active degradation of DNA-bound TetR until an equilibrium determined by the intracellular aTc concentration is again reached. The consequence of this autorepression is that the WTC<sub>846</sub> requires more aTc to reach a given level of controlled gene expression than strains in which TetR is expressed only constitutively. Autorepression flattens the dose response curve, increases the range of aTc doses where a change in promoter activity can be observed, and buffers the effects of stochastic cell-to-cell variations in TetR concentration, thereby reducing cell-to-cell variation in expression of the controlled gene throughout the input dynamic range.</p><p>We further extended the output dynamic range of WTC<sub>846</sub>-controlled genes by developing three different Kozak sequences, K1, K2, and K3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Li et al., 2017</xref>), to allow controlled genes to be translated at different levels. We used these sequences to construct strains bearing conditional alleles of the essential genes <italic>CDC28</italic>, <italic>IPL1</italic>, <italic>TOR2</italic>, <italic>CDC20</italic>, <italic>CDC42</italic>, <italic>PMA1</italic>, and <italic>PBR1</italic>. These strains all showed graded expression of growth and other phenotypes, from lethality at zero expression to penetrant expression of previously reported phenotypes at higher protein dosage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Mnaimneh et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Yu et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dechant et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Muñoz-Barrera and Monje-Casas, 2014</xref>). We used controlled expression in the WTC<sub>846</sub><italic>::CDC20</italic> strain to bring about G2/M arrest followed by synchronous release, with low cell-to-cell variation in induction timing, demonstrating that WTC<sub>846</sub> can be used in experimental approaches that require dynamic control of gene expression.</p><p>Both induction and shutoff with WTC<sub>846</sub> are rapid, as both Citrine and Cdc20 expression occur within 30 min of induction, and shutoff of Citrine expression is observed within 60 min. However, time to steady state expression after induction, reached when degradation and dilution through cell division balance new synthesis, takes longer. Time to steady state will depend on the stability of the controlled protein. This is 6–7 hr for the stable protein Citrine, and the majority of yeast proteins have similar stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Wiechecki et al., 2018</xref>). Those proteins with shorter half-lives will reach steady state faster. Furthermore, we showed in WTC<sub>846</sub><italic>::IPL1</italic> strains that high level expression of this spindle assembly checkpoint kinase arrests cells at G2/M with 2 n or higher DNA content. This phenotype, thought to be due to disruption of kinetichore microtubule attachments, is displayed in mammalian cells when the homologous Aurora B is overexpressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">González-Loyola et al., 2015</xref>), but had not been observed previously in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> when Ipl1 was overexpressed from <italic>P<sub><italic>GAL1</italic></sub></italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Muñoz-Barrera and Monje-Casas, 2014</xref>). We also showed that in WTC<sub>846</sub><italic>::WHI5</italic> strains, different levels of controlled expression of Whi5 can constrain cell sizes within different limits.</p><p>Cell-cell variation in WTC<sub>846</sub>-driven expression is highest at low aTc levels, because control in this regime depends mostly on the higher variation Simple Repression by TetR-Tup1 expressed from the <italic>P<sub><italic>RNR2</italic></sub></italic>. This variation at low input doses in the WTC<sub>846</sub>represented a trade-off between the design goals of abolition of basal expression and suppression of cell-to-cell variation. The Autorepression (AR) architecture better suppressed cell-to-cell variation in controlled gene expression at low inducer inputs, but, because of the fact that TetR and the controlled gene were both under the control of the same repressible promoter, the controlled gene still showed considerable basal expression when uninduced. Given that suppression of basal expression of the controlled gene was critical to generating 'reversible null' phenotypes, we developed the AR architecture further. The resulting cAR configuration of WTC<sub>846</sub>, had low cell-to-cell variation, equivalent to the variation at the lowest expression levels that AR could achieve. Importantly, because transcription of WTC<sub>846</sub>-controlled genes is synchronized to that of the autorepressing TetR gene, transcription and mRNA abundance of WTC<sub>846</sub>-controlled genes should be steady throughout the cell cycle. This autorepressing circuitry operationally defines WTC<sub>846</sub> as an 'expression clamp', a device for adjusting and setting gene expression at desired levels, and maintaining it with low cell-to-cell variation, and so allowing expressed protein dosage in individual cells to closely track the population average.</p><p>Taken together, our results show that WTC<sub>846</sub> controlled genes define a new type of conditional allele, one that allows precise control of gene dosage. We anticipate that WTC<sub>846</sub> alleles will find use in cell biological experimentation, for example in assessment of phenotypes now incompletely penetrant due to variable dosage of the causative gene products (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Casanueva et al., 2012</xref>), and for sharpening the thresholds at which dosage dependent phenotypes manifest. We also hope that genome wide collections of WTC<sub>846</sub> alleles might enable genome wide gene-by-gene and gene-by-chemical epistasis for interactions that depend on gene dosage. In <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, recent development of strains and methods (such as the SWAP-Tag [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Weill et al., 2018</xref>]) that facilitate installation of defined N and C terminal genetic elements after cycles of mating, sporulation, and selection of desired haploids should allow generation of whole genome WTC<sub>846</sub> strains for this purpose. Epistasis screens rely on measurement of colony size on plates or culture density in liquid media. For two proteins whose effect on growth rate was identical, a one-generation difference in achievement of steady state expression could result in a twofold difference in number of cells in a colony or well, and thus in a 1.26-fold difference in colony diameter. We therefore suggest that growth rate-based assays using WTC<sub>846</sub> or any other inducible system pre-induce cells several generations before plating or pinning. WTC<sub>846</sub> alleles may find use in engineering applications such affinity maturation of antibodies expressed by yeast surface display, where precise ability to lower surface concentration should aid selection for progressively higher affinity binders. WTC<sub>846</sub> can also be a useful complement to boost the efficiency of methods that act at the protein level such as induced degradation or AnchorAway techniques. Such techniques could be used in conjunction with WTC<sub>846</sub> to achieve rapid and sustained shutoff from a well-maintained steady state level. This would also allow fast step function decreases in abundance. For example, an experimenter might simultaneously induce depletion of the product of a controlled gene by such a method while adjusting aTc downward to rapidly reset the level of an expressed protein to a new, lower level. Implementation of the WTC<sub>846</sub> control logic in mammalian cells and in engineered multicellular organisms should allow similar experimentation now impossible due to cell-to-cell variation and imprecise control.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plasmids</title><p>Information on plasmids, and promoter and protein sequences used in this study can be found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> - Tables S2 and S4.

During cloning, the insert of plasmids bearing TetR were cloned such that the insert promoter was closer to the T7 promoter and the terminator was near the T3 promoter of the backbone. In plasmids bearing Citrine, the insert was flipped onto the opposite strand, such that the insert promoter was near the T3 promoter, and the terminator near the T7 promoter. This inversion was done to avoid homologous recombination during subsequent integration of these plasmids into the same strain, since in many strains TetR and Citrine were flanked by the same promoter and the same terminator.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Strains</title><p>Strains used in this study can be found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> - Table S1.

Table S3 Oligos used in this study to create strains where WTC<sub>846</sub> controls endogenous gene expression. See Appendix 5 for the protocol used for endogenous gene promoter replacement through homology directed repair. These oligos were used in conjunction with P2375 (NatMX) or P2350 (HygMX) to create the linear PCR fragment necessary for promoter replacement, or as colony PCR oligos to confirm correct promoter replacement. Table S4 Sequences used in this study. (*) indicates a shortened t_CYC1 used to avoid homology in plasmids where there are more than one t_CYC1 sequences. (**) indicates the linker sequence used between TetR-nls and the fusion partners MBP and Tup1. (***) indicates the linker sequence used between TetR-nls and the fusion partner GST. Table S5 Parameters used to fit 5-parameter sigmoid curves to experimental data.

<italic>tetO<sub>1</sub></italic> placement and endogenous transcription factor binding sites</title><p>When creating <italic>P<sub><italic>7tet.1</italic></sub></italic>, the final promoter used in WTC<sub>846</sub>, we optimized the placement of the <italic>tetO<sub>1</sub></italic> sequences, the sequences of the endogenous Gcr1 and Rap1-binding sites, the number of these sites present in the promoter, and the TATA sequence. Our goal was to increase maximum expression from the promoter, because <italic>P<sub><italic>TDH3</italic></sub></italic> derivatives we had constructed with <italic>tetO<sub>1</sub></italic> sites had shown reduced expression. For these optimizations we used as a starting promoter <italic>P<sub><italic>4tet</italic></sub></italic>. This promoter is a variant of <italic>P<sub><italic>5tet</italic></sub></italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) from which the <italic>tetO<sub>1</sub></italic> sequence immediately upstream of the TATA was removed. <italic>P<sub><italic>4tet</italic></sub></italic> showed a higher basal expression level than <italic>P<sub><italic>5tet</italic></sub></italic>, allowing us to better observe subtle differences in basal expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1—figure 1B</xref>). We tested repression of <italic>P<sub><italic>4tet</italic></sub></italic> and derivatives in the SR architecture. We constructed the derivatives as follows. We extended the Rap1 site and the upstream Gcr1 site by one base pair (<italic>P<sub><italic>4tet.1</italic></sub></italic> and <italic>P<sub><italic>4tet.2</italic></sub></italic>), to account for the possibility that we initially truncated the endogenous binding sites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Metzger et al., 2015</xref>, replaced the downstream Gcr1 binding site with the same extended Gcr1 site (<italic>P<sub><italic>4tet.3</italic></sub></italic>), since the upstream Gcr1 binding site was closer to the reported consensus sequence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Huie et al., 1992</xref>, and tested alternative TATA sequences (<italic>P<sub><italic>4tet.4</italic></sub></italic> and <italic>P<sub><italic>4tet.5</italic></sub></italic>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Mogno et al., 2010</xref>. Four of these optimizations resulted in increased maximum activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1—figure 1B</xref>): the Rap1 site extension (<italic>P<sub><italic>4tet.1</italic></sub></italic>), replacement of the downstream Gcr1 site (<italic>P<sub><italic>4tet.3</italic></sub></italic>), and the TATA sequence optimizations (with <italic>P<sub><italic>4tet.5</italic></sub></italic> driving expression more strongly than <italic>P<sub><italic>4tet.4</italic></sub></italic>). <italic>P<sub><italic>4tet.2</italic></sub></italic> with the extended Gcr1 site showed reduced maximum expression.</p><p>We therefore chose the following modifications: the single base pair extension of the upstream Rap1 site, the replacement of the downstream Gcr1 site with the original upstream Gcr1 sequence, and the TATA sequence TATAAATA. We implemented these modifications to <italic>P<sub><italic>5tet</italic></sub></italic> to generate <italic>P<sub><italic>5tet.1</italic></sub></italic>. By the assays described in the main text for testing the other promoter derivatives, compared to <italic>P<sub><italic>5tet</italic></sub></italic>, the new promoter <italic>P<sub><italic>5tet.1</italic></sub></italic> (Y2659) showed 95% of maximum expression driven by <italic>P<sub><italic>TDH3</italic></sub></italic>, and increased repression (15 fold vs. 12 fold) with only a slight increase in basal activity when fully repressed (Y2656, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1—figure 1C</xref>). In order to increase maximum expression even further, we took advantage of previous work showing that increasing the number of transcription factor binding sites in a promoter could increase its strength <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Ottoz et al., 2014</xref>. We investigated whether adding additional Rap1 and Gcr1 sites to <italic>P<sub><italic>5tet.1</italic></sub></italic> would increase promoter activity. We created <italic>P<sub>7tet</sub></italic> by duplicating the Rap1 site, and <italic>P<sub><italic>7tet.1</italic></sub></italic> by duplicating both the Rap1 and one of the two Gcr1 sites in <italic>P<sub><italic>5tet.1</italic></sub></italic>, while keeping the same <italic>tetO<sub>1</sub></italic> placements at these duplicated sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1—figure 1C</xref>). <italic>P<sub><italic>7tet.1</italic></sub></italic> had a higher maximum activity (116% vs 99% of <italic>P<sub><italic>TDH3</italic></sub></italic> activity) and fold repression than <italic>P<sub>7tet</sub></italic> (20-fold vs 18-fold), with only minimal increase in absolute repressed activity (4.3-fold vs fourfold above autofluorescence).

One of these contributions, individual differences in general ability to express genes into proteins, contributes to phenotypic variation in genetic penetrance and expressivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Burnaevskiy et al., 2019</xref>). Quantification of this and other sources of variation benefits from ability to measure output of single cells over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Colman-Lerner et al., 2005</xref>) and, in flow cytometry, requires measurement of outputs of multiple reporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Pesce et al., 2018</xref>). Here, however, we were interested in the overall variability rather than specific sources of variability. Therefore, we only had a single reporter protein (Citrine). However single reporter studies have a major, confounding contribution to measured variation in gene expression that multi-reporter studies don’t: Fluorescent proteins in yeast are degraded very slowly unless they have degradation tags attached (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Gordon et al., 2007</xref>) and therefore, if constitutively expressed, their abundance increases over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Cookson et al., 2010</xref>). Thus, in cycling populations of budding yeast that continually express fluorescent proteins, a major source of cell-to-cell variation in fluorescent signal is that small, new-born cells have not had time to accumulate much fluorescent protein, while larger cells have. This source of variability normally affects all reporter proteins in the cell in a similar fashion, and therefore does not require correcting in multi-reporter studies. On the other hand in single reporter studies with flow cytometry in yeast, as for higher cells, this volume related variation in fluorescent protein expression is generally corrected for by gating; that is filtering the data to select only a narrow subset of cells with similar forward and side scatter, and thus volume, which increases with cell cycle progression. Such gating disregards data from the majority of the cells whose values fall outside the gated range. Here, in order to avoid discarding data, we established a single-reporter measure of cell-to-cell variation that corrects for variation due to fluorescent protein accumulation without gating.</p><p>We first established that forward and side scatter signals can be used to distinguish smaller cells from larger ones. We sorted cells on a BD FACS Aria III flow cytometer. We set different gates on the FSC and SSC signals (shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app2fig1">Appendix 2—figure 1</xref>) to collect 10 sorted sub-populations, each containing about 100,000 exponentially growing Y2683 cells. We then immediately measured (a) FSC and SSC from the collected subpopulations on a different instrument, the LSRII Fortessa LSR used for the flow cytometric measurements in this work, and (b) volume in fL with a Coulter Counter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app2fig2">Appendix 2—figure 2</xref>). The raw data acquired by the two methods can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app2fig2">Appendix 2—figure 2A,B</xref>.

This linear model allowed us to correct for the differences in cell volume and calculate the RSD of the fit as explained in the Materials and methods. This RSD value quantifies the variation in the population that is not due to differences in cell volume between the cells.

The authors aimed to meet 6 criteria in their system: (1) operation in all growth media; (2) regulation by an exogenous small molecule with minimal effect on cell function; (3) zero basal expression to obtain null phenotypes; (4) large range of precisely adjustable expression; (5) very high maximal expression; and (6) low cell-to-cell variability at any output level. The data shown indicate that they have more or less achieved these aims and that the system they describe is an advance on current methods. The logic behind the development of the system is very clearly presented, as well as its relationship to previous work. In addition, the authors place their work in a very broad historical perspective, which is unusual but much appreciated by this reviewer. Finally, they complement their description of the system (which employs a fluorescence read-out) with several case studies on a variety of different yeast genes that demonstrate its utility and highlights its advantages relative to the current state-of-the-art methods. This study thus provides an important new tool for quantitative analysis of the effect of expression level on phenotype that should be of wide interest in the yeast genetics community as a discovery tool.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this generous summary.</p><p>We note that the approach to setpoint gene regulation is general beyond yeast.

It seems to me that the AR strain (Figure 2A, and Supplementary Figure 4) displayed less cellto-cell variation than the cAR variant. Why was this strain not pursued further as an alternative for cases in which this feature might be more desirable?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this question. We should have been clearer.</p><p>Yes, the AR strain displays lower cell-to-cell variation compared to the cAR strain in Figure 2A, especially at lower doses of aTc. But this was not true for the final cAR constructions that comprise WTC<sub>846</sub> (compare Figure 4 and the AR strain in Figure 2). When comparing the AR strain in Figure 2 and the final WTC<sub>846</sub> strain in Figure 4, at lowest expression levels, cell-to-cell variation is almost the same.</p><p>There are two differences between the cAR strain presented in Figure</p><p>2 and the final WTC<sub>846</sub> strain: the former has TetR instead of TetRTup1 as the constitutively expressed element of the architecture, and more importantly, the promoter for this constitutively expressed repressor in the original cAR strain (P<sub>ACT1</sub>) is much stronger than in the final WTC<sub>846</sub> strain (P<sub>RNR2</sub>). As a consequence, the starting cAR strain constitutively expressed a much larger amount of repressor, which was not subject to the cell-to-cell variation reducing effects of the negative feedback loop. The lower constitutive expression of repressor in the WTC<sub>846</sub> strain means that a greater proportion of the cellular complement of repressor is autorepressed, and variation is suppressed.</p><p>The answer to why we pursued the cAR architecture after the experiments in Figure 2 lies in the initial criteria we had set for our ideal transcriptional controller. These are enumerated in the Introduction section. The two relevant criteria read: &quot;(3) manifest no basal expression of the controlled gene in absence of inducer, allowing generation of null phenotypes” and &quot;(6) exhibit low cell-to-cell variability at any set output…” In the case of our AR strain, we reasoned we could never fulfil criterion (3), as long as both the repressor and the controlled gene were expressed from the same TetR repressible promoter. If we wished the gene of interest to have no basal expression, then by definition TetR should have no basal expression, which would then mean there is no TetR to repress the promoters.</p><p>The cAR strain therefore embodies a trade-off between being able to supress basal expression and allowing higher cell-to-cell variation within a small portion of the dynamic range of the controller. We went with this trade-off because we judged that the ability to zero out basal expression was important for generating “reversible knockout” phenotypes, and perhaps in some synthetic biology applications where complete absence of a protein might be required for proper function of an engineered synthetic genetic circuit or to keep a kill switch off. Additionally, we went with the trade off because the means by which we would achieve it, the &quot;zeroing repressor&quot; concept, would be applicable to other WTC<sub>846</sub>-like controlled systems. As a backup, we made parts available via Addgene that enable construction of strains with the other architecture, AR, by one step cloning.</p><p>In response to the reviewer comments, we made the following changes.</p><p>Last paragraph of the Results section titled “Complex autorepressing (cAR) controller architecture expands the input dynamic range and reduces cell-to-cell variation”:</p><p>Previously the text read:</p><p>“Compared with cells bearing the SR architecture, otherwise-isogenic cells bearing the AR architecture showed increased basal expression (6.3 vs. 4.1fold over autouorescence background). […] We therefore picked this cAR architecture for our controller.”</p><p>The text in the Results section now reads:</p><p>“Compared with cells bearing the SR architecture, otherwise-isogenic cells bearing the AR architecture showed increased basal expression (6.3 vs. 4.1fold over autofluorescence background). […] We therefore picked this cAR architecture for our controller.”</p><p>We also made the following addition to the Discussion:</p><p>“Cell-cell variation in WTC<sub>846</sub>-driven expression is highest at low aTc levels, because control in this regime depends mostly on the higher variability Simple Repression by TetR-Tup1 expressed from P<sub>RNR2</sub>. […] This autorepressing circuitry operationally defines WTC<sub>846</sub> as an ”expression clamp”, a device for adjusting and setting gene expression at desired levels and maintaining it with low cell-to-cell variation, and so allowing expressed protein dosage in individual cells to closely track the population average.”</p><p>We also made the following addition to the legend in the Plasmids table (Supplementary Table 2), to make it clear that we have provided information and materials sufficient to make strains with the other architectures used in this study.</p><p>“Plasmids used in this study. * indicates plasmids available through Addgene. These plasmids are sufficient to allow construction of WTC<sub>846</sub> strains carrying the cAR architecture without any further construction. […] Construction of SR strains would require deletion of the negative feedback-controlled TetR from (P2365/2370/2371/2372/2374), and construction of AR strains would require deletion of the constitutively expressed TetR-Tup1 from the same plasmids.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Induction with the WTC<sub>846</sub> system using aTc is a relatively slow process, at least judged by the Citrine read-out (Figure 4B), taking place over &gt;360 minutes (&gt;3 cell divisions in rich medium). The authors should discuss why this is so, with reference to known transcriptional and/or translational kinetics in this complex feedback system.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for directing us to address induction or induction kinetics. We had not done so previously, partly because the story is complicated, and partly because what we knew was probative, not dispositive.</p><p>We need to distinguish between speed of induction and time to steady state. Reviewer notes that it takes &gt;3 cell divisions to reach steady state after induction. In WTC<sub>846</sub> strains, induction, judged by Citrine fluorescence signal (Figure 4B) is detected within 30 minutes after aTc addition, and the release after Cdc20 depletion (Figure 5B) occurs within 35 minutes after aTc addition. Given that induction is rather fast, why do WTC<sub>846</sub> strains require 6 hours to reach steady state? Expression of the controlled gene is synchronized to expression of the autorepressing TetR. And yet, we know that the long time to steady state is not a consequence of the autorepressing feedback, as we observe that Simple Repression (SR) configurations also require a similar length of time (6 hours) to reach steady state (See Supplementary Figure 6). This time to steady-state derepressed expression is also comparable to that for a previously described TetR based system, which depends on galactose for activation, which required around 400 minutes to reach steady state (doi: 10.1038/nature01546). This time to steady state is still short compared to activation-based systems like the β-estradiol dependent system previously constructed in our lab (doi: 10.1093/nar/gku616).</p><p>Our explanation for the long time to equilibrium is that steady state concentration of the controlled protein (Citrine) is reached when degradation of existing protein and its dilution by partition into daughter cells, balances new synthesis. Therefore, the time to steady state will depend on the stability of the controlled protein. If the half-life is longer than doubling time, steady state will be reached in 6-7 hours. If the protein has a half-life shorter than doubling time, steady state will be reached faster. Citrine is long lived and is lost mainly due to dilution by cell division (the longevity of Citrine is shown in our Supplementary Figure S25). Estimates vary as to the stability of the yeast proteome. A recent meta-analysis of 4 different datasets measuring half-lives suggests most proteins (between 50% and 85%) are just as stable and are lost mainly due to dilution by cell division (http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3155916).</p><p>Equation 1 is a simple ODE model where a protein is produced at constant rate a and lost with a lumped linear rate (dilution + degradation) d. The analytical solution (Equation 2) of this model shows that the only constant that affects the time variable is the degradation + dilution rate. Dependence on this variable is also evident in the simulations we provide in Appendix 4—figure 1, based on this model. The smaller d is, (i.e., the more stable the protein is), the longer it takes to reach steady state. On the other hand, changes in the production rate a have no effect on time to steady state, although both rates affect the maximum level as one would expect.</p><p>In order to make the distinction between induction and steady state kinetics clearer, we made the following changes in the first paragraph of the 4<sup>th</sup> subsection of results:</p><p>Old text read:</p><p>“After induction, signal appeared within 30 minutes and reached steady state within 7 hours.”</p><p>New text reads:</p><p>“After induction, signal appeared within 30 minutes. Time to reach steady state, which will be shorter for proteins that degrade more quickly (see Appendix 4), was 7 hours for the stable protein Citrine.”</p><p>We also added the simulations mentioned above as Appendix 4—figure 1, and we refer to it as seen below:</p><p>“Time to steady state depends on the stability of the controlled protein. In the experiments in Figure 4, WTC<sub>846</sub>-controlled Citrine takes around 7 hours to reach steady state concentration. […] Therefore most WTC<sub>846</sub>-controlled endogenous proteins will likely have a time to steady state around 7 hours, except those with a shorter half-life which will exhibit a shorter time to steady state.</p><p><inline-formula><mml:math id="inf4"><mml:mrow><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mo form="prefix" stretchy="false">[</mml:mo><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mo form="postfix" stretchy="false">]</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mtext mathvariant="normal">dt</mml:mtext></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mspace width="0.222em"/><mml:mo>•</mml:mo><mml:mi>P</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> 𝑃 (1)</p><p><inline-formula><mml:math id="inf5"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>[</mml:mo><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mo>]</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mfrac><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>d</mml:mi></mml:mfrac><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:msup><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> (2)”</p><p>We also made the following addition to the 7<sup>th</sup> paragraph of the Discussion:</p><p>“Both induction and shutoff with WTC<sub>846</sub> are rapid, as both Citrine and</p><p>Cdc20 expression occur within 30 minutes of induction, and shutoff of Citrine expression is observed within 60 minutes.

They should also discuss the potential implications of this for screens based upon plate measurements of single-colony growth rates or growth of robotically &quot;pinned&quot; cell cultures. They show a limited number of growth (&quot;spot&quot;) assays on solid media that would appear to indicate abrupt cut-offs for colony formation, though the data show only one time point in the growth assay and might obscure growth rate differences.</p></disp-quote><p>First, viability experiments. Our plate-based assays using WTC<sub>846</sub>, were not meant to measure growth rates but only the ability of single cells to divide and form colonies (a measure of cell viability) at a terminal time point.</p><p>The revised results text in the 3<sup>rd</sup> paragraph of the last Results section now reads:</p><p>“We spotted serial dilutions of cultures of the final seven strains on YPD, YPE, SD, S Glycerol and SD Proline plates, with and without inducer, and assessed the strains' ability to grow into visible colonies at a single time point, at which cells of the parent strain formed colonies in all serially diluted spots(24h for YPD and SD, 42h for others.).”</p><p>But this is not what the reviewer asks. We would like to see WTC<sub>846</sub> used in plate based and robotically pinned growth dependent screens. We know there are differences in time to approach steady state expression for different strains expressing different proteins from WTC<sub>846</sub> – or by any other inducible system. These differences will lead to different effects on growth rate for the first doublings on solid medium or liquid culture. This fact admits to an obvious workaround, which is to suggest that experimenters pre-induce the strains before plating cells or pinning them robotically into wells on a dish.</p><p>In response, we added wording to the last paragraph of the Discussion section about the suitability of WTC<sub>846</sub> for pinned growth rate experiments. The text now reads:</p><p>“Taken together, our results show that WTC<sub>846</sub> controlled genes define a new type of conditional allele, one that allows precise control of gene dosage.[…] WTC<sub>846</sub>- alleles may find use in engineering applications, for example in directed evolution of higher affinity antibodies expressed in yeast surface display, where precise ability to lower surface concentration should aid selection of….”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. The authors should examine shut-off kinetics, ideally by as direct a measure of RNA Pol II initiation as possible. This could be of interest in exploring the function of essential genes, for example.</p></disp-quote><p>Yes. The reason we were reluctant to explore shutoff kinetics is that it is another complex story. In WTC<sub>846</sub>, elimination of protein from the cell (which is what we care about for assessment of phenotype) depends both on shutoff of new expression and on perdurance.</p><p>We expected (and expect) that the speed of shutoff of WTC<sub>846</sub> controlled genes would be affected primarily by the rates of 3 reversible processes: aTc diffusion out of the cell, TetR binding to its operators, and sequestration of free aTc by newly synthesized TetR. These processes are fast: TetR binding and unbinding to DNA is fast (all binding sites were occupied within ~5 minutes of addition of doxycycline to a reverse TetR system in mammalian cells) (doi: 10.1038/ncomms8357 (2015)). Moreover, in the same experiment, reverse TetR started associating with specific sites seconds after addition of doxycycline, indicating that, at least in mammalian cells inducer diffusion and inducer-TetR binding are also rapid. For this reason (although it is possible that diffusion out of yeast cells might take slightly longer due to the cell wall), we expect that shutoff of WTC<sub>846</sub>-controlled phenotypes will be limited by perdurance, governed by the degradation kinetics of the mRNA and the encoded protein. Given the rapidity of induction (again, fluorescence signal after 30 minutes, Figure 4B, release from CDC20 arrest within 35 minutes, Figure 5E), we reasoned that the same reversible phenomena that govern WTC<sub>846</sub> induction (namely aTc diffusion, TetR-DNA interactions, and sequestration by newly synthesized TetR) will govern shutoff, so that shutoff of the WTC<sub>846</sub> expressed phenotype will be dominated by perdurance of the controlled gene products. The consequence would be that for controlled genes (as in Figure 5E with CDC20), the predominant factor in achieving zero protein and observing the associated phenotype in the cell upon aTc removal will be the stability of the mRNA and protein of interest.</p><p>Given the relative complexity of this explanation, in response to this reviewer we performed additional direct experiments to (a) determine how quickly WTC<sub>846</sub> stopped producing the protein of interest upon aTc removal and (b) confirm that perdurance is the predominant factor in how quickly the desired loss of function is seen.</p><p>For (a) we grew a strain in which Citrine expression was under WTC<sub>846</sub> control to exponential phase and then induced with a high concentration (600ng/mL) of aTc. We then measured fluorescence signal every 30 minutes in flow cytometry. Additionally, after 30, 90, 150, and 210 minutes, we removed, washed, and resuspended a sample from the culture in (a) medium without aTc (to shut off WTC<sub>846</sub>) and (b) without aTc but with cyclohexamide (to shut off both WTC<sub>846</sub> and new protein synthesis). After shutoff, we expected to see an initial increase in signal, followed by decline from this peak. The initial increase in fluorescence after shutoff would be due to 3 factors: the time it took for WTC<sub>846</sub> to stop producing new transcripts, the time it took for the existing mRNA to be degraded, and continued fluorophore formation by already-synthesized but immature Citrine proteins. Whatever increase in fluorescence we observed above that found in the cycloheximide sample would be due to the other 2 factors outlined above, namely WTC<sub>846</sub> shutoff speed and mRNA degradation speed.</p><p>Our results are presented as a supplementary figure in the revised submission. Shutoff of WTC<sub>846</sub> directed expression is rapid, as we see stabilization of fluorescence within 60 minutes. And assuming a ~30 minute maturation time for Citrine (since its parent EYFP matures in ~30 minutes after denaturation (https://doi.org/10.1038/nbt0102-87)), WTC<sub>846</sub> shutoff likely occurs within the first 30 minutes. These results also show that a stable protein like Citrine takes a long time to be eliminated from the cells, given that its level is halved every 90-120 minutes, consistent with dilution through cell division.</p><p>In (b), we revisited cell cycle arrest and release by Cdc20. In the original experiment in Figure 5E, arrest of the WTC<sub>846</sub>::CDC20 strain took 8 hours (See Materials and Methods). Given that CDC20 is a very unstable protein, we attributed this long time to arrest to the high aTc concentration in which we precultured the cells (20ng/mL), which likely brought about high pre-arrest concentrations of Cdc20 that took a long time to become depleted. To confirm this hypothesis, we precultured the WTC<sub>846</sub>::CDC20 strain at a much lower aTc concentration (3ng/mL) and then placed cells in medium without aTc. At this lower concentration, arrest began at 1.5 hours after removal of aTc, consistent with the shutoff time of WTC<sub>846</sub> established above, and between 3-4 hours all cells had arrested. The large difference between the arrest times of cells grown with 3 and 20ng/mL aTc, as well as the short shutoff time of WTC<sub>846</sub> [WTC<sub>846 –</sub> Citrine expression] presented above, support the notion that perdurance of protein of interest will in most cases dominate the time to complete “phenotypic” shutoff, i.e. the time needed to see the zero expression &quot;null&quot; phenotype.</p><p>We’ve included both experiments as supplementary figures (also presented here) and added the following text to the manuscript.</p><p>As the second paragraph of the Results section titled “WTC<sub>846</sub> fulfils the criteria of an ideal transcriptional controller” we added:</p><p>“To better characterize the system, we also measured the shutoff speed of WTC<sub>846</sub> driven Citrine expression. […] Overall, we conclude that WTC<sub>846</sub> shutoff is rapid, but the time required to see the phenotypic effects of the absence of the controlled gene product will primarily depend on the stability of the mRNA and expressed protein.”</p><p>And we made the following changes in the last paragraph of the Results section titled “WTC<sub>846</sub> allows precise control over protein dosage and cellular physiology”.</p><p>“Finally, we tested the ability of WTC<sub>846</sub> to exert dynamic control of gene expression by constructing a WTC<sub>846</sub>-K3::CDC20 strain (Y2837) and using this allele to synchronize cells in batch culture by setting Cdc20 expression to zero and then restoring it. […] Given this, and the rapid shutoff kinetics of WTC<sub>846</sub> presented in Figure 4—figure supplement 8, we conclude that the shutoff dynamics of WTC<sub>846</sub> controlled phenotypes depend mostly on the speed of degradation of the controlled protein.”</p><p>We also added a short comment on the speed of shutoff within the third to last paragraph of the Discussion section:</p><p>“Both induction and shutoff with WTC<sub>846</sub> are rapid, as both Citrine and Cdc20 expression occur within 30 minutes of induction, and shutoff of Citrine expression is observed within 60 minutes.”</p><p>We also adjusted our Materials and methods to explain these additional experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. The expected results for the Whi5 experiment and how they might differ from the actual findings (Figure 5D, pg. 10) are not clear and should be developed further, perhaps in the Results section itself. As the authors point out: &quot;Whi5 controls cell volume by a complex mechanism&quot;, but they don't explain what I believe is a key feature, namely that its translation does not scale with cell volume (according to the Skotheim lab), which is an unusual feature. It would be interesting to examine WTC<sub>846</sub> regulation of other genes implicated in cell size control.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the suggested clarification. We agree that the decoupling of the amount of translation from cell volume is a key feature of Whi5 control. We changed the results (6<sup>th</sup> paragraph of the last Results section). Revised text now reads.</p><p>“Whi5 controls cell volume by a complex mechanism and unlike most other proteins its abundance does not scale with cell volume. […] To test whether we could control cell volume by controlling Whi5, we constructed haploid and diploid WTC<sub>846</sub>::whi5 strains (Y2791, Y2929)…”</p><p>In terms of our results, we believe that while we alter the cell cycle stage at which Whi5 mRNA is expressed (by making it expressed continually), the nuclear import/export regulation of Whi5 remains intact. The continued import/ export regulation allows cell size regulation by Whi5 to remain functional, and so that cell volume simply scales with the amount of Whi5 expression we induce via WTC<sub>846.</sub> We clarified this point by adding the text below to the Results:</p><p>“Here, we constructed haploid and diploid WTC<sub>846</sub>::WHI5 strains (Y2791, Y2929). […] We expected that the volume of these cells should scale with the concentration of the aTc inducer.”</p><p>While we observe that the cell size scaled with aTc concentration, we also found that overexpression of Whi5 in the haploid strain led to increased cell-to-cell variation in cell volume. In order to develop this aspect of the results further, we analysed DNA content of haploid cells grown in presence of high aTc and noticed an increase in the number of cells that had &gt;2n DNA content. We believe this indicates a misregulation of the normal progression of the cell cycle, leading to endoreplication, which could then lead to the observed increase in cell-to-cell variation. We show this experiment in Figure 5—figure supplement 5. We also made the following addition to the Whi5 paragraph of the Results (6<sup>th</sup> paragraph of the subsection titled “WTC<sub>846</sub> alleles allow precise control over protein dosage and cellular physiology”):</p><p>“Both diploid and haploid cells (especially haploids) expressing high levels of Whi5 showed increased variation in volume. […] We therefore believe that overexpression of Whi5 leads to endoreplication, and the increased variation in volume at high aTc concentrations in the haploid strain originates from these endoreplicated cells.”</p><p>It will be interesting to examine WTC<sub>846</sub> regulation of other cell size control genes, and we are attempting to recruit a student to address this work.</p><p>New figure legend reads:</p><p>“(C) DNA content of the haploid WTC<sub>846-K1</sub>::WHI5 strain cells (Y2791, red) at mid-exponential phase in S Ethanol media, grown with 4 different aTc concentrations as marked on top of each plot.

In Figure 5E, it would be great to show, or at least explain clearly in the text, how the WTC<sub>846</sub>::CDC20 strain compares to the standard cdc20-ts allele used in the field.</p></disp-quote><p>We did so. We added the following text together with the relevant references to our Results section to compare our Cdc20 allele to already existing ones:</p><p>“When compared to published data, arrest at G2/M using the WTC<sub>846</sub>::CDC20 strain is more penetrant than that obtained using temperature sensitive (~25% unbudded cells) and transcriptionally controlled (~10% unbudded) alleles of cdc20. Release is at least just as fast as that observed for the temperature sensitive (~35 minutes) and the transcriptionally controlled allele (~40 minutes).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. In Discussion (pg. 10, bottom right) the authors need to show clearly that WTC<sub>846</sub> actually gives much lower cell-to-cell variation than all other current methods (at least where this has been measured).</p></disp-quote><p>We've done the best we can. When evaluating gene expression tools, cell-to- cell variation has not been routinely measured. This is possibly because all systems thus far have relied on a simple repression or activation configuration, and cell-to-cell variation has been quite high. Moreover, the best means to quantify the different contributions to cell-to-cell variation in expression require microscopic quantification of expression of two reporters in sets of hundreds of single cells tracked over time (Colman-Lerner et al. 2005) and even the best flow cytometric methods for achieving variation (Pesce 2018) involve dual reporter strains rather than the single reporter strains used here.</p><p>To address this point, we have included (in references 13, 19, 20), relevant instances in which variation in single reporter strains can be assessed. In these, cell-to-cell variation was not explicitly quantified, but induction resulted in highly variable (even bimodal) distributions of expression. One of those references is to a transcriptional controller induced by β-estradiol (LexA-hER-B112) we published previously. In response to the reviewer's direction, we quantified cell-to-cell variation in gene expression by this controller compared to expression by WTC<sub>846</sub>. The β-estradiol induced system had high cell to cell variation (&gt;0.4) throughout its entire dynamic range, whereas WTC<sub>846</sub> shows high variation only at a small portion of its dynamic range at low expression levels. Additionally, we constructed a strain where the commonly used, galactose inducible P<sub>GAL1</sub> promoter directed Citrine expression. We quantified cell-tocell variation in a dose response to galactose, where upon induction variability was always very high (&gt;0.6). We included these comparisons as a supplementary figure.</p><p>We also included the following text in our Results section (last paragraph of the section titled “WTC<sub>846</sub> fulfills the criteria of an ideal transcriptional controller”):</p><p>“We quantified the cell-to-cell variability in Citrine expression using the single reporter (ViV) measure for the WTC<sub>846</sub>::citrine strain (Y2759) grown in YPD, and compared it to variation in a β-estradiol (LexA-hER-B112) activation based transcriptional control system we previously described, and the commonly used galactose activated P<sub>GAL1</sub> promoter(Figure 4D, Figure 4—figure supplements 4, 6 and 9).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9. In the Discussion (pg. 11 top right) the authors state that &quot;WTC<sub>846</sub> alleles display no uninduced basal expression&quot; (and earlier in Results they repeated speak of &quot;abolished&quot; basal expression). I think that it would be more correct to point out, at least in the</p><p>Discussion, that WTC<sub>846</sub> alleles display no uninduced basal expression as measured here, by the Citrine fluorescent read-out. Producing null phenotypes in cases where this was not possible with previous systems is a valuable demonstration of the utility of the new method, but not a demonstration of complete repression. The authors might try to measure mRNA steady-state levels by RT-qPCR to estimate copy number per cell, and together with any information on mRNA stability, to estimate transcription rate, if they really want to pin a number on the basal expression level.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer's qualification is of course correct. Since WTC<sub>846</sub> is intended as a tool for controlling gene expression, and our functional tests with low expressed genes did not show any problematic basal expression, we opted not to further quantify mRNA, but to change the wording so that it says what we did observe. Discussion now reads.</p><p>“It can set protein levels across a large input and output dynamic range. […] WTC<sub>846</sub> alleles also exhibit high maximum expression, low cell-to-cell variation, and operation in different media conditions without adverse effects on cell physiology.”</p><p>Instead of the old text which read:</p><p>“It can set protein levels across a large input and output dynamic range. WTC<sub>846</sub> alleles display no uninduced basal expression, high maximum expression, low cell-to-cell variation, and operate in different media conditions without adverse effects on cell physiology.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10. Since one of the major potential applications of the WTC<sub>846</sub> system described here, as pointed out by the authors, is genome-wide screening, that authors should at least discuss how this might be efficiently implemented. The generation of a library of WTC<sub>846</sub> fusions to each protein-coding gene in yeast by standard methods would be extremely laborious and expensive. An alternative worth mentioning is the SWAp-Tag strategy described by Schuldiner and colleagues (Yofe et al. [2016] Nature Methods).

As the reviewer suggested, one good way to generate a library of WTC<sub>846</sub> controlled endogenous genes would be to use existing whole genome collections such the SWAP-Tag as a starting point. SWAP-Tag allows insertion of N or C-terminal sequences to most ORFs in the yeast genome by creating standard sites for homologous recombination. Generating a whole genome collection of WTC<sub>846</sub> alleles would be accomplished crossing the existing SWAP-Tag N terminal collection with a WTC<sub>846</sub> donor strain, followed by sporulation on the appropriate selective medium. We’ve therefore added a short section and the necessary references in our discussion on this subject using the text below.</p><p>Last paragraph of the Discussion previously read:</p><p>“Taken together, our results show that WTC<sub>846</sub>- controlled genes define a new type of conditional allele that allows precise control of gene dosage.

Although the authors emphasize the utility of WTC<sub>846</sub> regulation for generating precisely graded expression levels of a given protein with minimal secondary effects growth or physiology, they devoted considerable effort towards achieving maximal shut-off without much discussion of the utility of this feature. In light of anchoring and induced degradation methods that operate at the protein level to generate loss-of-function effects, the authors should consider how WTC<sub>846</sub> regulation might be a useful complement to these methods, particularly when their efficiency or rapidity is in question.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestion. WTC<sub>846</sub> could certainly a useful complement to such methods, especially in cases where rapid shutoff of expression is required together with precise dosage control. We have added this to the last part of our discussion using the text below:</p><p>“WTC<sub>846</sub> can also be a useful complement boost the efficiency of methods that act at the protein level such as auxin induced degradation or AnchorAway techniques. […] For example, an experimenter might simultaneously induce depletion of the product of a controlled gene by such a method while adjusting aTc downward to rapidly reset the level of an expressed protein to a new, lower level.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Additional comments and suggestions</p><p>1.

Although systems of this sort have been developed in yeast, they all have specific drawbacks, as clearly described here. The WTC<sub>846</sub> system described here represents a genuine improvement on current methods and is likely to be an important addition to the yeast toolbox for gene function analysis. It may also motivate similar developments in mammalian cell culture systems, and eventually in whole animals.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this assessment. Just as qualitative means to bring about conditional gene expression enabled experiments that produced important qualitative insights into cell function, so development of precise quantitative means to bring about conditional gene expression will enable better quantitative analysis of cell function. It will also enable new technical approaches such as the threshold phenotypes, epistasis approaches, and evolutionary methods mentioned above.

This system is very precise and allows for dynamic gene expression by adjusting the amount of inducer (aTc) and/or by changing the translation initiation sequences. In addition, it is equally good at being turned on and off in all the media tested and has low cellto-cell variation. The authors tested their transcriptional controller using different genes (including CDC20, IPL1, WHI5, TOR2, and others) and recapitulated various known phenotypes. They also identified a novel phenotype when overexpressing IPL1 in yeast which mimics a previously identified phenotype in mammalian cells when overexpressing Aurora B. This system will be very useful for the yeast community.</p></disp-quote><p>We also want to stress that now that we have proof of concept, we can do this in higher cells and multicellular organisms including vertebrates, which need it more.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Major comments</p><p>Are the key conclusions convincing?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Should the authors qualify some of their claims as preliminary or speculative, or remove them altogether?</p></disp-quote><p>No. They do a good job backing up their claims in their supplementary files.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Would additional experiments be essential to support the claims of the paper?

Could the authors add the pGAL1-10-IPL1 control to their WTC<sub>846</sub>-driven IPL1 overexpression experiment (Figure S17)? It might be easier for the reader to understand why the exciting phenotype the authors found was not reported before.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the suggested control. Since we believe that the WTC<sub>846</sub>::IPL1 allele manifests an overexpression phenotype because it produces more protein than P<sub>GAL1</sub> would have, replacing the promoter of Ipl1 with P<sub>GAL1</sub> would be the best control. However, since IPL1 is an essential gene, and its misregulation affects chromosomal integrity, we weren't confident we could replace its promoter with P<sub>GAL1</sub> and still achieve the right expression level to keep the cells healthy. In fact, in previously published work on IPL1, overexpression of IPL1 was achieved by introducing a P<sub>GAL1</sub>-IPL1 producing plasmid into an IPL1+ background.</p><p>To address the reviewer's concern we therefore took the same approach. We placed the P<sub>GAL1</sub> promoter upstream of Citrine in a centromeric plasmid, then grew the strain that carried the (P<sub>GAL1</sub>Citrine) plasmid in the same (Gal Raf) media used by M. MunozBarrera and F. Monje-Casas 2014, to observe effects of Ipl1 overexpression on growth rate and colony formation. The authors did not observe detrimental effects of Ipl1 overexpression in either case.</p><p>Here, we used flow cytometry to measure single cell fluorescence from the strain bearing the P<sub>GAL1</sub>-Citrine plasmid, as well as the WTC<sub>846</sub>::citrine strain grown in YPD with 400ng/mL aTc (the same concentration we used in the Ipl1 overexpression experiment).</p><p>Our results showed that the median expression level of the centromeric P<sub>GAL1</sub>-Citrine strain was approximately two fold lower than that in the integrated WTC<sub>846</sub>::citrine strain, and that it displayed much higher cell to cell variation. As measured by the single reporter cell-to-cell variation measure (ViV), P<sub>GAL1</sub>-Citrine variation was 0.9, whereas WTC<sub>846</sub>::citrine variation was only 0.19. Ipl1 overexpression phenotype does not lead to a complete arrest of growth in the entire population- some cells are affected while others are not. With PGal1 driven overexpression, overall Ipl1 level is lower compared to WTC<sub>846</sub> driven overexpression. Additionally, due to high cell-to-cell variability only a handful of cells are actually expressing Ipl1 at this level, which would have made it difficult to observe the growth arrest/delay phenotype that is already not a uniform phenotype in the population. Therefore, we believe the combination of lower expression and higher cell-to-cell variation in the P<sub>GAL1</sub>-Citrine strain likely accounts for the failure of Munoz-Barrera and Monje-Casas to observe a growth arrest phenotype.</p><p>We present the results in Figure 5—figure supplement 7. We explain the results in additional sentences at the end of the 4<sup>th</sup> paragraph of the Results section titled “WTC<sub>846</sub> alleles allow precise control over protein dosage and cellular physiology“.</p><p>The paragraph in the main text now reads:</p><p>“At high aTc concentrations, the WTC<sub>846</sub>-K2:IPL1 strain formed colonies with lower plating efficiency than the parent strain.

One about Figure S7, the other about clarifying the essential endogenous gene promoter replacement protocol we used. We address these two points separately below.</p><p>First. We thank the reviewer for the suggestion about Figure S7. In Figure S7, inclusion of the unrepressed promoter fluorescence curves would widen the x-axis range we need to show, and therefore would make it more difficult for the reader to perceive the small differences between the repressed expression of P<sub>2tet</sub> and P<sub>3tet</sub> compared to the autofluorescence. Therefore, given that the focus of this supplementary figure is narrowly on the repressed expression, we believe it is best to omit the unrepressed expression curves in this figure.</p><p>It is important to note that, although P<sub>3tet</sub> is weaker than P<sub>2tet</sub>, this fact is not the only reason that P<sub>3tet</sub> shows a lower level of repressed expression. Unrepressed P<sub>2tet</sub> is 1.14 times stronger than P<sub>3tet</sub> (data from main figure 1). However, when repressed, P<sub>2tet</sub> expression is 1.38 higher than that for P<sub>3tet</sub>. This suggests that promoter strength is not the explanation for the lower repressed expression from P<sub>3tet</sub>. To emphasize this point, in response to the reviewer direction, we added fold comparison numbers to the figure legend.</p><p>The new text in the figure legend of Supplementary Figure 7 reads as follows:</p><p>“For comparison, repressed expression in the P<sub>2tet</sub> strain (Y2662) was 1.38 fold higher than in the P<sub>3tet</sub> strain (Y2702), even though the expression in the unrepresssed P<sub>2tet</sub> strain was only 1.14 fold more than P<sub>3tet</sub>. This fact shows that, even given the difference in promoter strength, P<sub>3tet</sub> is repressed more effectively than P<sub>2tet</sub>.”</p><p>Second, we thank the reviewer for the suggested clarification to the strain generation protocol. We changed the main text to indicate that the strains were generated by replacing the promoter of the endogenous gene in cells growing in medium containing aTc., using the text presented below:</p><p>“We constructed strains in which WTC<sub>846</sub> controlled the expression of these genes by replacing the promoter of the endogenous gene. Before transformation the cells were grown in liquid medium containing aTc, and then plated on solid medium containing aTc (see Supplementary Materials for a detailed protocol).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Significance (Required)):</p><p>Describe the nature and significance of the advance (e.g. conceptual, technical, clinical) for the field.
