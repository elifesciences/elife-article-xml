therapies. PDAC patients are frequently affected by cachexia characterized by muscle mass and strength loss (sarcopenia) contributing to patient frailty and poor therapeutic response. This study assesses the mechanisms underlying mitochondrial remodeling in the cachectic skeletal muscle, through an integrative exploration combining functional, morphological, and omics-based evaluation of gastrocnemius muscle from KIC genetically engineered mice developing autochthonous pancreatic tumor and cachexia. Cachectic PDAC KIC mice exhibit severe sarcopenia with loss of muscle mass and strength associated with reduced muscle fiber’s size and induction of protein degradation processes. Mitochondria in PDAC atrophied muscles show reduced respiratory capacities and structural alterations, associated with deregulation of oxidative phosphorylation and mitochondrial dynamics pathways. Beyond the metabolic pathways known to be altered in sarcopenic muscle (carbohydrates, proteins, and redox), lipid and nucleic acid metabolisms are also affected. Although the number of mitochondria per cell is not altered, mitochondrial mass shows a twofold decrease and the mitochondrial DNA threefold, suggesting a defect in mitochondrial genome homeostasis. In conclusion, this work provides a framework to guide toward the most relevant targets in the clinic to limit PDAC-induced cachexia.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>pancreatic cancer</kwd><kwd>cachexia</kwd><kwd>muscle wasting</kwd><kwd>energy metabolism</kwd><kwd>mitochondria</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-18-CE45-0016-03</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Habermann</surname><given-names>Bianca H</given-names></name><name><surname>Giannesini</surname><given-names>Benoit</given-names></name><name><surname>Carrier</surname><given-names>Alice</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Pancreatic cancer-associated muscle atrophy is characterized by strong mitochondrial metabolic defects that are not limited to carbohydrate, protein, and redox metabolism, but also concern lipid and nucleic acid metabolisms.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Pancreatic cancer has a very poor prognosis and the lowest 5-year relative survival rate (11%) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Siegel et al., 2022</xref>). It is the third-leading cause of cancer deaths and is expected to become the second by 2026 due to its increasing incidence and resistance to therapies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nevala-Plagemann et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rahib et al., 2021</xref>). Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is the most common form of pancreatic cancer. More than 80% of PDAC patients are cachectic at the time of diagnosis, having lost body weight due to melting of metabolic organs, adipose tissue, and muscles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hendifar et al., 2018</xref>). Cancer-induced cachexia is a frequent debilitating muscle wasting syndrome characterized by lean body mass loss, muscle and adipose tissues loss, altered body metabolism, and inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Baracos et al., 2018</xref>). It is often irreversible and a sure sign of increased mortality and morbidity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fearon et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Stubbins et al., 2020</xref>). PDAC-induced cachexia contributes significantly to the overall weakness of patients which hinders their clinical management and increases morbidity and mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mintziras et al., 2018</xref>). In this context, the limitation of patients’ cachexia through nutritional support - diet and physical activity - is an approach increasingly developed in cancer hospitals. However, the development of nutritional strategies is limited by the poor knowledge of the mechanisms linking nutrition, cachexia, and cancer. In addition, the knowledge of biomarkers to identify the patients that would benefit from nutritional strategies is required.</p><p>Exploration of the mechanisms underlying muscle wasting (sarcopenia) is done mostly in the aging context, nevertheless some insights were obtained in the recent years in cancer cachexia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Argilés et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Argilés et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Argilés et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Baracos et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Biswas and Acharyya, 2020</xref>). As in aging, the main mechanism underlying cancer sarcopenia is alterations in amino acid and protein metabolism, comprising increased muscle protein degradation (proteolysis) and impaired muscle protein synthesis. The tumor-associated systemic inflammation is one of the cancer characteristics promoting the activation of protein catabolism in skeletal muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">VanderVeen et al., 2017</xref>). Dysfunction of mitochondria also contributes to changes in muscle metabolism in cancer-induced cachexia in patients and mouse models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Beltrà et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">de Castro et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Dolly et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">van der Ende et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">VanderVeen et al., 2017</xref>). As the energy powerhouses of cells, mitochondria are instrumental in body organs homeostasis and function in general, and in skeletal muscle in particular since contraction to assure mobility is highly energy consuming. Beyond ATP production, mitochondria are a hub in nutrients metabolism, cell signaling, and cell death, thus controlling cell life-death balance. Dysfunctional mitochondria are observed in many pathologies that are not restricted to muscular diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Annesley and Fisher, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Murphy and Hartley, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Russell et al., 2020</xref>). In cancer cachexia, alterations in quantity and quality of mitochondria were reported in sarcopenic muscle, due to decreased biogenesis, increased mitophagy, altered dynamics (fusion and fission), and reduced energy metabolism through impairment of mitochondrial metabolism and respiration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Beltrà et al., 2021</xref>). This latter promotes production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by the respiratory chain, increasing the inflammation-associated oxidative stress which damages mitochondria, leading to a vicious circle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Penna et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zhang et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p>Despite the central role of mitochondria in the physiopathology of skeletal muscle, their involvement in PDAC-induced muscle wasting was not addressed to date. Furthermore, their role in cancers gained increased attention only recently, with the now-well admitted demonstration of their key role in cancer cell metabolic reprogramming, aberrant proliferation, survival, and resistance to therapies. Our laboratory showed that mitochondrial metabolism is reprogrammed in PDAC tumor cells and constitutes a vulnerability opening novel therapeutic avenues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abdel Hadi et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Masoud et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Reyes-Castellanos et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Reyes-Castellanos et al., 2020</xref>). Nevertheless, mitochondria still have to be explored in the tumor microenvironment and distant metabolic organs. Skeletal muscle inflammation is a common feature observed in PDAC mouse models with systemic low-grade inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gilabert et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Michaelis et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhu et al., 2019</xref>). We thus made the hypothesis that the chronic inflammatory state induced by the pancreatic tumor could impact on skeletal muscle potentially through mitochondrial stress and dysfunction.</p><p>The objective of the present preclinical study was to investigate the mitochondrial remodeling in PDAC muscle, and decipher the underlying molecular mechanisms. Our study focused on the gastrocnemius muscle of the KIC genetically engineered mice developing spontaneously a PDAC associated with cachexia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aguirre et al., 2003</xref>), by implementing different technical approaches to provide a comprehensive description of PDAC-associated mitochondrial features in sarcopenic muscle. This study led to the demonstration of profound alterations of mitochondrial function, structure, and gene expression in PDAC muscle, that could be used in the future to identify new PDAC-associated cachexia biomarkers and targets in the clinic.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The sarcopenia is severe in cachectic KIC PDAC mice</title><p>KIC mice, in which the constitutively active mutant <italic>Kras</italic> oncogene is expressed and the tumor suppressor <italic>Ink4a</italic> is deleted, both specifically in the pancreas, spontaneously develop PDAC and associated cachexia within 9–11 weeks of age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aguirre et al., 2003</xref>).

We found that muscle volume calculated from MR images was lower in KIC mice at 9–11 weeks of age (bearing a tumor) when compared to age-matched controls (21% decrease) as well as to 7- to 8-week-old (pre-tumoral) KIC mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). This muscle volume loss, which is similar to weight loss (–28%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), was associated with an almost proportional reduction of the absolute tetanic force which represents the maximal muscle capacity for producing force (–16%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). The specific tetanic force, calculated by scaling the absolute tetanic force to muscle volume, did not differ between KIC and controls at 9–11 weeks of age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), hence indicating that the reduction in absolute tetanic force was fully accounted by muscle loss.

The corresponding changes in phosphocreatine (PCr) and pH over the course of time and quantifications are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C and D</xref>. At rest, there were no differences among phenotypes and ages for PCr level and pH, which indicates that the presence of tumor did not affect the basal bioenergetics status. However, we found that the time constant of post-exercise PCr resynthesis (τPCr) was 43% longer in KIC bearing a tumor compared to age-matched controls. Given that τPCr during the post-exercise recovery relies exclusively on oxidative ATP synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kemp et al., 2015</xref>), the longer τPCr reveals that the presence of tumor did alter the mitochondrial function in vivo. Accordingly, we found that the maximal oxidative capacity, calculated as the ratio between basal PCr and τPCr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Prompers et al., 2014</xref>), was lower in KIC mice (–31%). It should be noted that the end-exercise PCr level, which reflects the metabolic stress in response to exercise activity, was similar in both phenotypes at 9–11 weeks of age. These data suggest that the tumor-induced mitochondrial defect would not impair energy supply in exercising muscle, through the compensation of the potent limitation of oxidative ATP production in 9- to 11-week-old KIC mice by another metabolic pathway. In this sense, we observed that the pH value at the end of the 6 min exercise was lower in KIC mice bearing a tumor compared to age-matched controls, thus suggesting that the tumor accelerates the glycolytic flux. Collectively, these data show a loss of gastrocnemius strength and lower ATP production by oxidative capacities in exercising KIC PDAC muscle in vivo, indicating defective mitochondria in the skeletal muscle of PDAC-bearing mice.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Mitochondrial function and homeostasis are profoundly affected in KIC muscles</title><p>Decrease of oxidative activity in cancer KIC muscle shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> (muscle from 9- to 11-week-old mice bearing a tumor) was further investigated by Seahorse oxygraphy on isolated mitochondria.

Cachexia in tumor-bearing KIC mice is characterized by almost complete disappearance of the gonadal adipose tissue and loss of mass (weight and volume) and strength in gastrocnemius muscle, consistent with the previously reported tissue wasting in PDAC mouse models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Danai et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Michaelis et al., 2017</xref>). Muscle mass loss is associated with a diminution in muscle fiber’s size, which is a common feature in cancer muscle wasting studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Johns et al., 2013</xref>). In contrast, no significant changes in the number and type of fibers were observed, in agreement with the fact that not all studies have demonstrated type 1 and 2 fiber differences in cancer muscle wasting studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Johns et al., 2013</xref>). Fibers’ size reduction is due to decreased protein synthesis and increased proteolysis, the latter involving the proteasome and autophagy protein degradation processes. Accordingly, we evidenced induction in KIC muscle of the E3 ubiquitin ligase MuRF1 (RNA and protein) and MAFBx (RNA) involved in the proteasomal protein degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Argilés et al., 2014</xref>). We also found upregulation of the <italic>Sqstm1</italic> gene encoding p62 involved in autophagy, as expected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">VanderVeen et al., 2017</xref>). The detailed analysis of gastrocnemius muscle bioenergetics by noninvasive multimodal MR demonstrates lower ATP production by oxidative capacities in KIC PDAC mice that is at least partly compensated by increased glycolysis, which could account for apparently normal muscle activity during exercise. MR data point to dysfunctional mitochondria in the skeletal muscle of PDAC-bearing mice, which was confirmed by oxygraphy (Seahorse) experiments performed on isolated mitochondria, showing a large reduction of mitochondrial respiration in KIC muscle likely as the result of decreased respiratory complexes activity and abundance. Finally, we observed important modifications in the size and shape of mitochondria in PDAC muscle with the presence of elongated mitochondria in accordance with the relation between mitochondrial function and structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Bulthuis et al., 2019</xref>), and decreased mitochondrial mass without any change in the total number of mitochondria. Collectively, these data demonstrate profound quantitative and qualitative alterations of mitochondria in pancreatic cancer muscle.</p><p>The major originality of this study is the deep deciphering of mitochondrial molecular changes at the transcriptomic and proteomic level, providing a large quantity of data that improve the knowledge of mitochondrial dysfunction in PDAC cachexia.</p><p>As expected, metabolism of amino acids and glycolysis were among the most dysregulated pathways in PDAC cachectic muscle, consistent with the overall altered protein metabolism and loss of OXPHOS function, respectively. Redox metabolism was also found to be altered, which has to be related to deregulation of the inflammatory response shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s4">Figure 7—figure supplement 4</xref> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">VanderVeen et al., 2017</xref>). Increased expression of multiple ROS defense genes is consistent with oxidative stress prone to affect mitochondrial macromolecules and homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Penna et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zhang et al., 2023</xref>). It should be noted that the proteins involved in antioxidant defense are, on the contrary, downregulated, suggesting their defective production to fight against oxidative stress. Collectively, these data strongly support that the main molecular alterations in KIC mitochondria are related to energy and redox metabolisms; importantly, these metabolisms are closely linked in a vicious circle, with ROS damaging mitochondria and, in turn, dysfunctional OXPHOS promoting oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Penna et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zhang et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p>Regarding mitochondrial dynamics, we looked at proteins involved in mitochondrial fusion (Mitofusins 1 and 2 and OPA1) and fission (DRP1 and FIS1). We found a slight decrease of both <italic>Opa1</italic> and <italic>Drp1</italic> gene expression in KIC muscle (no difference for <italic>Mfn1</italic>, <italic>Mfn2</italic>, and <italic>Fis1</italic>). In contrast, we found the proteins OPA1 and Mitofusin1+2 as upregulated in KIC muscle by western blotting, suggesting that transcriptomic and proteomic modifications of molecules involved in mitochondrial fusion are not related. Regarding mitophagy, the genes <italic>Bnip3</italic>, <italic>Bnip3l</italic>, and <italic>Pink1</italic> were found downregulated in KIC muscle. One could imagine the occurrence of mitochondrial hyperfusion in the KIC context as a compensatory mechanism allowing to maintain (rather badly than well…) the functioning of mitochondria in this muscle in full catabolism, and also perhaps to preserve the mitochondria from degradation by autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gomes et al., 2011</xref>). Finally, the genes encoding PGC1α and PGC1β involved among other roles in mitochondrial biogenesis were strongly down-expressed as expected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Penna et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">VanderVeen et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Major novelties revealed by this study concern the lipid and nucleotide metabolisms. Lipid metabolism pathways were found to be downregulated in KIC muscles and mitochondria, which has to be related to the stringent loss of fat mass in cachectic KIC mice and the physiological role of fatty acid in mitochondrial respiration via fatty acid oxidation (FAO). Interestingly, it was reported that excessive FAO induces muscle atrophy in cancer cachexia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fukawa et al., 2016</xref>), suggesting that early deregulation of mitochondrial lipid metabolism could be involved in triggering muscle atrophy in PDAC. This remains to be investigated. In addition, several pathways of DNA metabolism, such as DNA damage, degradation of DNA, nucleotide synthesis, and folate pathway (involved in purines and pyrimidines synthesis), were found deregulated, suggesting a certain level of DNA instability affecting the mitochondrial genome. Interestingly, the decrease of mtDNA in KIC muscle was even larger than the decrease in mitochondrial mass as measured by protein content, suggesting altered mitochondrial genome homeostasis in PDAC-induced sarcopenia, as has been reported in age-related sarcopenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Barbieri et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rygiel et al., 2016</xref>). It would be interesting to further investigate the interactions between mtDNA alterations and redox and nucleotide metabolism, in the context of a growing understanding of the importance of ROS and mtDNA released during the inflammatory response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Barnett et al., 2023</xref>). In sum, the large amount of data generated by this study provides a wealth of information for the identification of new gene and protein markers of cachexia associated with pancreatic cancer.</p><p>A transcriptomic analysis of PDAC cachectic muscle was reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">van der Ende et al., 2018</xref>) using the gene expression microarrays data generated on biceps femoris muscle from KIC mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gilabert et al., 2014</xref>). It highlighted decreased expression of genes involved in mitochondrial fusion, fission, ATP production, and mitochondrial density, and increased expression of genes involved in ROS detoxification and mitophagy. We observed these same gene modulations in the same direction in KIC gastrocnemius. In a notable way, we have here largely completed this preliminary study by integrating transcriptomic and proteomic data in cachectic muscle, and by revealing a large number of modulated mitochondrial genes. Importantly, integrating the transcriptome and proteome in KIC muscle showed several common pathways that are deregulated during cachexia, suggesting that considering transcriptome only (for which diagnostic tools are available in the clinic) would be relevant in further studies. Importantly, in major pathways, deregulation of genes in one direction (up or down) can be the opposite for the corresponding protein (down or up, respectively). This is consistent with the fact that for one gene, mRNA level (related to gene transcription rate and RNA stability) is not obligatory correlated with protein level (related to translation rate and protein stability) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Liu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Piccirillo et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>The first limitation of this study is the use the KIC PDAC model which is fast (9–11 weeks) compared to human pathology. Nevertheless, this model is indicative of common molecular pathways involved in cachexia in human and mouse; for example, disruption of mitochondrial morphology and decrease of mtDNA were also observed in the skeletal muscle of cachectic patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">de Castro et al., 2019</xref>). Second, we used only male mice, yet some mechanisms of pancreatic cancer cachexia are sex specific (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zhong et al., 2022</xref>). We postulated that mitochondrial alterations would be similar in males and females, but this question remains to be addressed. Third, this study is lacking molecular data concerning mitochondria in pre-cachectic KIC muscle before the tumor-induced cachexia, that we monitored with noninvasive multimodal MR measurements (7- to 8-week-old [pre-tumoral] KIC mice in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). It will be very interesting to know whether mitochondrial defects happen before the start of muscle atrophy in PDAC, and initiate sarcopenia as demonstrated in other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Alway et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Brown et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Waltz et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, this work demonstrates that muscle atrophy is associated with strong mitochondrial metabolic defects that are not limited to carbohydrates and proteins, but also concern lipids and nucleic acids. It presents important translational perspectives in the clinic considering that mitochondrial dysfunction was also observed in cachectic cancer patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">de Castro et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Dolly et al., 2022</xref>). Therefore, our data provide a frame to guide toward the most relevant molecular markers that would be affected during tumor development and could be biomarkers of PDAC cachexia. Inhibiting oxidative stress to reverse muscle wasting is a strategy currently under development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Penna et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zhang et al., 2023</xref>), but it is important to also consider the other side of oxidative stress, which drives the therapeutic response to chemo- and radiotherapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abdel Hadi et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>). In addition, our study points to the mitochondrial lipid metabolism as a promising target in PDAC cachexia, which was already suggested in other cancers with FAO inhibition by etomoxir (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fukawa et al., 2016</xref>) or trimetazidine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gatta et al., 2017</xref>). Further investigation in this line is required, following our own data using the FAO inhibitor perhexiline which is able to cure chemotherapy-resistant tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Reyes-Castellanos et al., 2023</xref>) and has potential added benefit to limit chemotherapeutics toxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dhakal et al., 2023</xref>). Another promising approach against muscle wasting in the clinic is physical activity which has multiple beneficial effects: maintenance of tumor mass, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and increase in mitochondrial quantity and quality, in line with the need for multimodal management of cachectic cancer patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Barbieri et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Beltrà et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Penna et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rygiel et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Stubbins et al., 2020</xref>).</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Innovation</title><p>Mitochondrial dysfunction is a well-established feature of cachexia but was not explored in PDAC-induced sarcopenia.

A piece of each organ and one gastrocnemius muscle were fast frozen in isopentane cooled on dry ice, and stored at −80°C for RNA and protein analysis. Considering that oxidative and glycolytic fibers are unevenly distributed in the gastrocnemius muscle, we paid particular attention to always using the same portion of the muscle for further molecular analyses. The second gastrocnemius muscle was used to extract mitochondria ex vivo for oxygraphy experiments (whole to avoid biases related to uneven distribution of oxidative and glycolytic fibers as explained before), or fast frozen and stored at −80°C for histological analysis.

The gastrocnemius muscle was chosen because it is easily accessible for MR antenna and preferentially activated using our methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Giannesini et al., 2010</xref>). Investigations were performed with a homebuilt cradle designed to be operational inside the 7-Tesla horizontal magnet of a preclinical 70/16 PharmaScan MR scanner (Bruker, Karlsruhe, Germany). This cradle is similar to that described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Giannesini et al., 2010</xref>). Briefly, it allows (i) to elicit contraction of the left gastrocnemius muscle by transcutaneous electrostimulation, (ii) to measure the resulting contractile force with a dedicated ergometer composed of a foot pedal coupled to a force transducer, (iii) to perform multimodal MR measurements, and (iv) to maintain prolonged anesthesia by gas inhalation (1.5–2% isoflurane mixed in air) with monitoring of breath rate and regulation of the animal’s body temperature at physiological level throughout a feedback loop. Fourteen consecutive non-contiguous axial slices (1 mm thickness; 0.25 mm spaced) covering the whole left hindlimb were selected. Rapid acquisition relaxation-enhanced images of these slices (8 echoes; 5000 ms repetition time; 35 ms TE; 20×20 mm<sup>2</sup> field of view; 0.078×0.078 mm<sup>2</sup> spatial resolution) were acquired at rest. Muscle function was evaluated throughout a tetanic electrostimulation train (150 Hz; 0.5 s duration) and during a bout of exercise consisting in 6 min of repeated isometric contractions electrically induced at a frequency of 1 Hz. Contractile force was recorded and processed using the Powerlab 35 series system driven by the LabChart v8.1 software (AD Instruments, Oxford, UK). The digital signal was converted to force according to a linear calibration curve and expressed in N. <sup>31</sup>P-MR spectra (15 accumulation; 2000 ms repetition time) from the gastrocnemius muscle region were continuously acquired at rest (4 min), during the 6 min exercise bout, and during the following 16 min recovery period. MR data were processed using custom software code written in Python. For each MR image, region of interest was manually outlined so that the corresponding cross-sectional area of the gastrocnemius muscle was measured.

Briefly, 15 µg of each lysate prepared from muscle was loaded on NuPAGE 4–12% Bis-Tris acrylamide gels (Life Technologies) and run at 80 V for 8 min to stack proteins in a single band. Bands were cut from the gels following Imperial Blue staining (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and were submitted to a classical in-gel trypsin digestion after protein reduction and cysteine alkylation with iodoacetamide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Shevchenko et al., 1996</xref>).

For each run, peptides were first concentrated on a pre-column (C18 PepMap100, 2 cm × 100 µm I.D., 100 Å pore size, 5 µm particle size) and washed in water containing 0.1% trifluoracetic acid. In a second step, peptides were separated on a reverse phase LC EASY-Spray C18 column (PepMap RSLC C18, 50 cm × 75 µm I.D., 100 Å pore size, 2 µm particle size) at 300 nL/min flow rate with the following parameters: after column equilibration using 3% of solvent B (20% water - 80% acetonitrile - 0.1% formic acid), peptides were eluted from the analytical column by a two-step linear gradient (2.4–22% acetonitrile/H<sub>2</sub>O; 0.1% formic acid for 130 min and 22–32% acetonitrile/H<sub>2</sub>O; 0.1% formic acid for 15 min). MS analysis was performed following peptide ionization in the EASY-Spray Nano-source in front of the Orbitrap Fusion Lumos Tribrid under a spray voltage set at 2.2 kV and the capillary temperature at 275°C.

For internal mass calibration the 445.120025 ion was used as lock mass. The more abundant precursor ions were selected and collision-induced dissociation fragmentation was performed in the ion trap to have maximum sensitivity and yield a maximum amount of MS/MS data. Number of precursor ions was automatically defined along run in 3 s windows using the ‘Inject Ions for All Available parallelizable time option’ with a maximum injection time of 300 ms.

Quantifiable proteins were defined as those detected in above 70% of samples in one condition or more. Protein LFQ normalized intensities were base 2 logarithmized to obtain a normal distribution. Missing values were replaced using data imputation by randomly selecting from a normal distribution centered on the lower edge of the intensity values that simulates signals of low abundant proteins using default parameters (a downshift of 1.8 standard deviation and a width of 0.3 of the original distribution).

The study builds upon and extends previous findings that implicate mitochondrial defects in the pathophysiology of cancer cachexia. The authors demonstrate that while the total quantity of mitochondria from skeletal muscles of mice with pancreatic cancer cachexia is similar to controls, mitochondria were elongated with disorganized cristae, and had reduced oxidative capacity. The mitochondrial dysfunction was not associated with exercise-induced metabolic stress (insufficient ATP production), suggesting compensation by glycolysis or other metabolic pathways. However, mitochondrial dysfunction can lead to increased production of ROS/oxidative stress and would be expected to interfere with carbohydrate and lipid metabolism, events that are linked to cancer-induced muscle loss. The data are convincing and were collected and analyzed using state-of-the-art techniques, with unbiased proteomics and transcriptomics analyses supporting most of their conclusions.</p><p>Additional Strengths:</p><p>The authors utilize a genetically engineered mouse model of pancreatic cancer which recapitulates key aspects of human PDAC including the development of cachexia, making the model highly appropriate and translational.</p><p>The authors perform transcriptomic and proteomics analyses on the same tissue, providing a comprehensive analysis of the transcriptional networks and protein networks changed in the context of PDAC cachexia.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The authors refer to skeletal muscle wasting induced by PDAC as sarcopenia. However, the term sarcopenia is typically reserved for the loss of skeletal muscle mass associated with aging.</p><p>In Figure 2, the MuRF1 IHC staining appears localized to the extracellular space surrounding blood vessels and myofibers-which causes concern as to the specificity of the antibody staining. MuRF1, as a muscle-specific E3 ubiquitin ligase that degrades myofibrillar proteins, would be expected to be expressed in the cytosol of muscle fibers.</p><p>Disruptions to skeletal muscle metabolism in PDAC mice are predicted based on mitochondrial dysfunction and the transcriptomic and proteomics data. The manuscript could therefore be strengthened by additional measures looking at skeletal muscle metabolites, or linking the findings to previous work that has looked at the skeletal muscle metabolome in related models of PDAC cachexia (Neyroud et al., 2023).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.93312.2.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The present work analyzed the mitochondrial function and bioenergetics in the context of cancer cachexia induced by pancreatic cancer (PDAC). The authors used the KIC transgenic mice that spontaneously develop PDAC within 9-11 weeks of age. They deeply characterize bioenergetics in living mice by magnetic resonance (MR) and mitochondrial function/morphology mainly by oxygraphy and imaging on ex vivo muscles. By MR they found that phosphocreatine resynthesis and maximal oxidative capacity were reduced in the gastrocnemius muscle of tumor-bearing mice during the recovery phase after 6 minutes of 1 Hz electrical stimulation while pH was reduced in muscle during the stimulation time. By oxygraphy, the authors showed a decrease in basal respiration, proton leak, and maximal respiration in tumor-bearing mice that was associated with the decrease of complex I, II, and IV activity, a reduction of OXPHOS proteins, mitochondrial mass, mtDNA, and to several morphological alterations of mitochondrial shape. The authors performed transcriptomic and proteomic analyses to get insights into mitochondrial defects in the muscles of PDAC mice. By IPA analyses on transcriptomics, they found an increase in the signature of protein degradation, atrophy, and glycolysis and a downregulation of muscle function. Focusing on mitochondria they showed a downregulation mainly in OXPHOS, TCA cycle, and mitochondrial dynamics genes and upregulation of glycolysis, ROS defense, mitophagy, and amino acid metabolism. IPA analysis on proteomics revealed major changes in muscle contraction and metabolic pathways related to lipids, protein, nucleotide, and DNA metabolism. Focusing on mitochondria, the protein changes mainly were related to OXPHOS, TCA cycle, translation, and amino acid metabolism.</p><p>The major strength of the paper is the bioenergetics and mitochondrial characterization associated with the transcriptomic and proteomic analyses in PDAC mice that confirmed some published data of mitochondrial dysfunction but underlined some novel metabolic insights such as nucleotide metabolism.</p><p>There are minor weaknesses related to some analyses on mitochondrial proteins and to the fact that proteomic and transcriptomic comparison may be problematic in catabolic conditions because some gene expression is required to maintain or re-establish enzymes/proteins that are destroyed by the proteolytic systems (including the autophagy proteins and ubiquitin ligases). The authors should consider the following points.</p><p>Point1. The authors used the name sarcopenia as synonymous with muscle atrophy. However, sarcopenia clearly defines the disease state (disease code: ICD-10-CM (M62.84)) of excessive muscle loss and force drop during ageing (Ref: Anker SD et al. J Cachexia Sarcopenia Muscle 2016 Dec;7(5):512-514.). Therefore, the word sarcopenia must be used only when pathological age-related muscle loss is the subject of study. Sarcopenia can be present in cancer patients who also experience cachexia, however since the age of tumor-bearing mice in this study is 7-9 weeks old, the authors should refrain from using sarcopenia and instead replace it with the words muscle atrophy/ muscle wasting/muscle loss.</p><p>Point2. Most of the analyses of mitochondrial function are appropriate. However, the methodological approach to determining mitochondrial fusion and fission machinery shown in Fig. 5F is wrong. The correct way is to normalize the OPA1, MFn1/2 on mitochondrial proteins such as VDAC/porin. In fact, by loading the same amount of total protein (see actin in panel 5F) the difference between a normal and a muscle with enhanced protein breakdown is lost. In fact, we should expect a decrease in actin level in tumor-bearing mice with muscle atrophy while the blots clearly show the same level due to the normalization of protein content. Moreover, by loading the same amount of proteins in the gel, the atrophying muscle lysates become enriched in the proteins/organelles that are less affected by the proteolysis resulting in an artefactual increase. The correct way should be to lyse the whole muscle of control and tumor-bearing mice in an identical volume and to load in western blot the same volume between control cachectic muscles. Alternatively, the relative abundance of mitochondrial shaping proteins related to mitochondrial transmembrane or matrix proteins (mito mass) should compensate for the loading normalization. Because the authors showed elongated mitochondria despite mitophagy genes being up, fragmentation may be altered. Moreover, DNM1l gene is suppressed and therefore DRP1 protein must be analyzed. Finally, OPA 1 protein has different isoforms due to the action of proteases like OMA1, and YME1L that elicit different functions being the long one pro-fusion while the short ones do not. The authors must quantify the long and short isoforms of OPA1.</p><p>Point3. The comparison of proteomic and transcriptomic profiles to identify concordance or not is problematic when atrophy programs are induced. In fact, most of the transcriptional-dependent upregulation is to preserve/maintain/reestablish enzymes that are consumed during enhanced protein breakdown. For instance, the ubiquitin ligases when activated undergo autoubiquitination and proteasome degradation. The same happens for several autophagy-related genes belonging to the conjugation system (LC3, Gabarap), the cargo recognition pathways (e.g. Ubiquitin, p62/SQSTM1) and the selective autophagy system (e.g. BNIP3, PINK/PARKIN) and metabolic enzymes (e.g. GAPDH, lipin). Finally, in case identical amounts of proteins have been loaded in mass spec the issues rise in point 2 of selective enrichment should be considered. Therefore, when comparing proteomic and transcriptomic these issues should be considered in discussion.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.93312.2.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Gicquel</surname><given-names>Tristan</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Centre de Recherche en Cancérologie de Marseille</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">MARSEILLE</named-content></addr-line><country>France</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Marchiano</surname><given-names>Fabio</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Aix Marseille University, CNRS, IDBM</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Marseille</named-content></addr-line><country>France</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Reyes-Castellanos</surname><given-names>Gabriela</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Centre de Recherche en Cancérologie de Marseille</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">MARSEILLE</named-content></addr-line><country>France</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Audebert</surname><given-names>Stephane</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Aix Marseille Universite, CNRS, INSERM, Institut Paoli-Calmettes,</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Marseille</named-content></addr-line><country>France</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Camoin</surname><given-names>Luc</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Inserm</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Marseille</named-content></addr-line><country>France</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Habermann</surname><given-names>Bianca H</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Aix Marseille University, CNRS, IDBM</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Marseille</named-content></addr-line><country>France</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Giannesini</surname><given-names>Benoit</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>CRMBM</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Marseille</named-content></addr-line><country>France</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Carrier</surname><given-names>Alice</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Centre de Recherche en Cancérologie de Marseille</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">MARSEILLE</named-content></addr-line><country>France</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>eLife assessment</p><p>This useful study uses a mouse model of pancreatic cancer to examine mitochondrial mass and structure in atrophying muscle along with aspects of mitochondrial metabolism in the same tissue. Most relevant are the solid transcriptomics and proteomics approaches to map out related changes in gene expression networks in muscle during cancer cachexia.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: We very much appreciate the positive feedback from the editors on our article and are delighted to have it published in eLife. Our sincere thanks to the Reviewers for their positive feedback on our work, and for their insightful and constructive comments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>This important study provides a comprehensive evaluation of skeletal muscle mitochondrial function and remodeling in a genetically engineered mouse model of pancreatic cancer cachexia. The study builds upon and extends previous findings that implicate mitochondrial defects in the pathophysiology of cancer cachexia. The authors demonstrate that while the total quantity of mitochondria from skeletal muscles of mice with pancreatic cancer cachexia is similar to controls, mitochondria were elongated with disorganized cristae, and had reduced oxidative capacity. The mitochondrial dysfunction was not associated with exercise-induced metabolic stress (insufficient ATP production), suggesting compensation by glycolysis or other metabolic pathways. However, mitochondrial dysfunction can lead to increased production of ROS/oxidative stress and would be expected to interfere with carbohydrate and lipid metabolism, events that are linked to cancer-induced muscle loss. The data are convincing and were collected and analyzed using state-of-the-art techniques, with unbiased proteomics and transcriptomics analyses supporting most of their conclusions.</p><p>Additional Strengths:</p><p>The authors utilize a genetically engineered mouse model of pancreatic cancer which recapitulates key aspects of human PDAC including the development of cachexia, making the model highly appropriate and translational.</p><p>The authors perform transcriptomic and proteomics analyses on the same tissue, providing a comprehensive analysis of the transcriptional networks and protein networks changed in the context of PDAC cachexia.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The authors refer to skeletal muscle wasting induced by PDAC as sarcopenia. However, the term sarcopenia is typically reserved for the loss of skeletal muscle mass associated with aging.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: We agree that the term sarcopenia initially refers to aged muscle, but its use has spread to other fields, including oncology (for example, in this article, which we quote: Mintziras I et al. Sarcopenia and sarcopenic obesity are significantly associated with poorer overall survival in patients with pancreatic cancer: Systematic review and meta-analysis. Int J Surg 2018;59:19-26). Actually, the term sarcopenia is now widely used in the literature and in the clinic to describe the loss of muscle mass and strength in cancer patients (see for example, this recent review: Papadopetraki A. et al. The Role of Exercise in Cancer-Related Sarcopenia and Sarcopenic Obesity. Cancers 2023;15;5856).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Figure 2, the MuRF1 IHC staining appears localized to the extracellular space surrounding blood vessels and myofibers-which causes concern as to the specificity of the antibody staining. MuRF1, as a muscle-specific E3 ubiquitin ligase that degrades myofibrillar proteins, would be expected to be expressed in the cytosol of muscle fibers.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: We agree that MuRF1 IHC staining was also observed in the extracellular space, which was a surprise, for which we have no explanation to date.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Disruptions to skeletal muscle metabolism in PDAC mice are predicted based on mitochondrial dysfunction and the transcriptomic and proteomics data. The manuscript could therefore be strengthened by additional measures looking at skeletal muscle metabolites, or linking the findings to previous work that has looked at the skeletal muscle metabolome in related models of PDAC cachexia (Neyroud et al., 2023).</p></disp-quote><p>Response: We agree that our omics data could be strengthened by additional measures looking at skeletal muscle metabolites. It's an excellent suggestion to parallel the transcriptomic and proteomic data we obtained on the gastrocnemius muscle with the metabolomic data obtained by Neyroud et al. on the same muscle. These authors used another mouse model of PDAC than our KIC GEMM model, namely the allograft model implanting KPC cells (derived from the pancreatic tumor of KPC mice, another PDAC GEMM model) into syngeneic recipient mice. They carried out a proteomic study on the tibialis anterior muscle and a metabolomic study on the gastrocnemius muscle. Proteomics data identified in particular a KPC-induced reduction in the relative abundance of proteins annotating to oxidative phosphorylation, consistently with our data showing reduced mitochondrial activity pathways. Metabolomic data showed reduced abundance of many amino acids as expected, and of intermediates of the mitochondrial TCA cycle (malate and fumarate) in KPC-atrophied muscle consistently with reduced mitochondrial metabolic pathways that we illustrated. In contrast, metabolites that were increased in abundance included those related to oxidative stress and redox homeostasis, which is not surprising regarding the profound oxidative stress affecting atrophied muscle. Finally, we noted in Neyroud's metabolomic data the dysregulation of certain lipids and nucleotides in atrophied muscle, which is very interesting to relate to our study describing alterations in lipid and nucleotide metabolic pathways.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>The present work analyzed the mitochondrial function and bioenergetics in the context of cancer cachexia induced by pancreatic cancer (PDAC). The authors used the KIC transgenic mice that spontaneously develop PDAC within 9-11 weeks of age. They deeply characterize bioenergetics in living mice by magnetic resonance (MR) and mitochondrial function/morphology mainly by oxygraphy and imaging on ex vivo muscles. By MR they found that phosphocreatine resynthesis and maximal oxidative capacity were reduced in the gastrocnemius muscle of tumor-bearing mice during the recovery phase after 6 minutes of 1 Hz electrical stimulation while pH was reduced in muscle during the stimulation time. By oxygraphy, the authors showed a decrease in basal respiration, proton leak, and maximal respiration in tumor-bearing mice that was associated with the decrease of complex I, II, and IV activity, a reduction of OXPHOS proteins, mitochondrial mass, mtDNA, and to several morphological alterations of mitochondrial shape. The authors performed transcriptomic and proteomic analyses to get insights into mitochondrial defects in the muscles of PDAC mice. By IPA analyses on transcriptomics, they found an increase in the signature of protein degradation, atrophy, and glycolysis and a downregulation of muscle function. Focusing on mitochondria they showed a downregulation mainly in OXPHOS, TCA cycle, and mitochondrial dynamics genes and upregulation of glycolysis, ROS defense, mitophagy, and amino acid metabolism. IPA analysis on proteomics revealed major changes in muscle contraction and metabolic pathways related to lipids, protein, nucleotide, and DNA metabolism. Focusing on mitochondria, the protein changes mainly were related to OXPHOS, TCA cycle, translation, and amino acid metabolism.</p><p>The major strength of the paper is the bioenergetics and mitochondrial characterization associated with the transcriptomic and proteomic analyses in PDAC mice that confirmed some published data of mitochondrial dysfunction but underlined some novel metabolic insights such as nucleotide metabolism.</p><p>There are minor weaknesses related to some analyses on mitochondrial proteins and to the fact that proteomic and transcriptomic comparison may be problematic in catabolic conditions because some gene expression is required to maintain or re-establish enzymes/proteins that are destroyed by the proteolytic systems (including the autophagy proteins and ubiquitin ligases). The authors should consider the following points.</p><p>Point 1. The authors used the name sarcopenia as synonymous with muscle atrophy. However, sarcopenia clearly defines the disease state (disease code: ICD-10-CM (M62.84)) of excessive muscle loss and force drop during ageing (Ref: Anker SD et al. J Cachexia Sarcopenia Muscle 2016 Dec;7(5):512-514.). Therefore, the word sarcopenia must be used only when pathological age-related muscle loss is the subject of study. Sarcopenia can be present in cancer patients who also experience cachexia, however since the age of tumor-bearing mice in this study is 7-9 weeks old, the authors should refrain from using sarcopenia and instead replace it with the words muscle atrophy/ muscle wasting/muscle loss.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: This issue has also been raised by the Reviewer #1. We agree that the term sarcopenia historically refers to aged muscle, but it is also used in oncology (for example, in this article, which we quote: Mintziras I et al. Sarcopenia and sarcopenic obesity are significantly associated with poorer overall survival in patients with pancreatic cancer: Systematic review and meta-analysis. Int J Surg 2018;59:19-26). Actually, the term sarcopenia is now widely used in the literature and in the clinic to describe the loss of muscle mass and strength in cancer patients (see for example, this recent review: Papadopetraki A. et al. The Role of Exercise in Cancer-Related Sarcopenia and Sarcopenic Obesity. Cancers 2023;15;5856).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Point 2. Most of the analyses of mitochondrial function are appropriate. However, the methodological approach to determining mitochondrial fusion and fission machinery shown in Fig. 5F is wrong. The correct way is to normalize the OPA1, MFn1/2 on mitochondrial proteins such as VDAC/porin. In fact, by loading the same amount of total protein (see actin in panel 5F) the difference between a normal and a muscle with enhanced protein breakdown is lost. In fact, we should expect a decrease in actin level in tumor-bearing mice with muscle atrophy while the blots clearly show the same level due to the normalization of protein content. Moreover, by loading the same amount of proteins in the gel, the atrophying muscle lysates become enriched in the proteins/organelles that are less affected by the proteolysis resulting in an artefactual increase. The correct way should be to lyse the whole muscle of control and tumor-bearing mice in an identical volume and to load in western blot the same volume between control cachectic muscles. Alternatively, the relative abundance of mitochondrial shaping proteins related to mitochondrial transmembrane or matrix proteins (mito mass) should compensate for the loading normalization. Because the authors showed elongated mitochondria despite mitophagy genes being up, fragmentation may be altered. Moreover, DNM1l gene is suppressed and therefore DRP1 protein must be analyzed. Finally, OPA 1 protein has different isoforms due to the action of proteases like OMA1, and YME1L that elicit different functions being the long one pro-fusion while the short ones do not. The authors must quantify the long and short isoforms of OPA1.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: We acknowledge that our analysis of a minor set of proteins involved in mitochondrial dynamics by Western blotting (Figure 5F) is basic and could have been improved. We thank the Reviewer for all the suggestions, which will be very useful in future projects studying the subject in greater depth and according to the molecular characteristics of each player in mitochondrial fusion, fission, mitophagy and biogenesis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Point 3. The comparison of proteomic and transcriptomic profiles to identify concordance or not is problematic when atrophy programs are induced. In fact, most of the transcriptional-dependent upregulation is to preserve/maintain/reestablish enzymes that are consumed during enhanced protein breakdown. For instance, the ubiquitin ligases when activated undergo autoubiquitination and proteasome degradation. The same happens for several autophagy-related genes belonging to the conjugation system (LC3, Gabarap), the cargo recognition pathways (e.g. Ubiquitin, p62/SQSTM1) and the selective autophagy system (e.g. BNIP3, PINK/PARKIN) and metabolic enzymes (e.g. GAPDH, lipin). Finally, in case identical amounts of proteins have been loaded in mass spec the issues rise in point 2 of selective enrichment should be considered. Therefore, when comparing proteomic and transcriptomic these issues should be considered in discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: We fully agree with the Reviewer that seeking concordance between transcriptomic and proteomic data in the case of an organ affected by a high level of proteolysis is a difficult business. Another major difficulty we discussed in the Discussion section of the article is the fact that there is no concordance between RNA and protein level for a good proportion of proteins, for multiple reasons, so each level of omics has to be interpreted independently to give information on the pathophysiology of the organ studied.</p></body></sub-article></article>
