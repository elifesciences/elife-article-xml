large-scale distribution of microscopic organisms, whose biogeographical patterns have long been debated. Here we assessed the global structure of plankton geography and its relation to the biological, chemical, and physical context of the ocean (the ‘seascape’) by analyzing metagenomes of plankton communities sampled across oceans during the <italic>Tara</italic> Oceans expedition, in light of environmental data and ocean current transport. Using a consistent approach across organismal sizes that provides unprecedented resolution to measure changes in genomic composition between communities, we report a pan-ocean, size-dependent plankton biogeography overlying regional heterogeneity. We found robust evidence for a basin-scale impact of transport by ocean currents on plankton biogeography, and on a characteristic timescale of community dynamics going beyond simple seasonality or life history transitions of plankton.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Oceans are brimming with life invisible to our eyes, a myriad of species of bacteria, viruses and other microscopic organisms essential for the health of the planet. These ‘marine plankton’ are unable to swim against currents and should therefore be constantly on the move, yet previous studies have suggested that distinct species of plankton may in fact inhabit different oceanic regions. However, proving this theory has been challenging; collecting plankton is logistically difficult, and it is often impossible to distinguish between species simply by examining them under a microscope.

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Plankton communities are constantly on the move, transported by ocean currents. Transport involves both advection and mixing. While being advected by currents, plankton can be influenced by multiple processes, both physicochemical (fluxes of heat, light,and nutrients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Moore et al., 2013</xref>) and biological (species interactions, life cycles, behavior, and acclimation/adaptation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Armbrust, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Flynn et al., 2015</xref>]), which act across various spatial and temporal scales. In turn, plankton impact seawater physicochemistry while they are being advected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Moore et al., 2013</xref>). The community composition and biogeochemical properties of a water mass at a given site are also partially dependent on its history of mixing with neighboring water masses during transport. These intertwined processes occurring along transport by currents form the pelagic seascape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pittman, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1a</xref>). Due to logistical and analytical constraints, previous studies on plankton distribution have tended to be geographically or taxonomically restricted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hanson et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Martiny et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">McGowan and Walker, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Reygondeau and Dunn, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Roux et al., 2016</xref>), to focus on individual factors such as nutrient or light availability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Longhurst, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Tagliabue et al., 2017</xref>), or have investigated the influence of transport on specific nutrients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Letscher et al., 2016</xref>) or types of planktonic organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hellweger et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Villarino et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Wilkins et al., 2013</xref>). We set out to test for the first time at genomic resolution the hypotheses that a global-scale plankton biogeography exists and that it is closely linked to transport via large-scale ocean currents. To do this, we integrated metagenomic data from epipelagic samples collected during the <italic>Tara</italic> Oceans expedition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Karsenti et al., 2011</xref>) with in situ and satellite environmental metadata and large-scale ocean circulation simulations. Our sampling largely focused on open ocean sites located in the main gyres, but also included other areas with distinct oceanographic features, such as coastal upwelling zones and lagoons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1b</xref>). We chose to study biogeographic patterns along large-scale currents in the principal oceanic gyres, with counterpoints to other oceanographic features in which the influence of ocean transport by the main currents is likely to be relatively weaker, such as upwellings. Our analyses focus on the sunlit (epipelagic) layer of the ocean (subsurface and deep chlorophyll maximum [DCM] samples); at lower depths (the mesopelagic and below), the relationship between plankton community composition and ocean transport may be different than at the surface. The use of DNA as a primary proxy for global plankton diversity has several important advantages over classical morphology-based analyses, notably because methods can be standardized and applied across the entire range of plankton sizes, from viruses through prokaryotes and protists to animals.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>DNA sequence data was obtained from samples collected at 113 worldwide stations during the <italic>Tara</italic> Oceans expedition. Each plankton community sample was sequenced for up to six operational size fractions: one virus-enriched (0–0.22 μm; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Roux et al., 2016</xref>), one prokaryote-enriched (either 0.22–1.6 or 0.22–3 μm; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sunagawa et al., 2015</xref>), and four eukaryote-enriched (0.8–5 μm, 5–20 μm, 20–180 μm, and 180–2000 μm; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">de Vargas et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1b</xref>). These size fractions are operational in that each contains the organisms captured between two physical filters of a given size (either filters or nets, depending on size fraction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Pesant et al., 2015</xref>]). We estimated the average percentage of metagenomic sequence reads in samples from the prokaryote-enriched 0.22–1.6/3 µm size fractions that were of eukaryotic origin to be 12%, and the average percentage of reads in eukaryote-enriched size fractions that were of prokaryote origin as follows: 0.8–5 μm: 39%, 5–20 μm: 23%, 20–180 μm: 3%, 180–2000 μm: 5% (see Materials and methods). The <italic>Tara</italic> Oceans project produced a total of 24.2 terabases of metagenomic sequence reads (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Data_from_Genomic_evidence_for_global_ocean_plankton_biogeography_shaped_by_large-scale_current_systems/11303177?file=20034092">Supplementary Table 1</ext-link>). To account for uneven sequencing depth among samples, we analyzed a subset of 11.9 terabases, after testing that this subset accurately represented the complete data set (see Materials and methods). We also analyzed operational taxonomic units (OTUs, representing groups of genetically related organisms), consisting of previously published viral populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brum et al., 2015</xref>) previously derived bacterial 16S miTAGs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sunagawa et al., 2015</xref>), and 738 million 18S V9 ribosomal DNA marker sequences in the eukaryote-enriched size fractions, enlarging a previously described <italic>Tara</italic> Oceans data set (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">de Vargas et al., 2015</xref>). We used metagenomic data and OTUs independently to compute pairwise comparisons of plankton community dissimilarity (as proxies for β-diversity). Metagenomic dissimilarity highlighted, at species and subspecies resolution, differences in the genomic identity of organisms between stations. Our metagenomic sampling resulted in pairwise metagenomic dissimilarities that likely represent an overestimate of β-diversity (Appendix 1). However, we applied an identical procedure to compute metagenomic dissimilarity for all size fractions (correlations among fractions ranged Spearman’s ρ 0.6–0.9, p≤10<sup>−4</sup>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). The more thoroughly sampled OTU dissimilarity, in contrast, incorporated more numerous rare taxa within the plankton, but at genus or higher-level taxonomic resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">de Vargas et al., 2015</xref>). Metagenomic and OTU dissimilarities were correlated for all size fractions (Spearman’s ρ 0.53–0.97, p≤10<sup>−4</sup>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>), indicating that both proxies, although characterized by different sampling levels and taxonomic resolution, provided coherent and complementary estimates of β-diversity (Appendix 1). We performed subsequent analyses using both measures, which produced consistent results. The taxonomic composition of these <italic>Tara</italic> Oceans samples, not discussed here, is instead presented in a parallel analysis of the spatial dynamics of planktonic eukaryotes, based on the same environmental data and large-scale ocean circulation simulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sommeria-Klein et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>We focus on analyses of metagenomic dissimilarity here, with accompanying results for OTU dissimilarity presented in Supplementary Figures, and validation by comparison to abundance differences among metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Delmont et al., 2022a</xref>) and to more traditional imaging data presented independently below.</p><p>Globally, we observed substantial metagenomic dissimilarities (average pairwise dissimilarity &gt;80%) between sampled stations (including adjacent sites) across all size fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3a</xref>, Appendix 1). The resulting portrait is of a heterogeneous oceanic ecosystem at all scales separating <italic>Tara</italic> Oceans sampling sites (even those separated by only a few kilometers), dominated by a small number of abundant and cosmopolitan taxa, with a much larger number of less abundant taxa found at fewer sampling sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3b-e</xref>), corroborating other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">de Vargas et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Overlying this heterogeneity, we found robust evidence for the existence of large-scale biogeographical patterns within all plankton size classes using two complementary analyses of dissimilarity among samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4a-f</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>, Appendix 2). First, we grouped metagenomic samples within each size fraction into ‘genomic provinces’ via hierarchical clustering (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplement 6</xref>). Second, we derived colors for each sample based on a principal coordinates analysis (PCoA-RGB; see Materials and methods) in order to visualize transitions in community composition within and between genomic provinces. Genomic provinces were mostly composed of geographically clustered stations (consistent with previous studies documenting patterns in plankton biogeography [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hanson et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Martiny et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">McGowan and Walker, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Roux et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4a-f</xref>]). Although the large majority of our samples were located in oceanic gyres, samples located in physically distant zones but with shared environmental conditions, such as oceanic upwellings, also grouped together (e.g. genomic province B6 in the bacterial-enriched size fraction). Genomic provinces of smaller plankton (viruses, bacteria, and eukaryotes &lt;20 µm), with some exceptions (e.g. genomic province B5), tended to be limited to a single ocean basin and to approximately correspond to Longhurst biogeochemical provinces (BGCPs; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Longhurst, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4a-d</xref>; Appendix 3). In contrast, provinces of larger plankton (micro- and mesoplankton, &gt;20 µm) spanned multiple basins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4e-f</xref>, Appendix 4).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Plankton biogeography, environmental variation, and ocean transport among <italic>Tara</italic> Oceans stations.</title><p>Major currents are represented by solid arrows.

We interpret this as being a result of the expected significantly lower resolution in imaging data as compared to metagenomic data (a similar difference of resolution in OTU data versus metagenomic data is discussed in Appendix 1). Finally, we also confirmed our metagenome sequence read comparison-based results by comparing them to β-diversity among sampling sites using a collection of MAGs, which are likely to represent the most abundant genomes, from the 20–180 µm size fraction (the size fraction in which the largest proportion of metagenomic reads were mapped to MAGs, 18.4%; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Delmont et al., 2022a</xref>).

Consistent with our results, seasonal variations have previously been shown to have minor effects on the boundary positions of BGCPs based on satellite data, but not enough to affect the overall pattern of ocean regionalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Reygondeau et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Differences in environmental conditions for pairs of stations also covaried (although less strongly) with transit time for T<sub>min</sub> &lt;~1.5 years (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).

The relatively large separation (in terms of transport time and season) among sampling stations allowed us to detect the large-scale effects of ocean circulation, which are superimposed on smaller-scale effects such as local patchiness and seasonality (as previously observed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Longhurst, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Reygondeau et al., 2013</xref>). Within ocean basins, as the intertwined dynamics of plankton and chemistry continuously occur along transport, smooth variations have emerged due to the periodic recirculation of within-basin currents. This leads to stable, continuous patterns of changes in community structure and nutrient concentrations, and also explains how temporally stable genomic provinces can exist in the face of ocean currents. Among ocean basins, depending on the sensitivity to the environment of a plankton community, higher heterogeneity in environmental conditions across different circulation patterns can disrupt the equilibrium of seascape processes within a given continuum, leading to a global delimitation into distinguishable ecological continua among different large-scale current systems, resulting in the genomic provinces that we detected.</p><p>The existence of a size-class-dependent (smaller or larger than 20 µm) structure of plankton geography indicates that the continua that we observe vary among size fractions because of different reactions of organisms within the seascape (i.e. the interplay among organismal biology, nutrients, and local environmental conditions), in agreement with a parallel survey based on taxonomic groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sommeria-Klein et al., 2021</xref>). In the case of the North Atlantic current system (including the Mediterranean Sea), a simple exponential fit of metagenomic dissimilarity along T<sub>min</sub> for T<sub>min</sub> &lt;~1.5 years (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>) revealed that the smaller size classes (&lt;20 µm) had a shorter metagenomic turnover time (ca. 1 year) than larger plankton (ca. 2 years; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>, Appendix 6). At global geographical scales, the genomic provinces of small size classes, which are enriched in phytoplankton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">de Vargas et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Frémont et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sommeria-Klein et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sunagawa et al., 2015</xref>), corresponded in our data with differences in environmental parameters such as nutrient levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s7">Figure 1—figure supplement 7</xref>) that are often constrained by regional oceanographic processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sarmiento and Gruber, 2006</xref>). On the other hand, genomic provinces of larger plankton, enriched in heterotrophic and symbiotic organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">de Vargas et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Frémont et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sommeria-Klein et al., 2021</xref>), were less coupled with geochemical parameters and were more related to global scale gradients and circulation patterns, notably major latitudinal temperature zones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Martin et al., 2021</xref>) or the separation between Atlantic and Indo-Pacific large-scale surface circulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4e,f,i</xref>). These divergent effects were also evident in comparisons of metagenomic dissimilarity with variations in either nutrient concentrations or temperature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1b</xref>). For smaller plankton, correlations with differences in nutrient concentrations were strongest, at T<sub>min</sub> up to ~1.5 years, while for larger plankton, correlations were strongest with temperature variations, for T<sub>min</sub> beyond ~1.5 years. Larger plankton are dominated by eukaryotes, often multicellular, with much longer life cycles, potentially leading to slower community turnover. Organisms with long life cycles, on the order of several months or years, can be transported through basins spanning multiple biogeochemical niches in which they may encounter strong environmental variability; this trend was also detected in a taxonomy-based analysis accounting for differences in both body size and ecology among groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sommeria-Klein et al., 2021</xref>). As observed here, their biogeography is less affected by nutrient limitation and rather depends on large-scale temperature gradients among basins. This dependence may be linked to the known correlation between body size and organismal metabolic rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ikeda, 1985</xref>). Conversely, variants within populations of organisms with short life cycles have the capacity to increase their relative abundance within restricted ecological niches to which they are adapted. This difference, detectable at genomic resolution, may not be picked up in analyses performed using biological traits with less resolution. These results indicate a significant size-based decoupling within planktonic food webs. For example, large size predators will encounter different prey when transiting through the genomic provinces of small sized organisms (see Appendix 4).</p><p>In this study, we provide genomic evidence for an organism size-dependent global-scale open ocean plankton biogeography shaped by currents. Using analysis of standardized metagenomic data together with environmental and physical data, we reveal that, in a background of significant local patchiness, the integration of seascape physical, chemical, and biological processes over time and space produces a quasi-stationary biological partitioning of the oceans that supersedes short-term variability and seasonal cycles, ultimately generating global biogeographical patterns. Although the strong cross-coupling among our metagenomic, environmental, and physical data prevents a systematic disentangling of their various influences, we hypothesize that transport by ocean currents acts essentially as a conveyor on which interacting environmental and biological effects are layered. In this hypothesis, direct effects of currents (such as turbulent diffusivity) on plankton composition are secondary, and instead environmental and biological effects occurring during transport result in the emergence of a global plankton biogeography in the surface ocean. Future studies both on smaller spatiotemporal scales or specific oceanographic features (e.g. coastal regions) and on the global-scale constraints and influences on the seascape itself could lead to a more detailed understanding of plankton dynamics. The ocean is a three-dimensional system in which the primary axis of variation is depth. Our metagenomic data and simulations were limited to the sunlit layer of the ocean and therefore capture one part of seascape dynamics. At greater ocean depths (i.e. in the mesopelagic and below), the relationship between ocean transport and plankton community composition may differ from the one we describe at the surface. In addition, an understanding of plankton biogeography is a key component of future studies on the function of the genes they express; analyses that synergize both characterizations will refine the definition and ecological interpretation of plankton communities within genomic provinces. Overall, our work shows that studies of the dynamics of plankton communities must consider the critical influence of ocean currents in stretching, on the scale of basins, the distribution of both planktonic organisms and the physicochemical nature of the water mass in which they reside. We also demonstrate that the combination of ocean circulation modeling with the use of metagenomic DNA as a tracer of plankton communities provides a resolution above the minimum necessary for assessing the role of transport in community turnover over time and space. The open ocean planktonic ecosystem is fundamentally different in many ways from other major planetary ecosystems, and this study provides a basis to understand and potentially predict the structuring of the ocean ecosystem in a scenario of rapid environmental and current system changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beaugrand et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Caesar et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Frémont et al., 2022</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Sampling, sequencing, and environmental parameters</title><p>Sampling, size fractionation, measurement of environmental parameters and associated metadata, DNA extraction, and metagenomic sequencing were conducted as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alberti et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Pesant et al., 2015</xref>).

Since all genomic data were collected during day time, we restricted our analysis on day-collected samples. We also discarded non-living objects in our analyses. We estimated β-diversity by calculating Bray-Curtis dissimilarities between pairs of stations based on the relative abundances of each annotated taxonomic unit. Bray-Curtis dissimilarities are available as <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Data_from_Genomic_evidence_for_global_ocean_plankton_biogeography_shaped_by_large-scale_current_systems/11303177?file=25891494">Supplementary Table 17</ext-link>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>MAGs analysis</title><p>MAG relative abundances in metagenomic samples were retrieved from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Delmont et al., 2022a</xref>. β-diversity was estimated by calculating the Bray-Curtis dissimilarities between pairs of stations based on the relative abundances of each of the 713 MAGs calculated by read mapping in the metagenomes of size fraction 20–180 µm (the size fraction in which MAGs recruit the largest relative share of all reads). We represented PCoA-RGB color of the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity matrix for each sample on a world map (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4g</xref>) following the methodology described above. The Spearman ρ correlation coefficient was calculated between MAG-based β-diversity and metagenomic-based β-diversity from the size fraction 20–180 μm. MAG abundances for the 20–180 µm size fraction are available as Dataset 4.

For each eukaryote and prokaryote MAG and for each sample, we used the proportion of reads unambiguously mapped to the MAG. For each sample, we next obtained estimates of the percentages of prokaryote or eukaryote reads by summing these relative counts for all prokaryote (bacterial or archaeal) or all eukaryote MAGs. We discarded samples for which both prokaryote and eukaryote relative counts had a zero or negligible sum (&lt;1% of total reads). For the remaining 538 samples, the average percentage represents the average across all samples within a given size fraction.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information"

at the community level as a function of diversity, genome size, and organismal abundance, and also depend on the rate of evolution of each specific lineage. With exhaustive sampling, metagenomic dissimilarity could theoretically distinguish among genomes in a sample separated by a single mutation. However, our metagenomic sequencing level was likely not able to reach saturation due to the number of genomes per sample and their putative large size (metatranscriptomes, which contain fewer sequences per species than do metagenomes, did not reach saturation within <italic>Tara</italic> Oceans samples <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Carradec et al., 2018</xref>). For example, if for a pair of samples we sequence 50% of the total amount of the unique genomic DNA present, we expect the maximum similarity of the two samples to be roughly 25% (0.5 × 0.5). Therefore, the pairwise metagenomic dissimilarities we calculated between samples probably reflected a combination of genomic differences weighted toward more abundant organisms. In contrast, OTUs, obtained by sequencing single marker genes, approach biodiversity saturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">de Vargas et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Roux et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sunagawa et al., 2015</xref>). However, OTU resolution depends on the choice of the marker to be used, the threshold of similarity for the marker, and its lineage-specific substitution rate, and may therefore confound evolutionarily and/or ecologically distant organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Piganeau et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Seeleuthner et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Vannier et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Worden et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Wu et al., 2015</xref>). We observed a significant agreement between the two proxies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>), although dissimilarities based on OTUs were generally lower than those computed from metagenomic data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref> a).</p><p>Analyses of plankton biogeography produced consistent results based on metagenomic and OTU data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). For simplicity, in the main text, we chose to highlight results based on metagenomes rather than on OTUs for three reasons. First, the metagenomic sequencing protocol and subsequent measurement of dissimilarity were uniform across size fractions, whereas OTUs were defined differently for the viral-enriched, bacterial-enriched and eukaryote-enriched size fractions (Materials and methods). Second, the biogeographical patterns we obtained (see below) may be more evident in comparisons among metagenomic sequences (our data source in identifying genomic provinces), as genomes accumulate single-base changes and other variants more quickly than a single ribosomal gene marker. Third, β-diversity estimated by metagenomic dissimilarity generally displayed higher correlation values with minimum travel time (T<sub>min</sub>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p></sec></app><app id="appendix-2"><title>Appendix 2</title><sec sec-type="appendix" id="s9"><title>Robustness of genomic provinces</title><p>We assessed the robustness of genomic provinces in five separate ways. First, we tested five different hierarchical clustering algorithms from the R-package pvclust_1.3–2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Suzuki and Shimodaira, 2006</xref>; UPGMA; McQuitty’s method; Complete linkage; Ward’s method; Single linkage) on the metagenomic pairwise dissimilarities produced by Simka separately for the six organismal size fractions, followed by multiscale bootstrap resampling. We used the cophenetic correlation coefficient from the R-package dendextend_1.5.2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Galili, 2015</xref>) to measure how accurately the dendrograms produced by each method preserved the pairwise distances within the input dissimilarity matrices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sneath and Sokal, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sokal and Rohlf, 1962</xref>). The ranking of the cophenetic correlation coefficient for different clustering methods within each size fraction (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Data_from_Genomic_evidence_for_global_ocean_plankton_biogeography_shaped_by_large-scale_current_systems/11303177?file=25891500">Supplementary Table 19</ext-link>) was consistent with a published large-scale methodological comparison of clustering methods for biogeography, which considered UPGMA agglomerative hierarchical clustering to have consistently the best performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kreft and Jetz, 2010</xref>). Second, we compared clustering results among all size fractions using Baker’s Gamma Index (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baker and Hubert, 1975</xref>) from the R-package corrplot_0.77 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wei and Simko, 2016</xref>), which is a measure of association (similarity) between two trees based on hierarchical clustering (dendrograms). The Baker’s Gamma Index is defined as the rank correlation between the stages at which pairs of objects combine in each of the two trees. For each type of correlation, the UPGMA was consistently the most correlated with other clustering methods (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Data_from_Genomic_evidence_for_global_ocean_plankton_biogeography_shaped_by_large-scale_current_systems/11303177?file=25891503">Supplementary Table 20</ext-link>). This allowed us to conclude, in agreement with previous results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kreft and Jetz, 2010</xref>), that the UPGMA method is likely more robust than the other methods we tested.</p><p>Third, we compared the genomic provinces found by our UPGMA hierarchical clustering approach to those found by two different non-hierarchical methods: K-means on the positions found by multidimensional scaling and spectral clustering on the nearest-neighbor graph. Both methods rely on (i) a dissimilarity matrix and (ii) a tuning parameter (dimension of the projection space for K-means, and number of neighbors for spectral clustering). K-means uses the numeric values of the dissimilarities, whereas spectral relies only on their ordering (e.g. community A is closer to B than to C). We compared the genomic provinces to clusters found by K-means and spectral clustering for all values of the tuning parameter using the Rand Index (RI; from the GARI function of the loe R package version 1.1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Terada and Luxburg, 2016</xref>), a score of agreement between partitions. Results are reported as mean ± SD of the RI: 1 means perfect agreement and 0 complete disagreement. Fourth, in order to assess the significance of the genomic provinces, we performed a multivariate ANOVA to partition metagenomic dissimilarity across regions, using the adonis function of the vegan R package version 2.5–4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Oksanen et al., 2019</xref>). Note, however, that since the same data were used both to construct the genomic provinces and to assess their significance, the p-values estimated by ADONIS might be anti-conservative. The results of the third and fourth analyses are presented in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Data_from_Genomic_evidence_for_global_ocean_plankton_biogeography_shaped_by_large-scale_current_systems/11303177?file=25891506">Supplementary Table 21</ext-link>.</p><p>Fifth, we found that clustering of samples in genomic provinces was consistent with a complementary visualization based on the same data: RGB colors derived from the first three axes of a principal coordinates analysis (PCoA-RGB) of β-diversity, in which similar colors represent similar communities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>; see Methods). Samples within the same genomic province generally shared the same range of PCoA-RGB colors. Because the clustering approach was hierarchical, samples sharing some similarity could have been assigned to different genomic provinces due to binary decisions during the clustering process. This was also reflected in the PCoA-RGB colors, where the boundaries of genomic provinces did not indicate a complete change of communities among genomic provinces (and, conversely, belonging to the same genomic province did not imply identical communities). Nonetheless, samples with similar PCoA-RGB colors were generally situated in closely-related branches in the UPGMA tree (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplement 6</xref>). An illustrative example is genomic province F5 (of the 180–2000 µm size fraction; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4f</xref>), which encompassed stations in the Atlantic, Mediterranean Sea and some subtropical stations in the Indo-Pacific. In this wide region, the PCoA-RGB colors indicate the variation in community composition within the genomic province, and also reflect the relatedness of F5 to its adjacent samples, in particular those in the subtropical Atlantic/Pacific region F4, its neighbor in the UPGMA tree (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplement 6f</xref>).</p></sec></app><app id="appendix-3"><title>Appendix 3</title><sec sec-type="appendix" id="s10"><title>Comparison of genomic provinces to previous biogeographical divisions</title><p>Current approaches in biogeographic theory divide the ocean into regions based either on expert knowledge applied to satellite data, as in the hierarchical nesting by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Longhurst, 2006</xref> into biomes (macroscale, essentially representing a division of the world’s oceans into cold and warm waters, and coastal upwelling zones) and biogeochemical provinces (BGCPs, areas within biomes defined by observable boundaries and predicted ecological characteristics), or, alternatively, into the objective provinces of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Oliver and Irwin, 2008</xref>, which are based solely on statistical analyses.

We observed a similar pattern using OTU data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>). Whereas smaller size fractions generally lacked geographically widespread genomic provinces containing numerous <italic>Tara</italic> Oceans samples, the two largest size fractions were both characterized by two very widespread genomic provinces: F5 and F8 for the 180–2000 µm size fraction, and E5 and E6 for the 20–180 µm size fraction. These large genomic provinces were latitudinally limited by the boundary between the subtropics and subpolar regions, and spanned different oceanic basins. Notably, in the southern hemisphere the subtropical gyres actually form a single supergyre (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Speich et al., 2007</xref>) and there are almost no metabolic (mainly temperature) barriers between the northern and southern subtropical gyres (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>), potentially explaining genomic provinces in the 20–180 µm and 180–2000 µm size fraction that contain samples from the North and South Atlantic. For example, in the 180–2000 µm size fraction, F5 mostly covered the North and South Atlantic Oceans and adjacent systems, and F8 covered the Indo-Pacific low- and mid-latitudes. No clear correspondence existed with biogeochemical patterns (e.g. nutrient ratios), except for the clusters coinciding with upwelling systems (F3 for the California upwelling, F7 for the Chile-Peru upwelling, and F2 for the Benguela upwelling system) and for the samples collected at the DCM in the Pacific subtropical gyres (F5); this is consistent with the comparison of genomic provinces to previous biographical divisions, in which the genomic provinces of smaller size fractions were more consistent with Longhurst BGCPs, but those of larger size fractions were not (Appendix 3). A bimodal zooplankton species distribution (split into subtropical and subpolar communities, with ubiquitous warm water species) was also detected by a recent study on copepod population dynamics that used alternative approaches to analyze the same metagenomic data set (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Madoui et al., 2017</xref>) (see their <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). More locally, within the North Atlantic (see also Appendix 6), along the northern boundary of the subtropical gyre, cold and warm copepod species overlapped because of cross-current dispersal. Nonetheless, although both cold and warm species appeared to be able to travel long distances, mixing among them was not sufficient to create a local genomic province in our data.</p><p>We interpret the difference in genomic province sizes between smaller and larger size fractions as the result of various factors. Plankton smaller than 20 µm (femto-, pico-, and nanoplankton), which represent most of the prokaryotic and eukaryotic phototrophs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">de Vargas et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sunagawa et al., 2015</xref>), are sensitive to a suite of environmental factors (i.e. temperature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Eppley, 1972</xref>], nutrients, and trace elements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Moore et al., 2013</xref>]; see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s7">Figure 1—figure supplement 7</xref>) and generally have a shorter life cycle, together leading to faster fluctuations in their relative abundance in the communities we sampled. In contrast, larger plankton have longer life cycles and, if they are predators that are not strongly selective in their feeding, or are photosymbiotic hosts capable of partnering with multiple different symbionts, may cope with local fluctuations in environmental conditions. Therefore, they should be affected primarily by large scale, mostly latitudinal, variations in the environment, leading to larger genomic provinces, whereas smaller plankton are grouped into smaller provinces more influenced by local environmental conditions. Overall, this difference in biogeography suggests a size-based decoupling between smaller and larger plankton (which may also extend to nekton such as tuna and billfish; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Reygondeau et al., 2012</xref>), with implications for the structure and function of oceanic food webs and other types of biotic interactions.</p></sec></app><app id="appendix-5"><title>Appendix 5</title><sec sec-type="appendix" id="s12"><title>Genomic provinces as stable ecological continua</title><p>As plankton communities are transported by ocean currents, they change over time due to the various processes that occur in the context of the seascape: variations in temperature, light and nutrients (where changes in the latter may also be induced by plankton communities), intra- and interindividual and species biological interactions, and mixing with neighboring water masses. Thus, a continuum of composition among nearby samples is expected as a natural consequence of community turnover within the seascape over time. We observed the effects of continuous turnover in our biogeographical analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> a, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>, Appendix 2) in which nearby samples often reflected gradual, but not complete changes in community composition.</p><p>We measured the time window of transport by currents separating two samples during which the changes in their community composition were maximally correlated with travel time, resulting in a global average of T<sub>min</sub> less than roughly 1.5 years. This represents the travel time during which predictable continuous turnover occurs in our data set. This time scale of 1.5 years is probably an underestimate, since our sparse sampling did not cover all current systems. Notably, T<sub>min</sub> does not necessarily define the turnover rate itself, which depends on how strongly different seascape processes affect communities with differing biological characteristics (see Appendix 6).</p></sec></app><app id="appendix-6"><title>Appendix 6</title><sec sec-type="appendix" id="s13"><title>Community turnover in the North Atlantic</title><p>In order to characterize the impact of physical and biological processes on changes in metagenomic composition during travel along currents, we focused on the well-known current systems crossing the North Atlantic into the Mediterranean Sea (the Gulf Stream and other currents around the subtropical gyre <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dornelas et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fofonoff, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Franklin, 1786</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Talley et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2a</xref>). Across this region, the piconanoplankton (0.8–5 µm) were split into three genomic provinces, C5, C8, and C3, each less than 5000 km wide (~11 months of travel time; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4c</xref>). In contrast, mesoplankton (180–2000 µm) biogeography corresponded to a single province, F5, spanning from the Caribbean to Cyprus (&gt;9700 km or ~18 months of travel time; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4f</xref>; see also Appendix 4). Metagenomic dissimilarity and T<sub>min</sub> were strongly correlated within the region (Spearman’s ρ between 0.44 and 0.86 depending on size fraction, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2b-e</xref>), which allowed us to explore the relationship of genomic province size, ocean transport, and plankton community turnover over scales from months to years. We calculated metagenomic turnover times as e-folding times based on an exponential fit of metagenomic dissimilarity to T<sub>min</sub> (ranging from a few months to a few years, Methods). The metagenomic turnover time of smaller plankton (&lt;20 µm) was approximately 1 year. In contrast, for the larger size fractions, the metagenomic turnover time was approximately 2 years, suggesting that a lower turnover rate for larger plankton may explain their geographically larger genomic provinces.</p><p>We note that our results on metagenomic turnover time appear different from a recently published study that also calculated turnover rates for plankton, which found faster rates for larger organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Villarino et al., 2018</xref>). This may be explained by two significant differences between our approach and theirs: first, their measurements of β-diversity were based on presence/absence (Jaccard) comparisons among either morphological species or OTUs, whereas our calculations of turnover time above were based on metagenomic sequences. As described above (Appendix 1), there are significant differences in resolution between OTU-based and metagenomic data, and we would expect similar differences in resolution between organismal observation data and metagenomic sequences. In fact, due to these differences in resolution, our estimates of metagenomic turnover based on OTU rather than metagenomic data show a similar trend to those of (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Villarino et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2f-i</xref>). Second, their turnover rates were calculated separately for individual plankton groups (the nine main groups were prokaryotes, coccolithophores, dinoflagellates, diatoms, all microbial eukaryotes, gelatinous zooplankton, mesozooplankton, macrozooplankton, and myctophids), whereas our metagenomic data represent samples of the full plankton community within each size fraction. Among these, several groups (e.g. dinoflagellates or mesozooplankton) would be expected to be found across multiple <italic>Tara</italic> Oceans size fractions, blurring potential comparisons. Thus, our study and Villarino et al. calculated rates of change using broadly similar approaches, but based on very different underlying biological substrates.</p></sec></app><app id="appendix-7"><title>Appendix 7</title><sec sec-type="appendix" id="s14"><title>Plankton biogeography is robust to missing samples</title><p>Although many individual <italic>Tara</italic> Oceans stations are missing metagenomic or metabarcode sequencing data for a subset of size fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1b</xref>), all oceanic regions have broad coverage for each size fraction, with the exception of the viral-enriched size fraction in the North Atlantic. In fact, the largest source of missing data in our study is due to limited sampling of the viral-enriched size fraction in this region. Nevertheless, we found a pattern for organismal biogeography and for its relation with transport time that is not dependent on the size fraction, and therefore also does not depend on the particular size fractions sampled at specific set of sampling sites. In our analyses, we found a consistently similar patterns across the four smaller size fractions (each fraction was sampled and analyzed independently from the others) as opposed to the two larger ones. In addition, for our results relating to ocean transport time, the fact that the sampling sites are not exactly the same among size fractions actually lends robustness to our results, since it means that the dynamics we found are not overly dependent on any one selected site, region, or subset of sampling stations.</p></sec></app></app-group></back><sub-article article-type="editor-report" id="sa0"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.78129.sa0</article-id><title-group><article-title>Editor's evaluation</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Louca</surname><given-names>Stilianos</given-names></name><role specific-use="editor">Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/0293rh119</institution-id><institution>University of Oregon</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Richter and colleagues present an impressive analysis of metagenomic, OTU and imaging data collected from &gt;100 ocean locations worldwide, with the purpose of elucidating the role of large-scale currents on global-scale marine plankton biogeography.

The topic is exciting and timely, and should be of broad interest to the fields of marine microbiology, biological oceanography, plankton ecology and physical oceanography. One strong aspect of this study is that it compares community dissimilarities with travel times computed from a global ocean circulation model, rather than simply considering geodesic distances between locations. The data included with this manuscript will also likely be of great value to other research groups. There are, however, substantial concerns regarding the methodology and the conclusions that can be drawn from the work. A specific concern regards the use of 31 bp k-mers for calculating metagenomic dissimilarities and the difficulty of interpreting such dissimilarities biologically, given the many nuances of genome features from viruses to zooplankton. Concerns were also raised regarding the calculation of Tmin based on the surface layer, given that current velocity and direction near the surface and at lower depths of the mixed layer may diverge. Finally, there were questions about the relatively narrow distribution of Tara Oceans samples from similar latitudes and (largely) from the surface, and the fact that different locations were sampled at different seasons (which influence the extent of stratification).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>1. One strong aspect of this study is that it compares community dissimilarities with travel times computed from a global ocean circulation model, which arguably makes more sense than simply considering geodesic distances between locations (as most previous studies have done). The data included with this manuscript will also be of great value to other research groups.</p><p>2. The authors have shown that travel time correlates strongly with metagenomic community dissimilarities (lines 208-209), but they also found strong correlations between travel time and environmental differences (lines 232-233), and correlations between metagenomic differences and environmental differences (Figure 3 and lines 191-192). They also found that their genomic provinces often matched environmental differences. This begs the question to what extent the genomic provinces are caused by circulation within the provinces (which probably &quot;homogenizes&quot; communities within a province) rather than simply environmental differences between provinces (or environmental homogeneity within provinces). In other words, even if there was no circulation (thus communities are entirely determined by local environmental conditions), would we still expect to see the genomic provinces that the authors found? I would have expected a strong discussion on disentangling environmental selection effects from dispersal effects. The authors do marginally touch upon this issue by calculating partial correlations (Supplemental Figure S9), but they don't discuss this at all in the main text. Their Supplemental Figure S9c actually suggests that correlations between metagenomic dissimilarities and environmental differences (temperature and/or nutrients), when controlling for Tmin, are often stronger than correlations between metagenomic dissimilarities and Tmin (when controlling for temperature and nutrients). This might suggest that for some size classes genomic provinces are mostly caused by environmental homogeneity within basins/provinces, rather than the homogenizing action of currents. As it stands, I find the take-home messages of the paper rather vague and inconclusive from a mechanistic (i.e., rather than descriptive) point of view.</p><p>3. The authors calculate metagenomic dissimilarities with Simka based on counts of 31bp-k-mers (instead of, say, species counts or gene ortholog counts). While this is computationally efficient, it makes a biological interpretation of their metagenomic β-diversity hard. The original Simka paper demonstrated that k-mer distances correlate with taxonomic distance matrixes, but they don't seem to examine the relationship between k-mer dissimilarities and function-centric dissimilarities, i.e., dissimilarities in metabolic functions (as inferred by functionally annotating metagenomic reads or contigs). I suspect that k-mer-based distances may not correlate well with function-based dissimilarities.</p><p>Recommendations for the authors</p><p>I strongly recommend that the authors provide a quantitative and thorough discussion of my point 2 in their main text.</p><p>Related to point 3: Why not also perform an analysis in terms of functional (gene-centric) metagenomic dissimilarities? It seems that the authors only considered 100 million reads per sample anyway, so it should be feasible to annotate those and compare KO tables between samples. This would aid in the ecological interpretation of their findings. It would also facilitate comparison to other recent function-focused studies of marine microbial biogeography, such as [Ramírez-Flandes et al. 2019, DOI:10.1073/pnas.1817554116] or [Coles et al. 2017, DOI:10.1126/science.aan5712].</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The authors of the Tara Ocean consortium used this unique metagenomics data set of plankton size classes to test whether global biogeographic patterns exist and how these patterns are affected or even structured by global ocean currents. This data set of six size classes including viruses (&lt;0.2 µm), pico- and nanoplankton (prokaryotes, protists), micro- and macroplankton (protists, metazoans) up to a size of 2 mm is really unique for such an effort. It provides a unified basis by using genomic DNA in all size fractions and thus avoids biases related to methodological differences of how the plankton communities of the different size classes were analyzed. By using station- and satellite-based metadata and correlating the metagenomic data of the stations and their dissimilarities to water mass transport derived from the MITgcm global ocean current model, the authors find global biogeographic patterns. Interestingly, these patterns of the different size classes are positively correlated to the minimum travel time of water masses up to 1.5 years, suggesting that biogeographic provinces evolve and presumably persist over this time span. Beyond, other factors become more important, such as temperature or the nutrient regime. The data also show that the scale of the biogeographic patterns is inversely related to the size classes. Further, a hierarchical cluster analysis of the metagenomics data of the different size classes yielded global genomic provinces which grouped together stations of related environmental and biogeochemical properties beyond water masses.</p><p>The statistical evaluation is very rigorous and for various correlations multiple and different analyses have been performed. The pairwise dissimilarity analysis of stations was done both for the metagenomics and OTU data yielding basically similar results and thus confirming the validity of the outcome.</p><p>Because of the novelty of this analytical approach this study may become seminal for further similar analyses. In order to become a really solid basis for such future analyses I suggest that the authors should consider the following critical points to further improve the study and to revise the manuscript accordingly.</p><p>1. I tried to find specifications for sampling of the larger plankton size classes in this manuscript and other Tara Ocean publications. According to the available information metazoans were also collected from Niskin bottles. If this is correct it means that only rather few organisms per sample and depth were collected, assuming a total abundance of &lt;20 animals per liter in oligotrophic regions. So the questions arises how reliable the data on the larger size classes are for individual taxa compared to the smaller size classes where this point is not an issue. Usually zooplankton is collected by net hauls to obtain enough material. However, if net hauls are used they integrate over sections of the water column and it is impossible to sample a particular depth such as DCM. This point may also be an issue for the cluster analysis of the genomic provinces.</p><p>2. The cluster analysis of the genomic provinces shows that at quite a few stations the sample near the surface and at the DCM affiliates to different provinces. For the analysis of the water transport the surface layer of the MITgcm model was used. However it is known that current velocity and direction near the surface and at lower depths of the mixed layer may diverge, in particular towards the equatorial currents (Cravatte et al. 2017, J. Phys. Oceanogr. 47: 2305, DOI: 10.1175/JPO-D-17-0043.1; Hu et al. 2020, Sci. Adv. : eaax7727, DOI: 10.1126/sciadv.aax7727). How would the water transport and plankton dispersal change if only the near surface samples were used for this analysis (which would be the correct way for this analysis) or if this analysis were done with the MITgcm model for the depth section of the DCM (which would imply a reduced number of stations and an adjustment of depths because the depth of the DCM was variable)?</p><p>3. Stations in oceanic gyres dominate the sampling grid of the Tara Ocean expedition and stations in coastal and equatorial upwelling regions are greatly underrepresented. Therefore, and based on some discussion in the manuscript, the impression emerges that the biogeographic patterns and their relationship to Tmin is mainly true for oceanic gyres. I suggest that the authors should elaborate on this point and may also consider these constraints in their biogeographic analysis.</p><p>4. An important outcome of the study are the different scales of the dispersal of the size classes with Tmin. In a previous publication of the Tara Ocean consortium (Sunagawa et al. 2015, Figure 4B) they show a plot of an increasing dissimilarity of the prokaryotic communities with distance up to appr. 5000 km. In this manuscript the authors mention that they calculated correlations of the dissimilarities with distance for the different size classes but do not show any data. The study would greatly benefit when they show these plots for the different size classes which should yield different patterns. The distance of 5000 km may relate to the travel time of 1.5 years over an oceanic gyre.</p><p>In addition further recommendations are as follows:</p><p>l. 180-183, 195-199 and other places: There are quite a few genomic provinces of the prokaryotic and protest enriched size classes which go far beyond one ocean basin and even occur at one station near the surface and at the DCM. So be more precise in describing these features. Howe would you cope with genomic provinces which encompass similar stations but in corresponding gyres of the northern and southern hemispheres?</p><p>l. 181: delete &quot;to&quot; in this part of the sentence:.….tended to be limited to a single ocean basin and [TO] approximately correspond to…</p><p>l. 366: must be &quot;….the same number of reads WAS used….&quot;</p><p>l. 1019-1024: You hypothesize that the travel time of 1.5 years is equivalent to the time needed for crossing an oceanic gyre. I assume that this must not remain a hypothesis because I am convinced that ground truth data exist which provide such travel times, may be from the Argo floats program.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>This is another contribution from the Tara consortium and collaborators, in this case, they try to correlate ocean circulation with plankton biogeography. They have done a number of statistical comparisons using metagenomic data to analyze the effect of a parameter that they call Tmin, the minimal travel time, an estimation of the time that would transfer a water volume from one station to another as deduced from the expected water-mass movement. The problem of this approach (as with previous Tara papers in the view of this reviewer) is the random distribution of Tara stations at similar latitudes and (largely) from the surface and at different seasons. They contemplate the ocean as a two-dimensional system, largely ignoring the third dimension (depth) and the water column stratification that appears at most of these stations seasonally. Surface water movements have been considered without regard to the potentially more important vertical ones that happen when the water column mixes in colder seasons. Thus, their conclusions are flawed by a poor sampling strategy. The authors could have used more structured sampling efforts such as Geotraces, at least to check their overarching conclusions.</p><p>A second major flaw of this work is that the main source of information is what they call &quot;metagenomic dissimilarity&quot;. It is actually the reciprocal of the ratio of shared (100% identity) 31 nucleotide K-mers between stations out of a pool of several million Illumina reads. This is a quite rough estimate of similarity that does not contemplate the nuances of genome features from virus to zooplankton. For example, the presence of IS or related elements in prokaryotic genomes might bias this parameter strongly, as would the presence of multiple repeats of rRNA genes in eukaryotic cells. The biological significance of metagenomic dissimilarity should be carefully assessed. I do not imply that it cannot be used, but to reach conclusions of such weight (&quot;oceanic genomic provinces&quot;) a much more refined sampling strategy and analysis of the data would have been required. For example, why were the myriad of MAGs derived from prokaryotes and viruses at different geographical sites not considered? At least as a control for their claims. Actually, the several reports of nearly identical genomes at different oceanic provinces points towards the opposite.

What follows is the authors’ response to the first round of review.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Richter and colleagues present a large-scale analysis of metagenomic, OTU and imaging data collected from &gt;100 ocean locations worldwide, with the purpose of elucidating the role of large-scale currents on global-scale marine plankton biogeography. The topic is exciting and timely, and should be of broad interest to the fields of marine microbiology, biological oceanography, plankton ecology and physical oceanography. One strong aspect of this study is that it compares community dissimilarities with travel times computed from a global ocean circulation model, rather than simply considering geodesic distances between locations. The data included with this manuscript will also likely be of great value to other research groups. There are, however, substantial concerns regarding the methodology and the conclusions that can be drawn from the work. A specific concern regards the use of 31 bp k-mers for calculating metagenomic dissimilarities and the difficulty of interpreting such dissimilarities biologically, given the many nuances of genome features from viruses to zooplankton. Concerns were also raised regarding the calculation of Tmin based on the surface layer, given that current velocity and direction near the surface and at lower depths of the mixed layer may diverge. Finally, there were questions about the relatively narrow distribution of Tara Oceans samples from similar latitudes and (largely) from the surface, and the fact that different locations were sampled at different seasons (which influence the extent of stratification).</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the interest of the editor and the reviewers in our work, and we thank them for their time in evaluating our manuscript. In our response and in the associated modifications to our manuscript, we believe that we adequately address all of the concerns that they raised. We address each point in detail below as part of our response; here, we present general responses to the three main concerns raised in this summary.</p><p>1. The use of 31 bp k-mers</p><p>Although the principal focus of our manuscript is the analysis of metagenomes using k-mers, we confirmed all main results with OTUs and with imaging data (both of which provide different levels of taxonomic resolution from one another and from metagenomes) and, for the 20-180 µm size fraction, metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs).</p><p>We are aware that the probability of finding common 31 bp k-mers in a pair of communities depends not only on community composition, but also on other factors such as the size and complexity of their genomes. For example, the presence of abundant species with small genomes would increase the probability of finding a match (see also Figure 1—figure supplement 3b). For this reason, we performed the same analyses using OTUs for all size fractions, resulting in the same principal conclusions. In the main text, we focused on results based on k-mers because we obtained better correlation values for most plankton size fractions, which we hypothesize is due to the higher resolution of genomic data.</p><p>In addition to OTUs, we validated our results using imagery data collected for organisms 200 µm and larger. We show that for the larger size fractions, community dissimilarities based on k-mers, imagery and OTUs are well correlated (Figure 1—figure supplement 2). However, the correlation of imagery data with environmental parameters and T<sub>min</sub> is lower (Figure 3—figure supplement 1). We expected these lower correlations due to the much higher resolution of genomic data (see also Supplementary Information 1 for a similar argument for OTU data). In brief, for the largest size fractions, computing community similarities using imagery, OTUs and k-mers provides different tradeoffs between sampling depth and resolution. Our analysis shows that the three estimates are well correlated, but that k-mers from metagenomes provide better correlations with T<sub>min</sub> and with variations in environmental conditions, most likely due to their higher resolution.</p><p>We also believe that this empirical demonstration of using k-mers to highlight Lagrangian variation of plankton communities at genomic resolution – at least as efficient as OTU data and more efficient than imagery – will greatly facilitate future ecological surveys and open the door to novel ocean monitoring that is becoming more and more accessible due to improvements in DNA sequencing technology. Indeed, k-mers provide unequivocal information on the occupancy of specific genomes, as they are tracers made of fragments of organismal genomic DNA.</p><p>2. The calculation of T<sub>min</sub> based on the surface layer</p><p>In this work, our goal was to analyze the contribution of surface horizontal currents to plankton biogeography. Other types of water movement certainly exist, and impact plankton biogeography. In our analyses, we do not perform a comparison of types of water movement. Instead, we focus on surface currents. We show throughout our manuscript that two-dimensional surface currents already have enough information to highlight surface plankton dynamics and that surface currents modulate, in a specific way, organismal distribution and, therefore, plankton biogeography. We believe that the relative contributions of other types of water movement (which, together with biotic responses, are very likely the source of the variations not explained by surface currents), is an appropriate and interesting topic for future studies.</p><p>3. The spatial and temporal distribution of <italic>Tara</italic> Oceans samples</p><p>We acknowledge that the geographical sampling of our data set, although of a global scale, is not exhaustive, as a consequence of the current limitations on genomic sequencing and practical (i.e., time) limitations on collecting samples with a sailing boat. Oceanic areas such as coastal regions and closed seas were not considered.</p><p>However, there is nothing particular about the transport in the regions that we</p><p>sampled that should prevent us from extrapolating our conclusions to other pelagic regions. It is worth noting that the link between dissimilarity and T<sub>min</sub> holds true independent of the starting point, suggesting the potential existence of a general effect on community composition transported by currents within typical basin time scales. We supported this with a local demonstration of our global conclusions by focusing on the North Atlantic subtropical gyre, where sampling is very close to the Gulf Stream and where the correlation values between dissimilarity and T<sub>min</sub> ranged between 0.44 and 0.86 (Figure 2—figure supplement 2). Furthermore, we performed several tests to address the effects of seasonality of our samples (described in more detail in our response below).</p><p>In our work, we tested 2 clear hypothesis and explained the results of these tests as follows: (1) the combination of large-scale spatio-temporal sampling with metagenomics permits the study of biogeographical patterns at basin and sub-basin scales, because these patterns overlay fluctuations at smaller scales, and the nature of genomic DNA makes it an excellent tracer of community composition, which requires zero <italic>a priori</italic> knowledge; (2) T<sub>min</sub> (of horizontal surface currents) explains a significant part of plankton biogeographical variation (and is superior to the shortest geographical distance without crossing land).</p><p>For all three points above, even if our measurements of both metagenomic dissimilarity and T<sub>min</sub> are the result of substantial approximations, we still find strong correlations between the two, with global values not previously reached in the literature (see lines 211-216 of the submitted version of the manuscript, unchanged in lines 224-228 of the revised manuscript). Thus, instead, we propose that our results should be interpreted in the converse manner: despite all of these potential approximations and/or biases, we found a strong, statistically significant relationship, which means that these approximations/biases are likely to be second-order in terms of explaining pelagic plankton dynamics.</p><p>We revised our manuscript to emphasize these ideas, and to respond in detail to the reviewers’ suggestions (as described in our point-by-point response below).</p><p>Finally, two general notes on our manuscript: first, due to an unfortunate find/replace error when reformatting our bioRxiv manuscript for submission to <italic>eLife</italic>, the titles of the 10 figure supplements were not updated in the legends associated with each figure. We have corrected this error in the revised version of our manuscript. Second, we discovered a versioning issue that affected some data matrices used in our analysis. We made minor changes to Figure 2a, Figure 3, Figure 2—figure supplement 1 and Figure 3—figure supplement 1 to correct this issue by updating them to the most recent version of the data matrices (available via our FigShare repository, DOI: 10.6084/m9.figshare.11303177). These updates did not result in any substantial changes to figure interpretation or conclusions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>1. One strong aspect of this study is that it compares community dissimilarities with travel times computed from a global ocean circulation model, which arguably makes more sense than simply considering geodesic distances between locations (as most previous studies have done). The data included with this manuscript will also be of great value to other research groups.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s positive comments on our approach and on our data set.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The authors have shown that travel time correlates strongly with metagenomic community dissimilarities (lines 208-209), but they also found strong correlations between travel time and environmental differences (lines 232-233), and correlations between metagenomic differences and environmental differences (Figure 3 and lines 191-192). They also found that their genomic provinces often matched environmental differences. This begs the question to what extent the genomic provinces are caused by circulation within the provinces (which probably &quot;homogenizes&quot; communities within a province) rather than simply environmental differences between provinces (or environmental homogeneity within provinces). In other words, even if there was no circulation (thus communities are entirely determined by local environmental conditions), would we still expect to see the genomic provinces that the authors found? I would have expected a strong discussion on disentangling environmental selection effects from dispersal effects. The authors do marginally touch upon this issue by calculating partial correlations (Supplemental Figure S9), but they don't discuss this at all in the main text. Their Supplemental Figure S9c actually suggests that correlations between metagenomic dissimilarities and environmental differences (temperature and/or nutrients), when controlling for Tmin, are often stronger than correlations between metagenomic dissimilarities and Tmin (when controlling for temperature and nutrients). This might suggest that for some size classes genomic provinces are mostly caused by environmental homogeneity within basins/provinces, rather than the homogenizing action of currents. As it stands, I find the take-home messages of the paper rather vague and inconclusive from a mechanistic (i.e., rather than descriptive) point of view.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer makes an important point, and we apologize for not being clearer in the manuscript. Our results indeed highlight a strongly correlated T<sub>min</sub>/genetic dissimilarity/environmental conditions system which could invite the use of statistical methods for studying the independent effects of environmental conditions and circulation. However, as we explain in our manuscript and below, most or even all environmental parameters are not independent from currents; together, they are interlinked parts of the seascape. In our manuscript, we introduce the idea of using T<sub>min</sub> as a framework for interpreting plankton dynamics (that is, a given window of time to study effects of physical and biological processes in plankton community composition), rather than as a physical variable itself. As noted by the reviewer, we included partial correlations in a supplementary figure in order to demonstrate that they do not affect the maximum correlation of community dissimilarity with T<sub>min</sub> for T<sub>min</sub> &lt; ~1.5 years. However, we believe that, beyond this, using the results of partial correlations to draw broader conclusions from our data would be inappropriate, for three main reasons:</p><p>1. When dealing with strongly non-linear relationships, partial correlation can easily lead to interpretation problems (Vargha <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013 DOI 10.1007/s11135-012-9727-y). Temperature, to cite one example, has a known non-linear relationship with plankton growth (Eppley, “Temperature and phytoplankton growth in the sea”, 1972, Fish. Bull. 70(4), pp. 1063-1085). Most importantly, in a strongly correlated T<sub>min</sub>/genetic dissimilarity/environmental conditions system where all parameters are equivalently correlated to each other, it appears very difficult to infer who is the egg and who is the chicken given the current limitations of our data set.</p><p>2. Homogenization is not the only effect induced by currents. At mesoscale, currents also induce shearing of communities (i.e. heterogenization) just like when stirring a blob of honey in yogurt. Honey will first be stretched into filaments (heterogenization) before being diffused out on a longer timescale (homogenization). In our data set, it is impossible to disentangle the effect of stirring from the effect of diffusion on the scale of plankton communities, as it would have required us to sample all oceans at all times.</p><p>3. Finally, it would be overly reductive to interpret T<sub>min</sub> as simply a proxy for the physical effect of currents on plankton distribution/displacement. Indeed, the primary components of the local environment are also transported together with plankton communities (nutrients, heat), as described at the beginning of the submitted version of our paper (lines 111-120, and references therein), and as we demonstrated in our data (Figure 3, purple line, where the correlation of nutrient concentrations and T<sub>min</sub> also shows a peak at T<sub>min</sub> &lt; 1.5 years). In this framework, T<sub>min</sub> therefore captures both the variation in environmental conditions and the variation in plankton communities due</p><p>to changes in environmental conditions. Hence, T<sub>min</sub> does not isolate the physical effects of currents on plankton communities but instead represents the appropriate framework to capture plankton dynamics (emerging from environmental conditions/biotic interactions/effects of currents) during travel in the oceans (see also: Lévy <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014 DOI: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1215/21573689-2768549">10.1215/21573689-2768549</ext-link> and Dutkiewicz <italic>et al.</italic>, 2020 DOI: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-17-609-2020">10.5194/bg-17-609-2020</ext-link> on the stretching of plankton niches by transport).</p><p>An important consequence of T<sub>min</sub> being a framework for plankton dynamics rather than a proxy for physical effects is that even if we start with the hypothesis that stirring and dispersal have no effect on plankton composition, T<sub>min</sub> would still be correlated with plankton dissimilarities and environmental conditions, since the simple role of conveyor of currents would still have a major impact on plankton biogeography, as they transport both plankton and nutrients and hence stretch the regions where a given plankton community would live. Without transport, plankton biogeography would certainly be different as the timescale of diffusivity is much longer than that of currents, and major paths such as the Gulf Stream in the Atlantic (see Figure 2b) would disappear.</p><p>In other words, while not being able to statistically disentangle all biophysicochemical effects on plankton dissimilarities, we nonetheless present results that provide some hints about the mechanism of the causal relationships in the T<sub>min</sub>/genetic dissimilarity/environmental conditions system. First, cumulative correlations clearly detect at genomic resolution plankton dynamics and environmental conditions dynamics, and second, the PCoA-RGB maps of nutrients and temperatures show patterns that are clearly similar to those of plankton communities, with differences according to size fraction (see Figure 1—figure supplement 4). While not a formal disentanglement, such results suggest that the main effect of currents is that of a conveyor transporting the plankton/nutrients ecosystem, which experiences variations in temperature as it travels, or at least that effects of diffusion and stirring on plankton and nutrients are equivalent and therefore can’t be isolated.</p><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out that a distinct statement of the mechanism for our hypothesis was previously missing from the main text. To address this issue, we modified the text (lines 285-298 and lines 338-348) to clarify the mechanistic basis for the hypothesis we proposed to explain plankton biogeography, as follows:</p><p>Lines 285-298: “We present the following hypothesis as a potential mechanism for the partitioning of the global ocean into genomic provinces. The relatively large separation (in terms of transport time and season) among sampling stations allowed us to detect the large-scale effects of ocean circulation, which are superimposed on smaller-scale effects such as local patchiness and seasonality (as previously observed (Longhurst, 2006; Reygondeau et al., 2013)). Within ocean basins, as the intertwined dynamics of plankton and chemistry continuously occur along transport, smooth variations have emerged due to the periodic recirculation of within-basin currents. This leads to stable, continuous patterns of changes in community structure and nutrient concentrations, and also explains how temporally stable genomic provinces can exist in the face of ocean currents. Among ocean basins, depending on the sensitivity to the environment of a plankton community, higher heterogeneity in environmental conditions across different circulation patterns can disrupt the equilibrium of seascape processes within a given continuum, leading to a global delimitation into distinguishable ecological continua among different large-scale current systems, resulting in the genomic provinces that we detected.”</p><p>Lines 338-348: “Using analysis of standardized metagenomic data together with environmental and physical data, we reveal that, in a background of significant local patchiness, the integration of seascape physical, chemical and biological processes over time and space produces a quasi-stationary biological partitioning of the oceans that supersedes short-term variability and seasonal cycles, ultimately generating global biogeographical patterns. Although the strong cross-coupling among our metagenomic, environmental and physical data prevents a systematic disentangling of their various influences, we hypothesize that transport by ocean currents acts essentially as a conveyor on which interacting environmental and biological effects are layered. In this hypothesis, direct effects of currents (such as turbulent diffusivity) on plankton composition are secondary, and instead environmental and biological effects occurring during transport result in the emergence of a global plankton biogeography.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The authors calculate metagenomic dissimilarities with Simka based on counts of 31bp-k-mers (instead of, say, species counts or gene ortholog counts). While this is computationally efficient, it makes a biological interpretation of their metagenomic β-diversity hard. The original Simka paper demonstrated that k-mer distances correlate with taxonomic distance matrixes, but they don't seem to examine the relationship between k-mer dissimilarities and function-centric dissimilarities, i.e., dissimilarities in metabolic functions (as inferred by functionally annotating metagenomic reads or contigs). I suspect that k-mer-based distances may not correlate well with function-based dissimilarities.</p></disp-quote><p>First, regarding the use of species counts, we note that we presented confirmations of all principal results of our paper using species counts (as represented by OTUs).</p><p>We agree with the reviewer that a biogeography of metabolic functions would be an interesting complement to our analyses. In fact, we attempted such a comparison in the early stages of our analysis (see below). We note, however, that it represents a different scale of evolution. Using DNA fragments (approximated by billions of 31 base pair kmers per sample) provides a very high resolution of single-base changes in plankton genomes, which are likely to be the result of individual mutations during organismal evolution. Single-base changes carry the fine-scale record of selection by environmental and biological factors at a genomic level. A gene function analysis would test different hypotheses relating to a different scale of genome evolution; that is, they would relate to the maintenance (or not) of the gene repertoire of the members of a community. In our manuscript, we show using correlation analyses that the single-base level of resolution is more appropriate than either OTUs or image-based morphology for studying the effects of circulation and environmental variation. As we wrote in our manuscript (and in the related manuscript Frémont <italic>et al.</italic> 2020, DOI: 10.1101/2020.10.20.347237) we believe this is because genomic polymorphism carries a more detailed record of past environmental pressure (although the distribution of this polymorphism is not necessarily the direct result of the environmental variation we observed; selection, if it exerted an influence on a given site, could have acted at another point in space or time, or on another, linked position in the genome).</p><p>Regarding the analysis of function-based dissimilarities itself, unfortunately, the vast majority of microbial plankton genomic sequence is novel, especially within eukaryotes, and is distant enough from any sequenced species that it cannot be assigned a function by sequence similarity. Therefore, we attempted this approach and we were unsuccessful, as we were unable to retrieve a sufficient proportion of annotated sequence reads (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="sa2table1">Author response table 1</xref>). This effect was especially evident in the larger, eukaryote-enriched size fractions, likely for two reasons. First, eukaryotic genomes are generally larger and contain a substantially larger proportion of non-coding versus coding DNA (which itself could introduce a potential source of bias, as this fraction is known to vary by several orders of magnitude among plankton lineages; we note that an analysis based on randomly selected k-mers in the genome regardless of their coding potential, as we performed, should not be affected by such a bias, as we demonstrate by confirming our main conclusions using OTU and imaging data). Second, even the sequences within coding regions frequently show little similarity to any known sequence (Carradec <italic>et al.</italic>, 2018 DOI: 10.1038/s41467-017-02342-1).</p><p>We attempted to functionally characterize genomic provinces in the eukaryote-enriched size fractions by mapping the set of reads present in all metagenomes within the province against sequences with functional annotations from the published <italic>Tara</italic> Oceans metatranscriptome gene set (Carradec <italic>et al.</italic>, 2018) of 116 million unigenes.

Furthermore, there are highly uneven levels of annotation among different eukaryotic lineages, which could lead to significant biases.

This would result in relatively well annotated metagenomes for samples consisting mostly of animal sequences, and few or no annotations for samples consisting mostly of collodarian sequences (with the few available annotations biased towards genes with more highly conserved sequences).</p><p>For this reason, previous functional studies on marine metagenomes have been focused on prokaryotes (e.g., Ramírez-Flandes <italic>et al.</italic>, 2019 DOI: 10.1073/pnas.1817554116, Ulstick <italic>et al.</italic>, 2021 DOI: 10.1126/science.abe6301, Faure <italic>et al.</italic>, 2021 DOI:10.1038/s41467-021-24547-1). We anticipate that functional studies of eukaryote metagenomes will become possible in the future, as the availability of reference genomes and functional annotations increases.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Recommendations for the authors</p><p>I strongly recommend that the authors provide a quantitative and thorough discussion of my point 2 in their main text.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s comments. We responded to point 2 above, and modified the main text as described in our response.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Related to point 3: Why not also perform an analysis in terms of functional (gene-centric) metagenomic dissimilarities? It seems that the authors only considered 100 million reads per sample anyway, so it should be feasible to annotate those and compare KO tables between samples. This would aid in the ecological interpretation of their findings. It would also facilitate comparison to other recent function-focused studies of marine microbial biogeography, such as [Ramírez-Flandes et al. 2019, DOI:10.1073/pnas.1817554116] or [Coles et al. 2017, DOI:10.1126/science.aan5712].</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that a functional comparison among metagenomes would also be of interest. As we explained in our response to point 3, this is not feasible given the current state of knowledge of eukaryotic genomes, compounded by the differences in current knowledge among different organismal sizes and classes (which could introduce a bias that our function-agnostic analyses were designed to avoid). We added a phrase in the conclusion of our paper (lines 351-354) to indicate that the reviewer’s proposal would be of interest in future studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>The authors of the Tara Ocean consortium used this unique metagenomics data set of plankton size classes to test whether global biogeographic patterns exist and how these patterns are affected or even structured by global ocean currents. This data set of six size classes including viruses (&lt;0.2 µm), pico- and nanoplankton (prokaryotes, protists), micro- and macroplankton (protists, metazoans) up to a size of 2 mm is really unique for such an effort. It provides a unified basis by using genomic DNA in all size fractions and thus avoids biases related to methodological differences of how the plankton communities of the different size classes were analyzed. By using station- and satellite-based metadata and correlating the metagenomic data of the stations and their dissimilarities to water mass transport derived from the MITgcm global ocean current model, the authors find global biogeographic patterns. Interestingly, these patterns of the different size classes are positively correlated to the minimum travel time of water masses up to 1.5 years, suggesting that biogeographic provinces evolve and presumably persist over this time span. Beyond, other factors become more important, such as temperature or the nutrient regime. The data also show that the scale of the biogeographic patterns is inversely related to the size classes. Further, a hierarchical cluster analysis of the metagenomics data of the different size classes yielded global genomic provinces which grouped together stations of related environmental and biogeochemical properties beyond water masses.</p><p>The statistical evaluation is very rigorous and for various correlations multiple and different analyses have been performed. The pairwise dissimilarity analysis of stations was done both for the metagenomics and OTU data yielding basically similar results and thus confirming the validity of the outcome.</p><p>Because of the novelty of this analytical approach this study may become seminal for further similar analyses. In order to become a really solid basis for such future analyses I suggest that the authors should consider the following critical points to further improve the study and to revise the manuscript accordingly.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their positive comments on our results and methodology. We respond to their suggestions below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. I tried to find specifications for sampling of the larger plankton size classes in this manuscript and other Tara Ocean publications. According to the available information metazoans were also collected from Niskin bottles. If this is correct it means that only rather few organisms per sample and depth were collected, assuming a total abundance of &lt;20 animals per liter in oligotrophic regions. So the questions arises how reliable the data on the larger size classes are for individual taxa compared to the smaller size classes where this point is not an issue. Usually zooplankton is collected by net hauls to obtain enough material. However, if net hauls are used they integrate over sections of the water column and it is impossible to sample a particular depth such as DCM. This point may also be an issue for the cluster analysis of the genomic provinces.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is absolutely correct that different protocols are required to capture the diversity of smaller and larger plankton. But <italic>Tara</italic> Oceans sampling protocols were in fact designed to sample organisms larger than 20 μm with nets. The sampling protocols and the reasoning behind them are described in the manuscript we cited in the Methods section (lines 328-330 of our initial submission and 370-372 of the revised submission; Pesant <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015 DOI: 10.1038/sdata.2015.23, section 6). This is accompanied by an extensive technical validation section in the same manuscript. Unfortunately, due to the large size and scope of the <italic>Tara</italic> Oceans expedition, it was not possible to include a detailed description of the validation of the sampling protocols in our manuscript.</p><p>Specific protocols were in place to address multiple considerations related to the use of plankton nets: sampling depth, method of towing the net (oblique/vertical/horizontal), speed of towing the net, and time of day (i.e., day vs. night). For the net sampling of the larger size fractions of plankton communities analyzed in our manuscript, “Nets were lowered to the selected environmental feature and towed horizontally for 5-15 min at a speed of 0.3 m/s” (Pesant <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015). Environmental features included both the surface and DCM (described in section 5 of the paper). Thus, every effort was made to ensure an appropriate sampling of plankton of different sizes at particular depths.</p><p>Therefore, while we understand the concerns of the reviewer regarding possible small volumes of water sampled for our larger size fractions of plankton and regarding potential sampling bias for DCM, these were not the case (importantly, we also note that most analyses and conclusions presented in our paper concern surface samples only).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The cluster analysis of the genomic provinces shows that at quite a few stations the sample near the surface and at the DCM affiliates to different provinces. For the analysis of the water transport the surface layer of the MITgcm model was used. However it is known that current velocity and direction near the surface and at lower depths of the mixed layer may diverge, in particular towards the equatorial currents (Cravatte et al. 2017, J. Phys. Oceanogr. 47: 2305, DOI: 10.1175/JPO-D-17-0043.1; Hu et al. 2020, Sci. Adv. : eaax7727, DOI: 10.1126/sciadv.aax7727). How would the water transport and plankton dispersal change if only the near surface samples were used for this analysis (which would be the correct way for this analysis) or if this analysis were done with the MITgcm model for the depth section of the DCM (which would imply a reduced number of stations and an adjustment of depths because the depth of the DCM was variable)?</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer makes two suggestions. First, the reviewer suggests that we restrict our correlation analyses to surface samples. In fact, this is what we did, as described in the Methods (lines 516-519 of our initial submission): “We calculated rank-based Spearman correlations between β-diversity, T<sub>min</sub> and environmental parameters (…) for surface samples with a Mantel test with 1,000 permutations and a nominal significance threshold of p &lt; 0.01.” We clarified this statement by modifying this section of the Methods in our revised manuscript (lines 555-556), which now begins: “Our correlation analyses were restricted to <italic>Tara</italic> Oceans samples collected at the surface, and did not include DCM samples.”</p><p>Second, the reviewer suggests that we compare a simulation of travel times at the depth of the DCM to the samples collected at the DCM. Unfortunately, due to computational limitations, even given the significant resources available to our colleagues at MIT who performed the simulation, it was not possible to produce a simulation using the MITgcm with a variable depth matching the depth of the DCM at each simulated position. However, our colleagues did produce a simulation at a fixed depth of 75 meters, well below the impact of the wind (i.e., below the core of the Ekman layer in most cases; see also the introductory comments above in our response). We did not present analyses of the 75 meter simulation in our initial submission due to space limitations. The simulation depth is roughly equivalent to the median DCM depth of 58 meters in the samples we analyzed (calculated from depth data available in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Data_from_Genomic_evidence_for_global_ocean_plankton_biogeography_shaped_by_large-scale_current_systems/11303177?file=25891491">Supplementary Table 2</ext-link>). To address the reviewer’s concern, we performed a correlation analysis of β-diversity for DCM samples and T<sub>min</sub> from the 75 meter depth simulation. <xref ref-type="table" rid="sa2table2">Author response table 2</xref> shows Spearman correlation values and the number of stations in each calculation, in comparison to the original surface/surface correlations:</p><table-wrap id="sa2table2" position="float"><label>Author response table 2.</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th rowspan="1" valign="bottom">Size Fraction (µm)</th><th rowspan="1" colspan="2" valign="bottom">Surface</th><th rowspan="1" colspan="2" valign="bottom">DCM</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">Correlation</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">No. Stations</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Correlation</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">No. Stations</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">0-0.2</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">0.55</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">40</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">0.63</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">32</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">0.22-1.6/3</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">0.44</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">62</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">0.40</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">45</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">0.8-5</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">0.46</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">77</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">0.50</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">53</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">5-20</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">0.33</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">50</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">0.43</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">31</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">20-180</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">0.38</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">80</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">0.38</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">44</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">180-2000</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">0.45</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">80</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">0.43</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">54</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>It can be seen that, globally, the correlation levels we observe between DCM samples and the DCM simulation are comparable to those between surface samples and the surface simulation. As correctly noted by the reviewer, there are fewer DCM samples available for comparison. This relative lack of samples prevents us from presenting a cumulative correlation analysis for the DCM (as in Figure 2a for surface samples), since the paucity of samples in ranges of T<sub>min</sub> resulted in correlations which were not significant at our nominal threshold of p &lt; 0.01.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Stations in oceanic gyres dominate the sampling grid of the Tara Ocean expedition and stations in coastal and equatorial upwelling regions are greatly underrepresented. Therefore, and based on some discussion in the manuscript, the impression emerges that the biogeographic patterns and their relationship to Tmin is mainly true for oceanic gyres. I suggest that the authors should elaborate on this point and may also consider these constraints in their biogeographic analysis.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct to note that the relationship we describe between β-diversity and T<sub>min</sub> is true for open ocean samples, and not for coastal/upwelling samples. In fact, our correlation analyses explicitly excluded samples outside the open ocean, as we described in the Methods section (lines 512-513 of our initial submission, lines 556-558 of the revised submission): “We excluded stations that were not from open ocean locations from correlation analyses to avoid sites impacted by coastal processes.”</p><p>Our biogeographic analyses included all samples, including coastal samples. We discussed the relationship between upwelling zones and genomic provinces inSupplementary Information 4 (lines 955-985 of our initial submission, lines 1015-1060 of our revised submission).</p><p>In order to clarify the text in response to the comment raised by the reviewer, we revised the main text in the following locations:</p><p>Lines 129-134: “Our sampling largely focused on open ocean sites located in the main gyres, but also included other areas with distinct oceanographic features, such as coastal upwelling zones and lagoons (Figure 1—figure supplement 1b). We chose to study biogeographic patterns along large-scale currents in the principal oceanic gyres, with counterpoints to other oceanographic features in which the influence of ocean transport by the main currents is likely to be relatively weaker, such as upwellings.”</p><p>Lines 183-186: “Although the large majority of our samples were located in oceanic gyres, samples located in physically distant zones but with shared environmental conditions, such as oceanic upwellings, also grouped together (for example, genomic province B6 in the bacterial-enriched size fraction).”</p><p>Lines 337-338: “In this study, we provide genomic evidence for an organism size-dependent global-scale open ocean plankton biogeography shaped by currents.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. An important outcome of the study are the different scales of the dispersal of the size classes with Tmin. In a previous publication of the Tara Ocean consortium (Sunagawa et al. 2015, Figure 4B) they show a plot of an increasing dissimilarity of the prokaryotic communities with distance up to appr. 5000 km. In this manuscript the authors mention that they calculated correlations of the dissimilarities with distance for the different size classes but do not show any data. The study would greatly benefit when they show these plots for the different size classes which should yield different patterns. The distance of 5000 km may relate to the travel time of 1.5 years over an oceanic gyre.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that it is important to show the relationship between β-diversity and geographic distance. In fact, we presented this analysis in our initial submission (lines 218-220; lines 232-234 of the revised submission): “In contrast, no such unimodal pattern was found for correlations between metagenomic dissimilarity and geographic distance (without traversing land; Figure 3—figure supplement 1f).” The accompanying figure shows the cumulative correlation of geographic distance and β-diversity, as measured by metagenomic dissimilarity for all 6 organismal size fractions, and estimated from imaging data.</p><p>The distance of 5,000 kilometers is indeed on the order of the distance to cross an oceanic gyre. Nonetheless, Figure 3—figure supplement 1f shows that geographic distance is not the appropriate framework for studying differences in plankton genomic community composition. Instead, our results demonstrate that travel time is the appropriate framework to use. To respond to the reviewer’s comment, we modified the main text as follows (lines 251-252): “Up to ~1.5 years of travel time, the timescale of large-scale transport is therefore the appropriate framework for studying differences in plankton genomic community composition (Figure 2b).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In addition further recommendations are as follows:</p><p>l. 180-183, 195-199 and other places: There are quite a few genomic provinces of the prokaryotic and protest enriched size classes which go far beyond one ocean basin and even occur at one station near the surface and at the DCM. So be more precise in describing these features. Howe would you cope with genomic provinces which encompass similar stations but in corresponding gyres of the northern and southern hemispheres?</p></disp-quote><p>This is an astute observation on the part of the reviewer. In our opinion, this demonstrates that the genomic provinces that we defined based on pairwise similarity are not limited to samples collected at geographically close stations. Instead, this shows that the data we analyze represent community similarities at a spatio-temporal scale overlying the influences on variation at more local scales. This is complementary with the observation that upwelling stations are located in the same genomic provinces, despite being separated by very large geographic distances (in this case, the role of surface connectivity is eclipsed by strong variation in local environmental conditions).</p><p>In the main text of the paper, we focus mainly on biogeographical patterns for surface samples and their comparison to travel time simulated at the surface. In order to avoid confusion, we discuss the biogeography of DCM samples in the supplementary information. We modified the supplementary information to respond to the reviewer’s comment regarding stations whose surface and DCM samples were in the same genomic province, in Supplementary Information 3 (lines 1006-1013), as follows: “Although our analyses of the influence of transport and other environmental conditions on plankton biogeography are focused on surface samples (the depth at which our simulations of transport were conducted), we included samples collected at the deep chlorophyll maximum (DCM) in our genomic provinces in order to produce a broader description of plankton biogeography. In general, samples at the surface and DCM from the same station clustered together in the same genomic provinces, although we observed a minority of cases in which surface and DCM samples from the same station were found in different genomic provinces, and even a few genomic provinces composed only of DCM samples (e.g., C6 in the 0.8-5 µm size fraction; Figure 1—figure supplement 4).”</p><p>To further address the reviewer’s point, we modified lines 183-186 of the text in order to be more precise in describing genomic provinces, as follows: “Although the large majority of our samples were located in oceanic gyres, samples located in physically distant zones but with shared environmental conditions, such as oceanic upwellings, also grouped together (for example, genomic province B6 in the bacterial-enriched size fraction).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>l. 181: delete &quot;to&quot; in this part of the sentence:.….tended to be limited to a single ocean basin and [TO] approximately correspond to…</p></disp-quote><p>In this sentence, we chose to employ “to” as a syntactic marker of the infinitive in the clause that follows the coordinating conjunction (“and”).

In agreement with the reviewer’s statement, in our hypothesis, we take the average crossing time of an ocean gyre as an assumption. However, the hypothesis does not depend on the exact crossing time of an ocean gyre, <italic>per se</italic>. To clarify this point, we have reorganized this paragraph to remove direct references to a fixed travel time (lines 285-298).</p><p>The time estimate to cross the basins is based on assuming an average current velocity of 20 cm/s, which are the typical values for the mean surface currents (e.g., Lumpkin and Johnson, 2013 DOI: 10.1002/jgrc.20210). This gives a range of 6,000 km for the typical drift length, which compares with the longitudinal size of the N. Atlantic subtropical gyre (about 5,000 km). Notably, for the N. Atlantic subtropical gyre travel time, estimates from previous work on the European eel (based on otoliths and on high resolution Lagrangian computations) confirm our estimates, suggesting additionally that the eastward journey could be actually even faster (about 10 months) (Bonhommeau <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009 DOI:10.1111/j.1365-2419.2009.00517.x, Rodríguez-Díaz and Gómez-Gesteira, 2017 DOI:10.1016/j.seares.2017.06.010).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>This is another contribution from the Tara consortium and collaborators, in this case, they try to correlate ocean circulation with plankton biogeography. They have done a number of statistical comparisons using metagenomic data to analyze the effect of a parameter that they call Tmin, the minimal travel time, an estimation of the time that would transfer a water volume from one station to another as deduced from the expected water-mass movement. The problem of this approach (as with previous Tara papers in the view of this reviewer) is the random distribution of Tara stations at similar latitudes and (largely) from the surface and at different seasons. They contemplate the ocean as a two-dimensional system, largely ignoring the third dimension (depth) and the water column stratification that appears at most of these stations seasonally. Surface water movements have been considered without regard to the potentially more important vertical ones that happen when the water column mixes in colder seasons. Thus, their conclusions are flawed by a poor sampling strategy. The authors could have used more structured sampling efforts such as Geotraces, at least to check their overarching conclusions.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer raises 4 related concerns, which we address here. First, in our manuscript, we do not claim that horizontal transport explains all of plankton biogeography, nor that vertical transport does not have an influence. Instead, we find strong and statistically significant correlations between surface plankton community dissimilarity and travel times from simulations of horizontal transport at the surface (discussed in more detail in our responses to Reviewer #1). These correlation values surpass those from previous global-scale studies (see lines 211-216 of the submitted version of the manuscript, unchanged in lines 224-228 of the revised version). To us, this indicates that the analysis of transport by horizontal ocean currents can make a valuable contribution to understanding the forces that shape plankton community structure. It does not mean that other forces, such as vertical transport, do not also play important roles. We hope that our study will serve as a basis for future work that explores these roles (although we are unaware of any currently existing data set or study on the effect of three-dimensional water movement on plankton community composition at a global scale).</p><p>Second, we tested for the effects of seasonality (using daily sunshine duration as a proxy) by asking whether it was significantly different among genomic provinces, as was the case for temperature and various nutrients. These analyses were presented in Figure 1—figure supplement 7 (panels a and b) of the originally submitted version of our manuscript (unchanged in the revised version). Sunshine duration was significantly different among genomic provinces in only 1 of 6 organismal size fractions (180-2000 µm; panel a). Moreover, there were no significant differences when focusing on temperate latitudes, by removing stations near the Antarctic (panel b). Therefore, we concluded that the effect of seasonality was not as pronounced as the effects of temperature and nutrients.</p><p>Third, as we described in our introductory remarks above, and in lines 223-231 of the submitted version of our paper (unchanged in lines 252-261 of the revised version), we view the potential limitations of the sampling strategy instead as a strength. Despite the fact that the samples were collected across four different seasons and three different years, we nonetheless find strong and statistically significant correlations between the variation of plankton community composition of those samples and simulated minimum travel time (as well as variation in environmental conditions). We believe this places a lower bound on the strength of the effect that we observed.</p><p>Fourth, GEOTRACES (Biller <italic>et al.</italic>, 2018 DOI: 10.1038/sdata.2018.176) and more recent efforts such as Bio-GO-SHIP (Larkin <italic>et al.</italic>, 2021 DOI: 10.1038/s41597-021-00889-9) are inappropriate data sets for our analyses for two reasons. The first is biological and the second is technical: (1) These projects did not separate organisms by size fraction prior to metagenomic sequencing. This confounds multiple organismal size fractions (viruses, bacteria, microbial eukaryotes and planktonic animals). Size is the dominant factor differentiating plankton communities in the global ocean (de Vargas <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015 DOI: 10.1126/science.1261605, Figure 6A). In addition, the major part of the biomass of the ocean is divided roughly evenly among bacteria, protists and animals (Bar-On and Milo, 2019 DOI: 10.1016/j.cell.2019.11.018), meaning that a sampling strategy that does not separate organisms by size is likely to collect a mixture of these three groups (and a relative paucity of viruses). To avoid these issues, we instead analyzed samples separated into 6 organismal size fractions, each of which we studied independently, such that our genomic analyses are carried out among organisms of a similar size. This avoids comparing the genomes of completely different organisms (e.g., bacteria vs. animals), while at the same time permitting us to produce insights on differences among plankton of different size classes (see, for example, Figure 2a, Figure 1—figure supplement 4a-f, Figure 1—figure supplement 7, Figure 2—figure supplement 2 and Figure 3—figure supplement 1b). (2) Both studies lack the necessary sequencing depth for our calculations. GEOTRACES has a mean of 27 million sequenced paired-end reads per sample (Table 4 of Biller <italic>et al.</italic>), and Bio-GO-SHIP has roughly 26 million (derived from Table 1 of Larkin <italic>et al.</italic>). We found that, for the five non-viral enriched size fractions in our study, it was necessary to compare at least 100 million reads before the results of our analyses stabilized (see Methods, “Calculation of metagenomic community dissimilarity”). The relative lack of sequencing depth of both GEOTRACES and Bio-GO-SHIP would be expected to be compounded by the fact that multiple organismal size classes are mixed together in the same sample, thus further reducing the proportion of each size class sampled. For these two reasons, we do not believe it would be appropriate to perform a comparison to GEOTRACES or Bio-GO-SHIP.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A second major flaw of this work is that the main source of information is what they call &quot;metagenomic dissimilarity&quot;. It is actually the reciprocal of the ratio of shared (100% identity) 31 nucleotide K-mers between stations out of a pool of several million Illumina reads. This is a quite rough estimate of similarity that does not contemplate the nuances of genome features from virus to zooplankton. For example, the presence of IS or related elements in prokaryotic genomes might bias this parameter strongly, as would the presence of multiple repeats of rRNA genes in eukaryotic cells. The biological significance of metagenomic dissimilarity should be carefully assessed. I do not imply that it cannot be used, but to reach conclusions of such weight (&quot;oceanic genomic provinces&quot;) a much more refined sampling strategy and analysis of the data would have been required. For example, why were the myriad of MAGs derived from prokaryotes and viruses at different geographical sites not considered? At least as a control for their claims. Actually, the several reports of nearly identical genomes at different oceanic provinces points towards the opposite. I do not believe the evidence presented here warrants the kind of conclusive statements presented.</p></disp-quote><p>We note that all the principal results we obtained with metagenomic dissimilarity were confirmed with OTU-based data, which cannot be affected in the same way by the biases raised by the reviewer. These confirmations were presented in Figure 1—figure supplement 2, Figure 1—figure supplement 5, Figure 2—figure supplement 1, and Figure 3—figure supplement 1 and discussed in Supplementary Information 1, all in the submitted version of our manuscript (and which remain in the current version).</p><p>In addition, we did, in fact, confirm our results with MAG-based data (lines 297-303 of the submitted version of our paper, and figures referenced therein; unchanged in lines 243-249 of the revised version), and also with imaging-based data (lines 287-291 of the submitted version of the paper, and figures referenced therein; lines 235-243 of the revised version).</p><p>More importantly, the potential confounding factors in genome sequences proposed by the reviewer (prokaryotic IS elements and intragenomic repeats of eukaryotic ribosomal genes) would not be expected to strongly bias our results. We will respond regarding the ribosomal RNA locus in eukaryotes, as eukaryotes dominate the majority of the size fractions we analyzed (4 of 6); any strong bias present in 4 of 6 analyzed size fractions would be clearly evident in our data.</p><p>A typical eukaryotic ribosomal RNA locus is 5 kb (5 x 10 <sup>3</sup>), but eukaryotic genomes can be up to 6 orders of magnitude larger (gigabases, 10<sup>9</sup>), or more. Therefore, even thousands of rRNA repeats will have no substantial impact on genome-wide comparisons of randomly-sampled sequences.</p><p>How many rRNA repeats are expected to be present in the genomes we sampled? Nearly all genomes of planktonic microbial species have been assembled with Sanger or Illumina short read sequencing, which result in difficulties assembling repeated ribosomal RNA loci (and thus in counting their number of copies in a genome). A recent study on the diatoms <italic>Phaeodactylum tricornutum</italic> and <italic>Thalassiosira pseudonana</italic>, which was among of the first to use long reads for microbial plankton genome assemblies, provides an opportunity to assess the contribution of rRNA copies to total genome size (Filloramo <italic>et al.</italic>, 2021 DOI:10.1186/s12864-021-07666-3). This study found 7 copies of the rRNA locus in <italic>P. tricornutum</italic> of average length 5,936 bp, and 5 copies in <italic>T. pseudonana</italic> of average length 5,827 bp. The genomes of both species are estimated to be roughly 30 Mb in size, meaning that rRNA locus copies represent approximately 0.001 of each genome. This proportion would thus have a negligible (≤ 0.001) effect on genome-wide comparisons of matching k-mers such as those we performed, as k-mers are derived from sequencing reads randomly sampled from community genomic content.</p><p>In the absence of completely finished genome sequences, a method to estimate 18S gene copy number from short read mapping counts has also been proposed (Gong and Marchetti, DOI: 10.3389/fmars.2019.00219). This method estimated 18S copy numbers ranging from ~3 to ~161 for 7 different species of microbial eukaryotic plankton. The only two of these species with 18S copy numbers on the order of 10<sup>2</sup> were <italic>Symbiodinium kawagutii</italic> and <italic>Symbiodinium minutum</italic>; members of the genus <italic>Symbiodinium</italic> are estimated to have genome sizes on the order of 10<sup>9</sup> (LaJeunesse <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005 DOI:10.1111/j.1529-8817.2005.00111.x). Thus, consistent with the results described above, even the highest of these estimates would have a negligible effect on our comparisons.</p><p>Finally, intragenomic variation at the ribosomal RNA locus has been observed across the eukaryotic tree of life: in dinoflagellates (Thornhill <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007 DOI:10.1111/j.1365-294X.2007.03576.x), apicomplexans (Li <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997 DOI:10.1006/jmbi.1997.1038), cercozoans (Bass <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012 DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0049090), foraminiferans (Weber and Pawlowski, 2014 DOI:10.1016/j.protis.2014.07.006), animals (Gasmi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014 DOI:10.1186/s12983-014-0084-7), amoebozoans (Kudryavtsev and Gladkikh, 2017 DOI:10.1016/j.ejop.2017.09.003), diplonemids (Mukherjee <italic>et al.</italic>, 2020 DOI:10.1111/1462-2920.15209) and rhizarians (Sandin <italic>et al.</italic>, 2021 DOI:10.1101/2021.10.05.463214).</p><p>Thus, even if rRNA repeats were present as a substantial fraction of the genome (which has not been observed in any sequenced eukaryotic genome to date), it is likely that our approach, which is sensitive to changes at a single-base resolution (i.e., it relies on exact matches among 31 nucleotide k-mers), would still be able to detect variation among different copies of the locus.</p><p>In terms of other repeats, such as regions of low complexity resulting from simple repeated sequences, the software we used to produce dissimilarity matrices, Simka, includes an option to filter for such regions (Benoit <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016 DOI: 10.7717/peerj-cs.94).

There are instances in which distantly-located samples from the same depth are more closely related to one another than they are to closely-located samples at different depths. As an example, in the 0.8-5 µm size fraction, across large distances in the Pacific Ocean, surface samples in the C4 genomic province are more closely related to one another than they are to DCM samples in the C7 genomic province.

In general, the choice of the “DCM” depth by the chief scientist on board was to either target the DCM (from fluorescence profiles) or another relevant feature, if the former was not clearly identifiable.

Nonetheless, we added the identity of these samples to the main text (lines 281-284), as follows “This might be related to distant Tara Oceans stations experiencing similar oceanographic phenomena (notably temperature), for example upwelling zones (stations 67, 92 and 135; Figure 1—figure supplement 1), producing generally similar environmental conditions.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Ln 253 There seems to be something wrong with the plots presented in Supplementary Figure 2.

We would not necessarily expect to find high levels of correlation in community dissimilarity among organisms of such different sizes, life histories, and ecological roles. However, the fact that we do find such correlations reinforces the hypothesis that we propose to explain plankton biogeography, as these organisms are all transported by ocean currents in a similar way.

This feature of our analysis is advantageous both because we lack reference genomes for most planktonic species, and because we readily acknowledge that our size fractions were operational. Due to the latter, we were careful in the text to refer to each size fraction as “enriched” with a certain type of organism, and we refer to organismal size ranges when discussing size fractions, rather than to the taxonomic identity of the community they contain. We note that none of the principal results of the paper (i.e., those presented in Figures 1-3) depends on the taxonomy of the organisms within any given size fraction, although we do refer to particular taxonomic groups (or their biological features) in the discussion, when interpreting our results in the context of the hypothesis we propose for the existence of stable genomic provinces in ocean plankton communities.</p><p>We added a sentence to the text to indicate that our size fractions are operational, accompanied by an estimate of the percentages of eukaryotic reads present in the bacterial-enriched size fraction, and the percentages of bacterial reads present in the four eukaryotic-enriched size fractions, lines 144-153, as follows: “Each plankton community sample was sequenced for up to six operational size fractions: one virus-enriched (0-0.22 μm) (Roux et al., 2016), one prokaryote-enriched (either 0.22-1.6 or 0.22-3 μm) (Sunagawa et al., 2015), and four eukaryote-enriched (0.8-5 μm, 5-20 μm, 20-180 μm and 180-2000 μm (de Vargas et al., 2015); Figure 1—figure supplement 1b). These size fractions are operational in that each contains the organisms captured between two physical filters of a given size (either filters or nets, depending on size fraction (Pesant et al., 2015)). We estimated the average percentage of metagenomic sequence reads in samples from the prokaryote-enriched 0.22-1.6/3 µm size fraction that were of eukaryotic origin to be 12%, and the average percentage of reads in eukaryote-enriched size fractions that were of prokaryote origin as follows: 0.8-5 μm: 39%, 5-20 μm: 22%, 20-180 μm: 3%, 180-2000 μm: 5% (see Methods).”</p><p>We added a corresponding new section to the Methods, to provide further details on how our estimates were calculated, lines 648-657.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. Please clarify in line 143 why only 18S sequences are mentioned and not 16S and correct if necessary.</p></disp-quote><p>We used miTAGs (metagenomically-derived 16S sequences) to represent bacterial OTUs in our analyses. We modified this line of the text, which now reads (lines 156-161): “We also analyzed Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs, representing groups of genetically related organisms), consisting of previously published viral populations (Brum et al., 2015) previously derived bacterial 16S miTAGs (Sunagawa et al., 2015), and 738 million 18S V9 ribosomal DNA marker sequences in the eukaryote-enriched size fractions, enlarging a previously described Tara Oceans data set (de Vargas et al., 2015).”</p><p>Further details can be found in the Methods (lines 378-384 of the original submission, unchanged in lines 444-450 of this revision): “Within the 0-0.2 μm size fraction, we used previously published viral populations (equivalent to OTUs) (Brum et al., 2015) and viral clusters (analogous to higher taxonomic levels) (Roux et al., 2016) based on clustering of protein content. For the 0.22-1.6/3 μm size fraction, we used previously derived miTAGs based on metagenomic matches to 16S ribosomal DNA loci and processed them as described (Sunagawa et al., 2015). For the four eukaryotic size fractions, we added additional samples to a previously published Tara Oceans metabarcoding data set and processed them using the same methods (de Vargas et al., 2015) (also described at DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.15600).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. Please also check in line 142 if 24.2 TB of data were indeed analyzed, or if this is the total number of sequences but not all were actually analyzed.</p></disp-quote><p>We modified this line of the text, which now reads (lines 153-156): “The <italic>Tara</italic> Oceans project produced a total of 24.2 terabases of metagenomic sequence reads (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Data_from_Genomic_evidence_for_global_ocean_plankton_biogeography_shaped_by_large-scale_current_systems/11303177?file=20034092">Supplementary Table 1</ext-link>). To account for uneven sequencing depth among samples, we analyzed a subset of 11.9 terabases, after testing that this subset accurately represented the complete data set (see Methods).”</p></body></sub-article></article>
