cerebellar nuclei but also directly innervate the brainstem. Some PC-brainstem projections have been described previously, but most have not been thoroughly characterized. Here, we use a PC-specific cre line to anatomically and electrophysiologically characterize PC projections to the brainstem. PC synapses are surprisingly widespread, with the highest densities found in the vestibular and parabrachial nuclei. However, there are pronounced regional differences in synaptic densities within both the vestibular and parabrachial nuclei. Large optogenetically evoked PC-IPSCs are preferentially observed in subregions with the highest densities of putative PC boutons, suggesting that PCs selectively influence these areas and the behaviors they regulate. Unexpectedly, the pontine central gray and nearby subnuclei also contained a low density of putative PC boutons, and large PC-IPSCs are observed in a small fraction of cells. We combined electrophysiological recordings with immunohistochemistry to assess the molecular identities of two potential PC targets: PC synapses onto mesencephalic trigeminal neurons were not observed even though these cells are in close proximity to PC boutons; PC synapses onto locus coeruleus neurons are exceedingly rare or absent, even though previous studies concluded that PCs are a major input to these neurons. The availability of a highly selective cre line for PCs allowed us to study functional synapses, while avoiding complications that can accompany the use of viral approaches. We conclude that PCs directly innervate numerous brainstem nuclei, and in many nuclei they strongly inhibit a small fraction of cells. This suggests that PCs selectively target cell types with specific behavioral roles in the brainstem.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cerebellum</kwd><kwd>Purkinje cell</kwd><kwd>brainstem</kwd><kwd>vestibular nuclei</kwd><kwd>locus coeruleus</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000025</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01NS032405</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Regehr</surname><given-names>Wade G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35NS097284</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Regehr</surname><given-names>Wade G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R00NS110978</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Christopher H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Lefler Center</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wu</surname><given-names>Shuting</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Cerebellar Purkinje cells make direct synapses within the parabrachial, vestibular, pontine central gray, and other brainstem nuclei that exhibit spatial gradients and cell specificity consistent with nuanced influences on diverse behaviors.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Delineating the PC output pathways that mediate signals from the cerebellar cortex to the rest of the brain is a vital step in understanding cerebellar function. Although most studies of PC outputs have focused on the prominent connections to cerebellar nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kebschull et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hull and Regehr, 2022</xref>), PCs also project directly to the brainstem. Extensive PC projections to vestibular nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barmack, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barmack et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Shin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sekirnjak et al., 2003</xref>) play vital roles in vestibular and ocular-related functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lisberger and Pavelko, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lisberger et al., 1994a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lisberger et al., 1994b</xref>). PCs also project to the prepositus hypoglossal nucleus, and this pathway may play a role in gaze stabilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cullen, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Graham et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Walberg and Dietrichs, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Voogd et al., 1996</xref>). In addition, PCs prominently project to the parabrachial nucleus, which is suited to regulate broad-ranging nonmotor and autonomic functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sugihara et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">De Zeeuw et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wylie et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chen et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hashimoto et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Several studies suggested that PCs also inhibit cells in other brainstem nuclei that could allow the cerebellum to control diverse behaviors. Rabies-based tracing approaches suggested that PCs are the primary inhibitory inputs to the locus coeruleus (LC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Schwarz et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sun et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Breton-Provencher and Sur, 2019</xref>), but this is controversial. These studies have been highly influential and raised the possibility that PCs directly modulate LC-norepinephrine release, and regulate stress, attention, motivation, arousal, pain modulation, reward processing, and other behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Novello et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Carlson et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Zeidler et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Froula et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Krohn et al., 2023</xref>). Furthermore, it was also suggested that disruption of the PC-LC pathway contributes to autism spectrum disorder and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Koevoet et al., 2022</xref>), and impairs the ability of the cerebellum to control seizures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Streng and Krook-Magnuson, 2021</xref>). However, other studies do not see strong evidence for this PC-LC connection. Retrograde tracing studies of projections to the LC using dye tracers observed minimal PC labeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cedarbaum and Aghajanian, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aston-Jones et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aston-Jones and Waterhouse, 2016</xref>), and PC axons largely avoid the LC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chen et al., 2023</xref>). Thus, there is no consensus on whether PCs strongly inhibit LC neurons. There is also suggestive evidence that the cerebellum influences additional brainstem nuclei: the injection of trans-synaptic viruses into the posterior vermis labeled cells in pontine central gray (PCG) and nearby nuclei including the LC, Barrington’s nucleus, dorsal tegmentum, and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chen et al., 2023</xref>). These findings raise the possibility that direct PC-PCG projections could allow the cerebellum to regulate arousal, sleep-state transitions, micturition, and other behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Xiao et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Park and Weber, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Keller et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hou et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Verstegen et al., 2017</xref>). However, the viruses used in these studies can also retrogradely label cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Zingg et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Zingg et al., 2020</xref>), and it is therefore necessary to assess whether there are functional PC synapses in these nuclei.</p><p>In this study, we determine whether PCs make synapses and inhibit cells within various brainstem nuclei by examining whether PC synaptic boutons are present, and if PCs make functional synapses. Using PC/synaptophysin-tdTomato (<italic>Pcp2<sup>cre</sup>Rosa26<sup>Ai34D</sup></italic>) mice to label putative PC synapses and map their locations, we find that PCs project widely in the brainstem, and that synaptic densities are highly nonuniform within different nuclei and subnuclei. We identify and characterize PC synapses in brainstem nuclei using optogenetics in PC/ChR2-YFP (<italic>Pcp2<sup>cre</sup>Rosa26<sup>Ai32</sup></italic>) mice. There was good agreement between the density of PC synaptic boutons and the probability of evoking PC-IPSCs in neurons within different regions and subregions. In regions with a low density of PC boutons, PC-IPSCs were typically observed in a small fraction of cells, raising the possibility that PCs selectively target specific types of neurons in these regions. These findings provide an important resource that will allow future studies to clarify the PC targets in various brainstem nuclei and the behaviors controlled by these output pathways.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Visualization of PC projections to the brainstem</title><p>We visualized PC synapses in the brainstem of PC/synaptophysin-tdTomato mice in which synaptic boutons are intensely labeled, and axons, dendrites, and somata weakly labeled.

is observed in the cerebellar nuclei and brainstem. In sagittal views, brainstem labeling is sparser in the medial sections than in lateral sections. In coronal sections, the brainstem labeling is densest at bregma –5.85 mm, and sparser in anterior and posterior sections. Medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>, <italic>second column from left</italic>) and high magnification images (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B i–iv</xref>) showed highly variable densities of PC boutons in different regions. In some regions, labeling was extremely faint for medium magnification images, but putative PC boutons were apparent at higher magnifications (e.g. in the PCG in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1Aa i and Ba ii</xref>).</p><p>There were pronounced regional differences in the extent of labeling within the VN and the PB. In sagittal sections, for the VN the densest PC labeling was observed ventral to the cerebellar nuclei and the fourth ventricle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1Ac ii</xref>), and expression fanned out ventrally, anteriorly, and posteriorly. Dense labeling of the VN was also present in the anterior dorsal regions of the other sagittal slices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1Aa ii</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1Ab ii +iii</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1Ac ii</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1Ad ii</xref>). Although PC boutons were present throughout the VN, in anterior regions the densities were low near the midline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1Aa iii</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1Ab iv</xref>) and moderate densities in more lateral sections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1Ac iv</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1Ad iv</xref>). The density gradient of putative PC boutons within the VN was more apparent in coronal sections. Synaptic densities were highest in dorsal VN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1Bb i+ii</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1Bc i</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1Bd i</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1Be ii</xref>), and lower in ventral VN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1Ba iii</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1Bb iii</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1Bc iii</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1Bd ii</xref>). A gradient of labeling was also apparent within the PB. The highest densities were present in posterior PB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1Ac i and Ba i</xref>).

We used synaptophysin-tdTomato fluorescence to label putative PC boutons, vesicular GABA transporter (vGAT) immunohistochemistry to visualize all GABAergic synapses, and CGRP-GFP to label subnuclei to aid in atlas alignment.

To quantify synapses, confocal images were taken for a z-stack of 1.5 µm of the dorsal brainstem bilaterally. All regions previously observed with tdTomato signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) were imaged, as well as additional sections with no obvious labeling within 100 µm of labeled regions. Since weak tdTomato labeling is observed in the axons of PCs, vGAT immunohistochemistry was used to help identify putative presynaptic sites. In addition, PC contributions to total inhibition in each region can be measured by comparing GABAergic boutons without tdTomato labeling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, <italic>lower right, gray dots</italic>) or with tdTomato colabeling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, <italic>lower right, red dots</italic>, see Methods).

The spinal vestibular nucleus is the most posterior nucleus and had less variability across the anterior-posterior axis. It has a high average putative PC bouton number and density across sections, and 26% of inhibition originates from PCs. The prepositus nucleus also receives PC inputs that are highest at bregma –6.05 mm and –6.35 mm and in dorsal regions.

The densities of these synapses vary widely in different nuclei. There is also a pronounced gradient of PC synapses across the dorsal-ventral axis of the several brainstem nuclei, indicating that PCs do not uniformly regulate activity within these nuclei. The combination of synaptophysin-TdT expression restricted to PCs and vGAT immunohistochemistry allowed us to quantify the absolute number and density of putative PC boutons, and the fraction of inhibitory inputs that are from PCs for each region. Putative PC boutons comprised up to 75% of the inhibitory synapses in some vestibular regions and 55% in the caudal PB. Thus, PCs make prominent contributions to inhibition in some brainstem regions that are comparable to levels observed in cerebellar nuclei (72%) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">De Zeeuw and Berrebi, 1995</xref>). In contrast, in the PRP and PCG, PCs provide a low total number of inputs (PRP, PCG vs. VN; 0.002, 0.006, &gt;0.01 synapses/µm<sup>2</sup>, respectively) and a small fraction of inhibitory inputs (4%, 8%, 15–50%), where they inhibit only a modest fraction of cells (13%, 33%, 54%). In all of these regions, PCs likely function similarly to their inputs to the cerebellar nuclei, where a very brief pause in firing can lead to large and rapid elevations in target cell firing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Han et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wu et al., 2024</xref>), but PCs regulate the firing of a very different fraction of cells in brainstem nuclei and can do so in a variety of different ways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Shin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Najac and Raman, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Özcan et al., 2020</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>PC synapses in the PCG and nearby regions</title><p>We establish that there are PC boutons within the PCG and associated nuclei, and that there are strong PC synapses in this region.

Our previous study raised the possibility that PCs in the posterior vermis might directly target cells in Barrington’s nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chen et al., 2023</xref>), but this study relied on AAV1 injections in the cerebellum, that in addition to anterogradely labeling PC targets, could have retrogradely labeled cells in Barrington’s nucleus if they project to the cerebellar cortex.

We observed putative PC boutons and synaptic connections for cells in the vicinity of Barrington’s nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>). As suggestive as these findings are, it remains an open question whether direct PC synapses to Barrington’s nucleus control micturition without additional experiments using molecular markers to identify Barrington’s nucleus. Similarly, further studies are needed to identify other PC targets in the PCG and determine what behaviors they control.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Gradients of PC synapses in the brainstem</title><p>In general, PCs inputs to brainstem nuclei are spatially heterogenous. The caudal-rostral gradient of putative PC boutons in the PB allows PCs to target specific subtypes of PB neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chen et al., 2023</xref>). We find that putative PC boutons in the PCG and nearby subnuclei also exhibit a caudal-rostral gradient. Additional studies are needed to identify PC targets in these regions and to determine the significance of their spatial heterogeneity. There is also a pronounced dorsal-ventral gradient in many vestibular subnuclei and related nuclei. Previous studies suggested that PCs do not project to all regions of the VN, but they were unable to quantify the regional densities of putative PC boutons. Labeling individual PCs or those within subregions of the cerebellar cortex helped to determine their specific projections in the VN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barmack, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wylie et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Shojaku et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Tabuchi et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Blot et al., 2023</xref>), but did not label all PC boutons in the VN. Immunohistochemical methods targeting proteins selectively expressed in PCs offer the potential to label all PC boutons in the VN. Calbindin is a widely used PC marker, but its presence in vestibular afferents compromises its use in the VN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kevetter, 1996</xref>). PKCγ is also expressed by PCs, but has the advantage that it is not present in vestibular afferents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barmack et al., 2000</xref>). The lack of PKCγ immunoreactivity established that PC synapses are absent in the ventral VN, which is qualitatively similar to what we observe. However, the possibility that PKCγ is expressed by other cell types projecting to the VN complicates the use of PKCγ labeling as a definitive marker for identifying PC synapses. Our studies establish that PC synapses are present at high densities throughout the SUV; in the dorsal LAV, MV, PRP, SPIV; in subregions of the ECU; and there are large subregions that are devoid of PC synapses. Multiple lines of evidence suggest that PC synapses in the VN play a role in canceling self-motion related to eye movements and proprioception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cullen, 2023</xref>). The distribution of synapses suggests that processing within VN subnuclei is spatially segregated according to the locations of PC synapses, implying that PC feedback potentially cancels signals related to self-motion specifically within these regions.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Brainstem regulation by direct PC inputs or indirectly via the deep cerebellar nuclei</title><p>PCs can also disynaptically influence the brainstem by disinhibiting cells in the deep cerebellar nuclei that in turn project to the brainstem.

Studies highlighting PC inputs to the LC were conducted using rabies-tracing methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Schwarz et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sun et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Breton-Provencher and Sur, 2019</xref>), which have limitations. These viruses have unknown tropism, unclear synapse specificity, and critically depend on the degree to which the ‘starter’ cell population is restricted to the intended cell type, which can be complicated by inappropriate expression, and by the sensitivity of TVA-based rabies infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Beier, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Rogers and Beier, 2021</xref>). We were fortunate to have a highly selective cre line to selectively target PCs that allowed us to examine PC synapses in the brainstem while avoiding complications that can occur when using viruses.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>PC targets in the brainstem</title><p>The next step in clarifying the PC to brainstem outputs and the behaviors they regulate is to determine the molecular identity of target cells. This is challenging because there are many types of neurons present in the brainstem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Nardone et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Langlieb et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Zhang et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kodama et al., 2012</xref>). We previously identified candidate PC targets by injecting AAV1 in the cerebellar cortex to anterogradely label PC targets and then using RNA-seq to determine the molecular identity of labeled cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chen et al., 2023</xref>). An important caveat to this approach is that while it very effectively labels anterograde PC targets, it can also retrogradely label cells that project to the cerebellar cortex. It is therefore crucial to determine if functional PC synapse is present, unless it is known that the region does not project to the cerebellar cortex.</p><p>Our primary focus in our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chen et al., 2023</xref>) was to identify PC targets in the PB. The fact that the PB does not project to the posterior vermis of the cerebellum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Huang et al., 2021a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Huang et al., 2021b</xref>) and the observation that labeled cells were restricted to PB regions receiving PC inputs suggest that the following cells are PC targets: <italic>Satb2</italic>, <italic>Penk</italic>, and <italic>Tacr1</italic> populations, which have roles in taste (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jarvie et al., 2021</xref>), thermoregulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Norris et al., 2021</xref>), and pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barik et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Deng et al., 2020</xref>), respectively. We also found that <italic>Calca</italic> neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Huang et al., 2021b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Campos et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Palmiter, 2018</xref>), which are located in a region of the PB devoid of PC synapses, were not labeled by this method. This supports the hypothesis that PCs selectively inhibit specific types of brainstem neurons.</p><p>We also labeled neurons in the vestibular nucleus, Barrington’s nucleus, mesencephalic trigeminal nucleus, and the LC in that previous study. The lack of PC-evoked inputs to neurons in the mesencephalic trigeminal nucleus and LC shown here established that these populations are not targeted by PCs. It further suggests that these neurons project to the cerebellum and were retrogradely labeled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Billig et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Stanley et al., 2023</xref>). For the multiple candidate PC targets in the vestibular nucleus, it is necessary to specifically test for the presence of PC synapses, as was done for floccular-targeting, <italic>Slc6a5</italic>-expressing neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Shin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sekirnjak et al., 2003</xref>). In the PCG and nearby nuclei, the sparsity of PC synapses combined with the large PC synaptic inputs in a small fraction of cells suggests that PCs only inhibit specific cells in these regions. This was also reflected in our previous anatomical experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chen et al., 2023</xref>), where we identified <italic>Crh</italic>-expressing Barrington’s neurons and other glutamatergic/GABAergic neurons in the PCG.

Thus, synaptophysin-tdTomato was expressed selectively in all PCs, and GFP is expressed in the lateral parabrachial nuclei, the LC, the hypoglossal nuclei, the vestibular nerve, the spinal tract of the trigeminal nerve, and the solitary tracts. Mice were anesthetized at P56 and perfused with PBS and 4% PFA. After removal, brains were post-fixed for 1 day in 4% PFA, and sliced coronally and sagittally in 50 μm sections. Slices were stained with a vGAT antibody (Synaptic Systems, #131 004, 1:500), and visualized using an Alexa Fluor 647 secondary (Thermo Fisher, #A-21450, 1:1000). Every third section of the dorsal brainstem was imaged on a confocal microscope (Leica Stellaris 5). Acquisitions were made with an XY resolution of 361.1 nm for an area of about 10 mm<sup>2</sup> total per section, and 300 nm z steps for 4 μm stacks. Stitched images were imported into ZEISS arivis Pro (arivis).</p><p>To identify PC synapses, we analyzed for synaptophysin-tdTomato fluorescence colabeled with vGAT fluorescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chen et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Guo et al., 2021</xref>). Using a background correction feature in arivis, a background representation was generated with a 50 μm diameter Gaussian filter and subtracted from the vGAT fluorescence. vGAT was then isolated by a watershed algorithm provided with a 1 μm bouton diameter and threshold intensity. Thresholds were adjusted for each individual image based on three 50-pixel squares that had various densities of vGAT expression. Optimal threshold values were approximately one standard deviation above median. The following analysis was conducted in MATLAB: segmented vGAT boutons were analyzed for tdTomato-synaptophysin colocalization by finding a regional maximum in the tdTomato fluorescence (maximum center-to-center distance is 0.7 μm). We plotted the synaptophysin intensity values within each voxel. This histogram showed a bimodal distribution corresponding to noise and signal, and the signal threshold corresponded to the minimum between the two peaks.</p><p>We identified brainstem nuclei by aligning the Allen CCF. We used several features to register confocal images of the brainstem: (1) the edges of the tissue and position of the ventricles, (2) the fiber tracts and features notable from autofluorescence and bright-field imaging, and (3) GFP labeling present in numerous brainstem regions in <italic>Calca<sup>GFP</sup></italic> mice (including VIIn, sptv, LC, XII, and their axons). GFP labeling in the LC and VIIn was particularly useful in anterior sections of <italic>Calca<sup>GFP</sup></italic> mice.</p><p>Puncta within each brainstem region were quantified using this aligned atlas. We matched our samples to the indicated bregma levels (±100 μm) in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>. To determine the variability in our alignment, we sampled 50–70 points 350 μm apart across the atlas image before and after aligning to each confocal image. The displacement distances of these reference points were calculated for each image and binned based on the confocal image location relative to bregma. Our images were displaced from the Allen CCF by an average of 107 μm. The displacement distances were 90±25 μm (standard deviation, n=6 hemispheres, bregma –5.45 mm), 126±26 μm (n=10, bregma –5.65 mm), 102±35 μm (n=8, bregma –6.05 mm), 103±51 μm (n=8, bregma –6.35 mm), 108±43 μm (n=8, bregma –6.65 mm), and 96±31 μm (n=8, bregma –6.95 mm).</p><p>It is important to note that the accuracy of our mapping is dependent on the accuracy of the reference maps that we register to. The PCG is one region in particular that varies substantially between reference atlases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Paxinos and Franklin, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kronman et al., 2023</xref>). We labeled the regions in/around the dorsomedial pons as the PCG, based off of the borders noted in the Allen CCF, but other atlases constrain the borders of the PCG, leaving parts of the dorsomedial pons effectively unlabeled. The precise location of many other regions within the dorsomedial pons also differs dramatically. Precise identification of these areas (i.e. Barrington’s nucleus) will require a molecularly targeted approach (in situ hybridization, etc.).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Electrophysiology</title><p>Mice of both sexes ranging from p24 to p50 (n=30) were anesthetized with ketamine/xylazine and transcardially perfused with warm choline ACSF solution (34°C) containing in mM: 110 choline Cl, 2.5 KCl, 1.25 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 25 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 25 glucose, 0.5 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 7 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 3.1 Na pyruvate, 11.6 Na ascorbate, 0.002 (R,S)-CPP, 0.005 NBQX, oxygenated with 95% O<sub>2</sub>/5% CO<sub>2</sub>.

They combine two methods - presynaptic puncta labeling as putative presynaptic markers, and optogenetics, to test the anatomical projections and functional connectivity from purkinje cells onto a variety of brainstem nuclei. Overall, their study provides an atlas of sorts of purkinje cell connectivity to the brainstem, which includes a critical analysis of some of their own data from another publication. Overall, the value of this work is to both provide neural substrates by which purkinje cells may influence the brainstem and subsequent brain regions independent of the deep cerebellar nuclei, and also, to provide a critical analysis of viral-based methods to explore neuronal connectivity.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The strengths lie in the simplicity of the study, the number of cells patched, and the relationship between the presence of putative presynaptic puncta and electrophysiological results. This type of study is important and should provide a foundation for future work exploring cerebellar inputs and outputs. Overall, I think that the critique of viral-based methods to define connectivity, and a more holistic assessment of what connectivity is and how it should be defined is timely and warranted, as I think this is under-appreciated by many groups and overall, there is a good deal of research being published that do not properly consider the issues that this manuscript raises about what viral-based connectivity maps do and do not tell us.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>While I overall liked the manuscript, I do have a few concerns which relate to interpretation of results, and discussion of technological limitations. The main concerns I have relate to the techniques that the authors use, and an insufficient discussion of their limitations. The authors use a Cre-dependent mouse line that expresses a synaptophysin-tdtomato marker, which the authors confidently state is a marker of synapses. This is misleading. Synaptophysin is a vesicle marker, and as such, labels axons, where vesicles are present in transit, and likely cell bodies where the protein is being produced. As such, the presence of tdtomato should not be interpreted definitively as the presence of a synapse. The use of vGAT as a marker, while this helps to constrain the selection of putative pre-synaptic sites, is also a vesicle marker and will likely suffer the same limitations (though in this case the expression is endogenous and not driven by the ROSA locus). A more conservative interpretation of the data would be that the authors are assessing putative pre-synaptic sites with their analysis. This interpretation is wholly consistent with their findings showing the presence of tdtomato in some regions but only sparse connectivity - this would be expected in the event that axons are passing through. If the authors wish to strongly assert that they are specifically assessing synapses, a marker better restricted to synapses and not vesicles may be more appropriate.</p><p>Similarly, while optogenetics/slice electrophysiology remains the state of the art for assessing connectivity between cell populations, it is not without limitations. For example, connections that are not contained within the thickness of the slice (here, 200 um, which is not particularly thick for slice ephys preps) will not be detected. As such, the absence of connections are harder to interpret than the presence of connections. Slices were only made in the coronal plane, which means if that if there is a particular topology to certain connections that is orthogonal to that plane, those connections may be under-represented. As such, all connectivity analyses likely are under-representations of the actual connectivity that exists in the intact brain. Therefore, perhaps the authors should consider revising their assessments of connections, or lack thereof, of purkinje cells to e.g., LC cells. While their data do make a compelling case that the connections between purkinje cells and LC cells are not particularly strong or numerous, especially compared to other nearby brainstem nuclei, their analyses do indicate that at least some such connections do exist. Thus, rather than saying that the viral methods such as rabies virus are not accurate reflections of connectivity - perhaps a more circumspect argument would be that the quantitative connectivity maps reported by other groups using rabies virus do not always reflect connectivity defined by other means e.g., functional connections with optogenetics. In some cases the authors do suggest this (e.g., &quot;Together, these findings indicate that reliance on anatomical tracing experiments alone is insufficient to establish the presence and important of a synaptic connection&quot;), but in other cases they are more dismissive of viral tracing results (e.g., &quot;it further suggests that these neurons project to the cerebellum and were not retrogradely labeled&quot;). Furthermore, some statements are a bit misleading e.g., mentioning that rabies methods are critically dependent on starter cell identity immediately following the citation of studies mapping inputs onto LC cells. While in general this claim has merit, the studies cited (19-21) use Dbh-Cre to define LC-NE cells which does have good fidelity to the cells of interest in the LC. Therefore, rewording this section in order to raise these issues generally without proximity to the citations in the previous sentence may maintain the authors' intention without suggesting that perhaps the rabies studies from LC-NE cells that identified inputs from purkinje cells were inaccurate due to poor fidelity of the Cre line. Overall, this manuscript would certainly not be the first report indicating that rabies virus does not provide a quantitative map of input connections. In my opinion this is still under-appreciated by the broad community and should be explicitly discussed. Thus, an acknowledgement of previous literature on this topic and how their work contributes to that argument is warranted.</p><p>Comments on revisions:</p><p>The responses the authors offer in theory are good, but they still use terms such as synapses and putative presynaptic boutons relatively interchangeably - if the authors make the correction to the more conservative terminology, which I think better reflects the data, this should be more consistent throughout the manuscript.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa4"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.101825.3.sa4</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Christopher H</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>The Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Hershey, Pennsylvania</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Yao</surname><given-names>Zhiyi</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>The Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Hershey, Pennsylvania</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Wu</surname><given-names>Shuting</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Harvard Medical School</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Boston</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Regehr</surname><given-names>Wade G</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Harvard Medical School</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Boston</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>This paper is an incremental follow-up to the authors' recent paper which showed that Purkinje cells make inhibitory synapses onto brainstem neurons in the parabrachial nucleus which project directly to the forebrain.

With so many types of neurons in the brainstem, this would be a monumental task. Despite this limitation we prefer to keep our original title, since our study makes the following advances:</p><p>• We provide a comprehensive map of all PC synaptic boutons across the brainstem, and corresponding maps of PC synaptic input sizes. The input sizes vary widely, but are often multiple nanoamps, indicating that the cerebellum is an important regulator of activity in these regions. These maps will be indispensable for future investigations of cerebellar outputs.</p><p>• We find that PC projections and the synapses they make are spatially restricted within most target nuclei such as the vestibular and parabrachial nuclei. This suggests that the influence of the cerebellum is spatially segregated within these nuclei, and likely allows the cerebellum to regulate specific behaviors. While some aspects of these gradients have been described previously, our study is comprehensive, and has a higher degree of specificity than can be achieved with immunohistochemistry.</p><p>• We discover that PCs form functional synapses in the pontine central grey and nearby nuclei. Much of this region’s function is unknown, but certain subregions are important for micturition and valence. PCs make large synapses onto a small fraction of cells in this region, which suggests that PCs may target specific cell types to control novel nonmotor behaviors.</p><p>• We provide clarification regarding PC projections to the locus coeruleus. Multiple high-profile, highly influential studies using rabies tracing (Schwarz et al., <italic>Nature</italic> 2015; Breton-Provencher and Sur, <italic>Nature Neuroscience</italic> 2019; and others) described a prominent PC input to the locus coeruleus. We showed that this projection is essentially nonexistent, both anatomically and functionally. We previously addressed this issue, but the PC-specific optogenetic approach we used here provides the most compelling evidence against a prominent PC-LC connection. This is an important finding for the cerebellum and a cautionary tale for conclusions based solely on viral tracing methods. We will expand on this issue in response to the comments of reviewer #3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>While it is often assumed that the cerebellar cortex connects, via its sole output neuron, the Purkinje cell, exclusively to the cerebellar nuclei, axonal projections of the Purkinje cells to dorsal brainstem regions have been well documented.

These experiments also set a standard for future studies assessing the presence of PC synapses onto other target neurons in the brainstem.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Although the authors appear to assume uniform cell type and postsynaptic response in each of the dorsal brainstem nuclei (as noted in the Discussion, &quot;PCs likely function similarly to their inputs to the cerebellar nuclei, where a very brief pause in firing can lead to large and rapid elevations in target cell firing&quot;), we know that the responses to the Purkinje cell input are cell type dependent, which vary in neurotransmitter, output targets, somata size, and distribution, in the cerebellar and vestibular nuclei (Shin et al., 2011, J Neurosci; Najac and Raman, 2015, J Neurosci; Özcan et al., 2020, J Neurosci). This consideration impacts the interpretation of two key findings: (a) &quot;Large ... PC-IPSCs are preferentially observed in subregions with the highest densities of PC synapses (Abstract)&quot;. For example, we know that the terminal sparse regions reported in the present paper do contain Floccular Targeted Neurons that are sparse yet have dense somatic terminals with profound postinhibitory rebound (Shin et al.). Despite their sparsity, these postsynaptic neurons play a distinct and critical role in proper vestibuloocular reflex. Therefore, associating broad synaptic density with &quot;PC preferential&quot; targets, as written in the Abstract, may not fully capture the behavioral significance of Purkinje extracerebellar projections. (b) &quot;We conclude ... only a small fraction of cell. This suggests that PCs target cell types with specific behavioral roles (Abstract, the last sentence)&quot;. Prior research has already established that &quot;PCs target cell types with specific behavioral roles in brainstem regions&quot;. Also, whether 23 % (for PCG), for example, is &quot;a small fraction&quot; would be subjective: it might represent a numerically small but functionally important cell type population. The physiological characterization provided in the present cell type-blind analysis could, from a functional perspective, even be decremental when compared to existing cell typespecific analyses of the Purkinje cell inputs in the literature.</p></disp-quote><p>We now cite the papers suggested by the reviewer (Shin et al., 2011, J Neurosci; Najac and Raman, 2015, J Neurosci; Özcan et al., 2020, J Neurosci) and add to the discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) The quantification analyses used to draw conclusions about</p><p>(a) the significance of PC terminals among all GABAergic terminals and the fractions of electrophysiologically responsive postsynaptic brainstem neurons may have potential sampling considerations:.</p><p>(a.i) this study appears to have selected subregions from each brainstem nucleus for quantification (Figure 2).

They combine two methods - presynaptic puncta labeling as putative presynaptic markers, and optogenetics, to test the anatomical projections and functional connectivity from Purkinje cells onto a variety of brainstem nuclei. Overall, their study provides an atlas of sorts of Purkinje cell connectivity to the brainstem, which includes a critical analysis of some of their own data from another publication. Overall, the value of this work is to both provide neural substrates by which Purkinje cells may influence the brainstem and subsequent brain regions independent of the deep cerebellar nuclei and also, to provide a critical analysis of viral-based methods to explore neuronal connectivity.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The strengths lie in the simplicity of the study, the number of cells patched, and the relationship between the presence of putative presynaptic puncta and electrophysiological results. This type of study is important and should provide a foundation for future work exploring cerebellar inputs and outputs. Overall, I think that the critique of viral-based methods to define connectivity, and a more holistic assessment of what connectivity is and how it should be defined is timely and warranted, as I think this is under-appreciated by many groups and overall, there is a good deal of research being published that do not properly consider the issues that this manuscript raises about what viral-based connectivity maps do and do not tell us.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for highlighting this important aspect of this work, and for agreeing with our thesis concerning viral-based connectivity maps.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>While I overall liked the manuscript, I do have a few concerns that relate to interpretation of results, and discussion of technological limitations. The main concerns I have relate to the techniques that the authors use, and an insufficient discussion of their limitations. The authors use a Cre-dependent mouse line that expresses a synaptophysin-tomato marker, which the authors confidently state is a marker of synapses. This is misleading. Synaptophysin is a vesicle marker, and as such, labels axons, where vesicles are present in transit, and likely cell bodies where the protein is being produced. As such, the presence of tdtomato should not be interpreted definitively as the presence of a synapse. The use of vGAT as a marker, while this helps to constrain the selection of putative pre-synaptic sites, is also a vesicle marker and will likely suffer the same limitations (though in this case, the expression is endogenous and not driven by the ROSA locus). A more conservative interpretation of the data would be that the authors are assessing putative pre-synaptic sites with their analysis. This interpretation is wholly consistent with their findings showing the presence of tdtomato in some regions but only sparse connectivity - this would be expected in the event that axons are passing through. If the authors wish to strongly assert that they are specifically assessing synapses, a marker better restricted to synapses and not vesicles may be more appropriate.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that synaptophysin-tdTomato is an imperfect marker, although it is vastly superior to cytosolic tdTomato. We found that viral expression of synaptophysin-GFP gives much more punctate labelling, but an appropriate synaptophysin-GFP line is not available. We carefully point out this issue, and threshold the images to avoid faint labeling associated with fibers of passage. The intersection of VGAT labelling and of the synaptophysin-tdTomato labelling provides us with superior identification of PC boutons. We will add additional clarification to point out that these are putative presynaptic boutons, but that alone this does not establish the existence or the strength of functional synapses.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Similarly, while optogenetics/slice electrophysiology remains the state of the art for assessing connectivity between cell populations, it is not without limitations. For example, connections that are not contained within the thickness of the slice (here, 200 um, which is not particularly thick for slice ephys preps) will not be detected. As such, the absence of connections is harder to interpret than the presence of connections. Slices were only made in the coronal plane, which means that if there is a particular topology to certain connections that is orthogonal to that plane, those connections may be under-represented. As such, all connectivity analyses likely are under-representations of the actual connectivity that exists in the intact brain. Therefore, perhaps the authors should consider revising their assessments of connections, or lack thereof, of Purkinje cells to e.g., LC cells. While their data do make a compelling case that the connections between Purkinje cells and LC cells are not particularly strong or numerous, especially compared to other nearby brainstem nuclei, their analyses do indicate that at least some such connections do exist. Thus, rather than saying that the viral methods such as rabies virus are not accurate reflections of connectivity - perhaps a more circumspect argument would be that the quantitative connectivity maps reported by other groups using rabies virus do not always reflect connectivity defined by other means e.g., functional connections with optogenetics. In some cases, the authors do suggest this (e.g.&quot;Together, these findings indicate that reliance on anatomical tracing experiments alone is insufficient to establish the presence and importance of a synaptic connection&quot;), but in other cases, they are more dismissive of viral tracing results (e.g. &quot;it further suggests that these neurons project to the cerebellum and were not retrogradely labeled&quot;). Furthermore, some statements are a bit misleading e.g., mentioning that rabies methods are critically dependent on starter cell identity immediately following the citation of studies mapping inputs onto LC cells. While in general, this claim has merit, the studies cited (19-21) use Dbh-Cre to define LC-NE cells which does have good fidelity to the cells of interest in the LC. Therefore, rewording this section in order to raise these issues generally without proximity to the citations in the previous sentence may maintain the authors' intention without suggesting that perhaps the rabies studies from LC-NE cells that identified inputs from Purkinje cells were inaccurate due to poor fidelity of the Cre line. Overall, this manuscript would certainly not be the first report indicating that the rabies virus does not provide a quantitative map of input connections. In my opinion, this is still under-appreciated by the broad community and should be explicitly discussed. Thus, an acknowledgment of previous literature on this topic and how their work contributes to that argument is warranted.</p></disp-quote><p>We have a different take on connectivity and the use of optogenetics. Based on our years of experience studying synapses in brain slice, axons survive very well even when they are cut. It is not necessary to preserve intact axons that extend for long distances. It is also true that activation of these axons, with either extracellular electrical stimulation or with optogenetics, is sufficient to evoke synaptic inputs. Robust synaptic responses are evoked with optogenetic activation regardless of the slice orientation. We thank the reviewer for raising this issue, and we have added a couple of sentences to clarify this point under the section “Characterization of functional properties of PC synapses in the brainstem.”</p><p>The discussion on starter cell specificity was not referring to the specificity of cre in transgenic animals, but the TVA/G helper proteins that are introduced by AAV and used in conjunction with the rabies virus.
