conditions. Their fast/slow inactivation modes have been implicated in mechanopathologies but remain poorly understood. Here, we report several near-atomic resolution cryo-EM structures of fast-inactivating wild-type human PIEZO1 (hPIEZO1) and its slow-inactivating channelopathy mutants with or without its auxiliary subunit MDFIC. Our results suggest that hPIEZO1 has a more flattened and extended architecture than curved mouse PIEZO1 (mPIEZO1). The multi-lipidated MDFIC subunits insert laterally into the hPIEZO1 pore module like mPIEZO1, resulting in a more curved and extended state. Interestingly, the high-resolution structures suggest that the pore lipids, which directly seal the central hydrophobic pore, may be involved in the rapid inactivation of hPIEZO1. While the severe hereditary erythrocytosis mutant R2456H significantly slows down the inactivation of hPIEZO1, the hPIEZO1-R2456H-MDFIC complex shows a more curved and contracted structure with an inner helix twist due to the broken link between the pore lipid and R2456H. These results suggest that the pore lipids may be involved in the mechanopathological rapid inactivation mechanism of PIEZO channels.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cryo-EM</kwd><kwd>PIEZO</kwd><kwd>membrane channels</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>92068201</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pei</surname><given-names>Duanqing</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Key Research and Development Program of Zhejiang Province</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2024SSYS0031</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pei</surname><given-names>Duanqing</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The architectures of human PIEZO1 and its slow-inactivating channelopathy mutants with or without its auxiliary subunit MDFIC reveal the inactivation mechanism of PIEZO channels.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cells rely on mechanosensitive (MS) channels, which rapidly convert force into ion flow, to sense environmental changes and make appropriate decisions throughout the prokaryotic and eukaryotic kingdoms. In bacteria, two major MS channels, the small-conductance mechanosensitive channel (MscS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Levina et al., 1999</xref>) and large-conductance mechanosensitive channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Sukharev et al., 1994</xref>), are responsible for bacterial force sensing. In contrast, in mammals, only the PIEZO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Coste et al., 2010</xref>), two-pore domain K<sup>+</sup> channel (K2P) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Maingret et al., 1999</xref>) and TMEM63 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Murthy et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>), channels have been identified as bona fide MS channels. Structural studies indicate that not all MS channels are constructively conserved, ranging from monomer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Zhang et al., 2023</xref>) to heptamer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bass et al., 2002</xref>), but they are likely to obey two putative principles of force-from-lipid (FFL) and force-from-filament (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anishkin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Martinac et al., 1990</xref>). Within the heptameric MscS channel in bacteria, three types of lipids, the pore lipids, the gatekeeper lipids, and the pocket lipids, sense and transduce force at corresponding positions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>). Similarly, the pseudo-tetrameric MS K2P channels also utilize at least three types of lipids to regulate channel activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brohawn et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Schmidpeter et al., 2023</xref>). In particular, pore lipids seal the channel pores and could be removed by the mechanical force upon activation of the MscS, MS K2P, and TMEM63 channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Zhang et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brohawn et al., 2014</xref>). In the trimeric PIEZO channels, membrane curvature is likely associated with channel activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Lin et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Mulhall et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Yang et al., 2022</xref>). Although the PIEZO channel also obeys the FFL principle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Zheng et al., 2019</xref>), the role of the lipids in PIEZO channel gating remains elusive.</p><p>PIEZOs from different species or in disparate native cells exhibit diverse inactivation kinetics. Human PIEZO1 (hPIEZO1) exhibits faster inactivation gating kinetics than mouse PIEZO1 (mPIEZO1) under the same voltage condition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Coste et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Zheng et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bae et al., 2013</xref>), so mPIEZO1 presents a native gain-of-function (‘GOF’) state relative to hPIEZO1 regarding inactivation gating kinetics. Also, it has been reported recently that the MyoD family inhibitor, MDFIC/MDFI, is an auxiliary subunit of PIEZO channels to prolong inactivation and reduce mechanosensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Zhou et al., 2023</xref>). Besides, some hereditary erythrocytosis (HX) mutations exhibit slower inactivation gating kinetics than wild-type hPIEZO1. The slower inactivation may result in the higher open probability and delayed inactivation of hPIEZO1; thus, these mutations are considered GOF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bae et al., 2013</xref>). HX, also known as inherited dehydrated stomatocytosis, is an autosomal dominant disorder that causes dehydration of red blood cells, resulting in hemolytic anemia. In addition to changes in gating kinetics, some of the HX mutations show alterations in response to osmotic pressure and in membrane protein trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Glogowska et al., 2017</xref>). Interestingly, the populations with a mild GOF PIEZO1 allele are likely to be resistant to malaria infection, while some present a strong association with increased plasma iron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ma et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ma et al., 2018</xref>). Although the inactivation phenotype of PIEZO channels is very susceptible to intrinsic and extrinsic factors, the molecular basis of their inactivation remains unclear.</p><p>Here, we report the structural basis of hPIEZO1 gating and inactivation based on the architecture of hPIEZO1 and its slow-inactivating channelopathy mutants with or without its auxiliary subunit MDFIC at near-atomic resolution by cryo-EM. Our high-resolution structures support a model in which the pore lipids directly seal the central hydrophobic pore and involve fast inactivation of hPIEZO1. This model also provides a mechanistic understanding of the severe HX mutant R2456H with a more curved and contracted structure with an inner helix (IH) twist due to the broken link between the pore lipid and R2456H.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Overall structure of the full-length hPIEZO1</title><p>hPIEZO1 is known to have faster inactivation gating kinetics than mPIEZO1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bae et al., 2013</xref>). The structural basis of this difference remains unresolved. To resolve this, we synthesized a codon-optimized full-length hPIEZO1 with a C-terminal GFP and flag tag into the pBM vector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Goehring et al., 2014</xref>), and this construct exhibits similar mechanosensitivity and fast inactivation gating properties as previously reported by whole-cell poking assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). We overexpressed hPIEZO1 in 12 l of HEK293F suspension cells, extracted the protein with lauryl maltose neopentyl glycol (LMNG), and purified it in a digitonin environment. The symmetric peak of the full-length hPIEZO1 suggests the protein is homogenous. The smeared bands around 300 kDa on SDS-PAGE indicate the potential presence of posttranslational modifications (PTMs), and the lower bands may be the binding partners or degraded fragments of hPIEZO1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2a and b</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Structure of full-length human PIEZO1 (hPIEZO1) channel.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) 38-TM topology model of a single hPIEZO1 subunit.

Among the nine transmembrane helix units (THUs) containing four transmembrane helices for each predicted by primary sequences, the two N-terminal ones are not visible in the cryo-EM density map. The rest of the THUs, along with the pore module consisting of an anchor, an outer helix (OH), an IH, and a cap domain, are resolved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). Compared to the anchor, OH, and IH, the resolution of the cap domain is slightly lower, which may be due to the flexibility of the cap domain. On the intracellular side, a long beam helix supports the THU7–9 and pore modules. Each hPIEZO1 subunit has a curved blade structure, and the three subunits form the trimeric PIEZO channel, exhibiting a bowl-like shape. The hPIEZO1 density map, filtered with a low-pass filter, shows a disk approximately 30 nm wide with a horn-like density in the peripheral blade region, likely due to the PTMs such as glycosylation. Interestingly, we see a large density below the central pore module at the intracellular side, which may be potential auxiliary subunits, consistent with the lower molecular weight bands on SDS-PAGE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b–g</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2b</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>hPIEZO1 is more flattened and extended than mPIEZO1</title><p>Several studies using high-speed atomic force microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Lin et al., 2019</xref>), cryo-EM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Yang et al., 2022</xref>), and 3D interferometric photoactivation localization microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Mulhall et al., 2023</xref>) suggest that PIEZO blades may receive mechanical force through sensing membrane curvature. The reshaping of the curvature of the PIEZO conducts force to the pore region, which may result in the channel pore opening and ion flow. Structural comparison of hPIEZO1 and curved mPIEZO1 shows that hPIEZO1 presents a more flattened structure from the side view (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). The blades of hPIEZO1 are about 5 Å down toward the cytoplasmic side than those of mPIEZO1. Meanwhile, the cap domain of hPIEZO1 is slightly upward to the extracellular side (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). In the top view, the distal blades rotate counterclockwise about 22 Å compared to mPIEZO1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). Therefore, hPIEZO1 appears more extended than the curved mPIEZO1. Meanwhile, hPIEZO1 still maintains a sizeable curved state compared to the flattened mPIEZO1 structure. From the top view, the two structures are very similar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c and d</xref>). The pore radius of hPIEZO1 is between that of the curved and flattened mPIEZO1. Therefore, the curved hPIEZO1 may still represent a nonconducting state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e–h</xref>), and the differences in curvature and pore radius may be implicated in channel gating properties of hPIEZO1 and mPIEZO1.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Structural comparison of human PIEZO1 (hPIEZO1) and mouse PIEZO1 (mPIEZO1).</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Structural comparison of hPIEZO1 (this study) and curved mPIEZO1 (5Z10) at side view.

The evidence supporting this model is based on previous electrophysiological functional studies that substitution of the hydrophobic pore, formed by I2447, V2450, and F2454, with a hydrophilic pore prolongs the inactivation time for both PIEZO1 and PIEZO2 channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Zheng et al., 2019</xref>). More robust evidence comes from the HX channelopathy mutant R2456H, wherein the interaction between the hydrophilic phosphate group head and R2456 is disrupted, which leads to remodeling of the blade and pore module (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6d–h</xref>), thus significantly prolonging the inactivation time.

On the other hand, once the pore lipids are removed by a higher threshold of the mechanical force, it is equally more difficult for the pore lipids to return to the hydrophobic pore region and regain the stable pore module-multi-lipidated MDFIC-pore lipid complex, thus resulting in the very prolonged slow inactivation phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8b and d</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Piezo ion channels are the critical force sensors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Coste et al., 2010</xref>) that allow cells to sense their physical environment and regulate cell fate.

The MDFIC inserts into the PIEZO pore module and significantly reshapes channel inactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Zhou et al., 2023</xref>), which may also link PIEZO channel inactivation to cell fate. The lack of knowledge regarding the faster inactivating hPIEZO1 has prevented the acquisition of structural information about the relationship of true fast inactivating wild-type hPIEZO1 to cell fate determination, as well as clinically significant hPIEZO1 GOF slow-inactivating channelopathies. Our work has the following implications.</p><p>First, we present the near-atomic cryo-EM structures of the fast inactivation hPIEZO1 and its slow inactivation channelopathy mutants, illuminating the fast inactivation mechanism of PIEZO channels involved by the pore lipids, which ingeniously seals the hydrophobic pore.</p><p>Second, the overall structure of the curved hPIEZO1 shows a more flattened and extended state compared to the curved mPIEZO1, although there is no strong evidence yet for a link between curvature and inactivation. However, based on the mild GOF mutants hPIEZO1-A1988V and hPIEZO1-E756del, which are in the blade arm region, the correlation between curvature and inactivation is relatively evident, as the blade region indeed influences the channel inactivation. And all the force signal will be transduced to the pore region, removing the pore lipid barrier. Therefore, the pore lipid will likely play a key role in PIEZO gating.</p><p>Lastly, the inactivation can be modulated by extrinsic cues, such as MDFIC, and the channelopathy mutants of PIEZO channels often cause a slower inactivation rate. The primary mechanism of PIEZO channel fast inactivation may provide clues against the clinical mechanopathologies. More importantly, these insights may inspire further investigation into mechanosensing channels as cell fate regulators in the near future.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Constructs</title><p>A synthetic codon-optimized gene fragment encoding residues 1–2521 of the hPIEZO1 was cloned into a modified pEG-BacMam vector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Goehring et al., 2014</xref>) using EcoRI and XhoI restriction enzyme.

Clearly the molecular basis of PIEZO channel inactivation is of great interest and as such this manuscript provides some valuable extra information that may help to ultimately build a molecular picture of PIEZO channel inactivation.

They reveal that hPIEZO1 has a more flattened shape than mouse PIEZO1 (mPIEZO1) and has lipids that insert into the hydrophobic pore region. To understand how PIEZO1 GOF mutations might affect this structure and the underlying mechanistic changes, they solve structures of hPIEZO1 as well as two HX causing mild GOF mutations (A1988V and E756del) and a severe GOF mutation (R2456H). Unable to glean too much information due to poor resolution of the mutant channels, the authors also attempt to resolve MCFIC-bound structures of the mutants. These structures show that MDFIC inserts into the pore region of hPIEZO1, similar to its interaction with mPIEZO1, and results in a more curved and contracted state than hPIEZO1 on its own.

Therefore, in our putative model, the pore lipids seal the hydrophobic pore of hPIEZO1 in the closed state. Upon activation of hPIEZO1, the pore lipids retract from the hydrophobic pore and interact with multi-lipidated MDFIC, stabilizing in the inactivation state. The mild channelopathy mutants make the pore lipids retract from the hydrophobic pore and harder to close upon activation. For the severe channelopathy mutant, the interaction between the pore lipids and R2456 is disrupted, resulting in the missing of pore lipids and significantly slow-inactivating. We fully understand the concern of the role of pore lipids in our proposed model.

PIEZO in vivo roles are further exemplified by the presence of gain-of-function (GOF) or loss-of-function (LOF) mutations in humans that lead to disease pathologies. Hereditary xerocytosis (HX) is one such disease caused due to GOF mutation in Human PIEZO1, which are characterized by their slow inactivation kinetics, the ability of a channel to close in the presence of stimulus. But how these mutations alter PIEZO1 inactivation or even the underlying mechanisms of channel inactivation remains unknown. Recently, MDFIC (myoblast determination family inhibitor proteins) was shown to directly interact with mouse PIEZO1 as an auxiliary subunit to prolong inactivation and alter gating kinetics. Furthermore, while lipids are known to play a role in the inactivation and gating of other mechanosensitive channels, whether this mechanism is conserved in PIEZO1 is unknown. Thus, the structural basis for PIEZO1 inactivation mechanism, and whether lipids play a role in these mechanisms represent important outstanding questions in the field and have strong implications for human health and disease.</p><p>To get at these questions, Shan et al. use cryogenic electron microscopy (Cryo-EM) to investigate the molecular basis underlying differences in inactivation and gating kinetics of PIEZO1 and human disease-causing PIEZO1 mutations. Notably, the authors provide the first structure of human PIEZO1 (hPIEZO1), which will facilitate future studies in the field. They reveal that hPIEZO1 has a more flattened shape than mouse PIEZO1 (mPIEZO1) and has lipids that insert into the hydrophobic pore region. To understand how PIEZO1 GOF mutations might affect this structure and the underlying mechanistic changes, they solve structures of hPIEZO1 as well as two HXcausing mild GOF mutations (A1988V and E756del) and a severe GOF mutation (R2456H). Unable to glean too much information due to poor resolution of the mutant channels, the authors also attempt to resolve MCFIC-bound structures of the mutants. These structures show that MDFIC inserts into the pore region of hPIEZO1, similar to its interaction with mPIEZO1, and results in a more curved and contracted state than hPIEZO1 on its own.

The half-activation threshold of hPEIZO1 and hPEIZO1-MDFIC is measured to be 7 μm and 9 μm, respectively (Fig.S2). In addition, the mechanical currents amplitude of hPIEZO1-MDFIC is extremely small compared to that of WT reaching the nA level (Fig.S2).

It has been previously shown that MDFIC does not change the structure of mPIEZO1 but does alter its inactivation and gating kinetics. How does this discrepancy fit into the inactivation model proposed by the authors? Similarly, their claim that MDFIC slows hPIEZO1 inactivation and weakens mechanosensitivity just by affecting the pore module and changing blade curvature is made based on observation and no experimental data to test it.</p></disp-quote><p>We have revised the manuscript to avoid misleading the relationship between the curvature and the inaction kinetics of hPIEZO1.

In addition, the severe HX channelopathy mutant R2456H, wherein the interaction between the hydrophilic phosphate group head and R2456 is disrupted, leads to remodeling of the blade and pore module.

It can be proved that overexpressed PIEZOs exhibit faster inactivation kinetics than those in some native cell types with MDFIC expression (PMID: 20813920, 30132757).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Figure S2 is missing quantification of the electrophysiology data. The authors should show summary data in addition to their representative traces including the Imax for all conditions, tau for data shown in b, and sample size for all conditions, and related statistics. The text claims that MDFIC decreases mechanosensitivity (line 156) but there is no data to support this.</p></disp-quote><p>For the electrophysiological assay in Figure S2, we referred to previously reported mPIEZO1 mutants (PMID: 23487776, 28716860). We confirmed that the slower inactivation phenotypes of these mutations of hPIEZO1 are similar to those of mPIEZO1.</p><p>The half-activation threshold of hPEIZO1 and hPEIZO1-MDFIC is measured to be 7 μm and 9 μm, respectively. This tendency of increased half-activation threshold of hPIEZO1 upon binding with MDFIC is also shown in the electrophysiological result of hPIEZO1 channelopathy mutants.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) In line 144, the authors mention that they were able to validate the MDFIC density with multilipidated cysteines on the C-terminal amphipathic helix, but they do not show the density with fitted lipids. While individual densities for some of the lipids are shown in extended Figure 12, it would be helpful to include a figure where they show the map for MDFIC with fitted lipids in it.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the valuable suggestion. As the lipid densities of the post-transcriptional modification of PIEZOs auxiliary subunit MDFIC are not confident, we only use the single-chain lipids to represent them. And the lipidated MDFIC is proven by the MDFIC identification paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) The authors show that R2456 interacts with a lipid at the pore module and hypothesize that this underlies the fast inactivation of hPIEZO1. While they did not obtain a high-resolution structure of this mutant, this hypothesis could be tested by substituting R for side chains with different charges and performing electrophysiology to determine the effects on inactivation.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the constructive suggestion. We will perform the electrophysiology assay for R2456 mutants with different side chains.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Figure 4 shows overall structure of hPIEZO1 GOF mutations A1988V and E756del in complex with MDFIC. Other than showing an overall similar structure to wildtype hPIEZO1, the authors do not show how the human mutations A1988V alter the structure of the protein at the site of change. Understanding how these mutations affect the local architecture of the protein has important relevance for human physiology.</p></disp-quote><p>As the GOF channelopathy mutant hPIEZO1-A1988V is structurally unstable, the density at the site of A1988V is too weak to figure out the related interaction in the structure of the hPIEZO1-A1988V mutant.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor comment:</p><p>In general, the manuscript will benefit from heavy copy editing. For example, the word cartoon is misspelled in many of the figure legends.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the mistake. The manuscript has been checked and revised.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>Some portions of this manuscript were not well written. For example, at the end of the 3rd paragraph in the introduction, the authors talked about HX mutations and their correlation with malaria infection and plasma iron. This is irrelevant information and will only distract the readers. It would be ideal if the authors could go through the entire manuscript and improve its clarity.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the suggestion.
