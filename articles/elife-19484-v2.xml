myogenic progenitors (MPs); however, the factors responsible for this decline remain obscure. TGFβ superfamily signaling is an inhibitor of myogenic differentiation, with elevated activity in aged skeletal muscle. Surprisingly, we find reduced expression of <italic>Smad4</italic>, the downstream cofactor for canonical TGFβ superfamily signaling, and the target <italic>Id1</italic> in aged SCs and MPs during regeneration. Specific deletion of Smad4 in adult mouse SCs led to increased propensity for terminal myogenic commitment connected to impaired proliferative potential. Furthermore, SC-specific Smad4 disruption compromised adult skeletal muscle regeneration. Finally, loss of Smad4 in aged SCs did not promote aged skeletal muscle regeneration. Therefore, SC-specific reduction of Smad4 is a feature of aged regenerating skeletal muscle and Smad4 is a critical regulator of SC and MP amplification during skeletal muscle regeneration.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.19484.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.19484.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19484.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Even in adulthood, injured muscles can repair themselves largely because they contain groups of stem cells known as satellite cells. These cells divide to produce progenitor cells that later develop, or differentiate, into new muscle fibers. However as muscles get older, this repair process becomes less effective, in part because the satellite cells do not respond as strongly to injury. It remains obscure precisely why the repair process declines with age.</p><p>A protein called TGFβ is part of a signaling pathway that prevents the muscle progenitor cells from differentiating into muscle fibers, and TGFβ signaling is overactive in older muscles. Most TGFβ signaling operates via a protein called Smad4, and Paris et al. now show that older satellite cells and progenitor cells from the muscles of old mice produce less Smad4 when they are regenerating.</p><p>Next, the gene for Smad4 was deleted specifically from the satellite cells of mice. By examining the fate of these cells, Paris et al. found that Smad4 normally maintained the population of satellite cells by preventing them from differentiating into muscle fibers too soon. This was the case when both adult and aged muscle was regenerating.</p><p>All in all, Smad4 is clearly important for directing satellite cells to regenerate properly; aged cells have less Smad4 and are less able to regenerate. Future studies are now needed to determine how disrupting Smad4 in other resident cell types may influence the regeneration of muscles in mice.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.19484.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.19484.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>aging</kwd><kwd>muscle stem cells</kwd><kwd>sarcopenia</kwd><kwd>TGFB</kwd><kwd>satellite cells</kwd><kwd>Smad4</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009750</institution-id><institution>University of Rochester Medical Center</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Start-up Funds</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chakkalakal</surname><given-names>Joe V</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AG051456</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chakkalakal</surname><given-names>Joe V</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Ablation of canonical TGFβ signaling in muscle stem cells at any age is detrimental, and not beneficial, to effective skeletal muscle regeneration due to the promotion of premature fate commitment at the expense of progenitor amplification.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The regenerative capacity of adult skeletal muscle is endowed in a population of <italic>Pax7</italic>-expressing resident stem cells called satellite cells (SCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brack et al., 2012</xref>). Genetic studies utilizing lineage labeling, as well as cell ablation, have established that <italic>Pax7</italic>-expressing SCs are essential for various aspects of skeletal muscle regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Relaix and Zammit, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Liu et al., 2015</xref>). At homeostasis, SCs reside in a quiescent state at the interface between skeletal muscle fibers (myofibers) and the surrounding basal lamina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brack et al., 2012</xref>). In response to degenerative stimuli, SCs activate and undergo proliferative expansion, providing myogenic progenitors (MPs) necessary for myofiber regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brack et al., 2012</xref>). Skeletal muscle regeneration requires a balance between SC/MP amplification and terminal myogenic commitment in order to efficiently form multinucleated myofibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brack et al., 2012</xref>). Moreover, there is evidence that this balance is compromised in aging skeletal muscle, where changes in SC function and their surrounding environment occur, yielding defective progenitors and stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chakkalakal et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sousa-Victor et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Almada and Wagers, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blau et al., 2015</xref>). Therefore, elucidating factors that regulate SC and derived MP fate is critical in order to develop interventions to combat aged skeletal muscle regenerative decline, in which these cells are lost.</p><p>Transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ) superfamily signaling is crucial for the renewal and maintenance of various tissue-specific stem cell populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Oshimori and Fuchs, 2012</xref>). Superfamily ligands include TGFβs, bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), growth and differentiation factors (GDFs), Activins, and Myostatin. These ligands bind to transmembrane type II receptors with differing specificities. This association leads to the eventual formation of transmembrane complexes composed of type I (activin-like kinases, ALKs) and type II receptor homodimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Massagué, 2008</xref>). The formation of these complexes triggers the phosphorylation of receptor SMADs (R-SMADs). The R-SMADs associated with TGFβ/Activin/Inhibin and BMP ligands are SMAD2/3 and SMAD1/5/8 respectively. Phosphorylated R-SMADs, associated with the cofactor SMAD4, accumulate in the nucleus, where together with chromatin modifiers and other transcriptional co-factors they promote the expression of target genes. Depending on cell type and context, the TGFβ superfamily pathways regulate many cellular processes including differentiation, renewal, quiescence, and apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Oshimori and Fuchs, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Massagué, 2012</xref>). In aged regenerating skeletal muscle, TGFβ superfamily signaling is widely considered to be abnormally elevated, and is thought to inhibit SC activation and terminal myogenic differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kollias and McDermott, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Trendelenburg et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">2009</xref>). However, it has also been proposed that during regeneration TGFβ superfamily ligands may enable SC and MP expansion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ono et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sinha et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Smad4 is recognized as the canonical cofactor for TGFβ superfamily signaling and was initially identified as a tumor suppressor in pancreatic cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Malkoski and Wang, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Miyaki and Kuroki, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hussein et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nishita et al., 2000</xref>). Loss-of-function <italic>SMAD4</italic> mutations lead to familial juvenile polyposis, which can be associated with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, and aggressive forms of various cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Malkoski and Wang, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akhurst, 2004</xref>). In myogenic culture systems derived from immortalized cell lines or using sequential pre-plate techniques, knockdown of Smad4 promotes myogenic differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dey et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ono et al., 2011</xref>). Furthermore, global reduction of expression through direct intramuscular injection of Smad4 siRNAs or viral vectors with Smad4 shRNAs into injured mouse skeletal muscle can promote the formation of larger regenerated muscle fibers relative to controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dey et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lee et al., 2015</xref>). However, given that multiple non-myogenic cell types, such as inflammatory cells and fibro/adipogenic progenitors, also contribute to SC and MP fate decisions during skeletal muscle regeneration; It is unclear which cellular mechanisms promote hypertrophy of regenerated myofibers with non-targeted Smad4 loss. In contrast, specific loss of Smad4 in MPs compromises myogenic differentiation during embryonic skeletal muscle development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Han et al., 2012</xref>). Additionally, consistent with the critical role for Smad4 in stem and progenitor cell function, targeted deletion of Smad4 in hematopoietic, hair follicle, and neural stem and derived progenitor cell populations leads to their depletion during homeostasis and regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Karlsson et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Yang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mira et al., 2010</xref>). Moreover, targeted loss of Smad4 in myofibers leads to modest deterioration during growth and aggravation of denervation-induced atrophy in adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sartori et al., 2013</xref>). Recently, gain-of-function <italic>SMAD4</italic> mutations that prevent ubiquitination and subsequent degradation have been identified as the cause of the rare developmental disorder Myhre syndrome in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Caputo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Le Goff et al., 2012</xref>). Patients with Myhre syndrome are characterized by short stature, various musculoskeletal abnormalities, and hypertrophied musculature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Caputo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Le Goff et al., 2012</xref>). Although Smad4 clearly has crucial roles in skeletal muscle and tissue-specific stem and progenitor cell biology, to date no studies have explicitly examined whether or not there is a cell-autonomous requirement for Smad4 in SCs and derived MPs during skeletal muscle regeneration.</p><p>In this study we show, in comparison to adult, evidence of failure to induce <italic>Smad4</italic> expression in aged SCs and MPs during skeletal muscle regeneration. In order to examine the consequences of cell-specific Smad4 loss, we utilized transgenic mice expressing tamoxifen-inducible Cre recombinase under the control of <italic>Pax7</italic> regulatory elements to perform targeted deletion of Smad4 in SCs. We found that specific disruption of Smad4 in adult SCs resulted in insufficient SC and derived MP amplification, which was accompanied by severe deficiencies in adult skeletal muscle regeneration. Unexpectedly, with specific loss of Smad4 in aged SCs in an environment of presumably high TGFβ activity, aged skeletal muscle regeneration was not improved.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Smad4 expression is reduced in aged SCs and myogenic cells during regeneration</title><p>Deficiencies in aged skeletal muscle regeneration reflect in part a failure or delay of SC or SC-derived MP expansion due to multiple factors. These factors include impaired activation, premature terminal fate commitment, and the occurrence of senescence and apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sousa-Victor et al., 2015</xref>). Since SMAD-dependent signaling and target genes such as <italic>Id1</italic> have been implicated in the regulation of the terminal fate and amplification of SC and MP populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ono et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Clever et al., 2010</xref>), we examined the expression of <italic>Smad4</italic> and <italic>Id1</italic> in SCs and MPs from regenerating adult and aged skeletal muscles. Initially, we employed previously characterized flow cytometric analysis to examine age-related modification of SMAD4 protein levels in SCs and MPs (Lin-, Sca1-, ITGA7+) isolated from adult and aged, uninjured and regenerating skeletal muscle. Regenerating muscle was examined at five days post injury (5dpi), a time point when new myofibers are rapidly forming through the expansion, differentiation, and fusion of SC-derived myogenic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Murphy et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cosgrove et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bernet et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">García-Prat et al., 2016</xref>). To induce skeletal muscle regeneration, a barium chloride (BaCl<sub>2</sub>) solution was directly injected into tibialis anterior (TA) muscles, which is an established model of skeletal muscle degeneration and regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Murphy et al., 2011</xref>). Relative to SCs from adult uninjured TAs, an approximately 2.5-fold increase in SMAD4 protein was observed in SCs and MPs isolated from adult 5dpi TA muscles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and C</xref>). In contrast, SMAD4 induction was not detected in SCs and MPs isolated from aged 5dpi relative to uninjured TA muscles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>). To further substantiate these findings, we conducted RTqPCR analysis of <italic>Smad4</italic> expression as well as the SMAD-target <italic>Id1,</italic> the loss of which is associated with deficiencies in skeletal muscle regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Clever et al., 2010</xref>). Both <italic>Smad4</italic> and <italic>Id1</italic> expression were higher in SCs and MPs from adult when compared to those from aged 5dpi TAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D and E</xref>). We were unable to obtain consistent Ct values in the detectable range (&lt;36) for <italic>Smad4</italic> or <italic>Id1</italic> in SCs from uninjured skeletal muscle indicative of low to negligible expression (data not shown). Therefore, a feature of age-related regenerative decline is the loss of Smad4 induction in SCs and MPs.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19484.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Loss of Smad4 expression in aged satellite cells and myogenic progenitors during muscle regeneration.</title><p>Representative profiles of SMAD4 protein levels by flow cytometric analysis in SCs and MPs isolated from C57BL6 (<bold>A</bold>) adult and (<bold>B</bold>) aged uninjured and 5-day post injured (5dpi) (TA) muscles.

Several studies have specifically manipulated components of TGFβ superfamily signaling in myogenic progenitors and SCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Guardiola et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Han et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Huang et al., 2014</xref>). However, until now, no reports have examined the cell-autonomous roles of Smad4, the common cofactor for all branches of canonical TGFβ superfamily signaling, in adult or aged Pax7+ SCs and determined the subsequent consequences on skeletal muscle regeneration.</p><p>Consistent with previous reports, Smad4 disruption did promote myogenic terminal commitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dey et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ono et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lee et al., 2015</xref>). However, declines in proliferating SCs and MPs during regeneration were also observed. Myofibers are multinucleated cells formed by the fusion of many terminally committed myogenic cells. Therefore, the progression to the formation of mature multinucleated myofibers can be impeded at multiple levels, including impaired myogenic differentiation and/or reduced MP amplification through a variety of mechanisms: inhibition of cell cycle entry, cell death, and/or premature terminal commitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sousa-Victor et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brack et al., 2012</xref>). Given that we have detected differences in myogenic cell proliferation with no increased cell death or cell cycle inhibitor expression, we suspect that the reduced number of MPs in regenerating skeletal muscles following acute SC-specific Smad4 loss is likely due to a heightened propensity for terminal commitment. In contrast, specific disruption of Smad4 in embryonic mouse MPs, driven by <italic>Myf5-Cre</italic>, altered terminal myogenic commitment and myofiber formation in the tongue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Han et al., 2012</xref>). Intuitively, these divergent results could reflect differences in the intrinsic mechanisms that regulate SCs and MPs in response to the environments of embryonic tongue growth versus adult TA regeneration. Another possibility is that the <italic>Myf5-Cre</italic>, in addition to targeting the myogenic lineage, drives recombination in further resident cell populations with the capacity to directly or indirectly influence skeletal muscle growth and regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Huang et al., 2014</xref>). It will be of interest to determine in what manner specific disruption of Smad4 in other resident non-myogenic cell populations may influence adult or aged skeletal muscle regeneration. Although in adult Smad4 null SC cultures we observed reductions in <italic>Fgf6</italic> and <italic>Fgfr4</italic> expression similar to embryonic Smad4 deleted muscle, we also detected a robust induction of <italic>Fgf2</italic>. We have previously found that the presence of elevated levels of FGF2 in aged skeletal muscle is associated with a propensity for aged SCs to progress toward terminal fates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chakkalakal et al., 2012</xref>). Therefore, compensatory induction of FGF2 resulting from Smad4 loss may be a unique feature of adult SCs that drives terminal myogenic commitment, the mechanisms of which will require further investigation.</p><p>Previous work has shown that loss of BMP signaling induces premature terminal myogenic commitment, preventing SC and MP amplification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ono et al., 2011</xref>). Furthermore, Id1, which we found to be reduced in aged wildtype and adult P7:S4KO SCs and derived MPs, was identified as a SMAD target required for SC and MP amplification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ono et al., 2011</xref>). Indeed, through direct interactions Id1 can also promote Myogenin degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Vinals and Ventura, 2004</xref>). Therefore, loss of Id1 in aged and P7:S4KO SCs and MPs during regeneration could potentially stabilize Myogenin and thus promote excessive terminal commitment that impedes myogenic cell amplification. Although we observe loss of <italic>Smad4</italic> and <italic>Id1</italic> expression, some reports have described the presence of elevated TGFβ and phospho-Smad activity in aged SCs and MPs from regenerating skeletal muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carlson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pessina et al., 2015</xref>). Although less characterized, TGFβ can function through non-canonical Smad4-independent pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Derynck and Zhang, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Massagué, 2012</xref>). For instance, pSmad3, which is elevated in aged SCs and MPs, also associates with Drosha in a Smad4-independent complex required for microRNA processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Davis et al., 2008</xref>). Studies examining keratinocyte differentiation have shown Iκβ kinase to be a critical regulator of signaling through Smad2/3 that is Smad4-independent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Descargues et al., 2008</xref>). Non-canonical TGFβ mediators such as TAK1 (TGFβ activated kinase 1) and the downstream target p38 are both shown to be elevated in aged myogenic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cosgrove et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bernet et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Trendelenburg et al., 2012</xref>). Notably, heightened p38 activity in aged SCs hinders myogenic cell amplification through mechanisms that include promotion of terminal myogenic commitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cosgrove et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bernet et al., 2014</xref>). Collectively, it will be critical to determine if loss of Smad4 in aged and P7:S4KO SCs and MPs could impair myogenic cell amplification through promotion of multiple Smad4-independent pathways.</p><p>Although the TGFβ superfamily pathways are capable of influencing multiple cell types that contribute to the regeneration of skeletal muscle, few studies have examined specific inhibition of these pathways in adult or aged SCs and their derived progenitors. For example, it has been shown that SC-specific loss of Cripto, an inhibitor of Activin, Myostatin, and TGFβ signaling in myogenic cells, leads to smaller regenerated myofibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Guardiola et al., 2012</xref>). Additionally, genetic ablation of the BMP receptor <italic>Alk3</italic> in embryonic myogenic cells, utilizing <italic>MyoD-Cre</italic> and <italic>Myf5-Cre</italic> mice, was found to result in ineffective adult skeletal muscle regeneration, however this occurs primarily through mechanisms other than major dysfunction within the SC pool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Huang et al., 2014</xref>). This conclusion was based primarily on the lack of observable depletion or dysfunction of <italic>Alk3</italic> null SCs in vivo or in culture, respectively, which is thought to occur due to stimulation of the expression of the related <italic>Alk6</italic> as a compensatory mechanism to maintain SC function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Huang et al., 2014</xref>). In this study, we determined that inducible <italic>Pax7</italic>-driven loss of Smad4 impedes SC-derived myogenic proliferation and proper skeletal muscle regeneration. Further studies will be needed to determine in what way targeted disruption of Alk3, induced later in life, in adult or aged SCs may affect skeletal muscle regeneration at these ages, with potential compensation possibly being eliminated.</p><p>Although not specifically targeting SCs or MPs, intramuscular delivery of Smad4 siRNA or shRNA at later time points during regeneration has been shown to stimulate myofiber hypertrophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dey et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lee et al., 2015</xref>). Furthermore, utilizing miR-26 disruption to increase, and miR-431 mimics to decrease, <italic>Smad4</italic> expression at later timeponts during regeneration promotes myofiber atrophy and hypertrophy respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dey et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lee et al., 2015</xref>). However, it is intuitive that since microRNAs often target many genes, the aforementioned manipulations likely do not alter <italic>Smad4</italic> expression alone. Therefore, it remains unclear whether the balance between myogenic progenitor expansion and terminal fate commitment could be manipulated to be beneficial to adult and aged muscle if cell-specific Smad4 loss was induced at different timepoints during regeneration or by alternative, more transient, means.</p><p>Here, we demonstrate that induction of Smad4 is compromised in aged SCs and myogenic cells during skeletal muscle regeneration. Disruption of Smad4 specifically in adult SCs leads to phenotypes observed in aged regenerating skeletal muscle including compromised proliferation and amplification of SC-derived MPs. Collectively, these data indicate that Smad4 function in SCs is essential for adult and aged skeletal muscle regeneration in the mouse. Moving forward, careful dissection of Smad4-mediated pathways and targets may yield novel factors that promote skeletal muscle genesis in the contexts of aging and disease.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>All procedures involving mice were carried out in accordance with guidelines set by the Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Rochester.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Sean Morrison (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, including Amy J Wagers (Reviewer #1) - who is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors – and Colin Crist (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The manuscript by Chakkalakal et al. investigates the impact of deletion of SMAD4, a common signal transducer of the TGFβ superfamily, in adult and aged mouse muscle satellite cells. The authors show that SMAD4 is normally induced during muscle repair in young adults, and furthermore, using well-established lineage-specific, inducible CreER-LoxP deletion strategies, that deletion of Smad4 accelerates satellite differentiation, reduces proliferation, and impairs muscle regeneration after injury. Interestingly, they also examine SMAD4 ablation in aged animals, where it has been suggested that elevated TGFβ signaling constrains robust muscle regenerative potential. Unexpectedly, the authors report impaired SMAD4 induction in aged, regenerating muscle and show that SMAD4 deletion in this context is unable to reverse age-related regenerative defects. These results implicate SMAD4 as a positive regulator of muscle repair, and should prompt additional dissection of the upstream signals that modulate SMAD4 levels during muscle regeneration and aging.</p><p>The overall design of this study is straightforward, and should be of interest as it raises new complexities with respect to the interactions of TGF signals and muscle repair. The authors' use of highly specific genetic systems and aging of their animals out to 2 years is an important contribution. Furthermore, the results nicely highlight important differences in the generative/regenerative responses of developing, adult and aged muscle, and make an important point about the context specificity of SMAD4 requirement and the challenges of predicting pathway activity or impact based solely on ligand levels. However, a major discussion point among the reviewers was the extent to which the work provides new insights into SMAD4 functions, especially as this is a well-studied target in development and skeletal muscle biology, and the extent to which the authors are able to resolve the apparent differences they report between a loss of Smad4 during development, which seems to prevent efficient differentiation but not proliferation, and during adulthood, which reduces proliferation presumably by promoting differentiation. There were also some technical concerns related to the sufficiency with which the authors documented recombination efficiency in their mice, whether Smad4 fails to be upregulated, or if it is already upregulated in satellite cells of aged muscle (the way the data is presented, this is not clear), and whether the defects in P7S4-/- mice persist at later time points after injury. Addressing these points will be essential to shore up the authors' conclusions, and should be achievable by this team with their existing genetic tools and expertise. If these issues are addressed appropriately, then the work will be appropriate for <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A, B</xref> – basal levels of SMAD4 protein (in uninjured muscle) seem higher in at least a subset of aged SCs vs. adult SCs. If this is correct it is difficult to interpret the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, which expresses data relative to uninjured samples. Thus, for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, quantification and statistics for multiple experiments should be included for comparison of both uninjured and 5dpi to the negative control (not just UI to 5dpi, as currently done). A similar analysis is needed for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>. Smad4 and Id1 mRNA expression are likewise not reported for uninjured controls present in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D and E</xref>, and should be.</p><p>2) The authors need to better assess the SMAD4 deficiency phenotype in satellite cells using additional markers. Pax7 expression alone does not indicate satellite cells undergoing self-renewal. Authors should quantify numbers of Pax7-positive, MyoD-negative verus Pax7-positive, MyoD-positive cells to determine if satellite cells that have not activated the myogenic program are perturbed in their ex vivo culture system. In addition, they should include additional differentiation markers (e.g. myosin heavy chain) to quantify myotube formation and fusion index to support their claim that Smad4 mutant muscle stem cells possess an enhanced propensity for differentiation.</p><p>3) The authors should provide a better evaluation of the efficiency of SMAD4 deletion in the TAM-treated P7S4-/- satellite cells in adult vs. aged mice to verify that deletion efficiency is equivalent at the two ages. If the efficiency of Smad4 gene deletion is low in either circumstance, then it would be necessary to use a recombination sensitive reporter to analyze only cells in which the cre-recombinase was successfully activated, as inclusion of all cells (recombined and not recombined) in the analysis might comprise the results (again, depending on the efficiency of recombination).</p><p>4) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, the authors convincingly demonstrate a reduction in regenerating fiber size at 5dpi in P7S4-/- muscle and aged muscle. Do these defects persist at later timepoints? The authors should examine fiber CSA in more fully regenerated muscle (e.g., 14 and 21 dpi) and in uninjured muscle (at the same post-TAM time point as for the injury/repair studies) as well, to support their conclusions that Smad4-deletion in satellite cells results in severe deficiencies in skeletal muscle regeneration. Both HE and trichrome staining should be shown together with the distribution of fiber sizes. They could also ask if numbers of Pax7-positive cells present underneath the basal lamina return to normal levels in the absence of Smad4, although this might not be testable if they continue to observe a collapse in regeneration at the later timepoint.</p><p>5) The authors need to provide further insight into mechanism to support their conclusion that satellite cell expansion is disrupted with SMAD4 deletion. Inactivation of Smad4 during embryonic development leads to major defects in tongue muscle formation, which was attributed to impaired myogenic differentiation and fusion probably due to decreased expression of FGF4 and FGF6. Thus, the authors should investigate whether the adult phenotype similarly intersects with FGF signaling. To do so, they can use the existing data on tongue muscle development in the NCBI repository, then perform a targeted qPCR panel to identify the suspect FGF factors. The authors can add the suspect FGF exogenously to wt and Smad4 KO satellite cell cultures and ask if the defects they have observed are rescued. This will clarify whether Smad4 targets different pathways during development and adult life, which is a central tenet of the work.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19484.017</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>[…] Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A, B</xref> – basal levels of SMAD4 protein (in uninjured muscle) seem higher in at least a subset of aged SCs vs. adult SCs.

Negative values are subtracted from UI and 5dpi values. Smad4 and Id1 mRNA expression were examined in SCs derived from uninjured adult and aged skeletal muscles. We were unable to obtain consistent Ct values in the detectable range (&lt; 36) indicative of extremely low/undetectable levels. This is written in the text of the Results (subsection “Smad4 expression is reduced in aged SCs and myogenic cells during regeneration”).</p><p><italic>2) The authors need to better assess the SMAD4 deficiency phenotype in satellite cells using additional markers. Pax7 expression alone does not indicate satellite cells undergoing self-renewal. Authors should quantify numbers of Pax7-positive, MyoD-negative verus Pax7-positive, MyoD-positive cells to determine if satellite cells that have not activated the myogenic program are perturbed in their</italic> ex vivo <italic>culture system. In addition, they should include additional differentiation markers (e.g. myosin heavy chain) to quantify myotube formation and fusion index to support their claim that Smad4 mutant muscle stem cells possess an enhanced propensity for differentiation.</italic> </p><p>As requested we have conducted assessment of Pax7 and MyoD in our ex vivo culture system, the results are found in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C and D</xref>, Results (subsection “Smad4 loss severely impairs SC clonal growth and proliferative potential”, fourth paragraph). As requested we have conducted myotube formation assays, the results are found in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D and E</xref>, Results (subsection “Smad4 loss severely impairs SC clonal growth and proliferative potential”, second paragraph.</p><p><italic>3) The authors should provide a better evaluation of the efficiency of SMAD4 deletion in the TAM-treated P7S4-/- satellite cells in adult vs. aged mice to verify that deletion efficiency is equivalent at the two ages. If the efficiency of Smad4 gene deletion is low in either circumstance, then it would be necessary to use a recombination sensitive reporter to analyze only cells in which the cre-recombinase was successfully activated, as inclusion of all cells (recombined and not recombined) in the analysis might comprise the results (again, depending on the efficiency of recombination).</italic> </p><p>As requested we have examined SMAD4 disruption in P7S4-/- satellite cells, the results are in Figure 8—figure supplement 1. These data indicate similar disruption of SMAD4 in P7S4-/- aged and adult SCs.</p><p><italic>4) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, the authors convincingly demonstrate a reduction in regenerating fiber size at 5dpi in P7S4-/- muscle and aged muscle. Do these defects persist at later timepoints? The authors should examine fiber CSA in more fully regenerated muscle (e.g., 14 and 21 dpi) and in uninjured muscle (at the same post-TAM time point as for the injury/repair studies) as well, to support their conclusions that Smad4-deletion in satellite cells results in severe deficiencies in skeletal muscle regeneration. Both HE and trichrome staining should be shown together with the distribution of fiber sizes. They could also ask if numbers of Pax7-positive cells present underneath the basal lamina return to normal levels in the absence of Smad4, although this might not be testable if they continue to observe a collapse in regeneration at the later timepoint.</italic> </p><p>As requested we have conducted experiments to examine regeneration at a later time point. Assessment of H &amp; E and Sirius Red stained sections demonstrate SC specific Smad4 deletion leads to persistent deficiencies in regeneration 14 days after injury regardless of age. These results are found in new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, Results (last paragraph). The characterization of sublaminar Pax7 cells in 14 dpi P7S4-/- regenerating skeletal muscles was difficult to assess.</p><p><italic>5) The authors need to provide further insight into mechanism to support their conclusion that satellite cell expansion is disrupted with SMAD4 deletion. Inactivation of Smad4 during embryonic development leads to major defects in tongue muscle formation, which was attributed to impaired myogenic differentiation and fusion probably due to decreased expression of FGF4 and FGF6. Thus, the authors should investigate whether the adult phenotype similarly intersects with FGF signaling. To do so, they can use the existing data on tongue muscle development in the NCBI repository, then perform a targeted qPCR panel to identify the suspect FGF factors. The authors can add the suspect FGF exogenously to wt and Smad4 KO satellite cell cultures and ask if the defects they have observed are rescued. This will clarify whether Smad4 targets different pathways during development and adult life, which is a central tenet of the work.</italic> </p><p>As requested we have examined the expression of relevant FGFRs and FGFs pertinent to myogenesis. The results can be found in new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>, Results (subsection “Smad4 loss severely impairs SC clonal growth and proliferative potential”, third paragraph), and Discussion (second paragraph). Although similar to the Han et al., 2012 study we do find reduced expression of FGFR4 and FGF6. However, we also observe a reduction in <italic>FGFR1</italic>, no change in FGF1, and a significant induction of FGF2 expression. Although in the Results section (subsection “Smad4 loss severely impairs SC clonal growth and proliferative potential”, second paragraph) we only state 10% horse serum, DMEM, in the Materials and methods section under FACs purified SC/MP cultures we state FGF2 was used in our culture system. The latter is correct and we apologize for the confusion this may have caused and corrected the Results section accordingly. Although these data do provide similar results to the tongue study as it pertains to Smad4 loss in myogenic cells leading to decreased FGF6 and FGFR4 expression, the reduction in <italic>FGFR1</italic> and 4, and increased FGF2 expression are not congruent with the notion that FGF supplementation could somehow rescue deficiencies in proliferation. If anything, and consistent with the Han et al., 2012 study, such supplementation may promote terminal commitment. Therefore, based on our observations supplementation of individual FGFs was not conducted.</p></body></sub-article></article>
