mediates nuclear mRNP export. Dbp5 also shuttles between nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments with reported roles in transcription, ribosomal subunit export, and translation; however, the mechanism(s) by which nucleocytoplasmic transport occurs and how Dbp5 specifically contributes to each of these processes remains unclear. Towards understanding the functions and transport of Dbp5 in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, alanine scanning mutagenesis was used to generate point mutants at all possible residues within a GFP-Dbp5 reporter. Characterization of the 456 viable mutants led to the identification of an N-terminal Xpo1-dependent nuclear export signal in Dbp5, in addition to other separation-of-function alleles, which together provide evidence that Dbp5 nuclear shuttling is not essential for mRNP export. Rather, disruptions in Dbp5 nucleocytoplasmic transport result in tRNA export defects, including changes in tRNA shuttling dynamics during recovery from nutrient stress.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>DEAD-box protein</kwd><kwd>RNA export</kwd><kwd>nuclear pore complex</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM124120</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Montpetit</surname><given-names>Ben</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>130231</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Montpetit</surname><given-names>Ben</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>79497</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Loewen</surname><given-names>Chris JR</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Within the nucleus, Dbp5p supports tRNA export providing a parallel mechanism by which this conserved DEAD-box protein functions to support eukaryotic gene expression.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In eukaryotic cells, spatial separation of the transcriptional and translational processes necessitates transport of RNA and protein cargos across the nuclear envelope (NE) via nuclear pore complexes (NPCs). Generally, messenger RNAs (mRNAs) are transcribed and processed in the nucleus, transported across the NE, and then translated, stored, or decayed in the cytoplasm. Non-coding RNA (ncRNA) species, such as ribosomal RNA (rRNA) or transfer RNA (tRNA), also undergo nuclear processing and export following transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hopper, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Zemp and Kutay, 2007</xref>). Throughout these events, RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) interact with each RNA to form a ribonucleoprotein complex (RNP), with the protein constituents of each RNP mediating RNA processing and RNP functions within the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Moore, 2005</xref>).</p><p>DEAD-box proteins (DBPs) are a family of RBPs found in all kingdoms of life, often displaying RNA-stimulated ATPase activity, with diverse roles in RNA biology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Linder and Jankowsky, 2011</xref>). For example, DEAD-box protein 5 (Dbp5 or DDX19B in humans) plays an essential role in eukaryotic mRNA metabolism by driving directional nuclear mRNP export (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hodge et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lund and Guthrie, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Schmitt et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Snay-Hodge et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tran et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tseng et al., 1998</xref>). Dbp5, as a DEAD-box protein, is characteristically composed of two RecA-like domains that form the catalytic core of the enzyme, with identifiable sequence motifs that mediate RNA-binding, ATP-binding, and ATP hydrolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Collins et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dossani et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Montpetit et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Napetschnig et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">von Moeller et al., 2009</xref>). Dbp5 ATPase activity is further modulated by cytoplasmic oriented NPC proteins, Nup42, Nup159 (NUP214 in humans), and Gle1 together with the endogenous small molecule co-factor, inositol hexakisphosphate (InsP<sub>6</sub>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">AlcÃ¡zar-RomÃ¡n et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dossani et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hodge et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hodge et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Montpetit et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Napetschnig et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Noble et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Schmitt et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">von Moeller et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Weirich et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Weirich et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wong et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Based on the localization of Dbp5 at NPCs and regulation by NPC components, models propose that Dbp5 encounters mRNPs at the cytoplasmic face of NPCs and remodels these substrates to enforce directionality as mRNPs enter the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Folkmann et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Heinrich et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Stewart, 2007</xref>). However, Dbp5 is dynamic at NPCs and is known to shuttle between the nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Estruch and Cole, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hodge et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Izawa et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Noble et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Takemura et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zhao et al., 2002</xref>). This information prompts an alternative model in which Dbp5 functions as a scaffold, binding the mRNA in the nucleoplasm and traveling with nuclear mRNPs to NPCs where remodeling occurs through interactions with Gle1 and Nup159 (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Heinrich et al., 2017</xref>). While nuclear shuttling of Dbp5 is known, a mechanistic understanding of how nuclear transport is controlled and the relevance of this activity in the context of mRNP assembly and export is not.</p><p>Several additional roles for Dbp5 in gene expression have been proposed that point to functions of Dbp5 in the nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments. For example, studies have shown both physical and genetic interactions between Dbp5 and transcription initiation and translation termination machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">AlcÃ¡zar-RomÃ¡n et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">BeiÃel et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bolger et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Estruch et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Estruch and Cole, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gross et al., 2007</xref>). Additionally, a role for Dbp5 in the nuclear export of pre-ribosomal subunits has been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Neumann et al., 2016</xref>). Most recently, the mammalian and <italic>Xenopus</italic> homologs of Dbp5, DDX19B, have been shown to stabilize ribosomal elongation and termination complexes in vitro and contribute to nuclear R-loop clearance upon replication or DNA damage stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hodroj et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mikhailova et al., 2017</xref>). These data suggest a broader role for Dbp5 in RNA metabolism and gene expression, but the mechanisms by which Dbp5 contributes to these processes remains undefined.</p><p>With the goal of understanding the role of Dbp5 within the nuclear compartment, a comprehensive alanine scanning mutagenesis approach was employed to generate mutants encompassing residues 2â482 of Dbp5. The resulting data provide a functional map of Dbp5 at a single amino acid resolution and mutant alleles that can be employed to detail mechanisms by which Dbp5 contributes to gene expression. This is exemplified by work here describing the identification of single mutations within Dbp5 that facilitate nuclear shuttling of Dbp5 and the discovery of a novel role for Dbp5 in nuclear tRNA export.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Characterization of the <italic>dbp5</italic> mutant collection</title><p>An alanine scanning mutagenesis approach was used to generate single alanine (or glycine if the residue was an alanine) substitutions at positions 2â482 of Dbp5, resulting in a collection of 481 plasmids carrying <italic>dbp5</italic> mutant alleles in frame with GFP at the N-terminus. To begin to address the functional status of each mutant, a plasmid shuffle assay was used to generate strains solely expressing the mutated version of GFP-Dbp5. Based on this selection, 25 alanine substitutions were identified as lethal (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> - Table 1). Consistent with published biochemical and structural models of DBPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Linder, 2006</xref>), the majority of the lethal substitutions identified in Dbp5 were in motifs known to be critical for RNA-binding, ATP-binding, and ATP hydrolysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>). For example, lethal mutations included <italic>Q119A</italic>, which is within the highly conserved Q-motif and is known to be required for adenine recognition and ATP hydrolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cordin et al., 2004</xref>). Similarly, lethal mutations included <italic>D239A</italic>, <italic>E240A</italic>, and <italic>D242A</italic> in motif II (or the Walker B motif), which are part of the namesake D-E-A-D amino acid sequence critical for ATP recognition and hydrolysis. Lethal mutations also mapped to regions of Dbp5 that participate in binding NPC regulators Gle1 and Nup159, including residues R256, Y325, and K382 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dossani et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Montpetit et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Weirich et al., 2004</xref>). Further phenotypic characterization of the individual point mutants within this collection is underway and will be published elsewhere, the focus of this work is on the nuclear transport of Dbp5.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Dbp5 contains an N-terminal nuclear localization signal</title><p>The inclusion of GFP in the mutant collection allowed for Dbp5 localization to be assayed in each point mutant. Under steady-state growth conditions, in the presence of a wild-type allele, GFP-Dbp5 expression was detectable for all 481-point mutations. The majority of the mutants displayed the expected localization pattern with enrichment of Dbp5 at NPCs with diffuse cytoplasmic and nuclear pools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Schmitt et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Snay-Hodge et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Weirich et al., 2004</xref>); however, two strains (GFP-<italic>dbp5-L12A and GFP-dbp5-L15A</italic>) showed a prominent nucleoplasmic localization of GFP-Dbp5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In these mutants, GFP-Dbp5 was found both in the nucleoplasm and nucleolus, as shown through co-localization of GFP-Dbp5<sup>L12A</sup> with the nucleolar protein Nop1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). As sole copy, a plasmid based GFP-<italic>dbp5-L12A</italic> allele displayed a temperature sensitive growth and poly(A)-RNA export defect at 37Â°C, but upon removal of GFP and integration of <italic>dbp5-L12A</italic> into the genome at the endogenous gene locus, these phenotypes were no longer present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2AâB</xref>). These data indicated that N-terminal GFP tagging in the context of the L12A mutation caused growth and mRNP export defects at 37Â°C. This interpretation is based on the fact that a strain with the wild-type <italic>DBP5</italic> allele did not show these defects when tagged with GFP and grown at 37Â°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2AâB</xref>). The integrated and untagged version of <italic>dbp5-L12A</italic> was also assessed by immunofluorescence (IF), and while the NPC associated pool of Dbp5 was not retained in wild-type during the IF procedure, Dbp5<sup>L12A</sup> was enriched in the nucleoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2C</xref>). This data shows that the presence of GFP did not contribute to the nuclear localization of Dbp5<sup>L12A</sup>.

To determine if this region was sufficient to function as an NES, residues 1 to 52 of Dbp5 (NES<sup>DBP5</sup>) were appended to a 2xGFP reporter with an SV40 nuclear localization signal sequence (NLS <sup>SV40</sup>) to generate a 2xGFP-NLS<sup>SV40</sup>-NES<sup>DBP5</sup> reporter. The addition of NES<sup>DBP5</sup> antagonized NLS <sup>SV40</sup> activity and facilitated export of the 2xGFP-NLS<sup>SV40</sup>-NES<sup>DBP5</sup> reporter in a manner comparable to a prototypical PKI NES (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fischer et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wen et al., 1995</xref>).

To test for the possibility that GFP-Dbp5<sup>L12A</sup> still accesses the cytoplasm, an anchor-away system was used with a peroxisomal anchor, Pex25-FKBP12, to anchor GFP-FRB-Dbp5 (present as sole copy of Dbp5) to peroxisomes in a rapamycin-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Haruki et al., 2008</xref>). In wild-type cells, GFP-FRB-Dbp5 rapidly accumulated on peroxisomes after rapamycin addition, resulting in strong depletion of the GFP signal from the NE withinÂ ~4 minutes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Similarly, GFP-FRB-Dbp5<sup>L12A</sup> was rapidly depleted from the nucleoplasm and accumulated on peroxisomes in the same time frame (data not shown). Dbp5 with alanine substitutions at L12, L15, and I17, referred to as GFP-FRB-<italic>dbp5ÎNES</italic>, also showed similar dynamics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), suggesting that the shuttling observed for GFP-FRB-Dbp5<sup>L12A</sup> was not due to residual NES activity. Quantitation of the nuclear GFP-FRB-Dbp5<italic><sup>ÎNES</sup></italic> showed that the nuclear signal was 63 Â± 9% and 58 Â± 7% of starting levels at 2 and 4 minutes after rapamycin treatment, indicating that GFP-FRB-Dbp5<italic><sup>ÎNES</sup></italic> shuttles and remains able to access the cytoplasm. This assay was also performed with wild-type GFP-FRB-Dbp5 in the background of an <italic>xpo1-T539C</italic> strain. Following treatment with LMB forÂ ~7 minutes to allow GFP-FRB-Dbp5 to accumulate in the nucleus, rapamycin was added, but in this scenario GFP-FRB-Dbp5 remained largely nucleoplasmic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, bottom panel). Levels in the nucleoplasm measured 100 Â± 23%, 99.5 Â± 24%, and 103 Â± 18% at 2, 4, and 10 minutes after rapamycin addition as compared to starting levels prior to rapamycin addition. These results show that Dbp5 export dynamics are Xpo1-dependent. As such, Dbp5 must engage the Xpo1 export pathway through both the N-terminal NES and via an independent means, likely in complex with other factors that also engage the Xpo1 transport system. It was also observed that a pool of GFP-FRB-Dbp5<italic><sup>ÎNES</sup></italic> remained in the nucleus of most cells following rapamycin addition, and based on co-localization of GFP-FRB-Dbp5<sup>L12A</sup> with Nop1, this pool of Dbp5 was associated with the nucleolus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). These data show that there are at least two distinct nuclear populations of GFP-FRB-Dbp5<sup>L12A</sup>; one population that is dynamic and enters the cytoplasm through a mechanism dependent on Xpo1, and a second population that is stably associated with the nucleolus.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Dbp5<sup>R423A</sup> shows altered nuclear import</title><p>To further identify mutants with altered Dbp5 nuclear transport, localization of GFP-Dbp5 was determined for the complete mutant collection in the background of a wild-type copy of Dbp5 following exposure to 12% ethanol.

Using this assay, mutations in a stretch of residues within and near motif VI (422-429) were found to disrupt GFP-Dbp5 nuclear accumulation in ethanol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1A</xref>).

Given the dependence of Dbp5 on Xpo1 for nuclear export, this suggested that failure of GFP-Dbp5<sup>R423A</sup> to accumulate in the nucleus during ethanol stress resulted from a defect in nuclear import. The region surrounding R423 is similar in sequence and charge to known NLS sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kosugi et al., 2009</xref>); however, in isolation this region of Dbp5 when fused to 2xGFP did not support nuclear import of the reporter (data not shown). This suggests that other regions of Dbp5 may act in concert with R423 to mediate import, or the mutation of this residue may alter intra- or inter-molecular Dbp5 interactions that impact nuclear import efficiency.</p><p>To assay Dbp5<italic><sup>R423A</sup></italic> nuclear import by another means, the anchor-away technique was employed with a histone protein anchor (Htb2-FKBP12) to address nuclear access of wild-type or R423A versions of GFP-FRB-Dbp5 when present as sole copy. Upon addition of rapamycin, GFP-FRB-Dbp5 moved to the nucleoplasm, resulting in complete depletion of the GFP signal at the NE withinÂ ~11 minutes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). GFP-FRB-Dbp5<sup>R423A</sup> also accumulated in the nucleus following rapamycin addition, but a significant proportion remained apparent at the NE for the entire length of the 18 minute imaging series (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). To test for the possibility that GFP-FRB-Dbp5<sup>R423A</sup> was stably bound to NPCs, the anchor-away system was again employed with the peroxisomal anchor (Pex25-FKBP12). In both wild-type cells and <italic>dbp5-R423A</italic> strains, GFP-FRB-Dbp5 rapidly accumulated on peroxisomes after rapamycin addition, resulting in complete depletion of the GFP signal from the NE in both strains inÂ ~4 minutes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Note the nuclear accumulation defect seen here was not as severe asÂ comparedÂ with ethanol (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). A major difference between these two assays being the presence of a wild-type copy of Dbp5 in the ethanol experiments. Through use of both plasmid and integrated versions of Dbp5, it is observed that the presence of wild-type Dbp5 exacerbates the Dbp5<sup>R423A</sup> nuclear import defect (data not shown), which is suggestive of competition for nuclear transport.

These genetic interactions, combined with the observed poly(A)-RNA export defect only upon GFP tagging and growth at high temperature, suggest that when combined with other perturbations Dbp5<sup>R423A</sup> activity can be limiting for RNA export. An idea supported by the fact that a threshold level of Dbp5 ATPase activity has been determined to be required for mRNP export (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dossani et al., 2009</xref>). Indeed, the location of residue R423 in motif VI, a DEAD-box motif generally involved in nucleotide binding and hydrolysis, would be expected to alter enzymatic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hilbert et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Linder and Jankowsky, 2011</xref>). These facts prompted investigations to determine how the R423A substitution impacts ATPase activity, which may lead to synthetic interactions in the presence of other perturbations to the gene expression apparatus (e.g. deletions impacting the mRNP export apparatus) or the function of Dbp5 (e.g. N-terminal GFP tag). Using an in vitro ATPase assay, the basal steady-state ATPase rate of Dbp5<sup>R423A</sup> was found to be similar to wild-type, but in the presence of RNA, Dbp5<sup>R423A</sup> exhibited an activity 47 Â± 2% of wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). These results were the same at 37Â°C with Dbp5<sup>R423A</sup> RNA-stimulated ATPase activity at 52 Â± 7% of wild-type.

A strain expressing GFP-Dbp5<sup>L12A/R423A</sup> is viable and there is an increased nuclear pool of Dbp5 as compared to R423A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1A</xref>); however, the untagged and integrated version of <italic>dbp5-L12A/R423A</italic> exhibited mRNP export defects at both 25Â°C and 37Â°C, and a strong temperature-dependent growth defect at 37Â°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1BâC</xref>). This result indicates that further limiting the pool of cytoplasmic Dbp5 in the context of the R423A mutation alters mRNP export. Using the double mutant, northern blotting was performed with probes against the tRNA<sup>Ile</sup><sub>UAU</sub> at 37Â°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>).

Due to the presence of mRNP export defects at 25Â°C, this mutant was not used to further interrogate the role of Dbp5 in tRNA export. Combined, the SGA, northern, and in situ data employing the <italic>dbp5-L12A</italic> and <italic>dbp5-R423A</italic> mutations to alter Dbp5 nuclear levels are strongly supportive of Dbp5 functioning in tRNA export within the nucleus, while facilitating mRNP export in the cytoplasmic compartment (e.g. at the cytoplasmic face of NPCs).</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Gle1 is required for tRNA processing</title><p>Reported defects in tRNA processing in <italic>nup159-1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wu et al., 2015</xref>), which is shared with <italic>dbp5-R423A,</italic> suggest a possible relationship between Dbp5 regulation at NPCs and Dbp5 functions in tRNA export.

Furthermore, the mutant collection represents a resource that can be employed to identify alleles of value to the study of Dbp5 in particular contexts, and more broadly, to understand DBPs in general. For example, work in this study identified domains important to Dbp5 nuclear transport, including an N-terminal NES sequence.

Growth data also support the functional importance of critical residues within highly conserved motifs of DBPs required for RNA-binding, ATP-binding, and hydrolysis. In addition, binding sites of Dbp5 specific regulators, Gle1 and Nup159, were identified as lethal when mutated, in agreement with biochemical and structural models describing Dbp5 regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">AlcÃ¡zar-RomÃ¡n et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dossani et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hodge et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Montpetit et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Noble et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Weirich et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Weirich et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>It is important to note that the inclusion of GFP within the mutant collection did result in the modification of mutant phenotypes, which was observed as a Ts and poly(A)-RNA accumulation phenotype at 37Â°C for both GFP-<italic>dbp5-L12A</italic> and GFP-<italic>dbp5-R423A</italic>.

Nonetheless, future screening of this <italic>DBP5</italic> mutant collection against various cellular stresses, or assaying for particular phenotypes, is likely to serve as a powerful means to identify residues that mediate distinct activities of Dbp5 within the gene expression program.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Nuclear shuttling of Dbp5 and mRNP export</title><p>The inclusion of GFP in this collection and subsequent identification of specific mutants that impact nuclear shuttling of Dbp5 was critical to establishing a nuclear function of Dbp5 reported here. This was accomplished through screening the mutant collection in the presence and absence of ethanol stress, which led to the identification of the Xpo1 dependent N-terminal NES sequence in Dbp5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) and a stretch of residues in and around motif VI required for efficient nuclear import (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Interestingly, characterization of NES mutants showed that Dbp5 NES-mediated nuclear export is not essential, and that a large cytoplasmic pool of Dbp5 is not required to support normal cellular functions in the growth conditions tested. This is based on the fact that an integrated and untagged <italic>dbp5-L12A</italic> allele had no growth defect at 25Â°C or 37Â°C, no mRNP export defect detectable by FISH, and minimal genetic interactions as measured by SGA. Similarly, <italic>dbp5-R423A</italic> showed no growth defects or detectable poly(A)-RNA accumulation at any temperature. Together these data support the general conclusion that Dbp5 nuclear shuttling is not essential to Dbp5 mRNP export.</p><p>Importantly, this work further provides information that can be used to discern current models describing the function of Dbp5 during mRNP export (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Heinrich et al., 2017</xref>). In the âscaffoldâ model of export, Dbp5 functions as a scaffold required for proper mRNP formation in the nucleus and travels with the mRNP to the cytoplasmic face of an NPC. At the NPC, the Dbp5 interaction with the mRNA would then be altered by the presence of co-regulators, Gle1 and Nup159, resulting in release of the mRNP into the cytoplasm. In this model, efficient shuttling of Dbp5 through the nucleus would be critical for the function of Dbp5 in mRNP export. The alternative âRNPaseâ model postulates that Dbp5 first encounters translocating mRNPs at the cytoplasmic face of the NPC and remodels these substrates at this location, an activity that would be independent of a nuclear pool of Dbp5. In this model, a constant pool of Dbp5 at NPCs would be central to mRNP export and altering the residual nuclear or cytoplasmic pools of Dbp5 would have less of an impact on mRNP export. Importantly, the data presented here showed that mRNP export is relatively insensitive to changes in Dbp5 steady-state localization and shuttling, which supports the RNPase model and suggests that the nuclear role of Dbp5 may be more critical for activities relating to other RNA processing and ncRNA export events.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Dbp5 acts within the nucleus to support tRNA export</title><p>Given that Dbp5 has been shown to be required for the export of pre-40s and pre-60s ribosomal subunits and the telomerase RNA <italic>TLC1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Neumann et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wu et al., 2014</xref>), one hypothesis could be that Dbp5 nuclear shuttling supports these activities. Additionally, export of pre-ribosomal subunits largely occurs through Xpo1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">KÃ¶hler and Hurt, 2007</xref>), and identification of an Xpo1 mediated NES in Dbp5 provides a mode for Dbp5 to act as an export receptor for these cargoes. However, pre-ribosomal subunit export defects in <italic>DBP5</italic> shuttling mutants (<italic>dbp5-L12A</italic> or <italic>dbp5-R423A</italic>) were not observed under the conditions tested. This may be due in part to multiple redundant pathways that contribute to pre-ribosomal subunit export, which includes Arx1, and the essential non-karyopherin transport receptor required for mRNP export, Mex67 (TAP or NXF1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bradatsch et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Faza et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hung et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Yao et al., 2007</xref>). The lack of a discernible phenotype is also in agreement with work from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Neumann et al. (2016)</xref>, which suggests that Dbp5 activity in relation to rRNA export is occurring at the cytoplasmic face of NPCs, similar to mRNP export. Given that both Dbp5<sup>L12A</sup> and Dbp5<sup>R423A</sup> still access the nuclear envelope, a block in rRNA may not be expected.</p><p>Instead, this work identified a requirement for nuclear Dbp5, and Dbp5 shuttling, in tRNA export (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref>â<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>). Specifically, analyses of wild-type and mutant strains provided evidence for a direct role for nuclear Dbp5 in tRNA export, including a physical interaction between Dbp5 and tRNA transcripts. tRNA export defects were most apparent in an integrated <italic>dbp5-R423A</italic> strain after a temperature shift to 37Â°C or following addition of nutrients (e.g. amino acids) to starved cells. Re-introduction of nutrients is a condition that induces re-export of a large nuclear pool of mature tRNAs that accumulate during nutrient starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Whitney et al., 2007</xref>), which was delayed in <italic>dbp5-R423A.</italic> Notably, a synthetic genetic interaction between <italic>dbp5-R423A</italic> and a <italic>msn5Î</italic> was observed by SGA, with Msn5p also known to promote tRNA re-export following nutrient stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Huang and Hopper, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Murthi et al., 2010</xref>). It is expected that under conditions of high temperature growth or nutrient stress tRNA export defects are most apparent due to the demands put on the tRNA export machinery, which may result from altered tRNA export due to regulation in response to stress and/or lowered efficiencies of other parallel tRNA export pathways under these conditions.</p><p>In the case of Dbp5<sup>R423A</sup>, one potential mechanism by which this mutation could impact tRNA export would be through reducing access of Dbp5 to the nuclear compartment. For example, lowered import rates in Dbp5<sup>R423A</sup> coupled with efficient nuclear export may result in a reduced steady-state level of nuclear Dbp5<sup>R423A</sup> that is not sufficient for tRNA export. However, while binding interactions with unspliced tRNAs appear to be lowered in Dbp5<sup>R423A</sup>, interactions were still detected and were not significantly different from wild-type at the p&lt;0.05 level. As such, altered nuclear access of Dbp5 may not be the only way in which this mutation alters tRNA export, with a second possible means being the altered ability of RNA to stimulate Dbp5<sup>R423A</sup> ATPase activity. In this context, while binding events occur between tRNA and Dbp5<sup>R423A</sup>, as detected in pull-down assays, these interactions may not be coupled with a productive ATPase cycle. This would potentially delay tRNA export due to the need for multiple rounds of Dbp5 binding to a tRNA before ATPase hydrolysis successful occurs and the work required for export is performed. However, it is most likely that the combined lack of nuclear access and altered ATPase activities are the cause of the observed defects in tRNA export. This is based on the fact that the ATPase defect in Dbp5<sup>R423A</sup> is not associated with an mRNP export defect, suggesting ATPase rates are sufficient to meet the needs of mRNA export under conditions where access to the cytoplasmic face of NPCs is unchanged. However, other possibilities exist, including the possibility that tRNA export requires a higher overall level of Dbp5 ATPase activity or the activity required for tRNA export is fundamentally different than mRNP export, either of which are activities unmet by Dbp5<sup>R423A</sup>. Future studies will pursue mechanisms by which Dbp5 mediates tRNA export, especially in response to changes in nutrient availability in conjunction with Msn5p, and how these functions of Dbp5 are specifically impacted in <italic>dbp5-R423A</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Dbp5, Nup159, Gle1, and Mex67 in tRNA export and beyond</title><p>Previous work has also identified a role for the mRNP export factor Mex67 and the Dbp5 regulator Nup159 in the export of tRNA substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chatterjee et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wu et al., 2015</xref>). Here, the role of another Dbp5 regulator, Gle1, in tRNA export was identified. The fact that these four proteins, which function together to support mRNP export (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Folkmann et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Heinrich et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Stewart, 2007</xref>), also show tRNA export defects raises the possibility that this machinery works together to facilitate the export of multiple transcript classes. Importantly, while <italic>nup159-1</italic>, <italic>gle1-4</italic>, and <italic>dbp5-1</italic> Ts alleles have strong mRNP export defects at 37Â°C, <italic>dbp5-R423A</italic> does not.

This lends support to the postulate that Dbp5, and both regulators Gle1 and Nup159, have roles in tRNA export that are independent of a block in mRNP export.</p><p>Given this work, many questions emerge surrounding the function(s) of Dbp5, and how this activity is modulated in vivo, to support mRNA, tRNA, and rRNA export. For example, does Dbp5 generally function to remodel all RNP complexes exiting NPCs or does Dbp5 function in a distinct manner on mRNA, tRNA, and rRNA substrates (e.g. RNPase vs. scaffold models)? For mRNAs, data presented here supports the conclusion that Dbp5 functions at NPCs during mRNP export, in line with an RNPase model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). In contrast, the requirement for nuclear Dbp5 to support tRNA export leads to two broad non-mutually exclusive models, which include Dbp5 acting solely in the nucleus as an RNPase or Dbp5 acting as a scaffold and traveling with tRNA to the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Notably, Mex67 is known to support the export of mRNA, tRNA and rRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bradatsch et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hurt et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Segref et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wu et al., 2015</xref>), and biochemical evidence suggests that Dbp5 targets Mex67 on mRNPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lund and Guthrie, 2005</xref>). As such, does Dbp5 target Mex67 bound to all these RNA substrates? Finally, an important question to address is the role of Dbp5 during nutrient stress and recovery? Do these activities of Dbp5 during a stress response extend to other RNA substrates to more globally regulate the gene expression program? Further work is required to address all of these questions and it is expected that the mutants characterized here, and potentially others within the collection, will serve as a rich resource to aid in this future work.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Models of Dbp5 function in mRNP and tRNA export.</title><p>Data from this work suggest that Dbp5 shuttling is not critical to mRNP export, supporting a model in which Dbp5 acts at NPCs to facilitate export. In such a model (schematic on left), mRNPs assembled in the nucleus would be expected to include the cap binding complex (CBC), export factors Mex67/Mtr2, Nab2, and various other RBPs. Following transport out of the nucleus, the activity of Dbp5 at the cytoplasmic face of the NPC in the context of Gle1:InsP<sub>6</sub> and Nup159 would promote remodeling of RNA-RBP interactions to enforce directional transport (e.g. RNPase model). For tRNAs, a nuclear pool of Dbp5 is involved in export suggesting two broad models of Dbp5 function (schematic on right). In model #1, Dbp5 would act solely within the nucleus to support tRNA processing and export by facilitating events, potentially as an RNPase, that ultimately lead to a tRNA being exported with a tRNA export factor (e.g. Los1 or Mex67). In model #2, Dbp5 engages a tRNA in the nucleus and travels with tRNAs from the nucleus to the cytoplasm in complex with the tRNA and tRNA export factor (e.g. scaffold model), and upon entering the cytoplasm, these interactions would be remodeled in the context of the NPC and Dbp5 regulators. The second model provides a rationale for tRNA export defects in mutants of Dbp5 co-regulators (Nup159 and Gle1), whereas in model #1 the impact of mutations in Dbp5 co-regulators would act through an indirect and/or independent mechanism.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-48410-fig6-v2.tif"/></fig></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Strains, plasmids, and oligos</title><p>For a list of DBP5 mutagenesis primers, yeast strains, plasmids, qPCR primers, FISH probes, and Northern probes see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> - Tables 3-6.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Scanning mutagenesis</title><p>A plasmid (pBM464) containing DBP5Â Â±500 bp of flanking sequence was generated with an N-terminal GFP sequence fused to the DBP5 coding region as a template for mutagenesis.

requests and the accompanying author responses.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;A nuclear role for the DEAD-box protein Dbp5 in tRNA export&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by Kevin Struhl as the Senior Editor, a Reviewing Editor, and two reviewers, a Reviewing Editor, and two reviewers. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The authors conduct a comprehensive analysis of the roles of the budding yeast DEAD box protein, Dbp5, in RNA nuclear export, RNA response to environmental stress, and protein synthesis. The studies are based upon an alanine scanning mutant collection they created and their extensive analyses including: growth phenotypes, live cell imaging of the localization mutant tagged Dbp5 proteins, protein localization motifs via reporter constructs, Sup45 co-IP, subcellular protein tethering, RNA FISH localization of poly A mRNA and tRNA, tRNA co-purification with Dbp5; RNA seq changes in response to stress, and SGA for two dbp5 alleles!</p><p>Due to the massive data sets and analyses the manuscript is quite exhausting to read and the reviewers fear that it will be to disperse and out of reach for non-experts. Still, the authors report results of scientific interest and validity. Hence, to make the paper scientifically appropriate for <italic>eLife</italic> a significant re-writing is suggested. The main point of the manuscript, a role of Dbp5 in tRNA metabolism, is appropriately supported. Moreover, the different roles of Dbp5 in mRNA nuclear export vs. tRNA nuclear export are interesting, including: the different motifs important for both, the data indicating that nucleus-cytoplasm Dbp5 shuttling seems not to be important for mRNA nuclear export (supporting the model of Dbp5 functioning to release mRNA on the cytoplasmic surface), whereas it appears to be important for tRNA nuclear export (support a model of Dbp5 assembling tRNA in an export complex).</p><p>In contrast, the reviewers believe, that the sections describing the RNA-seq analyses, the translation inhibitor studies and MMS screen do not make a coherent scientific point, but could potentially be assembled into separate manuscripts.</p><p>1) Tailoring of the manuscript throughout would really help its impact. Models/cartoons â diagrams often convey messages more effectively than text. For example, a cartoon indicating how Dbp5 may function differently in mRNA vs. tRNA nuclear export could help readers understand the complexity of Dbp5's biological roles and the roles of different motifs in the various functions.</p><p>2) Figure labeling â it would be easier to access the data if the labeling of figures were improved. For example: Figure 2âfigure supplement 1B and C appear similar, but B is FISH and C is protein imaging; so, putting this information on the figure in addition to the legend would be helpful to the readers. Another example for Figure 5; it would be helpful to label A. tRNAIle, B. tRNATyr, C. FISH tRNATyr, D. tRNAIle. Also, it is not clear in the figure or the text that A and D were conducted in Dbp5-tagged vs. untagged strains.</p><p>3) tRNA experiments: Figure 5C and D; why is the FISH conducted for tRNATyr whereas the northern for tRNAIle? Figure 6, even though L12A doesn't have a very remarkable affect upon tRNA nuclear accumulation, its response to -AA likely should be included in Figure 6. tRNA RIP analyses should include an internal nonspecific RNA, such as a mitochondrial tRNA, to assess pull-down specificity. One would have expected that L12A and R423A would have shown different levels of tRNA pulldown given their different roles as analyzed by FISH; how do the authors think about this.</p><p>4) Subsection âGene expression in <italic>dbp5-L12A</italic> and <italic>dbp5-R423A</italic> at steady-state and in response to MMSâ: no data are shown for the claim that steady state RNA levels were similar for wt, L12A and R423A mutants.</p><p>5) Figure 4 â it is nearly impossible to read the identities of the genes through the magenta and purple colors.</p><p>6) Figure 4A,B: differences in RNA levels in the mutants upon MMS treatment would be better shown as correlation plots. The data are hard to parse in their current form.</p><p>7) Subsection âGene expression in <italic>dbp5-L12A</italic> and <italic>dbp5-R423A</italic> at steady-state and in response to MMSâ: The FDR values for the highlighted GO terms are large (i.e. barely significant), raising the question whether the reported enrichments are biological meaningful. The authors make the point that L12A and R423A cause opposite changes in gene expression in the GO categories. Are the same genes affected? If so, this should be shown. If not, the FDR values for enrichment would probably render this effect statistically insignificant. More depth is needed in this section.</p><p>8) Subsection â<italic>dbp5-L12A</italic> and <italic>dbp5-R423A</italic> genetic interaction profilesâ: The referenced Figure 4 â figure supplement 1 seems to be missing.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;A nuclear role for the DEAD-box protein Dbp5 in tRNA export&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>.

Please find below our response to each.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Due to the massive data sets and analyses the manuscript is quite exhausting to read and the reviewers fear that it will be to disperse and out of reach for non-experts. Still, the authors report results of scientific interest and validity. Hence, to make the paper scientifically appropriate for eLife a significant re-writing is suggested. The main point of the manuscript, a role of Dbp5 in tRNA metabolism, is appropriately supported. Moreover, the different roles of Dbp5 in mRNA nuclear export vs. tRNA nuclear export are interesting, including: the different motifs important for both, the data indicating that nucleus-cytoplasm Dbp5 shuttling seems not to be important for mRNA nuclear export (supporting the model of Dbp5 functioning to release mRNA on the cytoplasmic surface), whereas it appears to be important for tRNA nuclear export (support a model of Dbp5 assembling tRNA in an export complex).</p><p>In contrast, the reviewers believe, that the sections describing the RNA-seq analyses, the translation inhibitor studies and MMS screen do not make a coherent scientific point, but could potentially be assembled into separate manuscripts.</p></disp-quote><p>The manuscript has been rewritten to focus on Dbp5 nuclear transport and the role of Dbp5 in tRNA metabolism. This includes removal of the phenotypic screens and RNA-seq data as suggested. We believe this has improved overall of clarity and more effectively conveys the impact of the work. Again, we thank the reviewers for this suggestion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) Tailoring of the manuscript throughout would really help its impact. Models/cartoons â diagrams often convey messages more effectively than text. For example, a cartoon indicating how Dbp5 may function differently in mRNA vs. tRNA nuclear export could help readers understand the complexity of Dbp5's biological roles and the roles of different motifs in the various functions.</p></disp-quote><p>As noted above, rewriting has aided with both message and impact. We have also added a model figure to help convey potential ways Dbp5 is functioning in tRNA vs. mRNA export (see Figure 6).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Figure labeling â it would be easier to access the data if the labeling of figures were improved. For example: Figure 2âfigure supplement 1B and C appear similar, but B is FISH and C is protein imaging; so, putting this info. on the figure in addition to the legend would be helpful to the readers. Another example for Figure 5; it would be helpful to label A. tRNAIle, B. tRNATyr, C. FISH tRNATyr, D. tRNAIle. Also, it is not clear in the figure or the text that A and D were conducted in Dbp5-tagged vs. untagged strains.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added labels as requested, plus reviewed all figures and legends to improve labeling and clarity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) tRNA experiments: Figure 5C and D; why is the FISH conducted for tRNATyr whereas the northern for tRNAIle?</p></disp-quote><p>Figure 5C/D, now Figure 4C/D, were both performed with tRNAIle, which was not apparent based on figure labeling. Related to comment #2 above, we have now added labels to resolve this issue.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 6, even though L12A doesn't have a very remarkable affect upon tRNA nuclear accumulation, its response to -AA likely should be included in Figure 6.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added L12A data as requested. Please see current Figure 5 (previously Figure 6).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>tRNA RIP analyses should include an internal nonspecific RNA, such as a mitochondrial tRNA, to assess pull-down specificity.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now assessed pulldown specificity by looking for the mitochondrial COX1 mRNA in cDNA libraries generated from all RIP experiments used to generate the data presented in Figure 5B. The COX1 transcript was not detected in any of the Dbp5 RIPs at levels above the -RT background; however, it was present in cDNA libraries made from total RNA. These data are discussed in the text in subsection âDbp5 supports re-export of mature tRNAs following nutritional stressâ and shown in Figure 5âfigure supplement 1C.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>One would have expected that L12A and R423A would have shown different levels of tRNA pulldown given their different roles as analyzed by FISH; how do the authors think about this.</p></disp-quote><p>As shown in Figure 5 and discussed in subsection âDbp5 supports re-export of mature tRNAs following nutritional stressâ and subsection âDbp5 acts within the nucleus to support tRNA exportâ of the revised manuscript, L12A has a significant enrichment for binding tRNAIle. We interpret this increased interaction to be reflective of the increased nuclear pool of Dbp5. In the case of R423A, the interaction with unspliced tRNAs appeared reduced potentially corresponding with altered nuclear import, but this did not reach a significance level of p&lt;0.05. Still, reduced binding is not the only means by which this mutation could impact tRNA export. For example, our data shows that RNA does not stimulate the ATPase activity of R423A to the level of wildtype Dbp5. As such, although binding events occur and are detected, binding may not be coupled with productive ATPase cycles that are required to support tRNA export. We have expanded the discussion of the R423A mutant in subsection âDbp5 acts within the nucleus to support tRNA exportâ of the revised manuscript to reflect these comments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Subsection âGene expression in dbp5-L12A and dbp5-R423A at steady-state and in response to MMSâ: no data are shown for the claim that steady state RNA levels were similar for wt, L12A and R423A mutants.</p></disp-quote><p>Through revision of the manuscript this statement has been removed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Figure 4: it is nearly impossible to read the identities of the genes through the magenta and purple colors.</p></disp-quote><p>Colors have been updated to allow gene names to be more easily read. Please see current Figure 3 (previously Figure 4).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Figure 4A,B: differences in RNA levels in the mutants upon MMS treatment would be better shown as correlation plots. The data are hard to parse in their current form.</p></disp-quote><p>Through revision of the manuscript these data have been removed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Subsection âGene expression in dbp5-L12A and dbp5-R423A at steady-state and in response to MMSâ: The FDR values for the highlighted GO terms are large (i.e. barely significant), raising the question whether the reported enrichments are biological meaningful. The authors make the point that L12A and R423A cause opposite changes in gene expression in the GO categories. Are the same genes affected? If so, this should be shown. If not, the FDR values for enrichment would probably render this effect statistically insignificant. More depth is needed in this section.</p></disp-quote><p>Through revision of the manuscript these data have been removed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Subsection âdbp5-L12A and dbp5-R423A genetic interaction profilesâ: The referenced Figure 4âfigure supplement 1 seems to be missing.</p></disp-quote><p>Through revision of the manuscript these data have been removed.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript has been improved and acceptance is recommended in principle, but there is one remaining issue that needs to be addressed before acceptance, the new Figure 6 does not provide identification for all the proteins, either on the figure or in the legend.</p></disp-quote><p>We have revised the manuscript by Lari et al., entitled â<italic>A nuclear role for the DEAD-box protein Dbp5 in tRNA export</italic>â as requested.
