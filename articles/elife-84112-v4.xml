In this manuscript, we describe a procedure to rapidly design immunostaining protocols for antibody labeling of cleared brain tissue. We prepared libraries of 0.5–1.0 mm thick tissue sections that are fixed, pre-treated, and cleared via similar, but different procedures to optimize staining conditions for a panel of antibodies. Results from a library of mouse tissue correlate well with results from a similarly prepared library of human brain tissue, suggesting mouse tissue is an adequate substitute for protocol optimization. These data show that procedural differences do not influence every antibody-antigen pair in the same way, and minor changes can have deleterious effects, therefore, optimization should be conducted for each target. The approach outlined here will help guide researchers to successfully label a variety of targets, thus removing a major hurdle to accessing the rich 3D information available in large, cleared human tissue volumes.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cell biology</kwd><kwd>neuroscience</kwd><kwd>human</kwd><kwd>mouse</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000049</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Aging</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NIA-K99AG068602</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zwang</surname><given-names>Theodore J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005294</institution-id><institution>Massachusetts General Hospital</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Harrison Gardner, Jr Innovation Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zwang</surname><given-names>Theodore J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Conditions for multiplexed antibody labeling in mouse brain tissue translates to effective labeling in human brain tissue when samples are prepared similarly.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In recent years, there have been substantial improvements in the techniques used to visualize features of brains, organs, and whole organisms in three dimensions. One promising method, tissue clearing, involves lipid removal and refractive index matching to significantly decrease light scattering. Tissue clearing allows for light microscopy to observe the distribution of individual molecules throughout entire organs millimeters to centimeters in size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ueda et al., 2020b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Richardson et al., 2021</xref>). This holds extraordinary promise for understanding human diseases, where the identification and characterization of abnormal structures is often an early step toward the development of clinical treatments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Kim et al., 2016</xref>). Difficulties with antibody staining and labeling is common in traditional thin tissue section histology, but is dramatically amplified in large, cleared samples. Although techniques have been developed to improve the homogeneity of staining (SWITCH; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Murray et al., 2015</xref>) and increase the speed of antibody labeling in large, cleared tissue (eFlash [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Yun et al., 2019</xref>], EFIC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Na et al., 2021</xref>], MDH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Dwyer et al., 2021</xref>]), these methods only work if an antibody’s epitope is well preserved during the tissue preparation and clearing process. This is rarely the case and complete, specific and homogenous staining is now the most common bottleneck preventing the widespread use of tissue clearing in samples that cannot be modified to express fluorescent proteins such as human tissue. Therefore, most tissue clearing methods have been optimized for studies in rodents, and only a few recent studies apply clearing techniques to human tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Scardigli et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Lai et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Susaki et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Matos et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Zhao et al., 2020</xref>). Here, we present a simple optimization strategy and automated analysis routine that allows researchers to tune their immunohistochemistry (IHC) protocols for labeling protein targets in cleared and uncleared brain tissue. Further, we demonstrate that our optimized protocols can be extended from mouse to human tissue.</p><p>IHC has a history of being difficult, with myriad improvements taking place over decades to allow for its current ubiquity in pathology laboratories and biomarker discovery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Matos et al., 2010</xref>). The basic concept of IHC is to use antibodies to label specific antigens in a sample, which can then be imaged to determine the antigen’s distribution. Successful IHC requires four fundamentals: (1) the antibody cannot denature, (2) the epitope cannot denature, (3) the antibody must diffuse completely through the tissue, and (4) the antibody must only bind its intended target. Often researchers develop lengthy protocols that include steps thought to enable successful labeling but are not necessarily based on empirical evidence or are borrowed from others using completely different antibodies or tissues. In general, IHC protocols share several common steps: first components of the tissue must be fixed in place to preserve its structure. This is typically performed by freezing the tissue or placing it in an aldehyde containing solution like formalin. It may then be stored for long periods of time before an investigation is initiated. Next, different methods of antigen retrieval can be deployed to enhance antibody binding. The tissue may also be blocked by incubating with serum or other agents to deactivate endogenous enzymes and reduce non-specific antibody staining. Finally, when labeling and imaging thick tissue, tissue clearing protocols are required that introduce several additional chemical treatments including dehydration, hydrogel embedding, delipidation, and immersion in a solution that is refractive index matched to the processed tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Richardson et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Richardson and Lichtman, 2015</xref>).</p><p>It is well understood that differences in staining quality can result from biological heterogeneity such as small differences in tissue composition, individual antibodies, their epitopes, and overall tissue structure. However, further variability can be induced by each step of an IHC protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Kim et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Matos et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Shi et al., 2011</xref>). Because of this, IHC protocols can usually be reproduced with the same tissues, antibodies, and fluorophores. Unfortunately, it is common to have difficulties extending these protocols to different antibodies or tissues. The complexity of these multi-step protocols makes it prohibitively costly and time-intensive for researchers to optimize all possible IHC conditions for their specific study. This has slowed the testing and adoption of reported improvements in IHC procedures as many researchers are forced to guess at the best protocol for their samples.</p><p>Experiments with human tissue samples are essential for a complete understanding of the pathology of many diseases. However, the necessary optimization of IHC protocols described above is often not possible in human tissue due to its scarcity. Attempting to use IHC protocols optimized for different tissues or antibodies could confound results and limit the insight gained from such precious resources. Ideally, researchers could optimize protocols in a more plentiful model species such as mice and directly transfer these methods to human samples. However, it is not often clear whether IHC improvements in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Murray et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Wassie et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Park et al., 2018</xref>) would translate to better staining of human tissue. Methods that can rapidly determine optimal IHC protocols for individual antibodies and assess their applicability to tissues from different species are needed.</p><p>Inspired by our previous experience troubleshooting IHC in large volumes of mouse brain tissue, we developed a practical workflow to rapidly optimize IHC protocols for different antibodies. We then applied this methodology to a variety of targets in mouse and human brain tissue to understand (1) how much variation exists if IHC protocols are optimized for individual antibodies and (2) if optimized IHC protocols can be generalized between species. We compare the effect of different IHC protocols on antibodies and a small molecule DNA label, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). We also test the influence of protocols on different antibodies raised against the same protein target and finally, explore whether IHC protocols optimized in mouse tissue can produce equally high-quality staining in human tissue. Together this work provides a method to empirically determine the optimal procedure for IHC studies in large-volume tissue, assess its generalizability, and support the use of abundant mouse tissue to optimize IHC protocols for scarce human samples.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Strategy to rapidly assess the optimization of protocols</title><p>Our workflow for determining an optimal IHC protocol is inspired by the success of quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) modeling for drug discovery. QSAR models are used to predict the biological activities of untested drugs by first testing a library of drugs with similar but varied structures, measuring how each drug affects the activity, then creating a model that relates the structural changes to the observed activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Muratov et al., 2020</xref>). Borrowing from this strategy and making a library of tissues that all went through similar processing steps but for a few key changes allows for us to predict the optimal staining protocol without needing to test every possible combination of conditions.</p><p>The use of large intact organs such as whole mouse brains is unnecessary and impractical for optimizing an IHC protocol. However, if the tissue sections are too thin, the impact of antibody diffusion cannot be fully appreciated and compared across protocols; whereas, if the sections are too thick, extensive incubation times are required. Through empirical testing, we found tissue sections 0.5–1.0 mm thick and antibody incubation times of 18–24 hr to be sufficient to assess the influence of our chosen conditions on IHC staining quality (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>), and allows dozens of protocols or multiple antibodies to be tested with tissue from a single mouse brain depending on the epitope distribution. It should be noted that these data suggest the signal when staining 24 hr and under may be limited by the depletion of antibodies on their way through the tissue, which should be considered when making comparisons of staining quality.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Process for generating a library of tissue prepared with different protocols.</title><p>Start with a baseline protocol (see Materials and methods). Choose conditions to test that can be separated into categories believed to influence staining quality. Prepare tissue by varying only one or two conditions from the baseline at a time. Each protocol should only vary by a single condition from at least one other protocol to allow for a complete understanding of how each change influences staining. So resulting immunohistochemistry (IHC) quality can isolate the effect of each condition change. Stored library of cleared tissues then allows for rapid antibody testing to quickly determine optimal IHC conditions for each antibody as well as protocols that allow for multiplexed IHC. We consistently found conditions in red to have exclusively negative effects on IHC or tissue integrity, so they were excluded from testing with most antibodies.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-84112-fig1-v4.tif"/></fig><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Quantifying the staining quality for comparison across protocols and antibodies.</title><p>Immunohistochemistry (IHC) quality comparisons can be difficult to determine by eye due to differences in fluorescence intensity and background, as well as the many ways that software can modify the visual representation of data, so we created a pipeline to quickly quantify staining quality in a way that allows rapid comparison. (<bold>a</bold>) First, a confocal or lightsheet microscope is used to image a Z-stack throughout the entire thickness of the sample. All imaging parameters are kept identical for a given antibody/fluorophore to allow for comparison between protocols. (<bold>b</bold>) Fluorescence values were normalized across the sample, then a rolling-ball algorithm was used in Imaris software to generate surfaces around fluorescent features with intensity above a threshold value. Alternatively, segmentation masks were generated using Ilastik following their pixel classifier workflow. (<bold>c</bold>) The voxels within the surface were indexed to define the array of voxels with and without staining that could then be analyzed in Matlab. (<bold>d</bold>) The staining quality was quantified and visualized by plotting the ratio of voxels with staining over the total number of voxels in a plane at that depth in the image, the average signal intensity within the segmented region, and the average noise intensity outside of the segmented region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplements 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">2</xref>). A higher proportion of indexed voxels, higher signal, lower noise, and longer depth to reach half-max staining intensity all represent better staining quality. This can also be used to provide visual representation of reproducibility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplements 4</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s6">6</xref>). It is also possible to reduce these numbers into a figure of merit that can be quantitatively compared between conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s7">Figure 3—figure supplement 7</xref>).</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-84112-fig2-v4.tif"/></fig><p>Using QSAR modeling as a guide, we selected 17 conditions to test in our proof-of-principle studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). These conditions were divided across four standard IHC/tissue clearing steps: fixation, blocking/unmasking, delipidation, and antibody incubation. Five conditions were later omitted, and multiple 0.5–1.0 mm thick tissue sections were assigned to 12 protocols to create the final tissue library (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). With the library complete, a tissue sections from each condition could be selected for further head-to-head analysis in our image analysis pipeline that outputs a quantifiable metric of quality (see below). Using these metrics, we were able to predict the optimal combination of IHC conditions for each antibody we tested from initial fixation through to final labeling. During this proof-of-principle study, we only tested high-quality antibodies that were already known to have high specificity and limited off-target binding for IHC in thin tissue slices.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Measuring IHC quality in cleared tissue</title><p>To compare the quality of IHC in the cleared tissue libraries we developed a data analysis pipeline to quickly extract the distribution of fluorescence in multiple samples and derive performance parameters. First, we used one of two different software (Imaris or Ilastik) to generate image segmentation masks. For analysis with Imaris, we isolated objects based on the intensity of fluorescence relative to nearby background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). For analysis with Ilastik, we leveraged machine learning algorithms that allow users to classify pixels and supervise the generation of the segmentation mask (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Berg et al., 2019</xref>). Either of these segmentation masks are then run through code in Matlab that extracts the signal, noise, signal-noise ratio, area of staining, and the distance into the tissue at which the staining intensity drops by half. IHC quality can then be made by comparing these features across samples. It should be noted that simply relying on depth to half-max staining does not separate the issues of free antibody penetration speed through the tissue nor the extent of antibody depletion along the way, and it is possible that conditions that reduce the antigenicity may significantly enhance the apparent penetration rate.</p><p>This analysis does not require staining of images to be perfect nor precise but requires features that can at least be separated via pixel classification. For images with unintended background staining, Ilastik can be trained to separately classify intended and unintended binding. Note that Imaris is also capable of performing similar pixel classification by integrating Labkit, which we did not compare.</p><p>After acquiring segmentation results, turning it into an ideal figure of merit will vary depending on the antigen of interest and its distribution in tissue. For antigens that have relatively constant distribution over the depth of imaging, the area of each plane within a Z-stack that is segmented could be used as a figure of merit for staining quality across conditions. However, if the antigen distribution does not have a constant distribution, it is better to use a figure of merit that is normalized based on the area of segmentation, such as the average staining intensity at each depth plane.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Conditions that influence antibody and epitope preservation</title><p>Starting from a comprehensive collection of published IHC protocols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Richardson et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Kim et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Scardigli et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Richardson and Lichtman, 2015</xref>), we selected a subset of commonly varied conditions to create 12 test protocols for proof of principle. Each protocol is nearly identical, only varying by a single condition from at least one other protocol to allow for a complete understanding of how each change influences staining. The baseline protocol involved minimal processing and gentle conditions. Specifically, the tissue was fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 2 days post-perfusion, embedded in hydrogel made of 4% acrylamide, delipidated in sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) for 1 day at 37°C, rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) with 0.2% Triton X-100 (PBST) at 4°C, and incubated with antibodies at 4°C for 18 hr. We then created a library of tissue that was processed using small changes to this baseline protocol, so we could compare how each of these changes influenced IHC quality. This library included changes in the composition of the hydrogel (with and without 4% PFA), changes in delipidation time (1, 2, 3 days), additional steps before antibody incubation (such as unmasking with 50°C or incubation with glycine), and differential changes in antibody incubation temperature (4°C or room temperature). In addition to this library, we also examined the effects of boiling samples in citrate buffer before or after delipidation, heating to temperatures above 70°C before immunolabeling, and removal or decrease of PFA concentration in the transcardial perfusion or post-perfusion fixing step (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). However, these conditions were universally observed to negatively impact IHC or tissue integrity, so they were excluded from our final library.</p><p>We chose two antibodies commonly used in neuroscience studies of cleared volumes (Glut1 and NeuN) and performed IHC on the same tissue sections from a mouse cortex that were processed according to the 12 protocols (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Each antibody was directly conjugated to a fluorophore: Glut1 to Alexa Fluor 488 and NeuN to Alexa Fluor 568. Increasing delipidation time to 2 days had a positive influence on NeuN staining, and no influence on Glut1 staining, but both showed worse IHC when increasing the delipidation time further. Incubation of tissue at 50°C for 1 hr prior to antibody incubation improved staining for Glut1 and NeuN. Glycine treatment had no significant effect on NeuN staining, but inhibited Glut1 staining. Incubating antibodies at room temperature improved NeuN staining and on Glut1 staining. Intriguingly, staining with DAPI appears insensitive to the different protocols (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Inclusion of PFA in the hydrogel resulted in decreased IHC quality for both Glut1 and NeuN, however this significantly improved IHC of dopamine receptor 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Therefore, we ascertained the optimal protocol for simultaneously staining Glut1, NeuN, and DAPI was to delipidate for 2 days, place the tissue at 50°C for 1 hr before incubating with antibodies, and incubating the antibodies at room temperature. Importantly, these same conditions would result in no staining of dopamine receptor 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Instead, an IHC protocol is required to use PFA in the hydrogel step to show adequate staining of dopamine receptor 2, which can still allow for simultaneous staining of NeuN, Glut1, and DAPI if the tissue is only delipidated for 1 day and incubated with antibodies at 4°C. Together, these results show that different conditions can have opposite effects on the quality of staining and depth of antibody penetration and reinforce the importance of optimizing sample preparation conditions for each antibody.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Influence of common conditions on immunohistochemistry in mouse brain tissue.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Representative maximum intensity projection views from the top and side of 500 µm thick, 5 mm wide tissue sections.

To better understand whether optimal IHC protocols may be shared for antibodies against the same target, we compared the staining of a monoclonal GFAP directly conjugated to a fluorophore and a polyclonal GFAP that was detected with a fluorophore conjugated to a secondary antibody. To enable a direct comparison, both sets of antibodies were used to label the same tissue sections. Immunolabeling GFAP with different antibodies shows that the trends in staining quality are similar for both antibodies across all conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). This suggests that conditions that enhance GFAP stability and prevent denaturation of its epitopes have a positive effect on all GFAP antibodies provided the antibodies are of high quality, have high specificity and limited off-target binding. This also suggests that IHC of GFAP with these antibodies is limited more by denaturation of the epitope than the antibody itself. We found that both GFAP antibodies successfully labeled their target under similar conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), and both showed similar conditions where no labeling occurred (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Some differences in labeling quality are apparent between antibodies, however it is not clear whether the differences in labeling quality are due to the conjugation of the fluorophore or other differences between the monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies. As this approach also reduces the length of the staining protocol, it is recommended to use primary antibodies directly conjugated to fluorophores whenever possible.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Immunohistochemistry of two different antibodies for GFAP.</title><p>Representative maximum intensity projection views from the top and side of 500 µm thick, 5 mm wide tissue sections of C57Bl/6J mouse isocortex stained with two different antibodies for GFAP.

It is worth noting that this was not necessarily the best protocol for each individual antibody. It is more important to have adequate staining of each epitope than to have fantastic staining of one at the cost of another. As described above, we determined the optimal protocol for multiplexed labeling by combining the protocol changes that quantitatively improve the staining quality, defined by half-max depth, for each antibody above the baseline protocol and do not significantly degrade performance of other antibodies. For NeuN, Glut1, and AT8 antibodies this protocol involves clearing for 2 days, using 50°C to unmask epitopes, and incubation of antibodies at room temperature. The optimal protocol was then validated in 1 mm thick pieces of human brain tissue, approximately 100-fold thicker than typical paraffin embedded sections. Antibodies for tau in mice expressing human tau show similar variability across conditions for the labeling of labeling tau in human tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). We concurrently incubated the human tissue with three antibodies conjugated to three different fluorophores (NeuN-A568, Glut1-A488, and AT8-A647). These antibodies were used to stain tissue that was first embedded in a 4% acrylamide hydrogel, cleared for 2 days and thoroughly washed. The antibodies were incubated with the tissue for 14 days to ensure complete staining through the whole sample in both humans (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>) and mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>).

By carefully following the optimal IHC protocol determined in this work, we were able to achieve complete penetration and simultaneous labeling of the 1 mm thick human tissue with all three antibodies. Both the Glut1-labeled vasculature and AT8-labeled tau are extremely well defined and could be easily quantitated.

When a subset of antibodies fail in a multi-target IHC protocol, often the antibodies themselves are blamed. Here, we have found that small changes to an IHC protocol can have profound effects on labeling efficiency. Rather than the antibody, our data suggests that poor staining is most often due to denaturation or blockage of the epitope. These procedural differences do not influence every antibody-antigen pair in the same way, so the optimal protocols for IHC should be determined for each individual target. Using combinations of antibodies in the same tissue may require using a protocol with conditions that are acceptable for all antibodies, rather than conditions that are optimal for each individual antibody. Unfortunately, as we found with the dopamine receptor 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>) and GFAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>) IHC, a protocol may not exist to allow for both targets to be effectively stained simultaneously. However, the methods described here allow a researcher to rapidly determine (1) an optimal protocol for single antibody staining, (2) an acceptable protocol that allows simultaneous multi-antibody staining, or (3) that cyclical single-antibody staining and stripping will be required to match conditions necessary for each antibody.</p><p>Importantly, temperature, fixation conditions, and the other conditions investigated here have greater influence, the larger the tissue volume becomes. For many of the tested protocols, the difference in staining is not apparent at the surface which suggests that the use of tissue sections that are too thin does not allow for appropriate optimization. Many of the protocols we tested for NeuN or Glut1 produce some degree of labeling at the surface of the sample that would have appeared no different between samples thinner than 50 µm, despite obvious differences in staining quality at depth.</p><p>Most surprising to us was that mouse tissue is a good model system for determining large-volume IHC protocols for human samples. However, these results show that minor procedural changes can disrupt the quality of staining, so it is important that tissue preparations are identical.</p><p>IHC protocols in large-volume tissue that requires clearing can take weeks or months to complete depending on the initial state and size of the tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Susaki et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ueda et al., 2020a</xref>). Previous studies have suggested that human tissue requires processing for longer than comparable-sized rodent tissue. Our results suggest that this is not due to intrinsic differences between human and mouse brain tissue, but rather a result of differences in the state of the tissue when clearing experiments are started. Human tissue is often stored in fixative for extended periods of time and, as our data shows, even a small increase in PFA exposure can have significant influence on IHC quality and depth. To our surprise, tissue that was delipidated for 3 days showed less rapid IHC penetration than tissue that was cleared for 2 days in all cases except for DAPI labeling. This suggests that samples can quickly become over-cleared and lose antigenicity which may extend the amount of time previously reported as necessary for IHC. It follows that future experiments should explore labeling tissue with antibodies with even shorter or milder fixation conditions and, where possible, carried out prior to any tissue clearing procedures.</p><p>Our methodology enables rapid optimization of IHC protocols, including protocols that require tissue clearing and provides a simple path to imaging tissue blocks that are 100 times thicker than conventional tissue slices. First, a library of cleared tissue samples that were each processed using different conditions is generated that can be stored for future experiments. Then, optimal IHC conditions are determined for new antibodies within a few days (approximately 24 hr for staining, 24 hr for rinsing, 12–24 hr for refractive index matching/clearing, 3 hr to image the samples, and a similar amount of time to quantify and compare the staining quality). The variability in staining quality across protocols suggests that researchers should use this process to test how changes may affect antibodies or epitopes that they plan to study before committing many weeks or months to a procedure in larger volumes. Additionally, these results speak to the necessity for scientists to publish both conditions that improve and degrade specific antibody performance. Understanding which procedures and antibodies are appropriate for a given sample will be essential for tissue clearing techniques to gain widespread use in human tissue. We are optimistic that our optimization process will allow researchers use these techniques to successfully label cleared human tissue, which will improve the adoption of this technique and the ability to unlock new insight into human pathology and neuroanatomy.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Human tissue samples</title><p>Human tissue was provided by the Massachusetts Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center (ADRC) with approval from the Mass General Brigham IRB (1999P009556). Three human participants with AD were selected from the Massachusetts Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center. Sex, age at death, Braak staging, which hemisphere, and comorbidities are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>. Autopsy tissue from human brains were collected at Massachusetts General Hospital, with informed consent of patients or their relatives and approval of local institutional review boards. Human tissue was received unfrozen immediately after autopsy and fixed (sample 2620) or frozen immediately after autopsy then thawed prior to fixation (samples 1581 and 1762). Tissue was placed in 4% PFA for 48 hr at 4°C, transferred to PBS for 24 hr at 4°C before slicing. This tissue was treated identically to the mouse tissue described below in the tissue slicing procedure and onward.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Mice strains</title><p>Male and female C57Bl/6J mice (Jackson Laboratory 000664) were used for most tissue experiments. For tissue to test IHC of tau, 10- to 12-month-old male hTau mice bred from a local colony (B6.Cg-Mapt<sup>tm1(EGFP)Klt</sup> Tg(MAPT)8cPdav/J, Jackson Laboratory 005491) that express only human tau isoforms were used. hTau knockout mice bred from a local colony (Mapt<sup>tm1(EGFP)Klt</sup>/J, Jackson Laboratory 004779) were used as controls for tau IHC experiments. Mouse experiments were performed with approval of local institutional review boards (IACUC protocol # 2019N000026).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Perfusion</title><p>Mice were transcardially perfused with ice-cold 40 ml PBS, followed by 40 ml 4% PFA (Electron Microscopy Sciences). Brains were removed from the cranium and placed in 4% PFA for 48 hr at 4°C. Brains were then transferred to PBS for 24 hr at 4°C before slicing.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Tissue slicing</title><p>Brains were embedded in 4% agarose hydrogel. To do this, extracted brains were placed individually in a small Petri dish and let dry slightly. The agarose solution was dissolved by boiling in a microwave, then left on the counter to cool before pouring. Agarose was poured to completely cover the top of the brain, which allows it to provide a solid support to prevent deformation during cutting. A block of agarose containing the brain was placed in a vibratome (VT1000S vibrating blade microtome, Leica, Wetzlar, Germany) then cut into 500 or 1000 µm coronal or sagittal slices. Each slice was then removed from the agarose through gentle manipulation with blunt forceps or paintbrushes before crosslinking.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Tissue hydrogel crosslinking</title><p>Each slice was incubated with a hydrogel crosslinking solution for 1 day at 4°C to let the molecules diffuse through the tissue. Solutions should be kept cold before and after the addition of VA-044 to prevent premature initiation of polymerization. Different crosslinking solutions were used to determine the effect of including PFA on IHC. <italic>Crosslinking solution 1</italic>: PBS with 4% (wt/vol) acrylamide (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO) and 0.25% (wt/vol) VA-044 thermal polymerization initiator (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA). <italic>Crosslinking solution 2</italic>: PBS with 4% (wt/vol) acrylamide, 0.25% (wt/vol) VA-044 thermal polymerization initiator, and 4% PFA. After incubation with the crosslinking solution for 1 day, the tissue was left in solution and placed in vacuum at 37°C for 3 hr. After polymerization with X-CLARITY polymerization system (Logos Biosystems, South Korea), the slices were rinsed with 50 ml PBS three times over 3 hr. Each slice was then cut into small pieces with width and length at least twice the thickness. This was done to increase the number of conditions that could be tested with small amounts of tissue.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Delipidation</title><p>After hydrogel crosslinking, the tissue was placed in a delipidation solution (SDS 200 mM, sodium sulfite 20 mM, sodium borate 20 mM, sodium hydroxide to pH 8.5–9, filtered if necessary) at 37°C for different amounts of time (1, 2, or 3 days), to determine the effect of delipidation in IHC. After delipidation, the brain slices were rinsed with 50 ml PBST (PBS with 0.2% Triton X-100, Thermo Fisher Scientific) five times over 1 day.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Pre-IHC tissue processing</title><p>Different conditions were tested at this step to determine their influence on IHC.

PBST was added to just cover the top of the samples (~300 µl). One to 5 µl of stock antibody solution was added, depending on the concentration of the stock. The final concentration of each antibody in solution was 5 µg/ml. Fluorophores or host species were chosen so multiple different antibodies could be tested at the same time in a single slice of tissue. The tissue was then incubated with the antibodies at 4°C or room temperature for 18 hr. The tissue was then rinsed in PBST 3×50 ml overnight (18–24 hr) at room temperature. If using unconjugated primary antibodies, the secondary antibodies were then added to give a final concentration of 5 µg/ml and incubated for 48 hr at 4°C.

First, the distribution of fluorescence values across all slices in the Z-stack were normalized. Then, a rolling-ball algorithm was applied to define the edges of fluorescent shapes with signal intensity greater than background by a threshold value. The area within each slice of a Z-stack that contained staining above this threshold was then divided by the maximum across all tissue stained with that fluorophore to determine the staining quality throughout the tissue. This metric was only applied to stains like NeuN or Glut1 in the cortex where we can make the assumption that there is a uniform and consistent distribution of these cells across sections. All samples that were imaged as part of the library described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> were included in this study, with at least three independent samples per condition to determine reproducibility.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Analysis with Ilastik</title><p>Raw data was converted to HDF5 format using ilastik’s ImageJ plugin plus custom macro to batch convert. The staining was then segmented using their pixel classifier workflow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Berg et al., 2019</xref>). In short, a paintbrush was used to draw over the signal and background to help train the classifier on how to segment each image. Real-time segmentation results were then improved using a minimum of 600 image planes from six different staining conditions that reflect the distribution of staining quality in the entire set. All images were then batch processed through the trained pixel classifier and exported as multipage tiff.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Post-image segmentation analysis in Matlab</title><p>The image segmentation output from either Imaris or Matlab was saved as a single-channel multipage Tiff and placed into a folder, and all the raw images were saved as a single-channel multipage Tiff and placed into a different folder. Image conversion was done using ImageJ macros. Quantification and generation of data for plotting can then be done by specifying the data path, ensuring the Matlab code is on the path, then running the code. The main code ‘QuantifyIHC.mat’ should be run first, which goes through the files in each folder in order and determines the segmentation area, staining within the segmentation, and noise outside of the segmentation. Next, running the ‘FindHalfHax.mat’ code will find the starting plane for plotting, the half-max depth, place all data for plotting into arrays, allow for the re-ordering of blinded data, and plotting of the heatmaps.</p></sec><sec id="s4-17"><title>Code availability</title><p>All Matlab code and ImageJ macros used to quantify data can be accessed at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/tjzwang/IHC">https://github.com/tjzwang/IHC</ext-link>, (copy archived at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://archive.softwareheritage.org/swh:1:dir:45a99958de37bb9a00b5230e04a5ae133fc53c56;origin=https://github.com/tjzwang/IHC;visit=swh:1:snp:306b87154871c16f03dfdfa18f177cd2f6bfac0c;anchor=swh:1:rev:64acafda08ebdda1021edfe47e3d328b21218aa6">swh:1:rev:64acafda08ebdda1021edfe47e3d328b21218aa6</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Zwang, 2022</xref>).</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>Reviewing editor, <italic>eLife</italic></p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing - original draft, Project administration, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Data curation, Formal analysis, Supervision, Investigation, Methodology, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Conceptualization, Methodology, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Supervision, Methodology, Project administration, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Data curation, Formal analysis, Methodology, Writing - original draft, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Data curation, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Methodology, Project administration, Writing - review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Autopsy tissue from human brains were collected at Massachusetts General hospital, with informed consent of patients or their relatives and approval of local institutional review boards.

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>Comments to the Authors:</p><p>We are sorry to say that, after consultation with the reviewers, we have decided that this work will not be considered further for publication by <italic>eLife</italic> at this stage.</p><p>Specifically, the reviewers noted and detailed a lack of clarity in key points of the protocol, and a rather large variability in the staining outcomes. Additionally, the reviewers were concerned about a few key assumptions regarding the properties of the subset of antibodies tested, and premature generalization of the results from analysis of these antibodies.</p><p>Overall, the work has a lot of potential, and we encourage resubmission of the story when the reviewer comments can be adequately addressed.</p><p>The complete and detailed reviewer evaluations are below.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Immunohistochemistry (IHC) encompasses a complex set of methods with many possible variations on conditions for tissue fixation, clearing, antigen retrieval, blocking, and staining. Choices of these conditions that are optimized for one antibody/target pair often do not generalize to others, or to other tissue types. As high throughput microscopy (particularly lightsheet microscopy) and clearing methods allow for imaging thicker blocks of tissue, these problems are increasingly a limiting factor in experimental studies. A more systematic understanding of how these various aspects of IHC methods choices should be made is of great interest. Optimizing IHC conditions for a given protein target in a given tissue is currently somewhat of an art. A more systematic approach to carrying out this optimization is also potentially of great interest. This would be particularly helpful for human tissue, as it is too precious to routinely test many IHC method variants.</p><p>The authors set out to create a streamlined, standardized tissue processing and image analysis workflow for comparing different tissue preparations in terms of IHC performance. They create a library of mouse brain tissue specimens processed with several variants of each processing step including fixation, clearing, and antigen retrieval. They vary only one parameter at a time to facilitate direct comparison between conditions. They set up a data analysis pipeline that is extremely simple and easy to use but probably underpowered for comparing quantitatively between conditions because it keeps only a signal mask and discards signal intensity information. It is also not clear how the pipeline should be modified to accommodate targets with different types of staining pattern. The results are presented as a 1D heatmap that varies with depth in the specimen, rather than a simple line plot, making it difficult to compare quantitatively between conditions.</p><p>Each of 12 process variants is carried out for two antibodies on three replicate specimens to assess repeatability. The authors do not discuss this experiment in detail, but there is high variability between replicates. For example, in Figure S1, the 2 days cleared case has fairly high signal in two replicates and almost none in the middle one. The staining solutions were apparently also not well mixed, as the antibody signals on the two sides of each specimen are very different in all cases, and the amount of difference between the two sides is also highly varying between specimens. From Figure 1, it is also clear that the signal varies across each specimen within the imaging plane. In this comparison of 12 conditions, one result pops out: incubating the antibodies at room temperature (as opposed to the default of 4oC) improves penetration. This effect is dramatic for NeuN. It is probably also present for Glut1, although it is necessary to look at Figure S2, showing all three replicates, to see this clearly. Every other method variant appears to result in worse performance except that in the case of 2 day clearing with Glut1 staining, one replicate has a particularly high signal area (Figure S2).</p><p>They then test two antibodies against GFAP and show that varying processing conditions affects both antibodies similarly, though they do not include any quantification. In contrast, they find that two antibodies against tau do vary differently with processing conditions, but again without quantification. Next, they carry out the same screen in human brain tissue that had previously been done in mouse brain tissue in order to assess the suitability of mouse tissue as a proxy for IHC quality in human tissue. The trends of IHC quality as a function of method variant appear to be qualitatively preserved between mouse and human. They finally show that three antibodies (primaries directly conjugated with fluorophores) against Glut1, tau, and NeuN fully penetrate through a 1 mm slice of human brain tissue after incubating for 14 days.</p><p>The goal of putting IHC on a more quantitative footing is an admirable and timely one, but the approach presented here requires some more work to deliver on this substantial promise.</p><p>Tissue library: Tissue thickness and staining time choices should be justified more carefully. Of particular concern is the antibody staining time, as the optimal time depends strongly on the temperature of incubation. Staining should be quantified at several time points to determine the extent of saturation at the tissue surface. The assumption that antigens have a &quot;relatively constant distribution with the depth of imaging&quot; should also be supported with data. The same goes for lateral variation. Variation between replicates also would ideally be reduced. From the methods, it seems as though the antibody is simply added to the staining buffer with the tissue, which might indicate there is insufficient mixing before and during antibody incubation.</p><p>Image analysis: A more sophisticated but still highly user-friendly segmentation strategy such as the Ilastik software package might be a more reliable and versatile choice for analyzing image data. Furthermore, the signal intensity distribution within the masked signal area can be extracted (e.g. in Matlab) to quantitatively compare processing conditions, in addition to the area occupied by the mask as used here. The area outside the mask could potentially be treated as a background segment, whose intensity distribution can also be quantified. This way, quantitative measures of both signal intensity and background staining levels could be used for a more full comparison between method variants. The results should be viewed as a 1D line plot for more quantitative comparison between conditions. Finally, this lineplot could be used to measure derived performance parameters such as the distance into the tissue at which the staining intensity drops by half.</p><p>These improvements in quantitation are necessary to draw strong conclusions from any further experiments, but with them this work stands to make a strong contribution to the field.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This work presents a systematic approach to evaluation and optimization of antibody labeling in cleared human brain tissue. The authors outline the problems very clearly and present strategies to solve them. First, libraries of tissue prepared using different protocols are generated to easily test the performance of different antibodies and different staining conditions. Importantly, only one condition at a time is varied, which allows to evaluate the contribution of individual variables to the final staining quality. Second, a strategy for finding the optimal conditions for simultaneous staining with several different antibodies is outlined. And third and very important results is that mouse tissue can be used for optimization of antibody labeling of human tissue, thus allowing efficient use of human tissue which is a scarce and very valuable resource.</p><p>Strengths</p><p>Antibody labeling of tissues, and especially large volume cleared tissues involves a multitude of steps and reagents. Variations in any of the tissue preparation or immunolabeling steps can affect antibody performance and finding the optimal conditions can be a very tedious process. This paper provides clear examples of how much variability there can be even when using the same antibody on the same tissue prepared in different ways or stained under different conditions. It gives a clear solution of how this problem can be addressed by using libraries of tissues prepared by varying a single condition in each instance.</p><p>The presented approach results in a huge saving of time as it can be completed much faster (several days) compared to the complete immunolabeling protocol for large volume cleared tissue which can take several weeks.</p><p>The demonstration that mouse tissue can be used for optimization of staining conditions for human tissue is very important, allowing the best use of human tissue.</p><p>Weaknesses</p><p>Results from a small number of antibodies are extrapolated to apply to all antibodies in general. For example, the results from the comparison between 2 different GFAP antibodies, showing that the antibody conjugated to a fluorophore performs better that the antibody that is not conjugated, is used to generalize that primary antibodies directly conjugated to a fluorophore are preferrable to use compared to antibodies that are visualized using indirect immunolabeling with a secondary antibody. Even when considering the 2 GFAP antibodies this conclusion cannot be made, because it is not clear whether the difference in performance is due to the primary antibodies themselves (monoclonal vs. polyclonal) or to the method of their visualization (direct vs indirect).</p><p>The authors conclude that &quot;IHC is limited more by denaturation of the epitope than the antibody itself&quot;.

There is one additional point that I believe is important and can be handled in the text. From the screen of antibody staining times (Figure S1), it appears that up through 24 hours of incubation the effect of increased incubation time is to increase the signal in a ~120 µm surface layer whose thickness does not change appreciably. After this, up to 48 hr (at least for RT incubation) the thickness of the surface layer changes strongly. This suggests that the limitation on signal for staining 24hr and under is depletion of antibodies on the way through the tissue. It should be pointed out that in the present work, the focus on depth to half-max staining does not separate the issues of (1) free antibody penetration speed through the tissue and (2) the extent of depletion along the way. Reducing antigenicity will improve the apparent penetration rate by reducing the effect of depletion due to epitope binding. This may be what is happening with the 50oC unmasking treatment, which increases penetration but greatly reduces the staining level (Figure 1 b,c, column 8). This limitation should be discussed explicitly.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.84112.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the authors resubmitted a revised version of the paper for consideration.

We incubated these antibodies for 3 days to achieve saturation, then quantified the average signal, percent segmented area, average noise, and signal/noise ratio in each imaging plane. Our original metric of percent segmented area shows some variation with depth depending on the brain region, but we find that normalizing the signal intensity per segmented area allows for a quantifiable metric for staining quality that is independent on the change in distribution of antigen, so long as there is some antigen in each plane. These data show insignificantly different results across tissue samples and brain regions. Additionally, as we will describe below, Ilastik segmentation is more robust which decreased a significant amount of variation between replicates. We feel the variation between replicates is reasonable, as quantified by the Signal-Noise ratio standard error of mean values in the hippocampus (10.2±2.4%) anterior cortex (11.0±3.5%) and posterior cortex (10.3±1.8%), especially when considering these tissue samples came from different mice.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>From the methods, it seems as though the antibody is simply added to the staining buffer with the tissue, which might indicate there is insufficient mixing before and during antibody incubation.</p></disp-quote><p>We have clarified in the methods section that the antibody was mixed in the staining buffer, and that the tissue was placed on a gentle shaker during antibody incubation for all conditions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Image analysis: A more sophisticated but still highly user-friendly segmentation strategy such as the Ilastik software package might be a more reliable and versatile choice for analyzing image data.</p></disp-quote><p>We attempted to use Ilastik, as recommended, and found it to be an extremely robust solution for analyzing our data. Before, using Imaris, we did not have access to the batch processing module due to its cost. This meant that we had to go through each file and individually generate the segmentation mask for each channel, which was a significant amount of time for the hundreds of imaging files used in this work. Ilastik allowed for us to train the segmentation on a subset of our data, then apply the segmentation to all of the similar images. Additionally, this did not require the normalization step we had applied to our data in Imaris, further improved the segmentation of poorly stained samples, and allowed for the isolation of nonspecific staining that may have confounded analysis.

As suggested, we performed this analysis on four of our sets of data (Mouse NeuN, Mouse Glut1, Human NeuN, and Human Glut1) consisting of 142 image volumes as a proof-of-principle. These quantifications provide some additional insight into the difference between conditions. Most interesting is the significant difference in the percent staining area in each imaging plane was more changed than the signal intensity across conditions, which provides support for our claim that IHC is significantly influenced by denaturation or masking of the epitope. The antibody is having the same overall effectiveness for signal intensity per unit area, but is binding to less. Additionally, the performance parameter suggested by the reviewer (which we call half-max depth in the manuscript) showed reproducible differences across samples and translated well between mouse and human tissue.

Reducing antigenicity will improve the apparent penetration rate by reducing the effect of depletion due to epitope binding. This may be what is happening with the 50oC unmasking treatment, which increases penetration but greatly reduces the staining level (Figure 1 b,c, column 8). This limitation should be discussed explicitly.</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to thank Reviewer #2 for the insight into our data, as well as their assessment of its limitations. We have added the following text to explicitly reflect their insight: </p><p>We added the following text under the “Strategy to rapidly assess the optimization of protocols” section in paragraph 2 “It should be noted that these data suggest the signal when staining 24 hours and under may be limited by the depletion of antibodies on their way through the tissue, which should be considered when making comparisons of staining quality.”</p><p>We added the following text under the “Measuring IHC quality in cleared tissue” It should be noted that simply relying on depth to half-max staining does not separate the issues of free antibody penetration speed through the tissue nor the extent of antibody depletion along the way, and it is possible that conditions that reduce the antigenicity may significantly enhance the apparent penetration rate.</p></body></sub-article></article>
