control. The increased resolution of pathogen whole-genome sequencing has significantly improved our ability to infer transmission events. Despite this, transmission inference often remains limited by the lack of genomic variation between the source case and infected contacts. Although within-host genetic diversity is common among a wide variety of pathogens, conventional whole-genome sequencing phylogenetic approaches exclusively use consensus sequences, which consider only the most prevalent nucleotide at each position and therefore fail to capture low-frequency variation within samples. We hypothesized that including within-sample variation in a phylogenetic model would help to identify who infected whom in instances in which this was previously impossible. Using whole-genome sequences from SARS-CoV-2 multi-institutional outbreaks as an example, we show how within-sample diversity is partially maintained among repeated serial samples from the same host, it can transmitted between those cases with known epidemiological links, and how this improves phylogenetic inference and our understanding of who infected whom. Our technique is applicable to other infectious diseases and has immediate clinical utility in infection prevention and control.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>During an infectious disease outbreak, tracing who infected whom allows public health scientists to see how a pathogen is spreading and to establish effective control measures. Traditionally, this involves identifying the individuals an infected person comes into contact with and monitoring whether they also become unwell. However, this information is not always available and can be inaccurate.</p><p>One alternative is to track the genetic data of pathogens as they spread. Over time, pathogens accumulate mutations in their genes that can be used to distinguish them from one another. Genetically similar pathogens are more likely to have spread during the same outbreak, while genetically dissimilar pathogens may have come from different outbreaks. However, there are limitations to this approach. For example, some pathogens accumulate genetic mutations very slowly and may not change enough during an outbreak to be distinguishable from one another. Additionally, some pathogens can spread rapidly, leaving less time for mutations to occur between transmission events.</p><p>To overcome these challenges, Torres Ortiz et al. developed a more sensitive approach to pathogen genetic testing that took advantage of the multiple pathogen populations that often coexist in an infected patient. Rather than tracking only the most dominant genetic version of the pathogen, this method also looked at the less dominant ones.</p><p>Torres Ortiz et al. performed genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) samples from 451 healthcare workers, patients, and patient contacts at participating London hospitals. Analysis showed that it was possible to detect multiple genetic populations of the virus within individual patients. These subpopulations were often more similar in patients that had been in contact with one another than in those that had not. Tracking the genetic data of all viral populations enabled Torres Ortiz et al. to trace transmission more accurately than if only the dominant population was used.</p><p>More accurate genetic tracing could help public health scientists better track pathogen transmission and control outbreaks. This may be especially beneficial in hospital settings where outbreaks can be smaller, and it is important to understand if transmission is occurring within the hospital or if the pathogen is imported from the community. Further research will help scientists understand how pathogen population genetics evolve during outbreaks and may improve the detection of subpopulations present at very low frequencies.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>phylogenetics</kwd><kwd>within-host diversity</kwd><kwd>SARS-CoV-2</kwd><kwd>infectious disease</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Viruses</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>201470/Z/16/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Grandjean</surname><given-names>Louis</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1R01AI146338</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Grandjean</surname><given-names>Louis</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000272</institution-id><institution>National Institute for Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Didelot</surname><given-names>Xavier</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.

The use of whole-genome sequencing allows for detailed investigation of disease outbreaks, but the limited genetic diversity of many pathogens often hinders our understanding of transmission events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Campbell et al., 2018</xref>). As a consequence of the limited diversity, many index case and contact pairs will share identical genotypes, making it difficult to ascertain who infected whom.</p><p>Within-sample genetic diversity is common among a wide variety of pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mongkolrattanothai et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lieberman et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dinis et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Leitner, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Popa et al., 2020</xref>). This diversity may be generated de novo during infection, by a single transmission event of a diverse inoculum or by independent transmission events from multiple sources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Worby et al., 2014</xref>). The maintenance and dynamic of within-host diversity is then a product of natural selection, genetic drift, and fluctuating population size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Didelot et al., 2012</xref>). The transmission of within-host variation between individuals is also favored as a large inoculum exposure is more likely to give rise to infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Murphy et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Han et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lee et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sender et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Spinelli et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Trunfio et al., 2021</xref>). The amount of within-sample diversity transmitted from index case to contact is determined by the bottleneck size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zwart and Elena, 2015</xref>), with stringent bottlenecks limiting the number of genotypes transmitted from the host to the recipient, and wide bottlenecks allowing for the transmission of higher levels of genetic diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Worby et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Phylogenetic analysis provides information regarding the structure of the genetic diversity among pathogen isolates. Moreover, pathogen phylogenetic trees can be used as input for many downstream analysis, including inference of transmission events, population size dynamics, or estimation of parameters of epidemiological models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Didelot et al., 2018</xref>). Most genomic and phylogenetic workflows involve either genome assembly or alignment of sequencing reads to a reference genome. In both cases, conventionally the resulting alignment exclusively represents the most common nucleotide at each position. This is often referred to as the consensus sequence. Although genome assemblers may output contigs (combined overlapping reads) representing low-frequency haplotypes, only the majority contig is kept in the final sequence. In a mapping approach, a frequency threshold for the major variant is usually pre-determined, under which a position is considered ambiguous. The lack of genetic variation between temporally proximate samples and the slow mutation rate of many pathogens results in direct transmission events sharing exact sequences between the hosts when using the consensus sequence approach. For instance, the substitution rate of SARS-CoV-2 has been inferred to be around two mutations per genome per month (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Harvey et al., 2021</xref>). Given its infectious period of 6 days (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Byrne et al., 2020</xref>), most consensus sequences in a small-scale outbreak will show no variation between them. This lack of resolution and poor phylogenetic signal complicate phylogenetic inference, limiting the downstream analysis and conclusions that can be extracted from the phylogenetic tree. Previous work has shown the advantages of using within-host diversity to infer transmission events compared to using consensus sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wymant et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">De Maio et al., 2018</xref>). Aside from transmission inference, the use of the within-host pathogen genetic data directly within phylogenetic inference will improve any downstream analysis using a phylogenetic tree as starting point.</p><p>We hypothesize that the failure of consensus sequence approaches to capture within-sample variation arbitrarily excludes meaningful data and limits pathogen phylogenetic and transmission inference, and that including within-sample diversity in a phylogenetic model would significantly increase the evolutionary and temporal signal and thereby improve our ability to infer infectious disease phylogenies and transmission events.</p><p>We tested our hypothesis on multi-institutional SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks across London hospitals that were part of the COVID-19 Genomics UK (COG-UK) consortia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">COVID-19 Genomics UK COG-UK, 2020</xref>). Technical replicates, repeated longitudinal sampling from the same patient, and epidemiological data allowed us to evaluate the presence and stability of within-sample diversity within the host and in independently determined transmission chains. We also evaluated the use of within-sample diversity in phylogenetic analysis by conducting outbreak and phylogenetic simulations of sequencing data using a phylogenetic model that accounts for the presence and transmission of within-sample variation. We show the effects on phylogenetic inference of using consensus sequences in the presence of within-sample diversity, and propose that existing phylogenetic models can leverage the additional diversity given by the within-sample variation and reconstruct the phylogenetic relationship between isolates. Lastly, we show that by taking into account within-sample diversity in a phylogenetic model, we improve the temporal signal in SARS-CoV-2 outbreak analysis. Using both phylogenetic outbreak reconstruction and simulation, we show that our approach is superior to the current gold standard whole-genome consensus sequence methods.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Sampling, demographics, and metadata</title><p>Between March 2020 and November 2020, 451 healthcare workers, patients, and patient contacts at the participating North London Hospitals were diagnosed at the Camelia Botnar Laboratories with SARS-CoV-2 by PCR as part of a routine staff diagnostic service at Great Ormond Street Hospital NHS Foundation Trust (GOSH).

The proportion of shared intra-host variants was negatively correlated with C<sub>t</sub> values in a logistic model (estimate = −0.78, p-value = 0.008), with higher C<sub>t</sub> values associated with a lower amount of shared intra-host variants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). The number of within-sample variants detected also increased with C<sub>t</sub> value, as well as the deviation in the number of variants between duplicates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>).

Additionally, only variants with a frequency higher or equal than 2% were used.

Of these, 699 positions had intra-host diversity, of which 78% (549/699) were singletons.

Using multi-hospital SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks and phylogenetic simulations, we show that including the genetic diversity of subpopulations within a clinical sample improves phylogenetic reconstruction of SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks and determines the direction of transmission when using a consensus sequence approach fails to do so.</p><p>The majority of samples sequenced harbored variants at low frequency. However, most variants were not consistently called in technical replicates, suggesting they were spurious or unreliable. Within-sample variation was less consistent between paired technical replicates with lower viral load (higher C<sub>t</sub>). This is likely to be a consequence of low starting genetic material giving rise to amplification bias during library preparation and sequencing. Establishing a cut-off for high C<sub>t</sub> values is therefore important to accurately characterize within-host variation. In our study, we excluded samples with a C<sub>t</sub> value higher than 30 cycles based on the diagnostic PCR used at GOSH. Since C<sub>t</sub> values are only a surrogate for viral load and are not standardized across different assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Evans et al., 2021</xref>), appropriate thresholds would need to be determined for other primary PCR testing assays. Similarly, variant calls at very low frequency were less likely to be present in both technical replicates. These variants at low frequency are thus potentially not genuine and the result of sequencing and variant calling errors. For our work, we removed any variants with an allele frequency lower than 2%. Until sequencing and variant calling technologies improve for low-frequency variants, technical replicates will remain essential for the study of pathogen within-host diversity in order to distinguish genuine variation from sequencing noise. The effect of this noise on phylogenetic inference will depend on the signal-to-noise ratio and the amount of variation already present in the consensus sequences. Spurious low-frequency variation will likely affect only the branch length estimation in phylogenetic inference by adding potentially erroneous calls, unless there is presence of batch bias which could artificially cluster epidemiologically unrelated isolates together.</p><p>The generation, maintenance, and evolution of subpopulations within the host reflect evolutionary processes which are meaningful from phylogenetic and epidemiological perspectives. Subpopulations within a host can emerge from three mechanisms: de novo diversification in the host, transmission of a diverse inoculum, or multiple transmission events from different sources. If the subpopulations are the result of de novo mutations, nucleotide polymorphisms within the subpopulations accumulate over time and may therefore result in a phylogenetic signal useful for phylogenetic inference. In our data, longitudinal samples taken at later time points were demonstrated to accrue genomic variation. Although this pattern can be confounded by decreasing viral load as infection progresses, C<sub>t</sub> values in our dataset were not correlated with a higher genetic distance, and clusters in our data containing both longitudinal and technical replicates also corroborate these results. Transmission of a diverse inoculum also gives rise to phylogenetically informative shared low-frequency variants, as our results show that transmission pairs are more likely to share variants at low frequency. The effect of multiple transmission events in the phylogeny depends on the relatedness of both index cases and the bottleneck size in each transmission event.</p><p>Paired samples with epidemiological links and from the same department shared a higher proportion of low-frequency variants and were located closer in the consensus tree than samples with no relationship. These patterns suggest that the distribution of low-frequency variants is linked to events of epidemiological interest. The fact that technical duplicates shared more within-host diversity than longitudinal replicates of the same sample suggests that much of the variation within hosts is transitory. Therefore, within-host diversity may be relevant on relatively short time scales, which is precisely where consensus sequences lack resolution. Combining the data derived from fixed alleles in the consensus sequences and transient within-sample minor variation enables an improved understanding of the relatedness of pathogen populations between hosts.</p><p>The effects of neglecting within-host diversity in phylogenetic inference were analyzed by using simulated sequences under a phylogenetic model that reflects the presence and evolution of within-host diversity. We compared a conventional consensus phylogenetic model and a model that leverages within-sample diversity, and evaluated their ability to infer the known phylogeny. Our proposed phylogenetic model incorporates within-sample variation by explicitly coding major and minor nucleotides as independent characters in the alignment. We demonstrated that phylogenies inferred using the conventional consensus sequence approach were unresolved and unrepresentative of the known structure of the simulated tree. However, sequences that included within-host diversity showed higher resolution that resulted in phylogenetic trees more similar to the simulated phylogeny. As other mutational models, our 16-state model assumes independence between sites in the alignment. This assumption can be violated due to the presence of genetic linkage, which can be caused by multiple biological processes, such as clonal relationships between microorganisms, recombination, or selection of co-evolving sites. To increase the amount of genetic linkage due to clonal relationships between organisms, we repeated our simulations using a coalescent model to create the starting tree, and confirmed that the 16-state model still outperformed the conventional consensus sequence in the presence of high linkage. Other sources of genetic linkage are not accounted for, and their inclusion in phylogenetic inference is out of scope of this work.</p><p>The proposed phylogenetic model used for the simulations did not include direct base transitions and transversions, but rather modeled base change as a process of minor variant acquisition and fixation. Therefore, a base change is composed of the following steps: first a minor variant is gained; then the minor variant increases in frequency and becomes the majority variant; and finally the new variant is fixed. In this way, within-host evolution is partially included in the model as a process of minor variant evolution and eventual lost or fixation. As shown in the simulations, this process of within-host evolution is also captured when the minor bases are simply incorporated as additional states in the Markov chain without explicitly limiting the possible transitions.</p><p>We complemented the phylogenetic simulations with tree inference of outbreaks simulated using TransPhylo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Didelot et al., 2017</xref>). We parameterized the simulations to reflect the transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2, including a generation time of 5 days and a sampling time of 7 days. Given this parameters, most simulated outbreaks lasted less than a month. We then simulated genetic sequences within the outbreak using fastsimcoal2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Excoffier et al., 2013</xref>) as previously described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">De Maio et al., 2018</xref>. Using a mutation rate of <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf10"><mml:mrow><mml:mn>5</mml:mn><mml:mo>×</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mn>10</mml:mn><mml:mrow><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mn>6</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> mutations per base per replication cycle, as previously described for SARS-CoV-2 and other betacoronaviruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sender et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amicone et al., 2022</xref>), and varying bottleneck sizes, we showed that tree inference using within-sample diversity improves as the transmission bottleneck widens, although even at low bottleneck sizes trees inferred using within-sample diversity are more accurate than those inferred using consensus sequences. Similarly, using varying mutation rates and a constant bottleneck size of 10 pathogens, we showed that tree inference was more accurate as mutation rates increased, although inference using consensus sequences improved only at a very high mutation rate of <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf11"><mml:msup><mml:mn>10</mml:mn><mml:mrow><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mn>3</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:math></inline-formula> mutations per base per cycle, which has mostly been observed in some HIV studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cuevas et al., 2015</xref>). Together, our simulations show that at the short time frame of disease transmission, phylogenetic inference using alignments that contain information regarding within-sample diversity outperform phylogenies inferred with consensus sequences, even at narrow transmission bottlenecks and very low mutation rates. Since TransPhylo simulates phylogenetic trees alongside the outbreak simulation, we could directly compare our inferred phylogenies with the known simulated trees. However, although phylogenetic trees can inform transmission inference, phylogenetic trees themselves and transmission trees are not interchangeable. Nevertheless, increasing the resolution of phylogenetic trees can improve inference of transmission chains and calculation of the likelihood of transmission events.</p><p>Previous studies have addressed the use of within-host variation to infer transmission events. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wymant et al., 2018</xref>, employed a framework based on phylogenetic inference and ancestral state reconstruction of each set of populations detected within read alignments using genomic windows. Our study extends this work by coding genome-wide diversity within the host directly in the alignment and the phylogenetic model. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">De Maio et al., 2018</xref>, proposed direct inference of transmission from sequencing data alongside host exposure time and sampling date within the Bayesian framework BEAST2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bouckaert et al., 2014</xref>). Our approach is focused on directly improving the temporal and phylogenetic signal of whole-genome sequences, and it’s especially suited for use in applications and analysis that employ a phylogenetic tree as input to infer transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Didelot et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Apart from transmission inference, phylogenetic trees can be used to infer many parameters of epidemiological interest, such as R<sub>0</sub> or the effective population size. In our work, we showed that the temporal signal of clusters where all isolates had the same sequences increased with the inclusion of within-sample diversity, which in turns allows better inference of phylogenetic trees. When analyzing specific outbreaks, we showed that groups of samples without genetic differences were clustered apart from other isolates of the outbreak, providing additional information on genetic relationships that could be used for transmission inference or to better understand the genetic structure of the outbreak. Even though transmission inference can be improved with epidemiological data such as collection dates even when all isolates have the same genetic sequences, such data can’t provide information regarding how samples cluster within the outbreak. Additionally, the order of collection dates not always correspond to the order of infection.</p><p>Future work will extend this model by including allele frequency data in addition to independent characters for major and minor variants. Moreover, to limit the number of character states we only allowed two variants at each position. Transmission inference of pathogens with high levels of within-host diversity, for instance as observed in HIV, could benefit from including more than two alleles. In those cases, the number of possible character state combinations would be too large, and therefore other methods such as phyloscanner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wymant et al., 2018</xref>) could resolve transmission events more accurately. However, it’s important to note that the low frequency of a third allele could result in more sequencing and mapping errors which could in turn bias phylogenetic inference and genomic analysis. Phylogenetic models that explicitly include dynamics of within-sample variation and sequencing error may further improve phylogenetic inference or allow researchers to better estimate parameters of interest, including R0, bottleneck size, transmissibility, and the origin of outbreaks.</p><p>In line with conventional consensus sequencing approaches, we used a reference sequence for genome alignment and variant calling. Although widely used, one limitation of this approach is a potential mapping bias causing some reads to reflect the reference base at low frequencies at a position where only a variant should be present. Although we applied stringent quality filtering, we cannot rule out the persistence of some false positive minor variants. Using genome graphs to map to a reference that encompasses a wider spectrum of variation may alleviate this problem, and could be an interesting addition to pathogen population genomic analysis.</p><p>Our results demonstrate that within-sample variation can be leveraged to increase the resolution of phylogenetic trees and improve our understanding of who infected whom. Using SARS-CoV-2 hospital outbreaks and simulations, we show that variants at low frequencies are consistent within sample replicates, phylogenetically informative and are more often shared among epidemiologically related contacts. By coding within-sample variation directly in the alignment, the additional genetic information can be easily incorporated in phylogenetic inference, facilitating its application within existing epidemiology pipelines and public health infrastructure. We propose that pathogen phylogenetic models should accommodate within-host variation to improve the understanding of infectious disease transmission and aid infection control measures.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Model for within-host diversity</title><p>To test the accuracy of different models at inferring known phylogenies, 100 random phylogenetic trees with 100 tips each were generated using the function <italic>rtree</italic> within the R package <italic>ape</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Paradis et al., 2004</xref>).

This rates result in fixed bases (A, C, G, and T) being 100 times more frequent than low-frequency bases. A different set of simulations was performed using rates that promote a high rate of low-frequency variation by having a lower rate of variant loss and switch (rates 1, 10, 10 for minor variant evolution, loss, and switch, respectively); a low amount of low-frequency variation by increasing the rates of variant switch and loss (1, 10, 100); and using a Jukes-Cantor model of sequence evolution and therefore resulting in no minor variants.</p><p>Two types of alignments were generated from the simulated genomes: a consensus sequence, where only the major allele was considered; and an alignment that retained the major and minor allele information as independent character states.

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Sara Sawyer as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Sebastian Duchene (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another and with the Reviewing Editor, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Both reviewers, while interested in the methodology, have raised concerns on the extent of the simulation study and on the validity of the conclusions based on analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 data.</p><p>Accordingly, the following are required for the paper to be considered further:</p><p>1) An expanded simulation study to explore in greater detail the assumptions and suitability of the proposed (16 site) model. Particular focal points, as raised by the reviewers (particularly #2, but discussed and agreed upon by both reviewers and the reviewing editor), would be on assumptions of Markovian behaviour and of site independence.</p><p>2) Address the concerns raised on the SARS-CoV-2 analyses. This may be achieved in a number of ways: a) [presumably supported by the additional work done through simulations] provide a stronger justification for the validity of the analyses as they are; or b) remove the SARS-CoV-2 analyses and either i) reframe the manuscript as a purely theoretical investigation; or ii) apply the model to a dataset with additional sequences (e.g. an influenza A virus dataset).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Lines 103-104: 2177x vs 10x: I don't fully understand.</p><p>Line 112: What does 'stable' mean? This is used repeatedly throughout the manuscript and I don't have a clear idea of what is meant by it.</p><p>Many of the y-axis labels and figure legends allude to 'mixed variants'. I searched for a definition of 'mixed' in the pdf but did not find one. I don't understand what is meant by 'mixed'.</p><p>Line 130: 'as viral load…also decreases from time since infection': this is not true.</p><p>Lines 147-152, Table 1: I'm somewhat confused. Line 141 talks about calculating the proportion of shared within-sample variants. Is that proportion used in this paragraph and for the values in Table 1? If so, how is 'phylogenetic distance' calculated from these proportions? I assume that what is used instead are the consensus sequences from each sample? But how are sampling dates incorporated? (They would seem to need to be incorporated if phylogenetic distance is indeed measured by substitutions per genome per year, and the phylogeny is time-aligned.) Also, I don't clearly understand the point of Table 1. If the point is simply to show that samples in one sample relationship (e.g., epidemiological) are genetically more similar that samples in a broader sample relationship (e.g., department), then why not show mean pairwise nucleotide differences between samples in a given sample relationship?</p><p>Table 1: Phylogenetic distance (or nucleotide distance) can't be negative, so the 95% CIs can't go below 0. That some of those distances have 95% CIs that go below 0 indicates to me that likely a normal distribution was used to calculate the 95% Cis when the distribution is not normal and some other distribution needs to be used (one that has no density for &lt;0 values).</p><p>Figure 2: I assume the (%) on the y-axis label is an error and should be removed?</p><p>Figure 5: right-hand side panel: &quot;subs/base/cycle&quot; – do you mean mutations/base/cycle?</p><p>Line 324: &quot;Our study benefited from…&quot; This is a pretty substantial overstatement.</p><p>Line 376: can the parameters of the negative binomial be given as mean and overdispersion parameter (k)?</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Within-host diversity improves phylogenetic and transmission reconstruction of SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Sara Sawyer (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been significantly improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>Following Reviewer #2's concerns (please see below), we ask that you more explicitly acknowledge the limitations of the SARS-CoV-2 data used in the study. This does not require further adjustments to the methods or analyses, but does require an earlier and stronger mention of the limitations, and (importantly) a discussion of *how* results may be impacted, not just that some of the limitations *do (likely)* impact them.</p><p>With regards to Reviewer #2's query on Figure 2 (also see their original review), it does remain of concern and must be addressed. While the additional material shown in Supp Figure 5 is helpful (as it is clear there that there are substantial and statistically meaningful differences there), a claim that &quot;the proportion of shared within-host variants was significantly higher…&quot; (line 171) requires further (statistical and/or compelling visual) justification. The current text at lines 168--187 is rather unclear as it is hard to tell if &quot;shared variants&quot; or &quot;shared low frequency variants&quot; are being described. If the 95% CIs shown in Figure 2 have been correctly calculated, then statistical (and/or compelling visual) analyses that justify the claim need to be clearly reported.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I have reviewed the revised manuscript, which has been improved in terms of testing the 16-site model on simulated data and on more clearly defining terms. My remaining concerns are:</p><p>1. The manuscript interprets its data and its findings too favorably. It would be much improved if the authors carefully went through the manuscript and improved the accuracy of statements/conclusions throughout. For example, the subtitle at line 151 reads 'Within-sample variation is shared between technical replicates'. Yet Figure 1c indicates that this is an overstatement. The proportion of shared minor variants is actually highly variable between technical replicates. A more appropriate subtitle would be 'Some within-sample…' Similarly, line 147, a more accurate subtitle would be 'A small amount of within-sample variation appears to be shared between…'</p><p>2. Even by selecting only the subset of samples with Ct &lt; 30, the overwhelming majority of the SARS-CoV-2 data minor variants in this subset are still spurious, given the cross-replicate findings shown in Figure 1. (The samples with lower Ct have a higher proportion of minor variants shared but they also have fewer variants, so that when the data subset of 249 samples are analyzed, the overwhelming majority of the minor variants in that dataset will be spurious or at least not reproducible across technical replicates.) This needs to be acknowledged directly in the manuscript and implications of this for their findings need to be discussed. The discussion currently has starting on line 408 an acknowledgment that many of the minor variants in their SARS-CoV-2 samples are likely not genuine. However, there is not a discussion of how that could have impacted their results (shown in Figure 6 and 7), and that acknowledgment does not come out clearly in the Results section of the text.</p><p>3. Paragraph 155-161: why not just look at Hamming distance? (Why go through a tree?) This result is also expected and I am not sure how it plays into the main point of this paragraph that within-sample variation is shared between epidemiologically linked samples.</p><p>4. Lines 174-176: I am trying to still square this with the data shown in Figure 2 and the confidence intervals shown in this figure. To be more convincing that the probability of a variant being shared is actually higher in epidemiologically-linked samples than is unlinked samples, could the authors show the specific instances of when they are shared? Again, I think showing a plot with one sample's minor variant frequencies shown on the x-axis and another sample's minor variant frequencies are shown on the y-axis would be highly informative. The plot does not have to identify (or assume) donor or recipient, it just would need to show the frequencies of the shared minor variant in both samples, along with the frequencies of all other minor variants that were identified in those samples (and any other sites where the alleles might be fixed but differ). Plots like these would be helpful to visualize patterns of sharing of minor variations.</p><p>5. Simulation study starting at line 191: I like this addition but am confused about what this simulation study entails. How did you simulate the genome alignments? If it is from the 'Model for within-host diversity' described in Materials and methods (which I suggest renaming, since the model simulates within- and between-host evolution if I am understanding correctly), then this model also has linkage between nucleotide sites. (Lines 228-233 present a coalescent model, which they say accounts for linkage, but this first model also has full linkage as far as I can tell.) Also, I believe the previous issue was less about linkage per se, it was about independence of transitions across sites. For example, during a transmission event with a bottleneck size of 1, all sites with genetic variation (e.g. Cg, At, Ta…) would become monomorphic at the same time (e.g., C, A, T), and the 16-site model assumes independence of these transitions across sites.</p><p>6. Figure 1—figure supplement 2: the smoothing has made there be some density of samples that have negative mean coverage, which doesn't quite make sense.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.84384.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Lines 103-104: 2177x vs 10x: I don't fully understand.</p></disp-quote><p>This sentence has been clarified (now Line 110): “A total of 454 whole-genomes with mean coverage higher than 10x were kept for further analysis, resulting in an average coverage across isolates of 2457x (Figure 1—figure supplement 2).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 112: What does 'stable' mean?

We have restructured the paragraph in a more clear way and we have changed the legend to reflect that the genetic distance is measured in units of substitutions per genome (also reflected in the text now), and that the distance is calculated using the ML consensus phylogenetic tree.</p><p>For our purposes, both the phylogenetic distance and the raw SNP distance are useful measures, and in principle they should be similar, but as pointed out by the reviewer the raw genetic distance is a more simple metric.

While the additional material shown in Supp Figure 5 is helpful (as it is clear there that there are substantial and statistically meaningful differences there), a claim that &quot;the proportion of shared within-host variants was significantly higher…&quot; (line 171) requires further (statistical and/or compelling visual) justification. The current text at lines 168--187 is rather unclear as it is hard to tell if &quot;shared variants&quot; or &quot;shared low frequency variants&quot; are being described. If the 95% CIs shown in Figure 2 have been correctly calculated, then statistical (and/or compelling visual) analyses that justify the claim need to be clearly reported.</p></disp-quote><p>Figure 2 shows a basic summary of the raw data, with the mean and 95th and 5th percentiles. We agree the text was confusing by using the term 95% CI rather than percentiles, and this has been amended. The modeling is shown in Figure 2—figure supplement 2, where the shaded area does represent 95%CI and where p-values were calculated. This has been clarified in the text. We have also added Figure 2—figure supplement 1 as requested by Reviewer #2 to show the differences in allele frequency between samples with different links. We have also changed the text in 168-187.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>I have reviewed the revised manuscript, which has been improved in terms of testing the 16-site model on simulated data and on more clearly defining terms. My remaining concerns are:</p><p>1. The manuscript interprets its data and its findings too favorably. It would be much improved if the authors carefully went through the manuscript and improved the accuracy of statements/conclusions throughout. For example, the subtitle at line 151 reads 'Within-sample variation is shared between technical replicates'. Yet Figure 1c indicates that this is an overstatement. The proportion of shared minor variants is actually highly variable between technical replicates. A more appropriate subtitle would be 'Some within-sample…' Similarly, line 147, a more accurate subtitle would be 'A small amount of within-sample variation appears to be shared between…'</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the time and throughout the comments. We have now changed all the subheadings to neutral statements to avoid any interpretation of the data in the Results section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Even by selecting only the subset of samples with Ct &lt; 30, the overwhelming majority of the SARS-CoV-2 data minor variants in this subset are still spurious, given the cross-replicate findings shown in Figure 1. (The samples with lower Ct have a higher proportion of minor variants shared but they also have fewer variants, so that when the data subset of 249 samples are analyzed, the overwhelming majority of the minor variants in that dataset will be spurious or at least not reproducible across technical replicates.) This needs to be acknowledged directly in the manuscript and implications of this for their findings need to be discussed. The discussion currently has starting on line 408 an acknowledgment that many of the minor variants in their SARS-CoV-2 samples are likely not genuine. However, there is not a discussion of how that could have impacted their results (shown in Figure 6 and 7), and that acknowledgment does not come out clearly in the Results section of the text.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer’s point that removing samples with a high Ct will still keep a big proportion of spurious minor variants is correct. That is why we also filtered variants with an allele frequency lower than 2%. We realize this was not explained in the Results section, which we have now corrected in the paragraph starting in line 140. We apologize for any confusion. Figure 2 reflects the probability a variant is shared for the filtered dataset.</p><p>We have also included a paragraph at the beginning of the Discussion about the presence and effects of spurious minor variation in the data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Paragraph 155-161: why not just look at Hamming distance? (Why go through a tree?) This result is also expected and I am not sure how it plays into the main point of this paragraph that within-sample variation is shared between epidemiologically linked samples.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize as we did change the phylogenetic distance to a hamming (SNP based) distance in Table 1, but this was not properly addressed in the paragraph the reviewer was referring to. We have now changed the paragraph starting at line 155 to reflect the reviewers’ comment. We believe it is important to analyze the concordance between the genetic and the epidemiological data before analyzing how within-host variants are shared among epidemiologically linked samples.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Lines 174-176: I am trying to still square this with the data shown in Figure 2 and the confidence intervals shown in this figure. To be more convincing that the probability of a variant being shared is actually higher in epidemiologically-linked samples than is unlinked samples, could the authors show the specific instances of when they are shared? Again, I think showing a plot with one sample's minor variant frequencies shown on the x-axis and another sample's minor variant frequencies are shown on the y-axis would be highly informative. The plot does not have to identify (or assume) donor or recipient, it just would need to show the frequencies of the shared minor variant in both samples, along with the frequencies of all other minor variants that were identified in those samples (and any other sites where the alleles might be fixed but differ). Plots like these would be helpful to visualize patterns of sharing of minor variations.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added Figure 2—figure supplement 1, where the allele frequencies of isolates with different relationships are compared in a pairwise manner. We have also changed the legend in Figure 2 to reflect that the error bars actually represent 95th and 5th percentile, not confidence intervals. Confidence intervals are shown in the modeling of Figure 2—figure supplement 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Simulation study starting at line 191: I like this addition but am confused about what this simulation study entails. How did you simulate the genome alignments? If it is from the 'Model for within-host diversity' described in Materials and methods (which I suggest renaming, since the model simulates within- and between-host evolution if I am understanding correctly), then this model also has linkage between nucleotide sites. (Lines 228-233 present a coalescent model, which they say accounts for linkage, but this first model also has full linkage as far as I can tell.) Also, I believe the previous issue was less about linkage per se, it was about independence of transitions across sites. For example, during a transmission event with a bottleneck size of 1, all sites with genetic variation (e.g. Cg, At, Ta…) would become monomorphic at the same time (e.g., C, A, T), and the 16-site model assumes independence of these transitions across sites.</p></disp-quote><p>The simulations described in line 191 were carried out using the Within-host diversity model described in the Results and Methods, as pointed out by the reviewer. This is a hidden-markov model with 16 states, thus modeling some of the processes that create within-host diversity.</p><p>The reviewer is correct by pointing out that the Within-host diversity model already has linkage within it. We carried out additional simulations using a coalescent tree rather than a random tree as a starting point to increase linkage across sites compared to a random starting tree to understand how the 16-state model fared when high amounts of linkage were present.</p><p>We also agree with the reviewer that linkage and independence of transitions is a biological phenomenon that is not accounted for in our model or in any other mutational models. The scenario suggested by the reviewer, where whole genotypes are in linkage and therefore transitions occur all at once when one population in particular increases in frequency (either by selection or drift, as in the case of a transmission bottleneck), is a phenomenon that will occur independently of the chosen model, regardless of whether the model accounts for 4- or 16-states. This is a topic of paramount importance, and hard to model in microbial phylogenetics, but out of the scope of the topic of this paper. However, we have clarified this limitation in the Discussion section, starting in line 354.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6.
