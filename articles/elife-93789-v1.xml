Insects, in particular, have emerged as relevant models for olfactory studies because of the tractability of their olfactory circuits. Here, we used fast calcium imaging to track the activity of projection neurons in the honey bee antennal lobe (AL) during olfactory stimulation at high temporal resolution. We observed a heterogeneity of response profiles and an abundance of inhibitory activities, resulting in various response latencies and stimulus-specific post-odour neural signatures. Recorded calcium signals were fed to a mushroom body (MB) model constructed implementing the fundamental features of connectivity between olfactory projection neurons, Kenyon cells (KC), and MB output neurons (MBON). The model accounts for the increase of odorant discrimination in the MB compared to the AL and reveals the recruitment of two distinct KC populations that represent odorants and their aftersmell as two separate but temporally coherent neural objects. Finally, we showed that the learning-induced modulation of KC-to-MBON synapses can explain both the variations in associative learning scores across different conditioning protocols used in bees and the bees' response latency. Thus, it provides a simple explanation of how the time contingency between the stimulus and the reward can be encoded without the need for time tracking. This study broadens our understanding of olfactory coding and learning in honey bees. It demonstrates that a model based on simple MB connectivity rules and fed with real physiological data can explain fundamental aspects of odour processing and associative learning.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>honey bee</kwd><kwd>Apis mellifera</kwd><kwd>insects</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000780</institution-id><institution>European Commission</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MSCA Long Term Fellowshipt ('Memento')</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Paoli</surname><given-names>Marco</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000780</institution-id><institution>European Commission</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ERC Starting Grant ('Emerg-Ant' 759817)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wystrach</surname><given-names>Antoine</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000780</institution-id><institution>European Commission</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ERC Advanced Grant ('Cognibrains')</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Giurfa</surname><given-names>Martin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Fast calcium dynamics of honey bee olfactory projection neurons revealed an unprecedented heterogeneity of response profile dynamics and explained fundamental aspects of olfactory discrimination and associative learning.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The logic of olfactory coding and learning has been extensively studied at the behavioural and neural levels in various insect models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adam et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Galizia, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Giurfa, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Jefferis et al., 2007</xref>). Among them, the honey bee <italic>Apis mellifera</italic> has played a pivotal role in our understanding of these processes due to its behavioural accessibility and tractability of its nervous system. In bees, olfactory perception and learning have been typically investigated using the proboscis extension reflex (PER; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Giurfa, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Menzel, 1999</xref>), a protocol that relies on pairing a neutral olfactory stimulus (the conditioned stimulus or CS) with a positive reinforcement of sugar solution (the unconditioned stimulus or US) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bitterman et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Giurfa and Sandoz, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Takeda, 1961</xref>). In the classical version of PER conditioning, the CS precedes and partially overlaps US presentation. This results in high levels of specific memory for the conditioned odorant. Conversely, when the reward precedes the stimulus (backward conditioning), no positive association can be established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Felsenberg et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Hellstern et al., 1998</xref>). It also enables the study of more sophisticated cognitive processes such as trace learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Paoli et al., 2023a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Szyszka et al., 2011</xref>) and patterning discrimination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Deisig et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Devaud et al., 2015</xref>). In the former, CS and US are not overlapping but separated by a stimulus-free temporal gap, whereas in the latter, bees are trained to respond in opposite ways to a two-odorant mixture compared to its individual components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Deisig et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Devaud et al., 2015</xref>). Overall, the olfactory conditioning of PER provides a robust read-out for investigating the dynamics of olfactory memory formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Giurfa and Sandoz, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Villar et al., 2020</xref>) and olfactory perception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Guerrieri et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>Our understanding of the neural processing subtending olfactory coding and learning relies on decades of neuroanatomical and neurophysiological studies performed in honey bees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Paoli and Galizia, 2021</xref>). Olfactory processing starts at the peripheral level, when volatile chemicals interact with the olfactory receptors expressed on the dendritic membrane of the olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs). The biochemical nature of odorant-receptor interactions allows for a certain molecule to bind to multiple receptors with different affinities, resulting in the activation of an OSNs sub-population with odorant-specific response intensities and latencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Münch and Galizia, 2016</xref>). Olfactory sensory neurons innervate the first olfactory processing centre, the antennal lobe (AL), where the neurons expressing the same olfactory receptor converge onto one of ~160 glomeruli, the anatomical and functional units of the AL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Flanagan and Mercer, 1989</xref>). Thus, odorant detection results in the stimulus-specific activation of a subset of glomeruli, creating a stereotypical map of odour-induced glomerular responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Galizia et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Sachse et al., 1999</xref>). The signal processed in the AL is forwarded by ~800 output neurons – the projection neurons (PNs) – to higher order brain centres: the mushroom bodies (MBs), central, paired structures dedicated to multisensory integration, memory storage and retrieval (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Heisenberg, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Stopfer, 2014</xref>), and the lateral horn of the protocerebrum, a diffuse bilateral structure involved in valence coding of odorants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Jeanne et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Roussel et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Strutz et al., 2014</xref>). The MB architecture is defined by the layout of its ~185,000 intrinsic neurons, the Kenyon cells (KCs). Each KC extends its dendritic arborisation within the MB input regions, termed the calyces, where it receives input from multiple PNs, and projects its axon to the MB output region, termed the pedunculus, where it bifurcates into the vertical (α and γ) and the medial (β) lobes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Mobbs, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Strausfeld, 2002</xref>). Kenyon cells integrate, among others, the excitatory input of olfactory PNs and the inhibitory input of recurrent GABAergic feedback neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ganeshina and Menzel, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Grünewald, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Rybak and Menzel, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Zwaka et al., 2018</xref>). The latter plays a critical role in shaping KCs olfactory responsiveness and maintaining a sparse output over a wide range of odorants and concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Papadopoulou et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Stopfer, 2014</xref>). Antennal lobe, mushroom body and lateral horn are innervated by the VUMmx1 neuron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hammer, 1993</xref>), an unpaired octopaminergic neuron conveying appetitive reward-related information to the olfactory circuit and mediating reward-based olfactory memory formation. The activity in the Kenyon cells is integrated by MB output neurons (MBONs). These neurons exhibit which show learning-related plasticity and provide valence-loaded information to pre-motor areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Aso et al., 2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Okada et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Schmalz et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Strube-Bloss and Rössler, 2018</xref>).</p><p>The neural representation of odorants in the AL has been extensively described by means of functional calcium imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Paoli and Haase, 2018b</xref>). In vivo imaging allowed observing that each stimulus is represented with a specific pattern of excitatory and inhibitory responses across the glomeruli of the AL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Galizia et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Sachse and Galizia, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Sachse et al., 1999</xref>), and that perceptually similar odorants elicit similar glomerular response patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Guerrieri et al., 2005</xref>). Calcium imaging of AL activity has been typically conducted at low temporal resolutions (~100–200ms; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Locatelli et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Mertes et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Nouvian et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Sachse and Galizia, 2003</xref>). This is partially justified by the slow dynamics of fluorescent calcium sensors, which resulted – in general – in the compression of olfactory representation into a spatial vector of glomerular response intensity, with a concomitant loss of information on neural response dynamics. While calcium signal decay is relatively slow (&gt;100ms), its onset is fast (&lt;10ms) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Helassa et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Moreaux and Laurent, 2007</xref>), and provides the possibility for investigating parameters such as glomerular response latency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Junek et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Paoli et al., 2018a</xref>), signal frequency components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Paoli et al., 2016</xref>) and interglomerular information transfer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chen et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Paoli et al., 2023b</xref>). In this study, we significantly improved the temporal resolution of calcium imaging recordings of olfactory neurons in the bee brain by means of a resonant scanning multiphoton microscope. This allowed us to record calcium activity at a&lt;10 ms resolution, preserving temporal information of the olfactory code and yielding a more realistic representation of odour trajectories in the AL. First, we observed that odour representation changes dynamically during and after an olfactory stimulation, resulting in specific odour and after-odour images. Then, we showed that most glomerular response profiles presented an inhibitory component, suggesting that glomerular activity is strongly shaped by local inhibition, with only a minor influence – if any – of local excitatory interneurons.</p><p>Calcium imaging analysis was combined with a modelling approach to investigate how odorant representation evolves from the AL to the MB. Electrophysiology experiments have provided insight on the phasic and sparse activity of Kenyon cells as well as into its oscillatory nature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Laurent and Davidowitz, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Perez-Orive et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Stopfer, 2014</xref>). However, the unavailability of an imaging method allowing the visualisation of olfactory coding in a KC ensemble prevented us from further understanding how odorants are represented within the MB, for example how the neural representation of an odorant is transformed from the AL to the MB or to what extent the similarity among odorant representation is maintained in the KC space. One way to address these questions is by using neural network models constructed <italic>via</italic> the abstraction of common features of MBs across insect species (e.g. fruit fly, locust, honey bee) to reproduce cognitive tasks such as stimulus discrimination or learning. Models can be built by simulating multiple neurons interacting with each other according to physiological rules such as the dynamics of action potentials or Hebbian synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Eschbach et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Finelli et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Gkanias et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Huerta et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Smith et al., 2008</xref>). Other models simulate the MB neural network by considering the statistics of connectivity within the neuropil, for example the ratio of PNs to KCs, the average number of synaptic connections, the neuronal firing rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ardin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Buehlmann et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Le Moël et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Peng and Chittka, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Springer and Nawrot, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Wystrach, 2023</xref>). Here, we followed the second approach and built a simplified but realistic neural network model of the MB based on the neuroanatomical and functional properties of the insect’s olfactory circuit. The model comprises three layers of neurons: (1) a MB input layer to provide the model experimentally acquired time-series of PN activity; (2) a MB intrinsic layer, where the input signal is distributed to a population of modelled KCs based on neuroanatomical and physiological data; (3) a MB output layer, where one appetitive MB output neuron (MBON) receives input from the KC layer and can be subject to learning-induced plasticity. Generally, the input for this type of model is simulated based on the spatial and temporal statistics of the odour-induced glomerular activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Eschbach et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Finelli et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Gkanias et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Huerta et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Le Moël and Wystrach, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Peng and Chittka, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Smith et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Springer and Nawrot, 2021</xref>). In this case, we fed the model with the time series of the PN responses recorded via in vivo calcium imaging analysis from multiple individuals exposed to three different odorants at the MB working frequency of 20 Hz (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cassenaer and Laurent, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Laurent and Naraghi, 1994</xref>).</p><p>Here, we show that an MB neural network model based solely on three simple connectivity rules abstracted from insect studies – sparse connectivity, feedback inhibition, and learning-induced synaptic modulation – is sufficient to explain fundamental MB processing features such as improved olfactory discrimination and associative learning. The model also predicts that the presence of post-stimulus inhibitory and excitatory activity leads to the recruitment of a second pool of KC, resulting in a distinct after-odour representation in the MB. Additionally, the model’s performance in appetitive learning and across-stimuli generalisation was coherent with empirical measurements obtained from behavioural protocols. Finally, using real physiological datasets as input, we showed that such a model is robust to noise and biological variability across multiple stimulus repetitions.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Response dynamics of projection neurons in high-temporal resolution</title><p>Antennal lobe PNs of eight bees were back-filled with the calcium sensor Fura-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Paoli and Haase, 2018b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Sachse and Galizia, 2002</xref>) to measure odour-induced glomerular activity of (~25 glomeruli/AL) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

Neuroanatomical studies in bees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Szyszka et al., 2005</xref>) and flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Litwin-Kumar et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Caron et al., 2013</xref>) suggest that each KC is randomly innervated by approximately 7–10 PNs. Thus, we generated a MB network where ~ 25 PNs (i.e., the average number of glomeruli imaged during a calcium imaging experiment) diverge onto 1000 KCs, with each KC being innervated by ~8 PNs. Second, recurrent inhibitory neurons such as the A3 feedback neurons in the bee (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Mobbs, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Rybak and Menzel, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Szyszka et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Zwaka et al., 2018</xref>), the APL neuron in fly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Lin et al., 2014</xref>), and the giant GABAergic neuron in the locust (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Papadopoulou et al., 2011</xref>), modulate MB KCs firing rate so that less than 20% of KCs are active upon olfactory stimulation, and only ~5% are stimulus-specific (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Honegger et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Turner et al., 2008</xref>). Hence, we enriched the model with a winner-takes-it-all feedback inhibition mechanism by forcing that only 10% of KCs receiving the largest summed input generate an action potential. Third, as in bees and locusts, MB have a 20 Hz oscillatory cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cassenaer and Laurent, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Laurent and Naraghi, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Popov and Szyszka, 2020</xref>), we fed the model with experimentally recorded calcium signals resampled at a 20 Hz-sampling frequency.

The analysis of KC population turnover (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) showed that, before odorant onset, the population varies randomly between adjacent time points while it stabilises during olfactory stimulation, with a turnover rate of ~10%. The dynamics of KC recruitment across bees and odorants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>) indicates that two odorant-specific sets of cells are recruited during an olfactory stimulation: the first one at stimulus onset, the second one at odour termination (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, <italic>t</italic>=5 s).

Because learning results from the coincidental activation of CS and US elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Pavlov, 1927</xref>), an individual should respond to the different time points of an olfactory stimulation with different strengths, depending on the US arrival time experienced during conditioning.

Having a fixed CS stimulation interval from <italic>t</italic>=0–5 s, and a learning window (US) of 3 s, we simulated MBON learning with the following ISIs: <italic>backward</italic> pairing occurred when the US initiated at <italic>t</italic> = –2 s (i.e. 2 s before CS onset), <italic>early</italic> pairing when it started at <italic>t</italic>=1 s (<italic>1</italic> s after CS onset), <italic>delay</italic> pairing when it started at <italic>t</italic>=4 s (4 s after CS onset), and <italic>trace</italic> pairing when the US started at <italic>t</italic>=7 s (2 s after CS offset). First, we trained the model with the experimental PN response profile recorded for either 1-hexanol or peppermint oil (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). One odorant was used as CS and the other as a novel odorant to test the specificity of the learning obtained under these experimental conditions. After learning, we modelled the MBON action potential (AP) probability upon the presentation of the CS (e.g., 1-hexanol) and the novel odorant (e.g., peppermint), and repeated this operation for the response profiles of all individuals. To account for the biological variability in the neural activities elicited by repetitions of the same stimulus, learning was assessed against the KC response profiles resulting from five CS and five novel odorant presentations, which were not included in the training dataset. As expected, we found that a trained MBON showed a larger decrease in firing probability when presented with the CS than with the unfamiliar stimulus, demonstrating learning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Interestingly, the model predicts weak learning in the case of <italic>backward</italic> pairing – that is when US and CS are partially overlapping, but the US begins before the CS – whereas both <italic>early</italic> and <italic>delay</italic> conditioning predict strong learning, that is, a large CS-specific down-regulation of MBON firing probability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Finally, in the case of <italic>trace</italic> conditioning, the model also produced a down-modulation of the MBON response. However, this learnt response was shifted in time: it appeared only after the CS offset, that is, around the US expected arrival time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>).</p><p>In addition, according to the model, high synaptic plasticity sensitivity (low <italic>spt</italic> values) facilitates non-specific learning, resulting in a strong generalisation effect. Conversely, MBON plasticity under high <italic>spt</italic> values requires a robust and stable KC activation. This scenario is not compatible with a learning interval that is only partially overlapping with the stimulation window (note that measurements are provided at 20 Hz, and in this context, a <italic>spt</italic> = 40 requires a synapse to be activated during two whole seconds – although not continuously – to be switched off) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>Stimulus representation is dynamic (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>). Hence, our model predicts that an MBON exposed to an <italic>early</italic> protocol should learn to identify the early components of the stimulus neural signature. Indeed, the model shows that the learned response (a down-regulation of MBON firing probability) occurs earlier in the <italic>early</italic> than in the <italic>delay</italic> contingency (Wilcoxon test for non-parametric paired data, <italic>p&lt;</italic>0.001; <italic>n</italic>=16) and with lower response latency variability (Barlett’s test <italic>early</italic> vs <italic>delay</italic>, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.011; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). At the same time, it predicts that <italic>trace</italic> conditioning should rely on the identification of post-stimulus neural activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). As such, the learned response occurs after odour offset and with a variability comparable to the one detected for the <italic>delay</italic> protocol (Barlett’s test <italic>delay</italic> vs <italic>trace</italic>, <italic>p</italic>=0.1808; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>).</p><p>To test the model’s predictions, we measured the timing of real behavioural responses (i.e<italic>.</italic> the proboscis extension) of bees trained under the same CS/US conditions and tested 1 hr later with the CS and a novel odorant.

In agreement with the model’s predictions and previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Felsenberg et al., 2014</xref>), <italic>backward</italic> conditioning led to scarce and unspecific responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>).

Video tracking of the proboscis extension response showed that bees receiving the reward 1 s after CS onset extended the proboscis earlier and with less variability than those that received the reward towards the end of CS delivery (Kruskal-Wallis test, p=0.036; Barlett’s test for data variance comparison, <italic>p</italic>=5e10<sup>–6</sup>; <italic>n</italic><sub>early</sub> = 26, <italic>n</italic><sub>delay</sub> = 20; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>).

Excitatory responses occurred earlier than inhibitory ones and exhibited a smaller temporal variability. This suggests that excitation of PNs occurs in a single wave upon cholinergic input from the OSNs to the glomeruli of the antennal lobe, with a minor contribution – if any – of second-order excitatory local interneurons within the AL, which have been reported for <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chou et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Olsen et al., 2007</xref>) but so far not for honey bees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Girardin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Krofczik et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Schäfer and Bicker, 1986</xref>). This finding also advocates that odour responses of OSNs may not display onset-latency variability as shown in the locusts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Kim et al., 2023</xref>). On the other hand, inhibitory PN responses and the termination of early excitatory PN responses occurred within the same time window, approx. 40 ms after the onset of excitatory responses, suggesting that lateral inhibition within the AL is responsible for triggering PN inhibition and terminating early excitatory responses (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, groups 7 and 8). This is consistent with a significant presence of GABAergic local interneurons in the AL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Schäfer and Bicker, 1986</xref>), which reshape the olfactory message conveyed to higher order brain structures such as the MBs and the lateral horn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Paoli and Galizia, 2021</xref>). Notably, we observed that almost 50% of PN responses recorded contain an inhibitory component (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, groups 1–3, 5, 7, 8), underlining the dominant role of inhibitory AL interneurons in shaping odour trajectories in the glomerular space. These observations are in contrast with previous calcium imaging analyses, where only 2–10% of responses had an inhibitory nature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Krofczik et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Szyszka et al., 2005</xref>), but coherent with electrophysiological recordings showing a rich response diversity and prominence of inhibitory activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Wilson et al., 2004</xref>). Differently from <italic>Drosophila</italic>, where both local inhibitory and excitatory interneurons contribute to the olfactory tuning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chou et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Huang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Shang et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Yaksi and Wilson, 2010</xref>), our analysis indicates that, in the honey bee AL, glomerular responses are modulated mainly by a local inhibitory network. This conclusion is supported by a previous study showing that pharmacological activation of a single glomerulus by topical acetylcholine application provokes inhibitory but not excitatory responses in other glomeruli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Girardin et al., 2013</xref>). Indeed, while the presence of excitatory local interneurons has been predicted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Malaka et al., 1995</xref>), such prediction has never been supported by experimental evidence. A population analysis suggests that the varied response profiles are equally distributed across individuals and can be triggered by different olfactory stimuli. Still, it remains to be understood to what extent the response profiles for each odour/glomerulus combination are conserved across individuals.</p><p>Overall, these findings highlight possible differences between the ALs of bees and fruit flies regarding the nature of the local interneuron populations modulating glomerular activity. Thus, they cast caution in prioritising a single species as a representative general model of insect olfaction.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Smell and aftersmell: An odorant-specific afterimage</title><p>Almost 50% of all PN responses in our database displayed either a prolonged post-stimulus activity (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, groups 2 and 6) or a change in response direction after stimulus termination (groups 3, 5, 7, 8). This results in the recruitment of an offset-specific population of KC – both in our model and in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ito et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Lüdke et al., 2018</xref>) – that creates a neural image of the post-odour in the MB. Thus, the post-odour representation is different from the neural image of the odorant itself and provides a stable, slowly decaying after-image, which is stimulus-specific and temporally associated with the neural correlate of the odorant itself. This is in agreement with the analysis conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Patterson et al., 2013</xref> on the olfactory representation in M/T cells in mice, which shows that the post-odorant activity is rather conserved and stimulus-specific even across concentrations and for about a 10 s window. Our modelling analysis predicts that the after-stimulus signature of an odorant is more distinct and stable across time in the MB than in the AL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). This could occur because the activity across the KC population is normalised by the MB feedback neurons operating a gain control, which stabilises odorant-responses signature in the MB – including the post-odorant activity – while the input signal in the PN is fading.</p><p>The existence of a post-odour signature has important implications for understanding the neurobiological basis of trace learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dylla et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Paoli et al., 2023a</xref>), a conditioning protocol in which a stimulus-free time window separates CS and US. Previous studies reported that an odorant cannot be predicted by its post-odour signature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Lüdke et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Szyszka et al., 2011</xref>). Nevertheless, as shown in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Galili et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Lüdke et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Patterson et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Szyszka et al., 2011</xref>), the neural activity associated with the OFF response is stimulus-specific and reproducible, suggesting that the post-odour could be physiologically similar to the onset of a second odorant (in the same way as the back-taste of wine could remind us of an unrelated ingredient). If so, the odour/post-odour pattern could be processed as an individual neural object, effectively extending the duration of the nominal, conditioned odour. Alternatively, it is also possible that the stimulus specificity of the after-smell signature and its temporal contiguity with the CS may enable some form of second-order conditioning. Certainly, the behavioural analysis within this study indicates that honey bees subjected to trace conditioning display the conditioned reflex already during odour arrival. This indicates that bees do not form simply the association between the after-smell (as CS) and the sugar reward (US). Conversely, it supports the idea that trace learning requires some form of prolongation of the neural trace of the CS until US arrival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dylla et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Paoli et al., 2023a</xref>). Interestingly, the duration of the post-odour neural signature reported by us and by previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Galili et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Patterson et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Szyszka et al., 2011</xref>) is about 10–15 s. As such, it is compatible with the duration of the CS/US gap in trace learning experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Galili et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Paoli et al., 2023a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Szyszka et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Wystrach et al., 2020</xref>), suggesting the possibility of its implication in this form of learning.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Mushroom body modelling predicts associative learning scores and response latency for different conditioning protocols</title><p>To investigate if the proposed neural network model explains the temporal features of associative learning, we simulated CS delivery by feeding the model with experimental PN calcium imaging time series and applied a learning rule based on the downregulation of recurrently recruited synapses in the MB. A learning time window of 3 s was defined according to four well-studied protocols for associative conditioning, which correspond to four different ISI situations (–2 s,+1 s,+4 and+7 s) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bitterman et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Giurfa and Sandoz, 2012</xref>). A simulation of the action potential probability of an MBON after olfactory conditioning revealed that differentiation between the CS and a novel odorant was observable whenever the CS anticipated the US (ISIs of +1 s and +4 s) but less successful in the <italic>backward</italic> (ISI of –2 s) and <italic>trace</italic> protocols (ISI of 7 s). Generalisation errors were also observed in a similar way as in behavioural experiments. Notably, in this study, we adopted a backward contingency with a 1 s overlap between the US and the CS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). This differs from the more traditional configuration, where the CS is delivered after US termination, that is, without any temporal overlap. In this case, the model would predict no learning at all, as observed in honey bee behavioural experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Felsenberg et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Hellstern et al., 1998</xref>). Hence, we tested the model’s prediction in the form of <italic>backward</italic> conditioning where US and CS are partially overlapping. In this case, the model predicts a weak appetitive association (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B, C and E</xref>). This result is coherent with a previous behavioural report, where bees subject to a similar protocol showed a weak response to the conditioned odorant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Felsenberg et al., 2014</xref>). In the <italic>early</italic> and <italic>delay</italic> configurations, a CS-specific associative memory was formed, both in the model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>) and in the behavioural tests (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). However, the model predicts a difference in response latency and latency variability depending on relative CS/US arrival (ISI of +1 or+4 s): a learning window placed closer to stimulus onset (<italic>early</italic> protocol) resulted in early and temporally precise MBON responses, whereas a delayed learning window produced a similar learning score, but with higher response latencies and temporal uncertainty.</p><p>Experimental results based on the same odorants that were fed to the model confirmed the model’s predictions. They showed that <italic>early</italic> and <italic>delay</italic> protocols yielded comparable results in terms of learning score and CS-specificity while differing in terms of CS latency and precision (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C–F</xref>). These observations support the idea that associative learning occurs upon coincident detection of the CS and US neural elements. In fact, because the CS neural representation changes dynamically during the olfactory stimulation, a positive association with the initial odour signature will trigger an earlier and temporally precise conditioned response. Conversely, the association with the later part of the olfactory signature will elicit a delayed response with greater temporal variability.</p><p>Finally, both the model and data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C and E</xref>) show that <italic>trace</italic> conditioning yields lower and less specific learning scores. However, while the model predicts that learners should respond around the expected US arrival time (i.e<italic>.,</italic> during the after-smell component, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>), empirical data show that the individuals who learned the association extend their proboscis during (and not after) the olfactory stimulation. Such a discrepancy in measured and predicted response latencies suggests that trace conditioning cannot be explained by the simple temporal coincidence of a reward system’s activation and a pool of KC recruited at odour offset. In order to trigger a conditioned response anticipating the expected reward time, the network must have learned the nominal CS stimulus and not simply its after-smell. Thus, a higher order cognitive process, possibly involving attention mediated by the serotonergic system, could contribute in prolonging the memory trace of the conditioned stimulus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Paoli et al., 2023a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">Zeng et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Vrontou et al., 2021</xref> showed that activation of the fruit fly dopaminergic system at the end of a stimulus or after odour offset can, in certain cases, regulate the MBON spiking rate already at odour onset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Vrontou et al., 2021</xref>). This suggests that delayed reward system activation can modulate an olfactory stimulus’s early neural coding. Consequently, the CS/US temporal contingencies used in studies on <italic>delay</italic> and <italic>trace</italic> protocols may trigger an earlier-than-expected behavioural response by inducing learning-related neural plasticity in the early components of a CS response.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Encoding time without encoding time</title><p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Pavlov, 1927</xref> proposed that the timing of a conditioned response could be adjusted to coincide with the expected arrival of the unconditioned stimulus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Pavlov, 1927</xref>). In his view, this capability involved two cognitive processes: learning to suppress the responses to the earlier phases of the conditioned stimulus and – at the same time – learning to delay the conditioned response until the US onset. Drew et al<italic>.</italic> showed that in goldfish, the timing of the conditioned response is influenced by the CS/US inter-stimulus interval, and its precision improves across learning trials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Drew et al., 2005</xref>). Importantly, this improvement was due to increased accurately timed responses rather than decreased off-time ones. Unlike in Pavlov’s hypothesis, these findings suggested that timing acquisition during associative conditioning relies on learning to respond at the correct moment rather than to avoid responding at the wrong time. Experimental evidence in mammals indicates that their ability to adjust the latency of the conditioned response based on the US/CS relative onset depends on the cerebellar neural network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Perrett et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Garcia-Garcia et al., 2024</xref>). Targeted lesions to the cerebellar cortex significantly impair this ability, suggesting that the adaptive timing of conditioned responses relies on a different mechanism than the one supporting the association. Although the neural mechanisms governing timing in the cerebellum are not yet fully understood, the involvement of this brain area in sensory-motor timing is well-established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Kirkpatrick and Balsam, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Paton and Buonomano, 2018</xref>).</p><p>While the influence of the inter-stimulus interval on learning is well documented also in invertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Giurfa and Malun, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Szyszka et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Vogt et al., 2015</xref>), the ability of relatively small insect brains to time the conditioned response based on the expected reward arrival remains unclear. Previous studies have shown that the duration of the inter-stimulus interval experienced during learning can influence the conditioned response’s latency in bumble bees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boisvert and Sherry, 2006</xref>) and honey bees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Szyszka et al., 2011</xref>). Both studies indicate that bees trained with a longer ISI exhibited a larger latency in their response to the conditioned stimulus. This provided clear evidence that CS-related information can modulate response timing. However, the appetitive response largely anticipated the expected reward time, and a clear interpretation of time tracking in insect brains is still missing.</p><p>Our model shows that this time contingency can be naturally encoded simply because the olfactory representation in the KCs evolves through time in a deterministic fashion. Thus, what is learnt during the US presentation is the KC configuration of the CS at this particular time. In other words, the MBON learns which subpopulation of KC is active during reward arrival rather than the expected reward time. Interestingly, because the KC representation of the CS does not evolve linearly with time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–C</xref>), the CS/US time contingency is not encoded perfectly. Remarkably, the model captures the experimental measurements of the proboscis response latency in bees, which indeed tend to respond earlier than the expected reward (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D and F</xref>). However, such reasoning may not apply to trace conditioning protocols – when a temporal gap separates CS offset and US onset. In this case, higher order neural processes that are not captured by our model may contribute to extending the stimulus-related information required for associative learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Paoli et al., 2023a</xref>).</p><p>As often in insect research, heuristics can provide simple solutions to apparently complex cognitive problems. In this case, a mechanism based on the temporal dynamics of the conditioned stimulus, explains the bees' systematic errors at encoding proper CS/US contingency. Whether, in addition to this process, other mechanisms enable bees to track time contingencies remains to be seen.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Conclusive remarks</title><p>In this study, we adopted a fast calcium imaging approach to investigate the dynamical representation of odorants in the antennal lobe. Our findings revealed that about 50% of glomerular responses had an inhibitory component and that local inhibition played a crucial role in shaping the initial PN activity and defining odour trajectories in the glomerular space. We observed that half of the PN response profiles prolonged their activity or changed response direction after stimulus termination, generating a stable, odorant-specific after-smell. Although the after-smell might be very different from the odour signature, it is specific and temporally contiguous, thus providing the means to prolong the neural representation of the stimulus itself.</p><p>To investigate the logic of olfactory transformation and learning in the mushroom body, we constructed an MB neural network model based on the known connectivity in the insect brain. We showed that the model can process experimentally acquired input data and produce realistic KC response patterns. Our analysis suggests that the mushroom bodies enhance olfactory discrimination ability and stabilise the olfactory after-image, effectively prolonging the stimulus signature after odour offset.</p><p>Finally, we implemented a learning rule to modulate MB output neurons firing rate based on associative learning. We verified the model’s predictions with behavioural measurements on real honey bees subjected to different learning protocols. The coherence between measured and predicted behavioural scores suggested that the rules behind this neural model – that is random connectivity, feedback inhibition, and MBON plasticity – are sufficient to generate relevant predictions for associative learning upon different learning protocols. In addition, by testing the model against physiological recordings of different stimulations, we showed that the model’s predictions are robust to noise and biological variability.</p><p>Because the model incorporates not only neural assumptions pertaining to the honey bee olfactory system but also to the fruit fly and locust olfactory systems, similar principles may guide odour signal transformation at the level of the MB in appetitive associative learning across insects. This generality does not apply, however, to the nature of odour reshaping by local interneurons observed in the AL of bees, which seems to differ from that occurring in flies, thus highlighting the fact that convergence, but also differences, can characterise the functional architectures of olfactory systems in different insect species.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Experimental model</title><p>Experiments were performed on honey bees <italic>Apis mellifera</italic> reared in outdoor hives at the experimental apiary of the Research Centre on Animal Cognition (CNRS, Toulouse, France) situated in the campus of the University Paul Sabatier.

No institutional permission is required for experimental research on honey bees.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Projection neurons labelling</title><p>Honey bee foragers were collected the day before the experiment at an artificial feeder, to which they were previously trained, and projection neurons were labelled for calcium imaging analysis as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Paoli et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Sachse and Galizia, 2002</xref>). Shortly, bees were fixed in a 3D-printed holder with soft dental wax, antennae were blocked frontally with a drop of eicosane (Sigma Aldrich, CAS: 112-95-8). A small window was opened in the head cuticle, and glands and tracheas were displaced to expose the injection site. The tip of a borosilicate glass needle coated with Fura-2-dextran (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc) was inserted between the medial and lateral mushroom body calyces, where medial (m-ACTs) and lateral antenno-cerebral tracts (l-ACTs) cross. After dye injection, the head capsule was closed to prevent brain desiccation, and bees were fed ad libitum with a 50% sucrose/water solution. On the following day, antennal lobes were exposed to allow optical access, and the brain was covered in transparent two-component silicon (Kwik-Sil, WPI). Although the injection procedure may result in variable levels of PN labelling, the reproducibility of response amplitudes and the lack of labelling bias for specific glomeruli indicate that the loading procedure is reproducible.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Calcium imaging analysis and signal processing</title><p>Undiluted solutions of 1-hexanol (Sigma-Aldrich, CAS:111-27-3, 7.98 M), 1-heptanol (CAS:111-70-6, 7.05 M) and peppermint oil (CAS: 8006-90-4, 898 g/L) were delivered to the bees using an Arduino Uno-controlled automated olfactometer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bestea et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Raiser et al., 2017</xref>). Briefly, 1 mL of pure odorant was placed in a 20 mL glass vial. During an olfactory stimulation, the headspace concentration of volatile odorants is injected into a clean airflow, where it is diluted approximately 10 times before reaching the honey bee antennae. The odorous flow exiting the olfactometer is weak but detectable by a human nose, in the range of honey bee olfactory sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Carcaud et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gil-Guevara et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Wright and Smith, 2004</xref>). Odorants were alternated and presented 20 times on a 5/25 s ON/OFF configuration. Calcium imaging recordings were conducted with a straight Leica SP8 scanning microscope (Leica Microsystems, Germany) equipped with a SpectraPhysics InSight X3 multiphoton laser tuned at 780 nm for Fura-2 excitation. All images were acquired with a water immersion 16 x objective (Leica HC FLUOTAR 16 x/0.6 IMM CORR, Leica Microsystems, Germany), at 64x64 pixel resolution and ~127 Hz.</p><p>Calcium imaging data were analysed with custom-made MATLAB (MathWorks Inc) scripts. The baseline signal, calculated as the mean fluorescence during the one second before stimulus onset, was used to calculate baseline-subtracted and normalised stimulus-induced glomerular activity (∆<italic>F</italic>/<italic>F</italic>). The normalised activity was multiplied by –1 to display excitatory/inhibitory responses as positive/negative relative changes (-∆<italic>F</italic>/<italic>F</italic>). Time series of glomerular activity were averaged across stimulus repetitions for response profile clustering analysis. Glomeruli were hand-selected based on a morphological and functional map. To facilitate glomerular identification, the odour response maps for the three stimuli were merged into an RGB image: 1-hexanol was set as the red channel, 1-heptanol as the green, and peppermint as the blue. Thus, glomeruli excited only by peppermint appear in blue, glomeruli excited only by 1-hexanol appear in red, and glomeruli excited by a combination of the three channels will result in different colour shades. Glomerular response profiles were calculated as the mean intensity of an area of 5-by-5 pixels around the centre of the glomerulus across time. Stimulus representation stability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>) was assessed with a Person’s correlation analysis between vectors of the mean glomerular response of different trials. Glomerular response vectors' stability was calculated before, during and after olfactory stimulation.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Mushroom body modelling</title><p>We used MATLAB R2018a to investigate how the recorded PN activity would affect KC responses of a MB network model.</p><sec id="s4-4-1"><title>Projection neurons to KC connectivity</title><p>Real projection neurons' activity acquired via calcium imaging analysis provided the input to a simple model of the mushroom body neural circuits. For each experimentally measured honey bee, approxmately 26 glomeruli were detected. Considering that each glomerulus hosts multiple PNs, for each glomerular signal, we modelled 3 PNs, each with its own independent connections with a subset of the 1000 modelled KCs. Connections between PNs and KCs were modelled as pseudo-random, with each KC receiving connections 30% of the input PN population, as observed in bees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Szyszka et al., 2005</xref>) and flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Litwin-Kumar et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Caron et al., 2013</xref>). PN-to-KC connections were assumed to be binary: either 0 (not connected), or 1 (connected), and the connectivity scheme is stable in a given MB model and not subject to plastic changes. This was implemented as a logic connectivity matrix (<italic>W_PN_to_KC</italic>) of size <italic>number_of_PNs ×number_of_KCs</italic>. Experimental PNs activity (<italic>PNactivity</italic>) was resampled at 20 Hz for modelling analysis (50ms temporal resolution) to match the 20 Hz oscillatory cycle detected in the MB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cassenaer and Laurent, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Laurent and Naraghi, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Popov and Szyszka, 2020</xref>). For every time step <italic>t</italic>, the integrated input to each KCs (<italic>KCepsp</italic>) was calculated as the matrix product of the input neuron activity vector (<italic>PNactivity</italic>) and the logical connectivity matrix. Notably, we considered that a glomerulus is completely silent only at minimal inhibition. For this reason, at any time point, also glomeruli with negative ΔF/F values contribute to determining a KC integrated input. This integrated input of each KC is analogous to its excitatory post-synaptic potential (EPSP).</p><p>KCepsp(t) = PNactivity(t) × W_PN_to_KC.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-2"><title>Winner-takes-it-all inhibitory feedback element</title><p>Whether a KC will fire an action potential depends not only on the sum of its input signals but also on the inhibitory activity of the MB feedback neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Rybak and Menzel, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Zwaka et al., 2018</xref>). These neurons act on the whole KC population, providing that the KCs receiving the highest summed input will produce an action potential (AP). To account for such effect, and based on known MB neurophysiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Honegger et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Peng and Chittka, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Turner et al., 2008</xref>), we imposed that only the 10% most active <italic>KCepsp</italic> (i.e<italic>.,</italic> receiving the strongest summed input) will fire an action potential.</p><p>If KC(<italic>i</italic>)epsp(<italic>t</italic>) &gt; 10h percentil of KCepsp(<italic>t</italic>), then KC(<italic>i</italic>)activity(<italic>t</italic>) = 1; else KC(<italic>i</italic>)activity(<italic>t</italic>) = 0.</p><p>This outputs a binary vector of firing pattern across the whole KC population (<italic>KCactivity</italic>), where ones correspond to action potential and zeroes to silent KC. This operation is repeated for all epochs to obtain the time course of the activity of the KC population before, during and after odour arrival. To ensure the robustness of the model and account for the variability of the initial parameters, the MB simulation was run 10 times for each experimental AL input dataset. The results were then averaged over the 10 MB network simulations.

Under the assumption that similar principles are highly conserved among insects, we modelled an MBON receiving connections from all KCs and with all connections having an initial synaptic weight = 1 to reflect a generalised odour tuning. This provides a broadly-tuned MBON that responds equally to any pattern of KC activity. Upon learning, MBON synapses that are repeatedly recruited are switched off (=0). As a consequence, a trained MBON retains a high AP probability in the presence of an unfamiliar stimulus but a lower one in response to the conditioned odorant (or to an odorant that is represented by a similar KC population). Two parameters guide learning: a synaptic plasticity threshold (<italic>spt</italic>) and a learning window. The variable <italic>spt</italic> defines the number of firing events needed for a given KC to induce its output synaptic depression (i.e<italic>.,</italic> KC(<italic>i</italic>)_to_MBON synaptic weight switch from 1 to 0). For the learning tests, a <italic>spt</italic> value of 15 was adopted. This value falls in the middle of the range tested in our simulations (from 1 to 40). It is stringent enough to hinder plastic modulation of rarely recruited KCs, while still requiring repetitive activation (i.e<italic>.,</italic> a synapse must be active at least 750ms during a 3 s learning window) before allowing learning-induced plasticity.</p><p>The learning window provides a temporal restriction of such a learning rule, analogous to the reward/US delivery window in an appetitive conditioning protocol. Different CS/US contingencies were tested.

Three hours later, they were exposed to an absolute olfactory conditioning protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Villar et al., 2020</xref>). During conditioning, bees were placed in front of the odour delivery device (the same one used for the calcium imaging analysis) and exposed to clean air for 15 s (familiarisation phase), to the odorant for 5 s, and to clean air again for another 20 s. Three different intervals were selected for delivering the sugar reward: either from 2 s before odour onset to 1 s after (<italic>backward conditioning</italic>), from 1 to 4 s from odour onset (<italic>early conditioning</italic>), from 4 to 7 s from odour onset (<italic>delay conditioning</italic>), or from 7 to 10 s from odour onset (<italic>trace conditioning</italic>).

As suggested, in a revised version of the manuscript, we will discuss the implication of our approach for the context of trace conditioning. The model we presented hinges on the learning-induced plasticity of KC-to-MBON synapses recruited during the learning window (i.e., the simulated US arrival). In the case of trace conditioning, the model predicts that the time of the behavioral response time should match the expected US arrival. Contrary to this prediction, preliminary analyses on empirical measurements of PER latency upon trace conditioning indicate this is not the case. In a revised version of the manuscript, we will discuss the differences between the predictions of the model and the experimental observations in a trace conditioning paradigm.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>The study presented by Paoli et al. explores temporal aspects of neuronal encoding of odors and their perception, using bees as a general model for insects. The neuronal encoding of the presence of an odor is not a static representation; rather, its neuronal representation is partly encoded by the temporal order in which parallel olfactory pathways participate and are combined. This aspect is not novel, and its relevance in odor encoding and recognition has been discussed for more than the past 20 years.</p><p>The temporal richness of the olfactory code and its significance have traditionally been driven by results obtained based on electrophysiological methods with temporal resolution, allowing the identification and timing of the action potentials in the different populations of neurons whose combination encodes the identity of an odor. On the other hand, optophysiological methods that enable spatial resolution and cell identification in odor coding lack the temporal resolution to appreciate the intricacies of olfactory code dynamics.</p><p>(1) In this context, the main merit of Paoli et al.'s work is achieving an optical recording that allows for spatial registration of olfactory codes with greater temporal detail than the classical method and, at the same time, with greater sensitivity to measure inhibitions as part of the olfactory code.</p><p>The work clearly demonstrates how the onset and offset of odor stimulation triggers a dynamic code at the level of the first interneurons of the olfactory system that changes at every moment as a natural consequence of the local inhibitory interactions within the first olfactory neuropil, the antennal lobe. This gives rise to the interesting theory that each combination of activated neurons along this temporal sequence corresponds to the perception of a different odor. The extent to which the corresponding postsynaptic layers integrate this temporal information to drive the perception of an odor, or whether this sequence is, in a sense, a journey through different perceptions, is challenging to address experimentally.</p><p>In their work, the authors propose a computational approach and olfactory learning experiments in bees to address these questions and evaluate whether the sequence of combinations drives a sequence of different perceptions. In my view, it is a highly inspiring piece of work that still leaves several questions unanswered.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for considering that our work has an inspiring nature. Below we have tried to answer the questions raised by the following comments, and we will include part of these answers in the revised version of our manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) In my opinion, the detailed temporal profile of the response of projection neurons and their respective probabilities of occurrence provide valuable information for understanding odor coding at the level of neurons transferring information from the antennal lobes to the mushroom bodies. An analysis of these probabilities in each animal, rather than in the population of animals that were measured, would aid in better comprehending the encoding function of such temporal profiles. Being able to identify the involved glomeruli and understanding the extent to which the sequence of patterns and inhibitions is conserved for each odor across different animals, as it is well known for the initial excitatory burst of activity observed in previous studies without the fine temporal detail, would also be highly significant.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for recognizing the relevance of the findings in understanding the logic of olfactory coding. We agree about the importance of establishing if the different glomerular response profiles are evenly distributed across individuals or have individual biases. In the revised version of the manuscript, we will provide data on the distribution of response profiles for each animal and for different olfactory stimuli. Also, we fully agree on the importance of assessing to what extent such response profiles - largely determined by the local network of AL interneurons - are glomerulus-specific and conserved across individuals.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In my view, the computational approach serves as a useful tool to inspire future experiments; however, it appears somewhat simplistic in tackling the complexity of the subject. One question that I believe the researchers do not address is to what extent the inhibitions recorded in the projection neurons are integrated by the Kenyon cells and are functional for generating odor-specific patterns at that level.</p></disp-quote><p>The model we proposed represents, indeed, a simplification of olfactory signal processing throughout the honey bee olfactory circuit. Still, it shows that simple but realistic rules can be sufficient to grasp some fundamental aspects of olfactory coding. However, we agree with the reviewer and believe that such a minimalistic model can provide a basis for designing future experiments in which complexity can be increased by adding relevant features, such as the learning-induced plasticity of PN-to-KC synapses or the divergence of multiple PNs from the same glomerulus to different KCs.</p><p>Concerning the reviewer's question on the involvement of inhibitory inputs in generating odor-specific patterns at the level of the KCs, the short answer is yes, they contribute to the summed input of a target KC, thus to the odor representation. In designing the model, we considered that a given glomerulus provides maximal input at maximal excitation and minimal input (=0 input) at maximal inhibition. For this reason, an inhibited glomerulus contributes less (to KC action potential probability) than a glomerulus showing baseline activity. This, in turn, contributes less than an excited glomerulus. From the modeling point of view, normalizing the signal between 0 and 1 (i.e., setting minimal inhibition to 0 and maximal excitation to 1) would yield a similar result as with the current approach, where values range from -25% to +30% ΔF/F. We implement the model's description to clarify this point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Lastly, the behavioral result indicating a difference in conditioned response latency after early or delayed learning protocol is interesting. However, it does not align with the expected time for the neuronal representation that was theoretically rewarded in the delayed protocol. This final result does not support the authors' interpretation regarding the existence of a smell and an after-smell as separate percepts that can serve as conditioned stimuli.</p></disp-quote><p>Considering that our odor stimulus lasted 5 seconds, glomerular activity is highly variable at odor onset (i.e., within the first 1s) because of short excitatory response profiles and the delayed and slower onset of inhibitory responses. After the initial phase, the neural representation of the stimulus becomes more stable. Consequently, a neural signature learned in the case of delay conditioning, i.e., with the US appearing towards the end of the olfactory stimulation (t = 4 - 5s), may present itself much earlier (t = 1.5s), triggering a behavioral response that largely anticipates the expected US arrival time.</p><p>In the model, we observe an early decrease in action potential probability even in the case of delay conditioning. This occurs because the synapses recruited during the last second of olfactory stimulation (within the learning window during which CS and US overlap) become inactive. Because odorant-induced activity recruits highly overlapping synaptic populations between 1.5 and 5 s from the onset, a learning-induced inactivation of part of these synapses will result in a reduced action-potential probability in the modeled MBON. Importantly, this event will not be governed by time but by the appearance of the learned synaptic configuration.</p><p>We will add a new section to the revised version of the manuscript to clarify this concept and perform further analyses to characterize the contribution of different response types to the modeled response latency.</p></body></sub-article></article>
