public health challenge and is the leading cause of death and disability worldwide, including in China (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Mortality and Death, 2016</xref>). Ischemic heart disease (IHD), ischemic stroke (IS), and intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) accounted for the majority of the deaths caused by CVD, which becomes more and more serious as the aggravation of population aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Mortality and Death, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Wang et al., 2017</xref>). In recent decades, with the concern about the burden of CVD, researchers not only focus on the modifiable risk factors, including smoking, drinking, physical activity, and diet, but also pay more and more attention to the internal biological mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Virani et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boehme et al., 2017</xref>). Plasma lipids, especially low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) which may accumulate in the arterial wall, gradually form atherosclerotic plaques and block the corresponding artery, is generally considered to be associated with risks of IHD, IS, and ICH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Varbo and Nordestgaard, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arora et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Sun et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Eggs are one of the richest sources of dietary cholesterol, but they also contain a wide variety of essential nutrients and bioactive compounds, such as high-quality protein, fat-soluble and B vitamins, phospholipids, and choline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andersen, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Blesso, 2015</xref>). Evidence for the association between eggs and CVD remains controversial in both observational and prospective studies based on Western populations, with positive association being reported in some studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Zhong et al., 2019</xref>) and others finding no significant association (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Shin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Guo et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Drouin-Chartier et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dehghan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Rong et al., 2013</xref>). Similar controversial findings have been found in the Chinese population. An inverse association between egg consumption and CVD risk was published,<sup>[16]</sup> whereas more (&gt;10 eggs per week) and less (&lt;1 per week) egg intake was found to be harmful to cardiovascular health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Xia et al., 2020</xref>). With regret, few studies have assessed the role of individual plasma cholesterol levels in such association, making the association clearer. On the other hand, Lipoproteins can be divided into large, medium and small subclasses according to particle size and include a series of constituents including cholesterol, phospholipids, triglycerides, and apolipoprotein which is difficult for conventional approaches to quantitate. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) metabolomics provides a new opportunity to explore the associations between exposure, diseases and lipoprotein and other small-molecule metabolic markers in a more detailed perspective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Nagana Gowda and Raftery, 2019</xref>).</p><p>The present study selected a targeted NMR-based metabolomics platform that previous large-scale studies have widely used, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Würtz et al., 2017</xref>) covering 14 lipoproteins and their subfractions with different densities and particle sizes, as well as other fatty acids, amino acids, and ketone-body-related metabolites. We aimed to simultaneously explore the associations of self-reported egg consumption with these metabolic markers, and of these markers with CVD risk in a nested case-control study in the China Kadoorie Biobank (CKB).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Participants and study design</title><p>The CKB study was a prospective cohort of 512,725 participants aged 30–79 years from 5 urban and 5 rural areas across China. Participants were recruited between 2004 and 2008, whose morbidity and mortality have been followed up ever since. A laptop-based questionnaire was used to collect detailed information, including demographic characteristics (e.g. age at recruitment, sex, education, household income, and marital status), lifestyle factors (e.g. smoking and drinking habits, food intake, and physical activities), medical history (e.g. hypertension, diabetes, and use of certain specific medications such as statins), and family history of diabetes, heart attack or stroke. Each participant also underwent a range of physical measurements operated by trained staff, including anthropometry, lung function, blood pressure, and heart rate, etc. All participants provided a 10 mL non-fasting (with time since last meal recorded) blood sample for immediate on-site random blood glucose (RBG) test and long-term storage. In addition, every 5 years after completing the baseline survey, about 5% of the participants were randomly selected to join in the re-survey.

Cases consisted of incident cases of myocardial infarction (MI, ICD-10 I21-23, n=946), IS (I63 and I69.3, n=1,217), and ICH (I61 and I69.1, n=1,238), with a censoring date of January 01, 2015. And 1377 controls were frequently matched to the combined cases by age, sex, and area if possible. All cases and controls had no history of self-reported prior doctor-diagnosed coronary heart disease (CHD), stroke, transient ischemic attack, or cancer, and were not using statin therapy at baseline. The Ethical Review Committee of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (Beijing, China, 005/2004) and the Oxford Tropical Research Ethics Committee, University of Oxford (UK, 025–04) approved the study.

Possible answers were ‘never/rarely, monthly, 1–3 days per week, 4–6 days per week, and daily’. The frequency was then converted into days of egg consumption per week, with each option corresponding to 0, 0.5, 2, 5, and 7 days per week, respectively. Participants were also asked about the daily amount when consuming eggs at the 2nd re-survey (2013–2014).</p><p>A separate validation study was conducted from 2015–2016 among 432 CKB participants to evaluate the reproducibility and validity of FFQ.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Qin et al., 2022</xref> It turned out that the weighted Kappa statistic was 0.77 and 0.65 for reproducibility and relative validity of baseline eggs frequency, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Measurement of NMR metabolisms</title><p>After centrifuging and aliquoting, baseline plasma samples from each participant were couriered from the regional laboratory via Beijing to Oxford for long-term storage in liquid nitrogen tanks.

The former was used to monitor the consistency of quantifications, whereas the latter was a technical reference to monitor the performance of the automated liquid handler and the spectrometer. Barcoding was preferred for sample identification, and all the liquid handling steps were done with an automated workstation. The spectral information underwent various comparisons with the spectra of the two quality control samples. Regression modeling was performed to produce the quantified molecular data for those spectral areas that passed all the quality control steps.</p><p>Samples from cases and controls were quantified randomly, with laboratory staff blinded to case or control status.

In addition, participants were stratified by sex, age group (&lt;60 y or ≥60 y), region (10 regions) and egg consumption group (never/rarely, monthly, 1–3 d/w, 4–6 d/w, or daily), and the mean values of amount on days when consuming eggs for each stratum collected in the 2nd re-survey among 23,974 participants was calculated as a proxy to estimate the amount of egg consumption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Qin et al., 2018</xref>).

The results showed that egg consumption was positively associated with apolipoprotein A1, acetate, mean particle diameter of HDL, as well as lipid profiles in very large and large HDL including lipoprotein particle diameters, total lipids, total cholesterol, cholesterol esters, free cholesterol, and phospholipids. In contrast, inverse associations were observed in cholesterol esters in small VLDL, and the ratio of apolipoprotein B to apolipoprotein A1. Moreover, most of these metabolic markers were found to be inversely associated with the risk of CVD. On the whole, 225 metabolic markers showed a pattern. That is, their association with egg consumption and CVD risk were directionally opposite. Our results explained the protective effect of egg consumption on CVD risk through metabolism in the Chinese population.</p><p>Results from previous observational studies describing the association between egg consumption and CVD risk are inconsistent. However, few studies have focused on plasma lipid metabolites between such associations so far. Some studies examined the metabonomics characteristics of plasma or feces in a wide range of food groups, including eggs, but had not shown much interest in lipid metabolites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Guertin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Mitry et al., 2019</xref>). Other studies combined eggs with other foods, such as ham, as a feed intervention to investigate consumers' metabolomics characteristics, but the results can not reflect the metabolite changes caused by egg consumption alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Rådjursöga et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Rådjursöga et al., 2017</xref>). This also gives expression to the necessity and urgency of the present study.</p><p>Even so, a number of studies and meta-analyses have explored the conventional lipids associated with egg consumption using blood biochemical analyses. Recently, a cohort study based on 39,021 overnight fasting adults in China collected egg consumption data and blood lipids biochemical analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Liu et al., 2020</xref>). It was found that compared with the low egg consumption group (&lt;26.79 g/d), medium or high consumption tertiles (&gt;26.79 g/d) had higher levels of HDL-C, which was in line with the present study. It is worth noting that the mediating analysis of that study found that BMI or waist circumference (WC) could partly explain the association between egg consumption and HDL-C. The present study also supported the hypothesis according to sensitivity analysis, in which the associations were no longer significant by additional adjustment of BMI.</p><p>Consistent with our results, three small intervention studies based on Americans or Japanese observed positive effects for HDL-C and apolipoprotein A1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kishimoto et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Missimer et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Lemos et al., 2018</xref>). In addition, a meta-analysis of 66 eligible randomized clinical trials (RCT) involving 3,185 participants found a non-linear effect for VLDL-C, showing inverse association at the egg consumption level corresponding to the present study (&lt;1.5 eggs/day) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Khalighi Sikaroudi et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>The debate over egg consumption centered on its effect on cholesterol metabolism. In our study, there was no significant association between egg consumption and lipoprotein in other sizes or densities except small VLDL, very large, and large HDL. To some extent, this reflected the balance between dietary cholesterol absorption and endogenous cholesterol biosynthesis, which accounts for about 25% and 75%, respectively, varying with different food consumption habits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blesso and Fernandez, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Lütjohann et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Kim and Campbell, 2018</xref>). HDL is widely believed to be cardiovascular-friendly lipoproteins responsible for binding and esterifying cholesterol in other tissues for subsequent excretion. The present study suggests that moderate egg consumption increases large HDL levels without altering triglyceride-rich lipoproteins. This mechanism may improve cholesterol metabolic characteristics, thus observing the protective effect on cardiovascular.</p><p>Our study provides substantial evidence for the recommendation of appropriate egg consumption in current dietary guidelines in China. The Dietary Guidelines for Chinese Residents recommended that each standard adult should eat 40–50 g eggs a day without discarding the yolk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Wang et al., 2016</xref>). However, according to the China Statistical Yearbook, the average egg purchase by Chinese residents in 2019 was 10.7 kilograms, or about 29.3 grams per day, which can be a partial estimate of actual consumption. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Statistics NBo, 2020</xref> Although this number has increased over the past decade, it still falls short of dietary guidelines. Hence, more health education and health promotion strategies and policies to encourage moderate egg consumption need to be developed to improve lipid metabolite characteristics in the Chinese population, contributing to CVD prevention.</p><p>This study based on the CKB population has many strengths, including relatively large sample size, accurately identified CVD and its subtype events, collection of as many covariates as possible, and the quantification of a wide range of metabolites based on NMR platform, such as lipoproteins and their constituents with varies of size, density, and chemical structure. Besides, the present study restricted the analysis to those free of CVD history and lipid-lowering therapy to minimize the possible confounding or even causal inversion of hypercholesterolemic participants. Our study also had several limitations. First, similar to other large-scale nutritional epidemiological studies, there was an unavoidable recall bias in the FFQ used for estimating egg and other food consumption in our study. There was also measurement bias when five options were used to estimate the weekly days of egg consumption. However, the results of our study were similar to those of previous observational studies or intervention studies, and these results remained robust when the imputed weekly amount of egg consumption was used as the independent variable. Second, even if potential confounding factors such as BMI, frequency of other food consumption, history of chronic diseases, and family history were adjusted in multivariate models or sensitivity analysis, residual confounding due to uncollected or suboptimally collected factors still existed. Third, as the weekly egg consumption of the present study (less than 2 eggs per day) was relatively lower compared with other studies, it is necessary to be cautious when concluding beyond this range. Finally, given the cross-sectional nature, the associations between baseline egg consumption and baseline level of plasma metabolites did not strongly elucidate their causality. Further longitudinal studies are needed to verify the causal roles of lipid metabolites in the association between egg consumption and CVD risk.</p><sec id="s4-1"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This study set in the Chinese population found significant associations between egg consumption and acetate, lipid-related metabolites within very large and large HDL and small VLDL, and found that these associations were directionally opposite to associations between these metabolites and risk of CVD. These results we reported not only potentially reveal at the small molecule level that lipid metabolism metabolites may play a role in the beneficial effects of egg consumption on CVD, but also provide Chinese population-based evidence for the formulation of strategies and policies to encourage moderate egg consumption.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Access to research materials/Data sharing</title><p>Details of how to access China Kadoorie Biobank data and details of the data release schedule are available from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ckbiobank.org/site/Data+Access">https://www.ckbiobank.org/site/Data+Access</ext-link>.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Visualization, Writing - original draft, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Methodology, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Investigation, Methodology, Project administration, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Investigation, Methodology, Project administration, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Methodology, Project administration, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con11"><p>Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con12"><p>Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con13"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Investigation, Methodology, Project administration, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con14"><p>Data curation, Methodology, Project administration, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con15"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Methodology, Project administration, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con16"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Project administration, Writing - review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Human subjects: The Ethical Review Committee of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (Beijing, China, 005/2004) and the Oxford Tropical Research Ethics Committee, University of Oxford (UK, 025-04) approved the study.

In brief, the China Kadoorie Biobank (CKB) is being conducted jointly by the Clinical Trial Service Unit (CTSU), Nuffield Department of Population Health, University of Oxford, and Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences (CAMS) in Beijing. Requesters should be employees of a recognized academic institution, health service organization, or charitable research organization with experience in medical research. Requestors should be able to demonstrate, through their peer-reviewed publications in the area of interest, their ability to carry out the proposed study. After registration, details of the required information are provided on the CKB Data Access System. The CKB Access Team will review and respond to data requests within 6-8 weeks. In order to explain more clearly, all the variables required for the analysis of this study are as follows: 1. Background: Basic [Baseline, 1st resurvey, 2nd resurvey], Demographics [Baseline]; 2.

The current study did not consider the difference between hypercholesterolemia patients and participants without hypercholesterolemia. Diagnosed hypercholesterolemia patients preferred to eat less egg, which is the richest source of dietary cholesterol as the authors mentioned. Hypercholesterolemia patients also had a higher risk of cardiovascular diseases. The potential bias should be considered.</p></disp-quote><p>The authors genuinely understand the reviewers' concern. Before analysis, the possible confounding or even causal inversion of hypercholesterolemic participants was carefully considered. Therefore, we restricted the study to those with no history of CVD and did not take lipid-lowering therapy (line 116-118). The plasma metabolomics assays showed that the average cholesterol level of the 4,778 participants was 3.52±0.61 mmol/L, whose 99% quantile was 5.33 mmol/L. Even at the cut-off point of 5.72 mmol/l, only 20 participants exceeded it, and 14 of them were not fasting for 8 hours. Therefore, in conclusion, we believe that the present study has avoided the confusion caused by hypercholesterolemia as much as possible. Hopefully, this will allay the reviewers' well-meaning concern.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Whether all the dietary assessments of participants in this study had reliable quality? The authors do not address the information about the exclusion of any unreliable dietary questionnaires.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate and understand the reviewer's concern. The present study was as quality-assured as possible on multiple fronts in assessing the participants' habitual dietary intake, added in the Method section of our revised manuscript (line 122-123, 130-133).</p><p>First, trained investigators administered the face-to-face laptop-based FFQ with a picture booklet as a reference. Moreover, the laptop used logical warnings to avoid unreasonable answers. For instance, if a participant reported that he never ate any staple food each week, the laptop would pop up a window to double-check. Besides, a separate validation study was conducted from 2015 to 2016 among 432 CKB participants to evaluate the reproducibility and validity of FFQ.<sup>[1]</sup> It turned out that the weighted Kappa statistic was 0.77 and 0.65 for reproducibility and relative validity of baseline eggs frequency, respectively.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Based on the results of this study, eggs could be a component in a healthy diet. However, the current evidence of egg consumption based on observational studies was not consistent. It is not appropriate to appeal for more health education and health promotion strategies and policies to encourage egg consumption.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers. In a context where the cardiovascular health effects of egg consumption are still controversial, it is inappropriate, and not the authors' intention, to simply say that egg consumption should be encouraged.</p><p>The weekly egg consumption of the present study (&lt;2/d) was relatively lower in Chinese population compared with other studies. As the authors pointed out in the Discussion section, the Dietary Guidelines for Chinese Residents recommend moderate eggs (40-50g/d without discarding the yolk), given their nutritional and controversial nature. Even so, using the purchasing amount in the China Statistical Yearbook as an approximation, Chinese residents' egg consumption (~29g/d) is far from the recommended level. Therefore, given this situation and based on the results of our study, we mentioned encouraging moderate egg consumption.</p><p>According to the reviewers' suggestion, the revised manuscript mainly clarifies two points. First, we emphasized &quot;moderate&quot; egg consumption to the basic recommended level, rather than simply encouraging without limit (line 287, 294, and 324). Second, we called for cautions when drawing conclusions at a higher egg consumption level (line 310-312).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. How did you select the targeted 225 metabolites? Please provide sufficient information in the Introduction section.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for asking this question. As expressed in the Introduction section, controversy over egg consumption centered on its effects on circulating lipid metabolites, which had not been systematically assessed. Therefore, we were more interested in lipid-related biomarkers in the egg-metabolite-CVD chain. We selected a targeted NMR-based metabolomics platform that previous large-scale studies have widely used,<sup>[2]</sup> covering 14 lipoproteins and their subfractions with different densities and particle sizes, as well as other fatty acids, amino acids, and ketone-body-related metabolites. We expected this platform to provide as much biomarker information as possible for the present study. The above has been added in line 88-91.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. The study analyzed the associations between plasma metabolic markers and the risk of overall CVD, and three subtypes. Baseline characteristics of these three subtypes should be displayed correspondingly.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this kind reminder. The revised manuscript had displayed the baseline characteristics of these three subtypes and controls separately in Table 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. Cigarette smoking is a strong confounder and should be adjusted in detail.</p></disp-quote><p>The authors entirely agree with the reviewer's opinion and consider smoking status one of the critical confounding factors. We want to clarify that according to the frequency, type, and quantity of smoking obtained from the questionnaire, smoking status was converted into a categorical variable (5 categories: never or occasional smoker, former smoker, ≤10 cigarettes, ≤20 cigarettes, or more per day) in the basic model of the present study (added at line 170-171). Through this detailed classification, rather than a binary variable, we hope to avoid as much confusion as possible from smoking status. Similarly, detailed information on other covariates was also added in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. The quality control procedures and rejection criteria need to be included in the Methods section.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for the professional advice on metabolomics assays. In order to make NMR metabolomics quality control procedures more transparent, we cited an article that detailedly described these procedures<sup>[3]</sup> and added brief information in the Method section of the revised manuscript, including liquid handling, quality control samples, sample identification, and so on (line 142-149).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. You have imputed concentrations under LOD with the lowest available concentration, which may lead to underestimation. More widely used approaches, such as imputations using 0 or lowest/2, should be tried.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that the imputation method of missing values under LOD may affect the study results. The replacement with a nonzero value is widely used, including minimum, mean, or median values between 0 and the detection limit, none of which has been proven perfect. Theoretically, given the high detection rate in the present study (only 0.8% of concentrations in total were under LOD), the imputation method is unlikely to overturn the results. Even so, the authors tried to reanalyze using the half minimum method at the reviewers' suggestion. The results showed that the metabolites associated with egg consumption remained essentially unchanged, although the three lipid ratios were no longer statistically significant after FDR correction (FDR-<italic>p</italic> was 0.11, 0.07, and 0.09, respectively).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9. In table 1, what does the content in parentheses after the percentage of some categorical variables mean, such as age, female and ow/ob, etc.? Please indicate this in the table notes. Besides, some continuous variables, such as BMI, SBP and Physical activity, etc., are not shown the standard errors.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank the reviewers for pointing it out. The authors apologize for our carelessness. We rechecked Table 1, which showed continuous variables as the means (with SEs in parentheses) while categorical variables as percentages.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10. The standard errors of some variables, including BMI and SBP, should be added in Table 1.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this reminder. In revised Table 1, all continuous variables' standard errors (SE) had been added.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11. In line 145, detailed information on covariables should be described. For instance, how is raw data converted into categorical variables?</p></disp-quote><p>Based on suggestions from reviewers, detailed information on covariables was added in the Method section of our revised manuscript (line 162-174).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12). The possible mechanism of how egg intake affects metabolites and further protects CVD needs to be discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>The authors appreciate and fully agree with the reviewers' suggestion. Based on the body's balance of endogenous and exogenous metabolites, as well as the biological function of HDL, the hypothesis that moderate egg consumption improves circulating cholesterol metabolism was added in the Discussion section (line 277-286), given the observed rising levels of large HDL but not triglyceride-rich lipoprotein in the present study.</p><p>References</p><p>1.
