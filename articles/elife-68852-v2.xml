manipulations that affect the brain’s capacity for plasticity will inform the design of targeted interventions that enhance recovery after stroke. Following stroke, increased contralesional activity (e.g. use of the unaffected limb) can negatively influence recovery, but it is unknown which specific neural connections exert this influence, and to what extent increased contralesional activity affects systems- and molecular-level biomarkers of recovery. Here, we combine optogenetic photostimulation with optical intrinsic signal imaging to examine how contralesional excitatory activity affects cortical remodeling after stroke in mice. Following photothrombosis of left primary somatosensory forepaw (S1FP) cortex, mice either recovered spontaneously or received chronic optogenetic excitation of right S1FP over the course of 4 weeks. Contralesional excitation suppressed perilesional S1FP remapping and was associated with abnormal patterns of stimulus-evoked activity in the unaffected limb. This maneuver also prevented the restoration of resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) within the S1FP network, RSFC in several networks functionally distinct from somatomotor regions, and resulted in persistent limb-use asymmetry. In stimulated mice, perilesional tissue exhibited transcriptional changes in several genes relevant for recovery. Our results suggest that contralesional excitation impedes local and global circuit reconnection through suppression of cortical activity and several neuroplasticity-related genes after stroke, and highlight the importance of site selection for targeted therapeutic interventions after focal ischemia.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>stroke

circuits and indirect functional damage to global networks resulting in behavioral deficits spanning multiple domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Murphy and Corbett, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Baldassarre et al., 2016</xref>). In the months following stroke, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have shown that local circuits lost to infarction remodel in peri-infarct cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Cramer and Riley, 2008</xref>). This process, termed ‘remapping’, appears to be tightly focused to perilesional regions in patients exhibiting good recovery, and suggests that peri-infarct cortex may take over the function of brain regions lost to stroke (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Brown et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Dijkhuizen et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Nudo et al., 1996</xref>). Similar studies examining brain-wide patterns of synchronized, resting-state, hemodynamic activity after stroke have shown that global patterns of resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) are also altered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Posner et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Felleman and Van Essen, 1991</xref>). Shortly after ischemic stroke, disruption of interhemispheric homotopic RSFC predicts poor motor and attentional recovery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Carter et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">He et al., 2007</xref>), and in rats, restoration of homotopic RSFC correlates with improved behavioral performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">van Meer et al., 2010</xref>). Similarly, we have shown in mice that functional disruption correlates with infarct size, regional RSFC disruption, the degree of remapping, and behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Kraft et al., 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bauer et al., 2014</xref>). While functional neuroimaging studies consistently demonstrate local and global changes in functional brain organization after stroke, it is unknown how these processes inter-relate to support recovery of function.</p><p>Activity in brain regions functionally connected to perilesional tissue can differentially affect recovery potential. In monkeys, the use of the affected limb is required for remapping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Nudo et al., 1996</xref>), and conversely, overactivation of the contralateral hemisphere through the use of the ‘good limb’ is associated with poorer clinical outcome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Turton et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Feydy et al., 2002</xref>). Additionally, there is substantial indirect evidence that homotopic, interhemispheric connections may directly impact recovery after stroke. Stroke patients with impaired hand movement experience abnormally high interhemispheric inhibition exerted from intact contralesional motor cortex to perilesional motor cortex, with the degree of inhibition increasing with deficit severity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Nudo, 2007</xref>). It is thought that an equilibrium between excitation/inhibition across hemispheres may be important for normal unilateral function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Bloom and Hynd, 2005</xref>). If the interhemispheric balance is disrupted (e.g. by stroke) local ipsilesional inhibitory influences from distant connections may worsen functional impairment. Prior human studies have primarily used non-invasive brain stimulation techniques (e.g. repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation [rTMS]) to investigate the role of contralateral activity on the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Nowak et al., 2010</xref>). However, treatment efficacy using these methods is extremely varied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Takeuchi et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Nowak et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adeyemo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Hao et al., 2013</xref>) and are limited by imprecision and indiscriminate activation or inhibition of all cell types near the stimulated site. Thus, it has been difficult to systematically examine the influence of specific neuronal populations and connection pathways important for recovery in human stroke patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Nudo, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Takatsuru et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Takatsuru et al., 2014</xref>). Optogenetics is a powerful approach for increasing the specificity of paradigms designed to modulate local and distant neural activity after experimental stroke (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Cheng et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Wahl et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Song et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Tennant et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Shah et al., 2017</xref>). The aim of this study was to determine if local circuits lost due to stroke in mice remap into perilesional cortex and reconnect with global functional circuits (i.e. resting-state networks), and if this process could be manipulated (spatially and temporally) by contralesional, homotopic excitation. Given that contralateral limb use suppresses recovery, we hypothesized that optogenetically exciting the contralesional cortex would likewise inhibit recovery. To mechanistically examine whether increased contralesional homotopic excitatory activity worsens recovery, we chose to lesion somatosensory forepaw cortex because this modality is amenable to tracking cortical remapping of sensory evoked responses in tandem with local and global network activity. Our results suggest that limited, focal excitation of contralesional cortex impedes perilesional remapping and restoration of RSFC within the somatomotor network. Furthermore, this maneuver profoundly altered more global patterns of cortical activity outside of the targeted circuit as well as recovery of the brain’s global functional connectome. These observations were associated with regulation of several molecular pathways relevant for recovery after injury.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Study design</title><p>In this study, we used optogenetic targeting in conjunction with optical intrinsic signal imaging (OISI) in CamK2a-ChR2 mice (see Methods) to examine the effects of contralesional excitation on local and global cortical remodeling after focal ischemia.

Note that all cortical regions and manipulations are in reference to hemisphere (instead of limb to which a brain region is mapped). We performed photothrombosis targeted to left primary somatosensory forepaw (S1FP) cortex. A randomly selected subset of mice received chronic, intermittent contralesional excitation of right S1FP (+Stim) beginning day 1 after photothrombosis and continued for 5 consecutive days/week over 4 weeks. The remaining mice recovered spontaneously (−Stim). Assessments of behavior (via cylinder rearing) and brain function (via OISI) occurred before, and 1 and 4 weeks after stroke. A sham group controlled for the effects of chronic photostimulation of right S1FP cortex in the absence of stroke and were imaged at the same time points as the stroke groups.

Thus, it is essential to understand what processes might inhibit or interfere with spontaneous repair mechanisms. Increased activity in homotopic brain regions contralateral to the infarct is associated with poorer recovery in patients after stroke. However, this observation is highly inconsistent across subjects and the mechanisms underlying poorer recovery are unknown. The present work examines how contralesional, excitatory activity in homotopic brain regions functionally connected to the site of injury influences cortical reorganization and global activity after stroke. We show that functional recovery occurs in tandem with formation of new cortical representations of the affected limb, restoration of RSFC within the affected somatosensory network, and more global renormalization of functional networks outside of the lesioned territory. Focal excitation of contralesional cortex significantly suppressed these processes, and altered transcriptional changes in several genes important for recovery.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Better recovery is associated with more normalized patterns of activity in the affected circuit</title><p>Spontaneous recovery (i.e. in –Stim mice) was associated with new cortical representations of the right (affected) limb having an area of activation and response magnitude nearer to baseline levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>). Conversely, perilesional cortex in +Stim mice failed to remodel as completely and exhibited sustained reductions in evoked activity at week 4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and D</xref>). Stimulation of the left (unaffected) limb resulted in the opposite picture. Responses in –Stim mice were indistinguishable from baseline responses while those in +Stim mice exhibited increased activity in right S1FP and right M1FP that persisted over the 4 week recovery period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) consistent with disinhibition from the lesioned hemisphere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Mohajerani et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Shimizu et al., 2002</xref>). The occurrence of new cortical S1FP representations in –Stim mice was therefore associated with more normal patterns of evoked activity in the larger S1FP circuit. Chronic contralesional excitatory stimulation prevented the formation of new cortical representations of the affected limb, and resulted in abnormally large representations of the unaffected limb. In parallel with cortical remapping, we also observed that the presence of new cortical S1FP representations in –Stim mice was associated with restoration of RSFC amongst functionally homotopic brain regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). That is, regions of homotopic synchrony with right S1FP shift from their original territory in left S1FP to remapped left S1FP representations. New representations also exhibit similar patterns of RSFC with other brain regions formally connected to the lesioned territory (e.g. left motor). Thus, more complete recovery experienced by –Stim mice was also associated with the reestablishment of more synchronous intrinsic activity within the larger somatomotor network.</p><p>The occurrence of new cortical S1FP representations along with a restoration of balanced stimulus evoked activity and homotopic RSFC in the S1FP circuit suggests that cortical remapping of disconnections after stroke provides a clue to how local circuits reconnect with brain networks to facilitate behavior. Following focal ischemia, peri-infarct regions appear to undergo large-scale changes in neuronal response properties. For example, in both human and animal studies peri-infarct regions become more responsive to stimulation of somatomotor regions with which they are not typically associated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Brown et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Dijkhuizen et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Jaillard et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Nudo et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Wei et al., 2001</xref>). In rodents, peri-infarct remodeling correlates temporally with behavioral recovery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Brown et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Dijkhuizen et al., 2001</xref>), and behavioral deficits in rats can be reinstated by ablating these remapped regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Castro-Alamancos and Borrel, 1995</xref>), suggesting that remapped cortex assumes the function of brain regions lost to stroke. Re-establishing normal patterns of stimulus evoked or resting-state activity appears essential for regaining function. Brain networks returning toward more normal patterns of intrinsic organization after stroke (i.e. restored homotopic RSFC) also exhibit more normalized patterns of activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Brown et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Dijkhuizen et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Rehme et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Grefkes et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Allegra Mascaro et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Kozlowski et al., 1996</xref>). Abnormal intrinsic brain rhythms that give rise to abnormally strong patterns of task activation result in reduced variability of motor patterns after stroke (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Ramsey et al., 2016</xref>). Abnormal brain activity could reflect an attempt to link, albeit inefficiently, regions that are disconnected, either by increasing neural activity upstream of the lesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Tennant et al., 2017</xref>) or by rerouting activity through accessory regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Ramsey et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Mohajerani et al., 2011</xref>). Intermittent contralesional excitatory stimulation could exacerbate these processes.</p><p>We find that reconnection between remodeled cortex and homotopic brain regions parallels global network renormalization, this implies that these processes are both required for proper recovery. Recent mouse work probing causal relationships between local neural stimulation and recovery of specific (sensorimotor) behaviors further support the idea that more normal patterns of activity are associated with better behavior. For example, photostimulation of the ipsilateral primary motor cortex in transgenic Thy1-ChR2 mice promoted functional recovery and a return to normal patterns of optogenetically evoked perfusion changes in perilesional cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Cheng et al., 2014</xref>). In a separate study, optogenetic stimulation of thalamocortical axons also promoted the formation of new and stable thalamocortical synaptic boutons, which was correlated with enhanced recovery of somatosensory cortical circuit activity and forepaw sensorimotor performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Tennant et al., 2017</xref>). Complementing these previous studies showing targeted photostimulation can improve recovery, our study adds nuance to the importance of site selection for therapeutic intervention by highlighting regions that suppress recovery.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Increased contralesional activity negatively affects global network interactions</title><p>Ischemic stroke results in direct structural damage to local brain networks but also to functional damage to global networks outside of the lesioned territory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Murphy and Corbett, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Carrera and Tononi, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Baldassarre et al., 2016</xref>).

ROI-based RSFC analysis of the somatomotor network shows clear changes in network synchrony over the 4 week recovery period in –Stim mice (top row, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) that were not observed in +Stim mice (bottom row, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Beyond increased RSFC between right and remapped left S1FP at week 4, right S1FP exhibits higher RSFC with right M1FP and with regions anterior to the infarct in motor cortex. Supporting this qualitative observation, maps of node degree in –Stim mice indicate that large portions of motor and sensory cortices exhibit more functional connections than +Stim mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). Additionally, regions well outside of direct injury (e.g. visual, retrosplenial) also exhibit changes in functional connection number. These data suggest that both local and distant networks are altered after stroke, and that the degree to which these networks recover is impaired by increased contralesional stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2C</xref>). However, these findings do not offer insights into the effect of increased contralesional activity on evolving internetwork interactions during recovery. To characterize global network interactions, we examined all pairwise RSFC over the cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Unexpectedly, several brain regions underwent dramatic changes in RSFC structure. In –Stim mice, parietal, visual, and retrosplenial cortices all exhibited increased homotopic RSFC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C, D and G</xref>) compared to +Stim mice. Furthermore, +Stim mice exhibited significant reductions in the magnitude of anticorrelations between functionally opposed networks residing within anterior (M1 and M2) and posterior (ret, V1p) cortices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B, D and G</xref>). Dynamic patterns of anticorrelated activity segregate distinct processing streams across networks during both task and resting-state paradigms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Fox et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Greicius et al., 2003</xref>). In humans, the most prominent example occurs between the dorsal attention network and default mode network. Altered synchrony across large cortical distances (&gt;several mm), as observed by reduced anticorrelated activity in +Stim mice at week 4, could prevent inter-network communication necessary for normal function. Reduced node degree in +Stim mice might indicate network-level inefficiencies, exemplified by more asynchronous intrinsic activity within these networks. We have recently shown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hakon et al., 2018</xref>) that improved tactile proprioception after stroke was associated with increased node degree in motor, somatosensory, and parietal cortices in mice, all regions relevant for processing proprioception and touch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Carey et al., 2016</xref>). Reduced within network connectivity (i.e. global node degree) combined with poorer interactions across networks (i.e. reduced anticorrelations) could impair multi-domain behavioral output in mice after stroke.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Contralesional stimulation alters transcriptional changes in genes important for recovery</title><p>Recovery from stroke is associated with neuronal and synaptic plasticity, the formation of new structural and functional connections that take over those lost due to infarction. These changes are likely to occur both locally (at the peri-infarct region) and at distant sites where changes in connectivity might occur (e.g. contralesional hemisphere). We examined changes in the expression of select genes associated with neuronal plasticity to determine if contralesional stimulation altered expression of genes associated with spontaneous recovery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). While changes in mRNA do not necessarily lead to proportional translation into protein, regulated transcripts do reflect potential involvement of the corresponding proteins in the regulation (activation or inhibition) of cellular processes in response to injury, plasticity, and/or intervention that could affect brain function. While distinct phases of plasticity occur over different time scales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Wieloch and Nikolich, 2006</xref>), good recovery of the peri-infarct is associated with upregulation of neurotrophic signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Stowe et al., 2007</xref>), growth-associated gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Carmichael et al., 2005</xref>), and markers of axonal formation/migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Benowitz and Carmichael, 2010</xref>) and synaptogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Murphy and Corbett, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Kraft et al., 2018</xref>). Some of these repair-related molecular changes are also observed in homologous, contralesional sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Cramer and Riley, 2008</xref>).</p><p>Our cumulative results suggest that spontaneous recovery following focal ischemia may be suppressed by chronic contralesional excitation. We used cluster analysis to determine if changes in neuroplasticity genes associated with spontaneous recovery (−Stim group) were suppressed by chronic contralesional excitation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Four groups were entered into the cluster analysis (ipsilesional and contralesional tissue in both groups). Hierarchical clustering revealed three distinct clusters that segregated patterns of gene expression. Functional recovery following small cortical lesions preferentially occurs in ipsilateral hemisphere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Biernaskie et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Shanina et al., 2006</xref>). Of particular interest were a collection of genes that demonstrated significant increased expression in ipsilesional cortical tissue in the –Stim group, but were suppressed in the +Stim group: BASP1, NPTX1, NPTX2, RTN4R, ARC, BDNF, SYP, and SLC1A2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). In line with these findings, we recently showed that remapping of forepaw cortex is dependent on activity-dependent synaptogenesis, and that blocking ARC-dependent remapping limited behavioral recovery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Kraft et al., 2018</xref>). NPTX1 and 2 mediate synaptic clustering of AMPA receptors, are implicated in synapse formation and maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Xu et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Pribiag and Stellwagen, 2014</xref>) and facilitate metabotropic glutamate receptor-mediated long-term depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Cho et al., 2008</xref>). Increased excitatory input from the contralesional hemisphere chronically after stroke appears to depress these repair-related molecular events.</p><p>Contralateral stimulation markedly downregulates genes coding for proteins involved in axonal sprouting. RTN4R forms part of a signaling complex (i.e. Nogo) that inhibits axonal growth and limits experience-dependent neural plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Schwab and Strittmatter, 2014</xref>) and BASP1 a growth-associated protein, that plays critical roles in synaptic plasticity and neurite outgrowth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Korshunova et al., 2008</xref>). In the post stroke axonal sprouting transcriptome, GDF10 is one of the most highly upregulated genes during the initiation of axonal sprouting in peri-infarct cortical neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Li et al., 2015</xref>). Despite a lack of remapping in +Stim mice, this group exhibited significantly increased expression of GDF10. New axonal growth and subsequent navigation likely require coordination amongst several molecular cues to ensure proper synaptic targeting.</p><p>Altering cell signaling, or modulating inhibitory or excitatory tone can profoundly affect recovery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Clarkson et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Clarkson et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kokinovic and Medini, 2018</xref>). The negative effect of contralesional excitation on recovery is thought to be due to increased perilesional inhibitory influences. While we did survey for markers of inhibition and excitation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>), most were not observed to be significantly altered between groups after correcting for multiple comparisons. However, stimulated mice did exhibit significant reduction in ipsilesional expression of GABABR1, a G protein-coupled receptor abundantly localized to glutamatergic synapses which regulates excitatory neurotransmission and synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ainsworth et al., 2016</xref>). Alone, focal ischemia results a loss of GABA B-mediated interhemispheric synaptic inhibition in stroke periphery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kokinovic and Medini, 2018</xref>). Sustained activation of glutamate receptors following focal ischemia leads to rapid downregulation of GABA B receptors via lysosomal degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Zemoura et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Maier et al., 2010</xref>). Stroke induced degradation of GABAB1 receptors could lead to the observed compensatory upregulation of GABBR1 transcript prevented by contralateral stimulation. Glutamate-induced downregulation of GABABR1 could lead to reduced inhibition of glutamatergic synapses, increasing synaptic excitability potentially to the point of increased excitotoxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Zemoura et al., 2016</xref>). While we did not observe group-wise differences in lesion volume, future studies are required to determine whether increasing ipsilesional inhibition during the recovery phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Hiu et al., 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Balbi et al., 2021</xref>) offsets the effects of contralesional excitation. It is also important to note, that the current analysis was performed at a single time point (14 days after stroke), during dynamically changing molecular environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Wieloch and Nikolich, 2006</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Interhemispheric influences on recovery and implications to clinical stroke</title><p>In one model of information exchange across hemispheres, excitatory information from one hemisphere conveyed by the corpus callosum activates inhibitory cells in the opposite hemisphere, thus inhibiting activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Palmer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Petrus et al., 2019</xref>).

Unilateral injury (e.g. stroke) modifies interhemispheric connectivity in such a way that disrupts the balance across hemispheres by decreasing the inhibitory influence of the affected hemisphere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Shimizu et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Xerri et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Carmichael, 2012</xref>). Non-invasive brain stimulation techniques, such as rTMS and tDCS (Transcranial Direct-Current Stimulation), have been used to influence rehabilitation after stroke by affecting this (Excitatory-Inhibitory) E/I balance. However, evidence supporting the clinical use of these techniques has been inconsistent. Some clinical trials have shown that these methods have a large, positive effect on motor recovery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adeyemo et al., 2012</xref>), while other studies were inconclusive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Hao et al., 2013</xref>). A portion of the variability in outcome is due to grouping patient populations with different types of strokes (ischemic vs hemorrhagic) and/or with lesions in different locations (cortical vs subcortical). Furthermore, the lack of refinement for spatial and cellular specificity, limits the use of rTMS and tDCS for examining specific populations of neurons or connections important for recovery.</p><p>Utilizing optogenetic targeting, we examine the role of contralesional, homotopic excitation on functional brain organization after stroke, a maneuver that might mimic the increased activity occurring during use of the unaffected limb. Sustained, increased activation of contralesional M1 using rTMS or through the use of the ‘good limb’ is associated with poorer clinical outcome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Turton et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Feydy et al., 2002</xref>), findings corroborated in rodent models and in other, non-motor systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Boonzaier et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Allred et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Allred et al., 2010</xref>). Our results indicate that even brief epochs of contralesional activity (3 min/day) during the repair phase after stroke is detrimental to recovery, possibly by extending an inhibitory influence well beyond the affected circuit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) and critical time-windows. Further, while acute imbalances in interhemispheric balance could be transient, chronic excitation could extend the period of imbalance. Increased global inhibition might interfere with local and distant network communication, which might result in the lack of reconnection of both local circuits lost due to stroke, and the subsequent reintegration of these circuits into global resting-state networks. It is important to point out that the role of the ipsilesional vs contralesional hemispheres on stroke recovery depends on the size and location of the infarct for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Keith et al., 2017</xref> and timing of rehabilitation can profoundly alter outcome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Kozlowski et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">AVERT Trial Collaboration group, 2015</xref>). Because structural and functional asymmetries persist in well-recovered stroke patients even after clinical symptoms have normalized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Julkunen et al., 2016</xref>), more systematic approaches are required to unravel causal influences for differences in outcome.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Limitations and future work</title><p>The design of the present study was intended to examine how early, chronic stimulation affected cortical remodeling after stroke. The duration of the experiment did not include time points when spontaneously recovering mice have been shown to exhibit more complete recovery, e.g. out to 8 weeks or longer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Brown et al., 2009</xref>). However, at 4 weeks, we see a clear divergence in patterns of local and global circuit repair. Our assessments of cortical remodeling and network reorganization were based on systems-level, hemoglobin-contrast-based measures of brain activity. Visualizing more direct measures of neural activity, e.g. through the use of genetically encoded calcium indicators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Gu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Brier et al., 2019</xref>), or voltage sensitive dyes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Mohajerani et al., 2011</xref>), would allow for examining evolving neural network interactions as they relate to behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Cramer et al., 2019</xref>) or evolving microvascular function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Lee et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Sakadžić et al., 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Sunil et al., 2020</xref>). Several unanswered questions remain regarding the choice of stimulation parameters, sites targeted, and neuronal subpopulations involved. For example, are the negative effects of increased contralesional activity most pronounced during a particular time window after injury? Would focal stimulation of cortical regions functionally distinct from the lesioned circuit (e.g. contralesional visual cortex) result in a similar negative influence on recovery? Are there specific excitatory or inhibitory subpopulations of neurons that have a particular influence on plasticity? These are exciting questions that we are currently exploring. Further work is also needed to disambiguate circuit specific roles that mediate the negative affect of contralesional stimulation on recovery. Right S1FP connects widely to several other cortical (e.g. S1, M1, and M2) and subcortical structures (e.g. striatum, thalamus, and midbrain, superior colliculus, and cerebellum) involved in integrating sensory information to coordinate motor output (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Oh et al., 2014</xref>). It is therefore possible that contralateral stimulation is impairing recovery, not through a direct effect of monosynaptic projections from contralesional to perilesional tissue, but by indirect modulation of cortical output (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Quiquempoix et al., 2018</xref>) or through descending projections. Future studies aimed at mapping brain wide activity (e.g. via fMRI or diffuse optical tomography [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Reisman et al., 2017</xref>]) following focal stimulation would help disambiguate a circuit specific role on recovery, and determine whether activity in the site stimulated is the main contributor to outcome. The limited scope of our RT-PCR analysis provided associations between expression of select neuroplasticity genes and systems level changes across groups post stroke. More complete evaluations of the post stroke transcriptome, and confirmation as to which genes and proteins are altered following contralesional stimulation will allow for a more complete understanding of how this maneuver affects cortical remodeling after stroke.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice</title><p>A total of 105 adult male mice expressing channelrhodopsin (ChR2) under the mouse calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II alpha (<italic>CamK2a</italic>) promoter were used for experimentation.

To create a measure of global inhibition, all pixels having a correlation coefficient below 0 were summed for each mouse at each time point.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Infarct quantification</title><p>Mice (n=5 –Stim and n=5 +Stim) were deeply anesthetized with FatalPlus (Vortech Pharmaceuticals, Michigan, USA) and transcardially perfused with heparinized PBS. The brains were removed and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 24 hr and transferred to 30% sucrose in PBS. After brains were saturated, they were snap-frozen on dry ice and coronally sectioned (50 μm thick slices spaced 300 μm apart) on a sliding microtome. After mounting, slices were allowed to dry for 24 hr and stained with cresyl violet, and cover slipped. Stained sections were imaged with a NanoZoomer under bright field setting and infarct area was quantified in ImageJ for each slice. Infarct volume was calculated as total infarct area × 300 μm. Statistical analyses were performed using Graph Pad Prism 8.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Brain extraction and RT-PCR</title><p>Mice (n=5 –Stim and n=5 +Stim) were deeply anesthetized with isoflurane and transcardially perfused with 0.01 M PBS. Brains were extracted, placed in a brain matrix, and coronal sections spanning from –0.5 mm posterior to bregma to 1 mm anterior to bregma were collected. Based on the approximate location of S1FP from the Paxinos atlas, tissue from the perilesional and contralesional regions were dissected, snap-frozen on dry ice, and stored at −80°C. Total RNA was extracted using RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) and reverse transcribed with the cDNA Reverse Transcription kit (Invitrogen). Quantitative PCR was performed with SYBR Green using the ABI QuantStudio 12 K Flex system in the default thermal cycling mode. Mouse GAPDH was used as a normalization reference. Relative mRNA levels were calculated using the comparative Ct method. Prior to clustering, expression levels of each gene were mean subtracted across groups and normalized to unit variance. RT-PCR analyses were performed using Microsoft Excel 2016 and MATLAB 2018a. Genes examined and primers used are tabulated in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Cylinder rearing</title><p>Cylinder rearing recording and analysis was done as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Baskin et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Kraft et al., 2018</xref>). Briefly, mice receiving photothrombosis were placed in a 1000 mL glass beaker and recorded for 5 min. A blinded observer manually analyzed videos to determine the amount of time that the (1) right paw, (2) left paw, or (3) both paws made contact with the glass walls. Paw-use asymmetry was calculated as (% left paw use – % right paw use)/(% left paw use + % right paw use). Mice having paw-use asymmetry at baseline greater than 50% for either limb were discarded from any subsequent analysis. Statistical analyses were performed using Graph Pad Prism 8.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>Statistical analyses were performed using either Graph Pad Prism 8 or Matlab 2018a. All Pearson-R values were converted to Fisher-Z values prior to statistical testing. Differences between stroke groups for imaging (e.g. pairwise RSFC) and behavioral measures were analyzed using 2-way rmANOVA. In the control group, differences across time were assessed using 1-way rmANOVA. For limited cases where data points from individual mice were missing, significant effects were analyzed using a LMM fit with a restricted maximum likelihood function. Equal variability of differences (i.e. sphericity) was not assumed, and degrees of freedom were adjusted using the Geisser and Greenhouse correction. Significant effects were evaluated post hoc; these and other pairwise comparisons were performed using a 2-tailed Student’s t-test assuming unequal group variance and corrected for multiple comparisons by controlling the FDR. Maps of statistical differences were corrected on a clusterwise basis. For all above tests, significance was achieved if (corrected) p&lt;0.05 except for RT-PCR (p&lt;0.1). The number of PCs used for data-driven ROI selection were determined from group-averaged, whole cortex correlation matrices. Extensive permutation resampling (3000 iterations) between groups was used to determine the amount of variance expected in the first two eigenvalues of the PCA decomposition in the null case. In the true eigenspectrum, PCs 1 and 2 (&gt;70% variance explained) exceeded the 90th percentile and were considered statistically significant.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Software, Visualization, Writing - original draft, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Formal analysis</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Formal analysis, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Data curation, Methodology, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Conceptualization, Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Visualization, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Project administration, Resources, Supervision, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Conceptualization, Funding acquisition, Resources, Supervision</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con11"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Project administration, Resources, Supervision, Writing - original draft, Writing - review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>All procedures described below were approved by the Washington University Animal Studies Committee in compliance with the American Association for Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care guidelines (Protocol #20-0022).</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>Genes surveyed for RT-PCR Analysis.</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-68852-supp1-v2.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="xlsx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="transrepform"><label>Transparent reporting form</label><media xlink:href="elife-68852-transrepform1-v2.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>Data reported in Figures 1, 6, 7 are publicly available on figshare: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Cylinder_Rearing_Scores/19773487">Figure 1</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Neuroimaging_Data_Pre_Post_Stroke_for_26-03-2021-RA-eLife-68852/19773244">Figure 6</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/RT-PCR_Data/19773364">Figure 7</ext-link>.

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Tamar Makin as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. The studies in the manuscript utilize brain stimulation, and use it as a goal of modelling behavioral limb use. In particular, the optogenetic stimulation protocol of primary somatosensory forelimb cortex is said to mimic overuse of the limb. It is not clear how stimulation of a subset of neurons in somatosensory cortex mimics limb overuse. Further, this stimulation is, in totality, very brief. Limb overuse does not appear to align with this brain stimulation protocol.</p><p>2. The parameters of the stimulation are set and not altered in these studies. They were chosen based on Cheng et al., (ref 25). This is interesting because in this publication, the optical stimulation parameters, delivered into peri-stroke cortex, produced recovery. Would different stimulation parameters have a different outcome on recovery or functional connectivity? Or is this contralateral stimulation site the main determinant of the negative effect on these two? The stimulation setup is very different in this Cheng et al., study, apparently to the present study. However, this is not clear as the actual stimulation is not described. In Cheng et al., the stimulation was specifically to layer V pyramidal neurons with an optrode in Thy1-ChR2 mice. A cranial window is described in the methods section, but this appears to be for imaging. How were the ChR2 neurons stimulated in this present study?</p><p>3. Relative to the last issue in #2, if the stimulation was done with an implanted optrode, what was done with control: the -stim condition. Was this an implanted optrode but not activated? Or, if stimulation was done with an LCD on the skull or a window, was this done in -stim?</p><p>4. There is substantial and ever-deeper analysis of the rsMRI data (Figures 4-6). This is all supportive of the overall core finding, that contralateral stimulation of neurons with ChR2 in this protocol impairs recovery. But each successive level of rsMRI analysis does not really add a new amount of evidence-this array of figures is not a new or independent set of data.</p><p>5. The behavioral readout is not well documented and is a key readout for the main claims in the paper. For example, in the methods; &quot;The laser power ranged between 0.2mW – 1mW and was set to a level just below that which elicited overt behavioral output (e.g. forepaw or whisker motor movements in sync with stimuli).&quot; for example, how is this measured? By eye? Quantitatively with tracking approaches? Also, the cylinder test methods notes there is only 1 blinded scorer, but how consistent is this person? Why not use a machine vision approach (if the videos are saved, I strongly suggest this is quantified differently, or if they do the new experiments suggested, this is used on the new video data).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Additional studies that might define the biology of recovery here, is to more completely flesh out the interaction of stimulation with recovery, so as to better prove that the site of stimulation is the main negative effect.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.68852.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1.

It is possible, and likely, that other stimulation parameters would result in improved or worsened recovery, depending on whether the ipsilesional or contralesional hemisphere was targeted. These are exciting questions that we are currently exploring, but feel an exhaustive exploration of which stimuli/networks are best/worst to target is beyond the scope of the current manuscript. We have added text to the limitations section of the Discussion on page 16 to address these remaining questions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The stimulation setup is very different in this Cheng et al., study, apparently to the present study.

There is substantial and ever-deeper analysis of the rsMRI data (Figures 4-6).

But each successive level of rsMRI analysis does not really add a new amount of evidence-this array of figures is not a new or independent set of data.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct that original Figures 4-6 report different results from the same set of functional neuroimaging data. Each set of analyses is intended to examine unique aspects of either local or global network organization after stroke. Figure 4 probes the effect of contralesional activity on local forepaw somatosensory circuit recovery using functional maps (task-evoked forepaw representations) as ROIs. The data-driven analyses in Figure 5 are agnostic to the experimental paradigm to determine whether targeted contralesional activity affects global network interactions (following or in the absence of focal ischemia). Because recovery of local and distant functional connection strength after stroke (node degree, quantified in original Figure 6) depends on the RSFC data in Figures 4 and 5, results from these analyses might be anticipated. We have therefore decided to move this Figure to supplemental material (new Figure 5—figure supplement 2).</p><p>New independent data are included in the manuscript as new Figure 6, where we show the effect of optogenetic photostimulation before and after stroke on global cortical activity in awake animals. For additional information, please see our response to concern #2 by Reviewer #2 below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. The behavioral readout is not well documented and is a key readout for the main claims in the paper. For example, in the methods; “The laser power ranged between 0.2mW – 1mW and was set to a level just below that which elicited overt behavioral output (e.g. forepaw or whisker motor movements in sync with stimuli).” For example, how is this measured? By eye? Quantitatively with tracking approaches?</p></disp-quote><p>We have clarified in response to Essential Point #2.2 above and in the “Interventional Optogenetic Photostimulation” section of the Methods (page 17) that overt behavioral responses to the interventional photostimulation were determined visually.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also, the cylinder test methods notes there is only 1 blinded scorer, but how consistent is this person? Why not use a machine vision approach (if the videos are saved, I strongly suggest this is quantified differently, or if they do the new experiments suggested, this is used on the new video data).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that a more efficient scoring method less prone to scorer-to-scorer variability would be optimal. Prior to examining the cylinder rearing data set in the current paper, the blinded scorer (J.K.) was previously trained by A.R.B. and A.W.K. using datasets previously published in Kraft et al., Science Translational Medicine, 2018. After a period of initial training, scorers are instructed to evaluate baseline (pre-stroke) rearing data. Scoring consistency is evaluated through (1) data-driven determination of mouse handedness (approximately 20% of mice are left- or –right handed, defined in our study as &gt;50% use asymmetry) which removes those mice from subsequent evaluation, and (2) statistical evaluation between the results of the trainee and those previously tabulated by A.R.B and A.W.K from the Kraft et al., study. While we are confident that our scoring protocol yields consistent results across scorers, manual scoring is time consuming. To that end, we are currently working on a machine vision approach to scoring, but this methodology is not currently ready for application.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Additional studies that might define the biology of recovery here, is to more completely flesh out the interaction of stimulation with recovery, so as to better prove that the site of stimulation is the main negative effect.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and have expanded on this important point in the Discussion on pages 15-16.</p></body></sub-article></article>
