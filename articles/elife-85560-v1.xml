(HCMV) disease. To create opportunities for viral spread, several HCMV-encoded immunoevasins employ diverse strategies to target HLA-I. Among these, the glycoprotein US10 is so far insufficiently studied. While it was reported that US10 interferes with HLA-G expression, its ability to manipulate classical HLA-I antigen presentation remains unknown. In this study, we demonstrate that US10 recognizes and binds to all HLA-I (HLA-A, -B, -C, -E, -G) heavy chains. Additionally, impaired recruitment of HLA-I to the peptide loading complex was observed. Notably, the associated effects varied significantly dependending on HLA-I genotype and allotype: (i) HLA-A molecules evaded downregulation by US10, (ii) tapasin-dependent HLA-B molecules showed impaired maturation and cell surface expression, and (iii) β<sub>2</sub>m-assembled HLA-C, in particular HLA-C*05:01 and -C*12:03, and HLA-G were strongly retained in complex with US10 in the endoplasmic reticulum. These genotype-specific effects on HLA-I were confirmed through unbiased HLA-I ligandome analyses. Furthermore, in HCMV-infected fibroblasts inhibition of overlapping US10 and US11 transcription had little effect on HLA-A, but induced HLA-B antigen presentation. Thus, the US10-mediated impact on HLA-I results in multiple geno- and allotypic effects in a so far unparalleled and multimodal manner.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>During a viral infection, the immune system must discriminate between healthy and infected cells to selectively kill infected cells. Healthy cells have different types of molecules known collectively as HLA-I on their surface. These molecules present small fragments of proteins from the cell, called antigens, to patrolling immune cells, known as CTLs or natural killer cells.</p><p>While CTLs ignore antigens from human proteins (which indicate the cell is healthy), they can bind to and recognize antigens from viral proteins, which triggers them to activate immune responses that kill the infected cell. However, some viruses can prevent infected cells from presenting HLA-I molecules on their surfaces as a strategy to evade the immune system. Natural killer cells have evolved to overcome this challenge. They bind to the HLA-I molecules themselves, which causes them to remain inactive. However, if the HLA-I molecules are missing, the NK cells can more easily switch on and kill the target cell.</p><p>The human cytomegalovirus is a common virus that causes lifelong infection in humans. Although it rarely causes illness in healthy individuals, it can be life-threatening to newborn babies and for individuals with weakened immune systems. One human cytomegalovirus protein known as US10 was previously found to bind to HLA-I without reducing the levels of these molecules on the surface of the cell. However, its precise role remained unclear.</p><p>Gerke et al. used several biochemical and cell biology approaches to investigate whether US10 manipulates the quality of the three types of HLA-I, which could impact both CTL and NK cell recognition. The experiments showed that US10 acted differently on the various kinds of HLA-I. To one type, it bound strongly within the cell and prevented it from reaching the surface. US10 also prevented another type of HLA-I from maturing properly and presenting antigens but did not affect the third type of HLA-I.</p><p>These findings suggest that US10 interferes with the ability of different HLA-I types to present antigens in specific ways. Further research is needed to measure how US10 activity affects immune cells, which may ultimately aid the development of new therapies against human cytomegalovirus and other similar viruses.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>human cytomegalovirus</kwd><kwd>MHC class I</kwd><kwd>US10</kwd><kwd>peptide loading complex</kwd><kwd>immunoevasin</kwd><kwd>tapasin</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Viruses</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HA 6035/2-2</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Halenius</surname><given-names>Anne</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>TR 1208/1-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Trilling</surname><given-names>Mirko</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ER 927/1-2</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Erhard</surname><given-names>Florian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DO 1275/7-2</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dölken</surname><given-names>Lars</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SCHL 1888/8-2</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schlosser</surname><given-names>Andreas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HE 2526/9-2</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hengel</surname><given-names>Hartmut</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Analysis of human cytomegalovirus-encoded glycoprotein US10 targeting human leucocyte antigen class I molecules reveals a multimodal strategy, resulting in a geno- and allotypic-dependent effects.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) belongs to the β-herpesviruses and establishes a life-long persistent infection in humans alternating between phases of latency and reactivation. Although clinical manifestations are mainly observed in immunocompromised patients, HCMV also affects the immune system of healthy individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brodin et al., 2015</xref>). For example, an expansion of memory-like NK cells as well as of CD8<sup>+</sup> memory T cells are frequent observations in HCMV-positive individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lübke et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rölle and Brodin, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Waller et al., 2008</xref>). These cytotoxic immune effector cells are crucial for HCMV control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sylwester et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Venema et al., 1994</xref>). While specific antigenic peptide ligands presented by major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) molecules on infected cells activate CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells, NK cells express various inhibiting and activating receptors that recognize MHC-I both in peptide-independent and -dependent manners.</p><p>In humans, MHC-I molecules are encoded by three classical (A, B, C) and three non-classical (E, F, G) human leucocyte antigen class I (HLA-I) loci located on chromosome 6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Koller et al., 1989</xref>). Classical HLA-I are characterized by a high degree of polymorphism, whereas non-classical HLA-I show low levels of heterogeneity. The MHC-I maturation process begins with a co-translational translocation of the heavy chain (HC) into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where it folds and assembles with β<sub>2</sub>-microglobulin (β<sub>2</sub>m). To acquire a peptide ligand, MHC-I is assisted by the chaperones tapasin, ERp57, and calreticulin, as well as the transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP), together forming the peptide loading complex (PLC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Blees et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hulpke and Tampé, 2013</xref>). While TAP transports cytosolic peptides generated by the proteasome into the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Michalek et al., 1993</xref>), tapasin serves as an adapter chaperone linking TAP and HLA-I.

To assess whether the PLC is involved in the US10-mediated delay of HLA-I maturation, HLA-I interaction with the PLC was analyzed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Co-immunoprecipitation using antibodies directed either against ERp57 or tapasin revealed that the overall level of PLC-associated HLA-I was greatly reduced in cells expressing US10, despite the increase in EndoH-sensitive HLA-I in these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, lanes 9–12). This indicates that larger quantities of HLA-I molecules remained in the ER, but these were not able to interact with the PLC. Interestingly, we observed that HLA-A*68:02 was less affected than HLA-B*15:03/-C*12:03; the percentage of HLA-A*68:02 in the PLC compared to the total amount of HLA-I in the PLC was increased in US10-expressing cells, whereas it was decreased for HLA-B*15:03/-C*12:03 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).

A co-immunoprecipitation of US10 with the PLC was not observed in this experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

While the endogenous level of tapasin barely allowed detection of US10 co-immunoprecipitation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, lane 2), overexpression of tapasin increased the level of US10 co-immunoprecipitation (lane 3). In cells lacking HLA-I expression (HLA-I was knocked out using a lentiviral CRISPR/Cas9 system; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B and C</xref>), the interaction with US10 remained discernible, albeit very faintly (lane 4). Moreover, in samples with tapasin overexpression anti-US10 rabbit antiserum co-immunoprecipitated tapasin. This was the case also in the absence of HLA-I expression, but with decreased intensity. HLA-I and ERp57 were not detected under these conditions (lanes 7–8).

The cells were transiently transfected to express US10 and HA-tagged HLA-I with and without β<sub>2</sub>m. Subsequently, the strength of US10 binding to HLA-I was measured using an anti-HA antibody. The highest level of US10 was bound to HLA-C*05:01 and expression of β<sub>2</sub>m did not markedly change this (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D and E</xref>). In contrast, upon co-expression of β<sub>2</sub>m US10, binding to the HLA-A and -B molecules was reduced. Loss of binding was most pronounced for HLA-A*02:01 followed by -B*07:02, and -B*44:02.</p><p>Altogether, these experiments suggest that US10 has a higher affinity for HLA-C*05:01 than for the investigated HLA-A and -B allotypes. Moreover, US10 binding to HLA-C*05:01 remains intact after β<sub>2</sub>m-assembly, accompanied by a strong retention in HLA-C*05:01 in the ER. The most likely explanation for the reduced US10 binding to HLA-A*02:01 and -B*07:02 after β<sub>2</sub>m expression is that these molecules are not retained anymore by US10, but the interaction is interrupted and the molecules leave the ER. To test this, we expressed HLA-A*02:01 and US10 in HLA-I KO cells and assessed interaction with the W6/32 mAb. When the cells were treated with brefeldin A, which blocks trafficking between the ER and Golgi compartments, more HLA-A*02:01 remained EndoH sensitive and clearly more US10 was co-immunoprecipitated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). This was also observed to some extent for HLA-B*07:02 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Therefore, US10 does not directly compete with β<sub>2</sub>m for binding to the HLA-I HC, instead, the data suggest that the affinity of US10 for assembled HLA-A and -B proteins is reduced upon HC assembly with β<sub>2</sub>m. This change in affinity could be due to the US10-HC interaction site being partially blocked by β<sub>2</sub>m.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Quantitative HLA-I ligandome analysis confirms genotype-dependent effects by US10</title><p>So far, our analysis suggested a genotype-dependent effect of US10 on HLA-I: HLA-A escapes retention, HLA-B downregulation correlates with tapasin dependency, and HLA-C is retained and stabilized by US10 in a β<sub>2</sub>m-assembled form in the ER. To assess how these distinct phenotypes affect the HLA-I ligandome of US10-expressing cells, we generated HeLa cells with a doxycycline-inducible TagBFP-T2A-US10 construct.

Since HLA-B*44:02 and HLA-C migrate slower than HLA-A*02:01 and -B*07:02 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>), this finding suggests that the US10 siRNA has a stronger effect on the recruitment of HLA-B*44:02 and HLA-C molecules to the PLC. This fits well with the observation that in particular HLA-B*15:03/-C*12:03 were excluded from the PLC in US10-expressing HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) and suggests that also in HCMV-infected cells US10 blocks interaction of specific HLA-I with the PLC and has the potential to skew the HLA-I ligandome.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>US10 siRNA treatment of HCMV-infected cells induces HLA-B antigen presentation</title><p>Next, HLA-I cell surface expression was analyzed by flow cytometry on HCMV-infected fibroblasts that were pretreated with US10 or control siRNA.

In contrast, US10 had no discernible impact on HLA-A allotypes.</p><p>The absence of cell-surface regulation of HLA-A was not due to lack of US10 binding. The conformation-independent binding of the anti-HA antibody to HA-tagged HLA-I demonstrated a remarkably conserved binding capacity of US10 to all tested HLA-I HCs (HLA-A, -B, -C, -E, and -G). However, consistent with unaffected cell surface expression of HLA-A allotypes, maturation of endogenous HLA-A*68:02 and transiently expressed HLA-A*02:01 was only modestly delayed in HeLa cells expressing US10.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Functional analysis of the PLC reveals HLA-I genotypic differences in US10 targeting</title><p>A strong correlation between US10-mediated inhibition of HLA-B allotypes and their dependency on tapasin was noted. In addition, HLA-I recruitment to the PLC was hindered by US10. HLA-I ligandome analysis verified that US10 impaired the quality control of HLA-B*15:03 and narrowed its ligandome. This underlines the observation that US10 blocks HLA-B interaction with the PLC and prohibits the quality control exerted by tapasin. In contrast to the effects on HLA-B*15:03, block of PLC recruitment was less pronounced for HLA-A*68:02. Also, no marked effect on the HLA-A*68:02 ligandome was measured after induction of US10 expression.</p><p>Interestingly, co-immunoprecipitation experiments indicated US10 interaction with the PLC, which was dependent on the expression level of tapasin and to a lesser extent on HLA-I. This suggests that US10 could bind tapasin directly and block the interaction between HLA-I and tapasin, potentially contributing to the observed inhibition of HLA-I recruitment to the PLC. Another reason for the impaired interaction between HLA-I and the PLC could involve the sequestration of HLA-I by US10 prior to its entry into the PLC. This is supported by the finding that US10 was able to induce further downregulation of sensitive HLA-I in tapasin-deficient cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Hence, these models are not mutually exclusive. On the contrary, our data suggest that US10 has multitasking abilities and employs several strategies to target HLA-I.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>US10 is able to retain assembled HLA-C and HLA-G in the ER, but not HLA-A and HLA-B</title><p>The unexpected finding that US10 associates selectively with HLA-C and -G in their β<sub>2</sub>m-dimerized form suggests that US10 has evolved an independent molecular targeting strategy for HLA-C and -G. This prominent interaction could explain why downregulation of HLA-C allotypes did not correlate with their level of tapasin dependency. Still, whether tapasin is involved as a co-factor in retention and accumulation of peptide-loaded HLA-C in the ER needs clarification.</p><p>Interestingly, forced ER localization of assembled HLA-A*02:01 and HLA-B*07:02 by brefeldin A increased US10 binding to these molecules, demonstrating that this interaction is possible but short-lived. Hence, under normal conditions US10 interaction with assembled HLA-A*02:01 and -B*07:02 does not impede their transport out of the ER. This indeed shows that US10 interaction with HLA-G and -C is qualitatively different from the interaction with HLA-A and -B.</p><p>It is surprising that, despite our extensive studies, we did not observe destabilization of HLA-G or any other HLA-I molecule, even though previous research reported that US10 facilitates the degradation of HLA-G (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Park et al., 2010</xref>). Supporting our initial observations in transfected HeLa cells, treatment with US10 siRNA in HCMV-infected BJ-5ta-HLA-G cells decreased HLA-G levels compared to other HLA-I HCs in the sample (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). We observed that modifications to the US10 protein significantly affect its stability and intracellular distribution, potentially causing abnormal effects on HLA-I when the sequence is altered.

Samples were loaded on a trapping column (2 cm × 150 µm ID, PepSep) and separated on a capillary column (30 cm × 150 µm ID, PepSep), both packed with 1.9 µm C18 ReproSil. Peptides were separated with a flow rate of 500 nL/min and a solvent system consisting of 0.1% formic acid (solvent A) and 80% ACN, 0.1% formic acid (solvent B) using the following gradient: 3–20% solvent B in 15 min, 20–45% solvent B in 45 min, and 45–98% solvent B in 5 min. Eluting peptides were analyzed using a higher-energy collisional dissociation (HCD) method, generating spectra from doubly charged peptides, as well as a combined HCD and electron transfer dissociation (ETD) method, generating spectra from singly and triply charged peptides. For both methods, a top speed data-dependent method with a fixed cycle time of 1.5 s and internal calibration using EASY-IC was used. Both MS and MS/MS scans were acquired in the Orbitrap analyzer with a resolution of 60,000. Precursor selection range was set to m/z 751–1601 (singly charged peptides), m/z 376–801 (doubly charged peptides), and m/z 251–534 (triply charged peptides), with a predictive automatic gain control target of 250% (1 × 10<sup>6</sup>) and a maximum injection time of 100 ms. Singly and doubly charged precursors were selected for HCD only, whereas triply charged precursors were selected for HCD and for ETD. HCD fragmentation with normalized stepped collision energy (30, 35, 40%) was applied. Dynamic repeat count was set to 1 with an exclusion duration of 8 s. For precursor selection, an intensity threshold of 1 × 10<sup>4</sup> was used.

For every peptide, a total of six variable modifications were allowed. The top 10 de novo sequencing candidates were reported for each fragment ion spectrum and matched against the three-frame translation of the human transcriptome (ENSEMBL 90) and the six-frame translation of the reference human genome (CRCh38) using Peptide-PRISM. Matched peptides were categorized according to the genomic region in which they are encoded (CDS, in-frame with annotated protein; 5′ UTR; off-frame, located inside, but out-of-frame, of protein-encoding ORF; 3′ UTR; ncRNA; Intronic; Intergenic). HLA peptide binding predictions were performed with NetMHCpan 4.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jurtz et al., 2017</xref>). A custom fasta database containing all HLA-I peptides identified by Peptide-PRISM at an FDR of &lt; 10% was generated and used to determine H/M ratios for all HLA-I peptides by MaxQuant 2.4.2.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cox and Mann, 2008</xref>). Digestion mode was set to ‘no digestion’. Multiplicity for the SILAC-labeling was set to 3 (light, medium, and heavy) with a maximum of six labels per peptide. Arg6, Lys4, Leu3 were selected as medium labels and Arg10, Lys8, Leu6 as heavy labels. FDR filtering was turned off by setting PSM FDR, protein FDR, and site decoy fraction to 1. Minimum scores for modified and unmodified peptides were set to 25. Finally, the Re-quantify option was used for improving quantification of large ratios. Apart from these adapted settings, the MaxQuant default parameters were used. The MaxQuant evidence table was merged with the Peptide-PRISM results table by peptide sequence. Median log2 H/M ratios were calculated for all peptides from the H/M ratios given in the MaxQuant evidence table. Median lg2 H/M ratios calculated only from H/M ratios of type ‘ISO-MSMS’ with either missing labeling state ‘medium’ or ‘heavy’ were excluded.

For analysis, 5 × 10<sup>4</sup> cells were incubated with the tetramer, further stained with anti-CD8 (BD Biosciences) and viability dye (EBioscience), washed, fixed in 2% PFA and measured on a FACS Canto.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Generation of HLA-B*08<sup>IE1</sup>-specific CD8+ T-cell clones</title><p>PBMCs (2 × 10<sup>6</sup>) from HCMV seropositive, HLA-B*08:01-positive donors were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies; supplemented with 10% [v/v] FCS [PAN Biotech], 1% [v/v] penicillin/streptomycin [Life Technologies], and 1.5% [v/v] HEPES [Life Technologies]). 0.5 µg/mL anti-CD28 antibody (BD Biosciences) and 5 µM of an HLA-B*08:01-specific IE1 peptide (199-207: ELRRKMMYM; Genaxxon [purity: 99.3%]) were added to the medium for 2 wk. Fifty percent of the medium was replaced by fresh, supplemented RPMI with 20 IU/mL IL-2 (Stemcell) every 3 d. After 10 d, specificity of the cells was tested by staining with tetramers generated from HLA-I easYmer and streptavidin-PE (BD Biosciences) according to the manufacturer’s instructions (immunAware). 5 × 10<sup>4</sup> cells were incubated with the tetramer, further stained with anti-CD8 (BD Biosciences) and viability dye (EBioscience), washed, fixed in 2% PFA, and measured on a FACS Canto or Fortessa LSR. To generate clones, cells were sorted on the FACS Melody. They were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (supplemented with 10% [v/v] human serum and 1% [v/v] penicillin/streptomycin [Life Technologies]) together with PHA-M (Sigma-Aldrich) and 2 × 10<sup>6</sup> feeder cells per mL. Feeder cells were gained from fresh PBMCs (EDTA blood, density separation; Lymphocyte Separation Medium [AnproTech]) and irradiated with 30 Gy for 30 min, Cs-source. Three days after sorting, the clones were fed with RPMI with human serum, 100 IU/mL IL-2 and the abovementioned supplements. Clones were cultured for 14 d before further analysis. The project was approved by the ethical committee at the Albert-Ludwigs-University Freiburg (22-1196).</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Analysis of the activation of HLA-B/CMV-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells by HCMV infection</title><p>1 × 10<sup>5</sup> HFFα or HFF99/7 fibroblasts nucleofected with US10- or non-targeting siRNA were seeded in DMEM (Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium, Life Technologies) supplemented with 10% (v/v) FCS (PAN Biotech) and 1% (v/v) penicillin/streptomycin (Life Technologies). After 24 hr, cells were infected with HCMV at an MOI of 5. At 24 or 72 hr p.i., the infected cells were co-cultured with HLA-B/CMV-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells for 5 hr (E:T ratio: 3:1 [HFFα] or 5:1 [HFF99/7]) in RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies)(supplemented with 10% [v/v] FCS [PAN Biotech], 1% [v/v] penicillin/streptomycin [Life Technologies], and 1.5% [v/v] HEPES [Life Technologies]). GolgiStop and GolgiPlug (BD Biosciences) were used according to the manufacturer’s instructions and added to the co-culture. Activation of the CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells was analyzed by flow cytometry. T-cells were transferred to a 96-well plate after co-culturing and surface staining of CD8 (BD Biosciences) was performed. Additionally, a viability dye-Cyan (EBioscience) was added. After fixation and permeabilization (BD Cytofix/Cytoperm Fixation/Permeabilization Kit), intracellular staining with FITC-coupled anti-IFNγ (BD Biosciences) and PE/Cy7-coupled anti-TNFα (BioLegend) was performed. Cells were measured on the FACS Canto (BD Biosciences). As positive controls, T-cells were cultured with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) (2 µg/mL; Sigma-Aldrich) and ionomycin (40 µg/mL; Sigma-Aldrich) or with 15 µM HLA-B-specific CMV peptide for 5 hr.</p></sec><sec id="s4-17"><title>Statistics</title><p>Calculations based on flow cytometric results were performed from the median fluorescence intensity (MFI) after subtraction of background signal (secondary antibody or isotype control) and are shown with the standard error of the mean (SEM). For statistical analysis of the siRNA infection experiments and of the allotype-specific regulation of HLA-I surface expression after transient transfection, one-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett’s multiple comparison test was performed as recommended by the GraphPad Prism software (v8). The correlation analysis (two-tailed) was performed with the same software. A p-value &lt;0.05 was considered significant (*p&lt;0.05; **p&lt;0.005; ***p&lt;0.0005).

well as T-cell-mediated responses crucial to control the herpesvirus human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), and there are multiple viral immune evasins that target the protective function of HLA-I. This valuable study reports on the HCMV immune evasin US10 and shows that it recognizes and binds to all HLA-I (HLA-A,-B,-C,-E,-G) heavy chains and affects their function in different ways. These convincing findings reveal novel functions of the viral glycoprotein US10.

We also include an acceptance summary that explains what the editors found interesting or important about the work.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Multimodal HLA-I genotype regulation by human cytomegalovirus US10 and resulting surface patterning&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Satyajit Rath as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Malgorzata A. Garstka (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions (for the authors):</p><p>Overall, the three reviewers all agree that the results are interesting and valuable, and the experiments performed are biochemically very well done. However, they all also agree that a substantial amount of additional and more direct mechanistic studies of US10-mediated MHC class I down regulation would be needed to make this manuscript interesting for a broader audience.</p><p>They also all agree that the description of the transcription studies takes focus away from the role of US10 as a functional immunoevasin and should be pared down.</p><p>In addition, the reviewers pointed out the discussion about TAPBPR to be speculative, mainly because HLA-A*68, HLA-A*02:01 and A*24:02 were found to be TAPBPR binders, while HLA-A*03:01 and HLA-A*01:01 were not [Ilca et al., 2019, doi: 10.1016/j.celrep.2019.09.074]. In their discussion the reviewers pointed out that maybe differences in sequence/structures could explain the differential effect of US10 inhibition.</p><p>In addition, they stated that the model of US10-mediated retention of different HLA molecules is inconsistent with the binding studies of US10 with the HLA molecules and the PLC.</p><p>To get more mechanistic insights into US10's role for viral immune evasion, please address the following points of the reviewers:</p><p>1) US10 could potentially block the interaction with the PLC by, e.g., a) blocking the binding of beta2m (some indications in Figure 4: less W6/32-IPed B*44:02 in the presence of US10 than in the case of other alleles), b) blocking interaction with tapasin or c) calreticulin. As calreticulin binds to sugars, it is not allele-specific. Please address these possibilities experimentally.</p><p>2) US10 could bind beta2m before MHC class I could do so. Therefore, please analyse the interaction with beta2m (IP with BBM.1 antibody (-/+US10, IB: anti-HA, anti-US10), and/or whether US10 can bind before MHC class I binds beta2m [by a short pulse (60s) and short chase (1, 2, 5, 10, 20 min), resolve all bands: HA, US10, beta2m].</p><p>3) Binding of MHC class I with beta2m and tapasin should be studied using an overexpression system with a single MHC class I allele at the time, which may allow for differentiation between HLA-B and HLA-C alleles.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This is important work. I have a few specific points that may improve the manuscript.</p><p>Lines 129-132: &quot;Interestingly, we observed that HLA-A*68:02 was less affected by this than HLA-B*15:03/C*12:03; the percentage of HLA-A*68:02 in the PLC as compared to the total amount of HLA-I in the PLC was increased in US10-expressing cells (Figure 2D). Hence, HLA- A*68:02 access to the PLC is less disturbed by US10 than observed for HLA-B*15:03/-C*12:03.&quot;</p><p>Figure 2C presents the interaction of HLA-A*68:01, B*15:03, and C*12:03 with ERp57 or tapasin in the presence or the absence of US10. The authors claim that although US10 inhibits interaction with PLC for all three alleles, HLA-B*68:02 is less affected. The quantification in D may be misleading as it demonstrates only data for HLA-B*68:02. I suggest representing the ratio of HLA-B*68:02/ERp57 (or tapasin) and B*15:03+C*12:03/ERp57 (or tapasin) that may allow more direct comparison between A and B/C allotypes in the presence and absence of US10 in HeLa cell line.</p><p>Suppl. Figure 1. Lines 136-138 &quot;Furthermore, we demonstrate here that under the same experimental conditions, US2 and US3 were co-immunoprecipitated by anti-ERp57, whereas this was not the case for US10 (Suppl. Figure 1).&quot; The authors should include entire membrane and indicate ERp57 band. Besides, the included exposure allows seeing US2HA co-IP with ERp57 but not US3. Could it be that US10 which is of lower molecular weight is below the detection limit? Including longer exposure may strengthen the authors' argument.</p><p>Lines 174-178 &quot;Interestingly, in samples where US10 was strongly co-immunoprecipitated with the mAb W6/32 also induced HC/β2m assembly was observed, particularly pronounced for HLA-C*05:01, -C*07:02, and – G*01:01. In contrast, the tapasin-dependent HLA-B*44:02 allotype showed a reduced level of β2m assembly in the presence of US10 (Figure 4D-E). &quot; It seems that US10 expression enhanced MHC class I (either IP with W6/32 or HA antibody). To show that there is an additional effect on b2m-bound HLA-C*05:01, -C*07:02, -G*01:01, and B*44:02, I suggest including a graph with the comparison of these two effects, specifically, a ratio of US10/control for MHC class I precipitated with W6/32 next to the ratio of US10/control for MHC class I precipitated with HA.</p><p>Lines 320-321 &quot;Our data support a model in which the affinity of US10 for HLA-A allotypes is lower than for HLA-B.&quot; Figure 1C shows similar binding of US10 to all studied MHC class I alleles (all forms). Figure 4A shows similar binding of US10 to HLA-A*02:01 and B*07:02 (total or b2m-bound form), thus the affinity of US10 to HLA-A and HLA-B alleles seem similar.</p><p>Lines 387-388: &quot;US10 is able to bind to all HLA-I molecules early after their synthesis and prior to dimerization with β2m (Figure 8).&quot; – The experiments may not support the above claim. In Figure 1C, 2A, 2C, both US10, and b2m are present in co-IP samples. In Figure 4A, the membrane is cut above b2m so it is not possible to access whether b2m is in the complex with MHC class I and US10. Moreover, a low signal of B*44:02 in Figure 4A may hinder the assessment of whether it binds to US10 while being in the complex with b2m. Short metabolic labeling would be needed to assess whether US10 binds to MHC class I before the MHC-I-b2m complex is formed.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>These are proposed points that would provide significance to the findings:</p><p>1) US10 has previously been described as an immune-evasin molecule with specificity for HLA-I alleles and a different mechanism. The differences in the US10 mechanism of action has not been demonstrated with experiments.</p><p>2) Figure 4 illustrates binding assays using W6/32 and an ant-HA antibody. The class I/US10 interaction does not correlate with class I down regulation shown in Figure 1. Thus, the mechanism of US10 recognition of MHC class I that contributes to its surface expression is not consistent with the model of downregulation. These findings should be clarified.</p><p>3) The analysis of US10 impacting HLA-down regulation during a virus infection is difficult to evaluate due to the small differences in MFI on flow cytometry and that using US10 siRNA impacts US11 expression. Thus, it is difficult for the authors to make bold conclusions for Figure 7. In addition, data supporting the US10 or US11 levels during infection would provide more confidence in the studies.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The cell surface staining experiments of Figures 1 and 2 are solid. Although the data on C*05:01 and C*07:02 show a difference in these two allelomorphs, in some places in the text there seems to be a pooling of HLA-C and -G rather than to make the distinction in some alleles. Although the 2D plot in Figure 3B seems to illustrate the relationship of the Tapasin independence, there are no error bars or statistics with panel A. This needs better explanation. Also, K(b) is indeed tapasin dependent in the mouse-that needs better explanation. It would have been nice to continue the analysis of B*4402 vs B*44:05, the classical tapasin dependent/independent pair that differ by a single residue polymorphism. The digression into the transcriptional regulation of US10 and US11 is rather confusing when the main point of the papeer seems to be the effect of the translated US10 on PLC dependent peptide editing. Supplemental Figure B is labelled &quot;in Tapasin dependent order&quot;, but indeed the order is tapasin independent. The only functional experiment addressing US10 as a potential immunoevasin is shown in Suppl. Figure 6B. This should be explained more completely and used to justify the important biological potential. Overall, the observations are sound, with some concern as to the full statistical significance of some of the comparisons. I would certainly urge the authors to pare down the digression to the transcription, as this seems to wander from the main point of the paper.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.85560.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions (for the authors):</p><p>To get more mechanistic insights into US10's role for viral immune evasion, please address the following points of the reviewers:</p><p>1) US10 could potentially block the interaction with the PLC by, e.g., a) blocking the binding of beta2m (some indications in Figure 4: less W6/32-IPed B*44:02 in the presence of US10 than in the case of other alleles), b) blocking interaction with tapasin or c) calreticulin. As calreticulin binds to sugars, it is not allele-specific. Please address these possibilities experimentally.</p></disp-quote><p>We have included new data showing that US10 can bind to assembled HLA-A*02:01 and HLA-B*07:02 if they are retained in the ER by brefeldin A (Figure 4F and Figure 3—figure supplement 1D). This demonstrates that US10 and β<sub>2</sub>m binding to the HC is not mutually exclusive.</p><p>Upon re-introduction of β<sub>2</sub>m into β<sub>2</sub>m-KO cells, US10 interaction with HLA-A*02:01 and HLA-B*07:02 was reduced, but not with HLA-C*05:01 (Figure 4D). This shows that the affinity of US10 for assembled HLA-A and -B is lower than for HLA-G and some -C, indicating a difference in the quality of the binding, which results in strong retention of HLA-G and some -C, but not of -A and -B.</p><p>The new quantitative HLA-I ligandome analysis support the idea that US10 affects HLA-I genotypes in different manner: the quality control of HLA-B*15:03 was strongly reduced, leading to loss of HLA-B*15:03 expression, while peptide-loaded HLA-C*12:03 was stabilized in the ER. No effects were observed on HLA-A*68:02 ligandome.</p><p>Furthermore, we found that US10 may interact with tapasin directly in an HLA-I-independent manner (Figure 2E, see also reply to point 3). This is different from our previous submission, in which we concluded that US10 is not interacting with the PLC. However, we now labeled the cells for a longer time and transiently transfected tapasin to induce a strong expression. This indeed allowed the detection of an interaction between US10 and tapasin. We therefore hypothesize that tapasin will be involved in functional aspects of US10. This will be investigated in more detail in a separate study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) US10 could bind beta2m before MHC class I could do so. Therefore, please analyse the interaction with beta2m (IP with BBM.1 antibody (-/+US10, IB: anti-HA, anti-US10), and/or whether US10 can bind before MHC class I binds beta2m [by a short pulse (60s) and short chase (1, 2, 5, 10, 20 min), resolve all bands: HA, US10, beta2m].</p></disp-quote><p>This is an interesting experimental setup. We performed a pilot experiment, but quite as we expected, it was not possible to visualize US10 in complex with MHC-I after a short labelling. We have previously observed that accumulation of newly synthesized US10 in a complex with MHC-I is slow (for example see Figure 2A). We believe that the reason for this is a slow insertion of newly synthesized US10 into the ER membrane.</p><p>We did not find direct binding of US10 to β<sub>2</sub>m (Figure 4—figure supplement 1A, lane 16). Therefore, US10 binding to assembled HLA-I is conferred through the HC.</p><p>We generated HLA-I and β<sub>2</sub>m double knock-out HeLa cells. In these cells US10 binding to HA-tagged HLA-A*02:01, -B*07:02, -B*44:02, and -C*05:01 was investigated. Using the anti-HA antibody, US10 was co-immunoprecipitated with all four HLA-I molecules (Figure 4D), demonstrating that US10 can bind to the free HCs of these HLA-I. β<sub>2</sub>m overexpression reduced US10 binding to HLA-A*02:01, -B*07:02, and -B*44:02. While this is consistent with the idea that β<sub>2</sub>m could displace US10 from the HLA-I HC, it could also mirror the level of transport of HLA-I out of the ER after expression of β<sub>2</sub>m. Indeed, upon treatment of cells with brefeldin A, which blocks trafficking between the ER and the Golgi compartment, induced interaction of US10 with HLA-A*02:01 and HLA-B*07:02 was observed (Figure 4F and Figure 4—figure supplement 1E). Therefore, it is possible to force this interaction, demonstrating that β<sub>2</sub>m and US10 binding to the HLA-I HC is not mutually exclusive.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Binding of MHC class I with beta2m and tapasin should be studied using an overexpression system with a single MHC class I allele at the time, which may allow for differentiation between HLA-B and HLA-C alleles.</p></disp-quote><p>Regarding β<sub>2</sub>m, please see our above comment.</p><p>During revision, we discovered an interaction between US10 and tapasin (Figure 2D), which contrasts with our initial findings. The actual reason for this re-investigation was the result of an interactome analysis that we have performed with US10 (immunoprecipitation and subsequent LC-MS/MS analysis of interaction partners). In addition to HLA-I allomorphs, in this interactome we detected pronounced interactions with all proteins of the PLC. It was therefore necessary to reassess the submitted data. Insufficient labeling during previous experiments is one reason for the obscured interaction, suggesting that US10 interaction with the PLC is not a dynamic event, i.e. that formed complexes are not in frequent exchange with newly synthesized proteins. Even under prolonged labeling times, the interaction with the PLC was difficult to visualize. However, upon tapasin overexpression a convincing detection of the US10-tapasin interaction was possible; the interaction was observed using both anti-ERp57 and anti-US10 antibodies. This finding raises intriguing questions that warrant further investigation. However, due to the number of experiments that should be performed, we believe it is more suitable to investigate these questions in a subsequent study. Therefore, we have not included further data on the association of the PLC with US10 and HLA-I in this manuscript.</p><p>However, the new HLA-I ligandome analysis that we provided strongly supports our conclusions regarding the genotype-dependent effects of US10. It shows that HLA-B*15:03 was destabilized by US10 and that quality control of peptide binding was missing. On the contrary, US10 stabilized peptide-loaded HLA-C*12:03 in the ER (Figure 5). No change of the HLA-A*68:02 ligandome was observed</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Please also address the specific concerns and suggestions of the three reviewers listed below.</p><p>This study presents a useful finding on a virally encoded immune-evasin which differentially inhibits antigen presentation by cellular protein complexes called Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I, thereby diminishing the activation of cytotoxic T cells. The evidence supporting the claims of the authors is solid, although the addition of more mechanistic insights would strengthen the study. The work will be of interest to virologists and immunologists working on the adaptive immune response to herpesviral infection. Some conclusions would require additional experimental support.</p><p>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</p><p>HMCV encodes various immunoevasins to inhibit being presented by MHC class I molecules to the cytotoxic cells of the immune system. Here, the authors studied the role and specificity of US10, a relatively uncharacterized immunoevasin from HCMV. They found that US10 differentially affects antigen presentation by different MHC class I allotypes. HLA-A and certain HLA-B and C alleles (so-called &quot;tapasin-independent&quot;) were unaffected, while other HLA-B and C alleles (so-called &quot;tapasin-dependent&quot;) as well as HLA-G were negatively affected. US10 can bind to different MHC class I allotypes, which inhibits their incorporation into peptide loading complex and slowers maturation. By comparing US10 to the other well-studied immunoevasins from HCMV, US2, US3, and US11, the authors demonstrated only partial overlap between them suggesting the cumulative action of immunoevasins in inhibiting MHC class I antigen presentation of HMCV epitopes. This work contributes to our understanding of the complex immune evasion mechanism by HCMV.</p><p>The strengths include using a broad use of available techniques, including overexpression of US10 and US10 siRNA in the infection context that allowed comparison of its net and cumulative effects. Bioinformatic analysis of US10 and US11 to describe how transcription and expression of these two gene products contribute to the control of immunoevasion by HCMV. The conclusions are mostly supported by the experiments.</p><p>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</p><p>The manuscript entitled &quot; Multimodal HLA-I genotypes regulation by human cytomegalovirus US10 and resulting surface patterning&quot; by Gerke et al describes the biochemical analysis of US10-mediated down regulation of HLA-I molecules. The authors systemically examine the surface expression of different HLA-I alleles in cells expressing US10 and interactions of US10 with HLA-I and antigen presentation machinery. Further, studies examined genotypic and allotypic differences during expression of US10/US11 transcripts suggest a different allelic class I downregulation. In general, the authors have included data supporting the major claims. Yet, the conclusions and findings of the study only marginally advance the overall understanding of HCMV viral evasion and the mechanism of US10 function.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The studies are well characterized and the studies utilize diverse HLA-I and HCMV viral molecules.

Since the PLC (APC machinery) plays a major role for HLA-I expression, it was relevant to investigate this. The new data underlines the importance of the PLC for US10-mediated HLA-I regulation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The innovative and significant aspects of the study are limited. The study does not delineate the US10 mechanism of action or show data in which US10-mediated MHC class I down regulation impacts adaptive or innate immune function.</p></disp-quote><p>These remarks are important. We want to emphasize the variable impact of US10 on HLA-I. To our knowledge previous studies have not uncovered genotype-dependent effects on HLA-I as distinct as those observed with US10, indicating that US10 may exploit aspects of HLA-I that are yet to be fully elucidated. Therefore, confirming these findings is crucial for our study. The quantitative analysis of the HeLa HLA-I ligandome in US10-expressing cells strongly supports this conclusion. The precise quantification of HLA-I peptide ligands was made possible through collaboration with Dr. Andreas Schlosser from Würzburg, Germany, who possesses profound expertise in this specific method. Thus, in our opinion, this revision has enabled us to advance innovation and, importantly, enhance the significance of our study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</p><p>Correlation of the HLA-B effects with previously demonstrated allelic differences in dependence on the peptide loading complex (PLC) component chaperone/editor tapasin and demonstration that US10 does not bind the PLC reflect on possible mechanisms of US10 function. Thus, this paper adds new information that may be integrated into evolving models of the steps of MHC-I dependent antigen presentation and how viruses counter immune recognition for their own benefit. Clearer focus on the proposed models for the function of US10 and its mechanism--i.e. what experiments address the mechanism and what additional finding might clarify the mechanism would be helpful.</p></disp-quote></body></sub-article></article>
