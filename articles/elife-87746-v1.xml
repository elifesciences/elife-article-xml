achieve this without rigid components remains incomplete. Here, we develop new all-optical methods based on optical interference in a deformable substrate to measure ground reaction forces (GRFs) with micrometre and nanonewton precision in behaving <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae. Combining this with a kinematic analysis of substrate-interfacing features, we shed new light onto the biomechanical control of larval locomotion. Crawling in larvae measuring ~1 mm in length involves an intricate pattern of cuticle sequestration and planting, producing GRFs of 1–7 µN. We show that larvae insert and expand denticulated, feet-like structures into substrates as they move, a process not previously observed in soft-bodied animals. These ‘protopodia’ form dynamic anchors to compensate counteracting forces. Our work provides a framework for future biomechanics research in soft-bodied animals and promises to inspire improved soft-robot design.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>biomechanics</kwd><kwd>soft-bodied</kwd><kwd>locomotion</kwd><kwd>elastic resonator interference stress microscopy</kwd><kwd>wavelength alternating resonant pressure microscopy</kwd><kwd>kinematics</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000266</institution-id><institution>Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EP/L505079/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Booth</surname><given-names>Jonathan H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000266</institution-id><institution>Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EP/P030017/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gather</surname><given-names>Malte C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FP/2014-202</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gather</surname><given-names>Malte C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>640012 (ABLASE)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gather</surname><given-names>Malte C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005156</institution-id><institution>Alexander von Humboldt Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Humboldt Professorship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gather</surname><given-names>Malte C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A new optical approach reveals dynamics of ground reaction forces in <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae and opens new avenues for studying the biomechanics of movement in small animals.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Locomotion is a fundamental behaviour in the Animal Kingdom. There is great diversity in how it is accomplished, from the modification of torque angles in rigid-bodied animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Audu et al., 2007</xref>) to a diverse array of peristalses in limbed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">van Griethuijsen and Trimmer, 2014</xref>) and limbless soft-bodied animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berrigan and Pepin, 1995</xref>). Key to these different strategies is one unifying characteristic: action against a substrate or fluid produces forces, thereby translating the body in space. In an aquatic environment, forces acting within fluids can be visualised via the waves of distortion they cause, thus facilitating the development of detailed theories of movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gray and LIissmann, 1964</xref>). In terrestrial settings, however, substrates are often rigid and therefore prevent direct visualisation of the ground reaction forces (GRFs) generated by animals.</p><p>Interactions with substrates have been extensively studied in animals with articulating skeletons (i.e. rigid-bodied animals) due to the ability to calculate output forces from lever physics combined with measurements of joint angles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Audu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bobbert et al., 2007</xref>). However, much less is known about substrate interactions and GRFs in soft-bodied animals without rigid internal or external skeletons. These animals lack articulating joints upon which muscles act, ambiguating points through which the animal interacts with the substrate. However, they too must anchor a part of their body when another part is in motion to prevent net progression being impeded by an equal but opposite reaction force, that is, their movements must obey Newton’s third law of motion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Trueman, 1975</xref>). Furthermore, soft bodies pose a difficult control problem owing to their highly nonlinear physical properties and virtually unlimited degrees of freedom. Movement over terrain therefore presents a unique challenge for soft animals. Dynamic anchoring has long since been postulated to be at the heart of soft-bodied locomotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tanaka et al., 2012</xref>), but understanding the mechanisms by which soft animals achieve this remains an open problem. Prior work on caterpillars (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">van Griethuijsen and Trimmer, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lin and Trimmer, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lin and Trimmer, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lin et al., 2011</xref>), leeches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cacciatore et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kampowski et al., 2016</xref>) and <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fang-Yen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gjorgjieva et al., 2014</xref>) provided key insights and have provided foundational observations for the inspiration of soft robot design; however, a lack of methods with sufficient spatiotemporal resolution for measuring GRFs in freely behaving animals has limited progress.</p><p>However, in the field of cellular mechanobiology, many new force measuring techniques have been developed which allow measurement of comparatively small forces from soft structures exhibiting low inertia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Krieg et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mohammed et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zancla et al., 2022</xref>) often with relatively high spatial resolution. Early methods such as atomic force microscopy (AFM) required the use of laser-entrained silicon probes to make contact with a cell of interest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Krieg et al., 2019</xref>). This approach is problematic for studying animal behaviour due to the risk of the laser and probe influencing behaviour. Subsequently, techniques have been developed which allow indirect measurement of substrate interactions. One such approach is traction force microscopy (TFM) in which the displacement of fluorescent markers suspended in a material with known mechanical properties relative to a 0-force reference allows for indirect measurement of horizontally aligned traction forces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zancla et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lekka et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yang et al., 2006</xref>). This technique allows for probe-free measurement of forces, but has insufficient temporal resolution for the measurement of forces produced by many behaving animals, despite recent improvements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Li et al., 2021</xref>). A second approach revolves around the use of micropillar arrays; in this technique, horizontally aligned traction forces are measured by observing the deflection of pillars made of an elastic material with known mechanical properties. This approach provides excellent temporal resolution but with limited spatial resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Schoen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gupta et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Recently, we introduced a technique named elastic resonator interference stress microscopy (ERISM) which allows for the optical mapping of vertically aligned GRFs in the nanonewton range with micrometre precision by monitoring changes in local resonances of soft and deformable microcavities. This technique allows reference-free mapping of substrate interactions as well as calculation of vertically directed GRFs used in cell migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kronenberg et al., 2017b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Liehm et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dalaka et al., 2020</xref>). Until recently, this technique was limited by its low temporal resolution (~10 s), making it unsuitable for use in recording substrate interaction during fast animal movements, but a very recent further development of ERISM known as wavelength alternating resonance pressure (WARP) microscopy has been demonstrated to achieve down to 10 ms temporal resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Meek et al., 2021</xref>). Given ERISM and WARP allow for probe-free measurement of vertical GRFs with high spatial and now temporal resolution, it becomes an attractive method for animal-scale mechanobiology.</p><p>In parallel, great strides have been made in understanding the neural and genetic underpinnings of locomotion in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> larva (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fushiki et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zwart et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Schneider-Mizell et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pulver et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Heckscher et al., 2012</xref>), a genetically tractable soft-bodied model organism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brand and Perrimon, 1993</xref>). <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae are segmentally organised peristaltic crawlers that move by generating waves of muscle contractions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berrigan and Pepin, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Heckscher et al., 2012</xref>). Larvae have segmentally repeating bands comprised of six rows of actin trichomes (denticles) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Payre, 2004</xref>). The developmental and genetic origins of these structures have been extensively studied, but relatively little is known about how they are articulated during movement. While computational modelling and biomechanical measurements have provided an initial knowledgebase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Loveless et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Loveless et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gjorgjieva et al., 2013</xref>), data on biomechanical forces generated during substrate interactions in <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae remain extremely limited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Khare et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sun et al., 2022</xref>). Development of methods for measuring GRFs in this model organism would enable fully integrated neurogenetic-biomechanical approaches to understanding soft-bodied movement and fulfil calls from the modelling community for more biomechanics data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tytell et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Here, we develop ERISM- and WARP-based approaches to measure GRFs exerted by freely behaving <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae. We combine these measurements with kinematic tracking to explore how soft-bodied animals overcome fundamental biophysical challenges of moving over terrain. We find that, despite their legless appearance, <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae interact with substrates by forming and articulating foot-like cuticular features (‘protopodia') and cuticular papillae, which act as dynamic, travelling anchors. The use of ERISM-WARP provides a step change in capability for understanding how soft-bodied animals interact with substrates and paves the way for a wider use of optical force measurement techniques in animal biomechanics and robotics research.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Kinematic tracking of substrate-interfacing features</title><p>As a first step in understanding how larvae interact with substrates, we confined third-instar larvae to glass pipettes lined with soft agarose (0.1% w/v) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). This allowed us to laterally image the animals and the lateral edges of denticle rows at the substrate interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>) while animals crawled towards an appetitive odour source. Animals interact with the substrate by large, soft, segmentally repeating cuticular features that contain rows of denticles and to which we refer as ‘protopodia' in the following. Protopodia in each segment engaged in ‘swing’ periods (moving, SwP) and ‘stance’ periods (planted on substrate, StP) as waves propagated through the body. During SwPs, protopodia detached from the substrate, with the posterior row of denticles moving to meet the anterior row of denticles, thereby inverting the cuticle and sequestering the whole protopodia into a travelling pocket (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). When protopodia ended their SwP, they unfolded from the sequestration pocket and then protruded into the substrate during the StP.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Protopodia protrusions in each segment are sequestered during swing phases of forward locomotion.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Schematic of setup for lateral imaging of larvae, using confinement in Pasteur pipette pre-filled with 0.1% (w/v) agarose.

By tracking the movement of defined points on bands relative to each other, we monitored intersegmental and intra-segmental movements during peristaltic waves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref>). In addition to moving relative to each other, denticle bands changed their shape during the sub-phases of a peristaltic wave. During forward waves (peristaltic contractions travelling in an anterograde direction), the anterior-most row of each denticle started to move after the corresponding posterior-most row (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>) and completed its movement after the posterior-most row stopped moving (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>), that is, there was an anteroposterior (AP) latency for both swing initiation (SI) (when movement begins) and for swing termination (ST) (when movement ends). Such a ‘rolling’ progression pattern is analogous to the ‘heel-to-toe' footfalls of limbed animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Federle and Labonte, 2019</xref>). To analyse this pattern further, we quantified the percentage of the wave duration spent in AP latency during SI and ST. For forward waves, this relative latency was generally consistent across the denticle bands on large protrusive protopodia but less pronounced for the smaller and less protruding protopodia at the extreme posterior and anterior abdomen and the thorax (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>). In backward waves, the heel-toe-like latency was reversed, with anterior-led latencies observed in SI and posterior-led latencies observed in ST (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Protopodia kinematics follow ‘heel-toe’-like footfall dynamics.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) (<bold>i</bold>) Brightfield image and (<bold>ii</bold>) schematic of second-instar larvae showing ventral side denticle belts which reside upon the protopodia and (<bold>iii</bold>) schematic of the imaging setup used for kinematic tracking.

For ERISM (blue), light originates from a halogen lamp (Lamp) and is spectrally scanned by a monochromator (MC) before being collimated by an achromatic doublet lens (AC1) and focused by another achromatic doublet lens (AC2) through a pinhole (PH). Light emerging from PH is then recollimated by AC3 into a kinematic mirror (KM1), directing it to KM2 which then directs the light under the nosewheel of a Nikon Ti2 inverted microscope. Under the nosewheel, the light is focused by an achromatic doublet lens (AC5) to a 50:50 RT beamsplitter plate (BS1), which directs the focused light to the back aperture of the objective (Obj). Light is then introduced onto the elastic resonator via Obj, whereupon it either enters the cavity, should it meet the resonance condition for the given cavity thickness, or is reflected, should it not meet this condition. Reflected light is then collected by Obj, focused by the tube lens (TL) and directed by the microscope turning mirror (TM2) then recorded by a camera (Camera). Though depicted as blue, ERISM typically scans through a spectral band from 550 to 750 nm. For WARP (red), light is generated by two 625 nm red LEDs (LEDλ and LEDλθ). For both LEDs, the light is collimated by aspheric condenser lenses (AsC1 and AsC2) and is then filtered by 633 nm bandpass filters (BPλ and BPλθ). BPλθ, is rotated roughly 15° such that the filter pass band is blue-shifted and the resultant transmitted light is approximately 90° out of phase (in terms of the resonances of the elastic cavity) relative to light passing through BPλ. These light paths are combined by a beamsplitter cube (BS2) and collimated using AC4 into the KM2, BS1, AC5, Obj common light path by a dielectric turning mirror (TM1) only present when using WARP. The LEDs are then triggered in an alternating pattern by a trigger circuit decade counter (TC) which is controlled by the trigger out of the sCMOS camera. (<bold>B</bold>) Working principle within the elastic cavity. When under stress (σ), the elastic cavity deforms from its resting length (L) to its strained length (ΔL). The change in cavity length causes a change in the wavelengths that fulfil the resonance condition of the cavity.

Here, we show that denticle bands are situated upon larger articulated foot-like cuticular processes, which act as locomotory appendages. Protopodia dynamically change shape during locomotion, allowing sequestration and presentation of denticles. Individual protopodia and individual denticles exert GRFs in the 1–7 µN and 1–48 nN ranges, respectively. Superficially, protopodia resemble the much smaller pseudopodia in cells – transient structures, similarly covered with actin protrusions, used by cells to facilitate movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Burnette et al., 2014</xref>).

Posterior denticle rows hit the substrate before anterior rows during deployment (ST) and left the substrate before anterior rows during removal (SI). This suggests that both deployment and removal involved rolling ‘heal-toe’ like movements, similar to footfalls in limbed animals, including terrestrial arthropods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Federle and Labonte, 2019</xref>). Removal but not deployment correlated with wave duration. In <italic>Manduca</italic> caterpillars, it has been noted that SwPs scale positively with wave duration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Simon et al., 2010</xref>); however, to our knowledge, there is no measurement for SI and ST in these animals.</p><p>SI latencies scaled positively with wave duration across most segments whereas ST latencies did not show this trend. SIs scale with SwP, and this could be mediated by proprioceptor activity in the periphery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Vaadia et al., 2019</xref>). Fine sensorimotor control of musculature during this process would allow for precisely tuned propulsion during peristalsis. In contrast, the more random nature of the ST suggests the process is less finely controlled. This could be a consequence of fluid inertia within the animal and/or the release of elastic energy from cuticle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sun et al., 2022</xref>) or relaxation of muscles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Simon et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ormerod et al., 2022</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>ERISM-WARP allows computation of GRFs in <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae</title><p>We adapted state-of-the-art mechanobiological force measuring techniques to enable measurement of substrate interaction dynamics of a freely behaving soft-bodied animal with micrometre spatial resolution, millisecond temporal resolution, and nanonewton force resolution. Previously, high-resolution force mapping was limited to cellular mechanobiology. Specifically, we developed microcavity resonators tuned to the vertical forces generated by larvae and employed ERISM and WARP to perform direct measurements of substrate interactions in anaesthetised and behaving animals. GRFs produced by individual denticles in anaesthetised animals were in the ~11 nN range. The measured vertical GRFs produced by the individual protopodia of each segment were in the 1–7 µN range, roughly three orders of magnitude less than the 17 mN recorded from an entire 1.72 g <italic>M. sexta</italic> caterpillar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lin and Trimmer, 2010</xref>). Our measurements provide fundamental constraints for future biomechanical modelling studies seeking to incorporate these structures.</p><p>Displacement and stress maps produced during larval crawling revealed that animals can control when and how protopodia contact the substrate. We observed that larvae travel surrounded by moisture from a water droplet, which produces a relatively large upwardly directed force in a ring around the animal. This surface tension produced by such a water droplet likely serves a role in adhering the animal to the substrate. However, during forward waves, we found that protopodia detached completely during SwP, suggesting this surface tension-related adhesion force can be easily overcome by the behaving animal. This observation, coupled with our lateral imaging of protopodia in constrained animals, explains how larvae prevent their rough denticulated cuticle from creating drag due to friction against the direction of the wave. Larvae do not simply pull protopodia off the substrate in a vertical direction; instead, they horizontally slide posterior regions forward in the axis of travel, before invaginating and therefore sequestering friction-generating features (e.g. denticles). This shows similarities to the use of shearing forces to detach adhesive pads in limbed arthropods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Federle and Labonte, 2019</xref>). Inversion of the cuticle to remove denticles from the substrate may also explain why natural variations in denticle count across animals do not strongly affect locomotor behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fitzpatrick and Szewczyk, 2005</xref>). The invagination process is reversed in order to expand the protopodia into and locally across the substrate, providing an expanding anchor which can serve as a postural support to enable locomotion and prevent lateral rolling during bilaterally asymmetric behaviours such as headsweeps. The dynamic anchoring during the progression of peristaltic waves thus serves to counteract horizontal reaction forces resulting from Newton’s third law of motion. Such a sequence of positioning points of support and anchoring them against the substrate has long been postulated to be a fundamental process in soft-bodied locomotor systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Trueman, 1975</xref>) and may be central to explaining why soft-bodied animals have evolved segmentally repeating bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Budd, 2001</xref>). However, WARP microscopy is largely limited to measurements of forces in the vertical direction, and though we can make inferences such as this as they are a consequence of fundamental laws of physics, we present this conclusion as a testable prediction which could be confirmed using a force measurement technique more tuned to horizontally directed forces relative to the substrate.</p><p>Our ERISM-WARP measurements also revealed substrate interaction from accessory structures. Immediately before enacting headsweep, larvae redistributed their body mass into naked cuticle in between protopodia along the midline, effectively fusing multiple protopodia into a single ‘ultra-protopodia’ that extends across multiple posterior segments. This redistribution occurs hundreds of milliseconds before the start of a headsweep, suggesting that it may be part of an active preparatory behaviour. Similar preparatory behaviours have been observed in caterpillars before cantilevering behaviours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lin et al., 2011</xref>), adult flies during fast escape behaviours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Card and Dickinson, 2008</xref>), and humans during stepping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Watanabe and Higuchi, 2022</xref>). More detailed characterisation of this behaviour remains a challenge owing to the changing position of the mouth hooks. Due to their rigid structure and the relatively large forces produced in planting, mouth hooks produce substrate interaction patterns which our technique struggles to map accurately due to overlapping interference fringes ambiguating the fringe transitions.</p><p>We also observed transient tripod-shaped substrate interactions in posterior terminal regions of larvae immediately before forward waves and headsweeps. Two bilateral cuticular protrusions covered in trichomes, labelled in previous work as anal papillae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zanini et al., 2016</xref>), are likely candidates responsible for these substrate interactions. However, the actions of these structures have hitherto not previously been described as a part of movement in soft-bodied animals. Each body segment has a preceding substrate-planted segment which acts as the anchor and lever to push the animal forward. However, A8 is an exception; it has no full preceding segment in contact with the substrate to counteract its muscle contraction. The tripod processes are ideally positioned to provide an anchor against horizontal reaction force generated by the initial contraction when moving forward (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7a</xref>) and might effectively form a temporary extra segment prior to initiation of a wave (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7b</xref>). The deployment of cuticular features as transient anchors has not been a focus of previous studies; future work should incorporate our findings into models of crawling behaviour. WARP and ERISM have technical limitations, such as the difficulty of resonator fabrication. This problem is compounded by the fragility of the devices owing to the fragility of the thin gold-top mirror. This becomes problematic when placing animals onto the microcavities as often the area local to the initial placement of the animal is damaged by the paintbrush used to move the animals. Further, as a result of the combining of the two wavelengths, the effective frame rate of the resultant displacement and stress maps is equal to half of the recorded frame rate of the interference maps. This necessitates recording at very high frame rates and thus requires imaging at reduced image size to maximise frame rates, but this in turn reduces the number of peristaltic waves recorded before the animal escapes the field of view. A further limitation is that WARP and ERISM are sensitive mainly to forces in the vertical direction; this is complementary to TFM, which is sensitive to forces in horizontal directions. Using WARP in conjunction with high-speed TFM (possibly using tuneable elastomers presented here) could provide a fully integrated picture of underlying vertical and horizontal traction forces during larval locomotion.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Proposed model for protopodia–substrate interactions during <italic>Drosophila</italic> larval locomotion.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Schematic illustration of forward wave propagating from posterior (blue) to anterior (yellow).

Due to Newton’s third law, there is an equal but opposite reaction force -<italic>F</italic><sub>h</sub> (A8).

This shows parallels to the regional specificity of function in a vertebrate foot. Specifically, the posterior medial region of the protopodia makes a large contribution to peak GRFs exerted during ST (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7b</xref>), similar in nature to a vertebrate heel strike impacting the surface prior to the rest of the foot. We propose that this zone of the protopodia acts as a vaulting point for the protopodia, functioning as a ‘point d’appui’ (point of support) as proposed in other soft-bodied animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Trueman, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Valentine, 1989</xref>). The transience of this vaulting point suggests it may be critical for locomotion, but dispensable for postural control during StP. The distal area of protopodia exhibited a similar transience. This increased force transmitted into the substrate is unexpected as the forces generated for the initiation of movement should arise from the contraction of the somatic muscles. We propose that the contraction of the musculature responsible for sequestration acts to move haemolymph into the protopodia, thus exerting an increased pressure onto the substrate while the contact area decreases as a consequence of the initiation of sequestration. Immediately after the posterior and medial protopodia impact during ST, the contact area of the outer region of the protopodia grew across both the AP and the ML axes. However, throughout the StP, this outer region then slowly retracted, suggesting it too was not critically important for maintaining posture during StP. This may reflect a transient anchoring mechanism – specifically, this anchor region deploys to provide greater friction for the subsequent segments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7c</xref>). This would allow the contractile wave to progress unimpeded by resultant reaction forces. Previously, such a function was thought to be provided mainly by mucoid adhesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Trueman, 1975</xref>). However, <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae are proficient at crawling over wet surfaces where mucoid adhesion is reduced or impossible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Apostolopoulou et al., 2014</xref>). Larvae can adhere to dry surfaces but have difficulty moving over these, although mucoid adhesion would provide optimal anchorage in this context. Water surface films appear to facilitate larval locomotion in general, but the biomechanical mechanisms by which this occurs remain unclear. We propose that protopodia act to provide an optimal balance between anchorage and adhesion depending on the environmental context. Overall, our work suggests that <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae use a sophisticated process of articulating, positioning, and sequestering protopodia to enable movement over terrain. Future work will be needed to determine the extent to which these processes are conserved across other soft-bodied crawlers.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Conclusions and outlook for future work</title><p>Combining ERISM-WARP with a genetically tractable model organism opens new avenues for understanding the biomechanical basis of animal behaviour, as well as the operation of miniaturised machines. Here we have provided new insights into the relatively well-studied behaviour of <italic>Drosophila</italic> larval locomotion. We have provided new quantitative details regarding the GRFs produced by locomoting larvae with high spatiotemporal resolution. This mapping allowed the first detailed observations of how these animals mitigate friction at the substrate interface and thus provide new insights into how locomotion is achieved in soft animals. Further, we have ascribed new locomotor function to appendages not previously implicated in locomotion in the form of tripod papillae, providing a new working hypothesis for how these animals initiate movement. It is our hope that these new principles underlying locomotion outlined here serve as useful biomechanical constraints as called for by the wider modelling community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tytell et al., 2011</xref>). We used <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae as a test case, but our methods now allow elastic optical resonators to be tuned to a wide range of animal sizes and thus create new possibilities for studying principles of neuro-biomechanics across an array of animals. In parallel, roboticists are increasingly moving to create miniaturised soft robots for a variety of applications. Our approach is well suited to provide ground truth, constraints, and inspiration for the development of such miniaturised machines. It also provides a potentially powerful new resource for evaluating the performance of these devices as our methodology will also allow scientists to measure GRFs during the operation of miniaturised soft machines. Importantly, while we have focused here on the movement of soft animals, our sensors could also be tuned to measure forces produced by small-limbed animals or miniaturised machines with rigid internal or external skeletons. Overall, this work therefore establishes a flexible platform for future investigations aimed at integrating knowledge across genetics, neuroethology, biomechanics, and robotics.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="top">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="top">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="top">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="top">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="top">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Biological sample (<italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="top">Canton S (wildtype)</td><td align="left" valign="top">Bloomingtons Stock Center</td><td align="left" valign="top">FBsn0000274 ID 64349</td><td align="left" valign="top"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td align="left" valign="top">OriginPro 2019b</td><td align="left" valign="top">OriginLab Corporation</td><td align="left" valign="top"/><td align="left" valign="top">Statistical analysis and plotting</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td align="left" valign="top">COMSOL Multiphysics</td><td align="left" valign="top">COMSOL Inc</td><td align="left" valign="top"/><td align="left" valign="top">Finite element method simulation resolving stress maps</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td align="left" valign="top">Python 3.0 and 2.0</td><td align="left" valign="top">Anaconda Inc</td><td align="left" valign="top"/><td align="left" valign="top">Cavity length map computation</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td align="left" valign="top">Inkscape v.1.01</td><td align="left" valign="top">Inkscape Organisation</td><td align="left" valign="top"/><td align="left" valign="top">Vector figure making</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td align="left" valign="top">FIJI</td><td align="left" valign="top">National Institutes of Health/SciJava</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">1.52p</td><td align="left" valign="top">Image analysis and manual tracking</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td align="left" valign="top">Phosphate-buffered saline</td><td align="left" valign="top">Gibco</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">10010023</td><td align="left" valign="top">Collagen coating</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td align="left" valign="top">Hydrochloric acid 5 M</td><td align="left" valign="top">Sigma-Aldrich</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">10605882</td><td align="left" valign="top">Collagen coating</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td align="left" valign="top">Acetic acid 95%</td><td align="left" valign="top">VWR</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">84528.290</td><td align="left" valign="top">Collagen coating</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td align="left" valign="top">Collagen-I</td><td align="left" valign="top">Millipore</td><td align="left" valign="top">L7220</td><td align="left" valign="top">Collagen coating</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Other</td><td align="left" valign="top">Gold grains (99.99%)</td><td align="left" valign="top">Kurt J.

Between 48 and 72 hr after flies were introduced to fresh media, feeding second-instar Canton S wildtype animals were selected with a size-exclusion criterion – any animals below 0.8 mm or above 1.5 mm were rejected. Animals were then washed and allowed to acclimate to 0.5% (w/v) agarose.</p><p>Immediately before experiments, a single animal was transferred to a freshly set dish containing 0.5% (w/v) agarose while still transparent. These dishes were then quickly placed onto the 3D-printed stage of a custom-built inverted Bresser Advance ICD stereomicroscope (Bresser GmbH, Rhede, Germany). Denticle band images were acquired, through the still transparent agarose substrate, at 60 frames per second for at least 1 min while the larva was freely behaving. All images were acquired using a XIMEA CMOS camera (XIMEA GmBH, Münster, Germany) through MicroManager 1.4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Edelstein et al., 2010</xref>). The velocity of 33 individual identifiable points across the animal’s body during peristaltic waves whilst imaging from the ventral side of second-instar larvae Denticle bands were tracked manually using the Manual Tracking plugin of ImageJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>). Analysis of tracking data was performed using OriginPro 2019 (OriginLab Corporation, MA).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>ERISM and WARP imaging</title><p>ERISM was used to record high-resolution maps of substrate indentations by monitoring local changes in the resonances of a soft and deformable optical microcavity. ERISM has been used to quantify cellular forces down to the piconewton range. The static thickness of microcavities was measured adapting our previously published ERISM method as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Liehm et al., 2018</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kronenberg et al., 2017a</xref>. In brief, images of the cavity were taken under epi-illumination with a series of 201 different wavelengths (550–750 nm in 1 nm steps). From these images, the minima in the spectral reflection for each pixel were correlated with theoretical values obtained from optical modelling for cavities of different thicknesses to determine the actual thickness at each position across the image (cavities were between 8 and 12 µm in static thickness). Thickness maps were converted into maps of local displacement by subtracting a linear plane using the mean thickness of the cavity in each corner.</p><p>For dynamic force mapping, we used a further improved version of the WARP routine described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Meek et al., 2021</xref>. Epi-illumination with light of two different and quickly alternating wavelengths was produced by passing the emission from two identical red LEDs (dominant emission wavelength 625 nm, FWHM 17 nm; Thorlabs Inc NJ) through two identical narrow bandpass filters (peak transmission at 633 nm, FWHM of 1 nm; Thorlabs Inc). By tilting the filter located in front of one of the LEDs by approximately 15° relative to the incident light, its peak transmission wavelength was tuned to λ<sub>θ</sub> = 628 nm. For the optical modes supported by our microcavities, this corresponds to a phase shift of roughly 90°, but remains within the same free spectral range band of the cavity. For the WARP measurements, we first took calibration images (under subsequent illumination at λ and λ<sub>θ</sub>) of the empty microcavity in an area with roughly linear slope in cavity thickness, for example, near where the silicone well containing the larvae meets the surface of the cavity. Images of behaving larvae were then recorded under rapidly alternating illumination at λ and λ<sub>θ</sub>, with the camera sending alternating trigger pulses to each LED to generate interleaved stacks of λ and λ<sub>θ</sub> images.</p><p>Displacement maps were obtained from these stacks using a series of image transformations, based around the fact that the ratio of the difference and the sum of pixel intensities at λ and λ<sub>θ</sub> is linked to local thickness in an unambiguous manner, at least across each free spectral range. See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4-figure supplement 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Meek et al., 2021</xref> for further details on the calculation of displacement from the λ and λ<sub>θ</sub> images. All WARP and ERISM images were acquired using an Andor Zyla 4.2 sCMOS camera (Andor Technology, Belfast, UK).</p><p>Stress maps were calculated from the ERISM and WARP displacement maps as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kronenberg et al., 2017b</xref>) using an FEM simulation via COMSOL multiphysics (COMSOL Ltd, Cambridge, UK) and the known mechanical properties of the microcavity.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Polydimethylsiloxane gel preparation</title><p>Polydimethylsiloxane elastomers were prepared according to the manufacturer’s guidelines for all gels. The two component precursors of different gels were mixed together in separate glass bottles using an equal mass ratio of the two components for Sylgard 527 and NulSil Gel8100 but a 1:10 volumetric ratio for Sylgard 184. Mixing was performed by 10 min of magnetic stirring (Sylgard 527 and NuSil GEL8100) or by 10 min of mechanical stirring (Sylgard 184). The elastomer mixtures were then combined in a fresh bottle in the desired mass ratio using a syringe following the same method as a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Palchesko et al., 2012</xref>). Combined elastomers were mixed for a further 10 min. Mixtures containing Sylgard184 were initially mixed by high-speed vortexing to coarsely disperse the gel to allow for the magnetic stir bar to overcome the high viscosity of the gel. After mixing, all preparations were degassed under vacuum for around 5 min, prior to fabrication of microcavities.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Anaesthetised animal force imaging</title><p>Animals were selected, cleaned, and placed in a fridge at 4°C for 2–3 hr to anaesthetise them. Immediately prior to experiments, anaesthetised animals were gently placed onto a collagen-coated microcavity in a Petri dish on ice. The microcavities were then placed, using a moistened paint brush, on the ERISM-WARP microscope and the animals were observed carefully. As soon as mouthhook movement was observed, an ERISM measurement was taken. Animals often had to be placed back onto ice to anaesthetise them once more as they rapidly regained motility. As the complete ERISM scan requires ca. 5 s, animals were required to be completely stationary in order to obtain reliable stress map images.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Freely behaving animals force imaging</title><p>Animals were selected according to the previously outlined criteria and cleaned before being placed onto a 1% (w/v) agarose-lined Petri dish. Elastic resonators were prepared according to the coating criteria mentioned above. 10% NusilGEL8100, 180 W O<sub>2</sub> plasma-treated microcavities were used for all freely behaving experiments. Once calibration images of the microcavity were acquired, excess water was removed from the cavity and animals were gently placed onto the cavity surface with a paintbrush, taking care to ensure there was enough moisture on the animal to prevent drying by wetting the paintbrush prior to transferring the animal. In order to keep animals on the sensor surface, a 50 µL drop of 15 mM ethyl butanoate (Sigma-Aldrich Inc, MO), suspended in paraffin oil, was dropped onto a 24 mm<sup>2</sup> glass coverslip before being inverted and placed on top of the silicone well (ibidi GmbH) such that the attractive odorant faced towards the animal but perpetually out of its reach. Animal substrate interaction was then imaged by WARP, using alternating wavelengths to generate a series of interleaved cavity resonance images, and displacement and stress maps were generated as described earlier. All WARP videos were recorded at 120 FPS, producing displacement maps with an effective frame rate of 60 FPS, using a ×4 magnification objective. Due to the high frame rate, we were limited to the use of ¼ of the total camera sensor, thus higher magnifications would prevent mapping of the whole animal.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>All statistical analyses were performed using OriginPro 2019 (OriginLab Corporation). Coefficients of determination (R<sup>2</sup>) for all but GRF vs. contact area analysis were determined using a linear fit. The rarity of backward waves during normal larval behaviour precluded analysis of latencies as used in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>. Adjusted coefficients of determination (Adj. R<sup>2</sup>) for the GRF vs. contact area analysis were performed using a second-order polynomial fit instead as this describes the data better than a linear fit. Two-way repeated-measures ANOVA was used in segmentwise peak contact area analysis as data were normally distributed according to a Shapiro–Wilk test. However, Levene’s test for homogeneity of variances was significant for SI (p&lt;0.05) but not for ST (p=0.092), we urge caution when interpreting the within-subjects' effects. Mauchly’s test showed sphericity of segment (W = 0.082, p=0.063) and the segment * SI-ST interaction (W = 0.27428, p=0.62463), where the SI-ST factor was not tested due to insufficient degrees of freedom. Independent-samples <italic>t</italic>-test was performed to show no significant difference between larval behaviour on elastic resonators and standard agarose substrates as data were normally distributed according to a Shapiro–Wilk test. Pairwise comparisons between segments all used Tukey-corrected <italic>t</italic>-tests. Force–distance curves were fitted using a height-corrected Hertz model; all force–distance curves were fitted with an R<sup>2</sup> &gt; 0.9.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Software, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Software, Validation, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Validation, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Software, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Validation, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>Measured effective Young’s modulus per elastomer mixture post plasma treatment.</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-87746-supp1-v1.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media xlink:href="elife-87746-mdarchecklist1-v1.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>The research data underpinning this publication can be accessed at: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.17630/f2a655d8-85c7-4bc0-b01b-b6f67aab2f07">https://doi.org/10.17630/f2a655d8-85c7-4bc0-b01b-b6f67aab2f07</ext-link>.</p><p>The following dataset was generated:</p><p><element-citation publication-type="data" specific-use="isSupplementedBy" id="dataset1"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Booth</surname><given-names>JH</given-names></name><name><surname>Meek</surname><given-names>AT</given-names></name></person-group><year iso-8601-date="2024">2024</year><data-title>Optical mapping of ground reaction force dynamics in freely behaving <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> larvae</data-title><source>University of St Andrews Research Repository</source><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.17630/f2a655d8-85c7-4bc0-b01b-b6f67aab2f07</pub-id></element-citation></p></sec><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by EPSRC (Doctoral Training grant EP/L505079/1 and grant EP/P030017/1), the European Research Council under the European Union’s Horizon 2020 Framework Programme (FP/2014-202) ERC grant agreement no. 640012 (ABLASE), and the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation via the Humboldt Professorship to MCG.

The force and displacement data generated by this method are a qualitative improvement on what was previously available for studying the larva, improving simultaneously the spatial, temporal, and force resolution, in many cases by an order of magnitude. The resulting images and movies are quite impressive.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their recognition of the achievements our work presents and for their feedback with regard to what they consider our most important findings and the points raised in their review. We will address these points individually below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(1.2) As it shows the novel application of recent technological innovations, the work would benefit from more detail in the explanation of the new technologies, of the rationales underlying the choice of technology and certain idiosyncratic experimental details, and of the limitations of the various techniques. In the methods, the authors need to be sure to provide sufficient detail that the work can be understood and replicated. The description of the results and the theory of motion developed here focus only on forces generated when the larva pushes against the substrate and ignores the equally strong adhesive forces pulling the larva onto the substrate.</p></disp-quote><p>As the reviewer correctly points out, our present work adapts a recently developed set of methods (namely, ERISM and WARP) for use with small soft-bodied animals. The foundational methods have been described in detail in previous publications (refs, 23 and 26). However, upon reflection, we agree that more information can be provided to ensure our work is more accessible and reproducible. We also agree that some additional clarifying information on our approach could be helpful. We have addressed this in the following ways:</p><p>(1) We have included a detailed Key Resources table in the methods section to allow for maximum transparency on equipment and reagent sourcing. This can now be found on Pages 16-19.</p><p>(2) We have modified the ‘Freely behaving animals force imaging’ section of the Materials and Methods section to include more detailed information on practical aspects of conducting experiments. These changes can be found on page 23-24 (lines 566–567, 571-577).</p><p>(3) We have re-ordered the Materials and Methods section, such that microcavity fabrication and microcavity characterisation occur prior to the description of ERISM and WARP experiments - this change should hopefully aid replication. Details regarding the application of a silicone well to the surface of microcavities have also been added (lines 472-474).</p><p>(4) We have added additional text in the Introduction and Results (Pages 3-4 and 7, lines 56-86, and 152-153) to explain our rationale for using ERISM/WARP and additional text in the discussion that discusses the potential role(s) of adhesive forces in larval locomotion (Page 12, lines 301307).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(1.3) The substrate applies upward, downward, and horizontal forces on the larva, but only upward and downward forces are measured, and only upward forces are considered in the discussions of &quot;Ground Reactive Forces.&quot; An apparent weakness of the WARP technique for the study of locomotion is that it only measures forces perpendicular to the substrate surface (&quot;vertical forces&quot; in Meek et al.), while locomotion requires the generation of forces parallel to the substrate (&quot;horizontal forces&quot;). It should be clarified that only vertical forces are studied and that no direct information is provided about the forces that actually move the larva forward (or about the forces which impede this motion and are also generated by the substrate). Along with this clarification, it would be helpful to include a discussion of other techniques, especially micropillar arrays and traction force microscopy, that directly measure horizontal forces and of why these techniques are inappropriate for the motions studied here.</p></disp-quote><p>We attempted to provide a streamlined Introduction in our initial submission and then compared ERISM/WARP to other methods in our discussion. We are happy to provide a brief overview of substrate force measurement methods in the introduction to help set the stage for readers. The Introduction section of our revised manuscript now contains the following comparison of different mechanobiological imaging techniques on pages 3-4 lines 56-86:</p><p>‘However, in the field of cellular mechanobiology, many new force measuring techniques have been developed which allow measurement of comparatively small forces from soft structures exhibiting low inertia (15–17) often with relatively high spatial-resolution. Early methods such as atomic force microscopy required the use of laser-entrained silicon probes to make contact with a cell of interest (15). This approach is problematic for studying animal behaviour due to the risk of the laser and probe influencing behaviour. Subsequently, techniques have been developed which allow indirect measurement of substrate interactions. One such approach is Traction Force Microscopy (TFM) in which the displacement of fluorescent markers suspended in a material with known mechanical properties relative to a zero-force reference allows for indirect measurement of horizontally aligned traction forces (17–19). This technique allows for probe-free measurement of forces, but the need to obtain a precise zero-force reference would make time-lapse measurements on behaving animals challenging; further, depending on the version used, it has insufficient temporal resolution for the measurement of forces produced by many behaving animals, despite recent improvements (20). A second approach revolves around the use of micropillar arrays; in this technique, horizontally-aligned traction forces are measured by observing the deflection of pillars made of an elastic material with known mechanical properties. This approach can be limited in spatial resolution and introduces a non-physiological substrate that may influence animal behavior (21,22).</p><p>Recently we have introduced a technique named Elastic Resonator Interference Stress Microscopy (ERISM) which allows for the optical mapping of vertically aligned GRFs in the pico and nanonewton ranges with micrometre spatial resolution by monitoring local changes in optical resonances of soft and deformable microcavities. This technique allows reference-free mapping of substrate deformations and calculation of vertically directed GRFs; it has been used to study a range of questions related to exertion of cellular forces (23–25). Until recently, this technique was limited by its low temporal resolution (~10s), making it unsuitable for recording substrate interaction during fast animal movements, but a further development of ERISM known as wavelength alternating resonance pressure microscopy (WARP), has been demonstrated to achieve down to 10 ms temporal resolution (26). Given ERISM/WARP allows for probe-free measurement of vertical ground reaction forces with high spatial and temporal resolution, it becomes an attractive method for animal-scale mechanobiology.’</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(1.4) The larvae studied are about 1 mm long and 0.1 mm in cross-section. Their volumes are therefore on order 0.01 microliter, their masses about 0.01 mg, and their weights in the range of 0.1 micronewton. This contrasts with the force reported for a single protpodium of 1 - 7 micronewtons. This is not to say that the force measurements are incorrect. Larvae crawl easily on an inverted surface, showing gravitational forces are smaller than other forces binding the larva to the substrate. The forces measured in this work are also of the same magnitude as the horizontal forces reported by Khare et al. (ref 32) using micropillar arrays.</p><p>I suspect that the forces adhering the larva to the substrate are due to the surface tension of a water layer. This would be consistent with the ring of upward stress around the perimeter of the larva visible in S4D, E and in video SV3. The authors remark that upward deflection of the substrate may be due to the Poisson's ratio of the elastomer, but the calibration figure S5 shows that these upward deflections and forces are much smaller than the applied downward force. In any case, there must be a downward force on the larva to balance the measured upward forces and this force must be due to interaction with the substrate. It should be verified that the sum of downward minus upward forces on the gel equals the larva's weight (given the weight is neglible compared to the forces involved, this implies that the upward and downward forces should sum to 0).</p></disp-quote><p>We have carefully calculated the forces exerted by protopodia and are confident in the accuracy of our measurements as reported. We further agree with the reviewer’s suggestion that gravitational forces can be largely neglected.</p><p>As the reviewer points out, one would expect forces due to upward and downward deflections to cancel when considering the entire system. However, we see indications that the counteracting / balancing force often acts over a much larger area than the acting force, e.g. a sharp indentation by a protopodium might be counteracted by an upward deflection over a 10-20 fold larger radius and hence 100 to 400-fold larger area, thereby reducing the absolute value of the upward deflection at any given pixel surrounding the indentation. This in turn increases error in determining the integrated upward deformation, making it difficult to perform an absolute comparison of acting and counteracting force. Further, recording the entire counteracting force induced deformation would require acquiring data with a prohibitively large field of view.</p><p>We agree that in some situations, water surface tension may be adhering animals to the substrate. Importantly, this is a challenge that the animal faces outside the lab in its natural environment of moist rotting fruit and yeast. The intricate force patterns seen in our study in the presence of water surface tension are therefore ecologically relevant. In other situations (e.g. preparing for pupation), larvae are able to stick to dry surfaces, suggesting that other adhesive forces such as mucoid adhesion can also come into play in certain behavioural contexts. A full characterization of the effects of water tension and mucoid adhesion are beyond the scope of this study. However, we have now added a sentence on pages 8 and 12 commenting on these other biomechanical forces at play:</p><p>‘We also observed that the animals travel surrounded by a relatively large water droplet (lines 189-190).’</p><p>‘We observed that larvae travel surrounded by moisture from a water droplet, which produces a relatively large upwardly directed force in a ring around the animal. The surface tension produced by such a water droplet likely serves a role in adhering the animal to the substrate. However, during forward waves, we found that protopodia detached completely during SwP, suggesting this surface tensionrelated adhesion force can be easily overcome by the behaving animal. (lines 301-307) .’</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(1.5) Much of the discussion and the model imply that the sites where the larva exerts downward force on the gel are the sites where horizontal propulsion is generated. This assumption should be justified. Can the authors rule out that the larva 'pulls' itself forward using surface tension instead of 'pushing' itself forward using protopodia?</p></disp-quote><p>Determining the exact ‘sites’ where horizontal propulsion is generated is challenging. In our conceptual model, movement is not initiated by protopodia per se, but rather by a constellation of muscle contractions, which act upon the hydrostatic skeleton, which in turn causes visceral pistoning that heaves larvae forward. This is based on previous findings in Ref 31. While there are indeed downward protopodial ‘vaulting’ forces prior to initiation of swing, we propose that the main function of protopodia is not to push the larvae forward, but rather to provide anchoring to counteract opposing forces generated by muscles. We agree that water surface tension could also be sculpting biomechanical interactions; however, a full characterization of how water surface tension shapes larval locomotion is beyond the scope of this study.</p><p>Since we have observed larvae move over dry terrain (e.g. glass) without an encasing water bubble, we do not believe that an encasing water bubble is strictly required for locomotion. We have also seen no obvious locomotion related modulations in the pulling forces created by water bubbles encasing larva, which would be expected if animals were somehow using water tension to pull themselves forward. Overall, the most likely explanation is that larvae use a mixture of biomechanical tactics to suit the moment in a given environment. This represents a challenge but also an opportunity for future research.</p><p>We have now added additional text in the ‘Functional subdivisions within protopodia’ subsection to discuss these nuances (page 14, lines 382-387):</p><p>‘This increased force transmitted into the substrate is unexpected as the forces generated for the initiation of movement should arise from the contraction of the somatic muscles. We propose that the contraction of the musculature responsible for sequestration acts to move haemolymph into the protopodia thus exerting an increased pressure onto the substrate while the contact area decreases as a consequence of the initiation of sequestration.’</p><p>and (page 15, lines 398-399):</p><p>‘Water surface films appear to facilitate larval locomotion in general but the biomechanical mechanisms by which they do this remain unclear.’</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(1.6) More detail should be provided about the methods, their limitations, and the rationale behind certain experimental choices.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment. As this significantly overlaps with a point raised earlier, we kindly direct them to our answer to comment #1.2 above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(1.7) Three techniques are introduced here to study how a crawling larva interacts with the substrate: standard brightfield microscopy of a larva crawling in an agarose capillary, ERISM imaging of an immobilized larva, and WARP imaging of a crawling larva. The authors should make clear why each technique was chosen for a particular study - e.g. could the measurements using brightfield microscopy also be accomplished using WARP? They should also clarify how these techniques relate to and possibly improve on existing techniques for measuring forces organisms exert on a substrate, particularly micropillar arrays and Traction Force Microscopy.</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, each of the three methods used has a specific merit. The brightfield microscopy was selected to track features on the animal’s body and to provide a basic control for the later measurements. However, this technique cannot directly measure the substrate interaction, it only allows inferences to be made from tracked features at the substrate interface. ERISM provides high resolution maps of the indentation induced by the larva; it is also extensively validated for mapping cell forces and the data analysis is robust against defects on the substrate (refs 23, 24 and 25). However, as we explain in the manuscript, ERISM lacks the temporal resolution needed to monitor mechanical activity of behaving larva. Its use was therefore limited to the study of anaesthetised animals. For mapping forces exerted by behaving larva, we used WARP which is a further development of ERISM that offers higher frame rates but at the cost of requiring more extensive calibration (Supplementary Figure S4). The streamlined introduction of the different methods in our original manuscript originates from our attempt to be as concise as possible. However, as state in response to comment #1.2, we agree that additional explanation and discussion will be helpful for readers and that it will helpful to briefly refer to other methods for force mapping. We have now added references to a variety of techniques in the Introduction (Page 3-4, lines 56-86) as stated in a prior response.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(1.8) As written, &quot;(ERISM) (19) and a variant, Wavelength Alternating Resonance Pressure microscopy (WARP) (20) enable optical mapping of GRFs in the nanonewton range with micrometre and millisecond precision...&quot; (lines 53-55) may generate confusion. ERISM as described in this work has a much lower temporal resolution (requires the animal to be still for 5 seconds - lines 474-5); In this work, WARP does not appear to have nanonewton precision (judging by noise on calibration figures) and it is not clear that it has millisecond precision (the camera used and its frame rate should be specified in the methods).</p></disp-quote><p>Previous studies have demonstrated the capabilities and limitations of ERISM and WARP. Upon reflection, we agree that our wording here could be more precise. To clarify our claim, we now separate the statements on ERISM and WARP in the introduction as follows (page 4, lines 78-83):</p><p>“Until recently, this technique was limited by its low temporal resolution (~10s) making it unsuitable for use in recording substrate interaction during fast animal movements, but a further development of ERISM known as wavelength alternating resonance pressure microscopy (WARP), has been demonstrated to achieve down to 10 ms temporal resolution (26)”</p><p>While WARP can achieve comparable force resolution as ERISM when used in a cellular context (c.f. Ref 26), we agree that for the present study, the resolution was in the 10s of nanonewton range, due to the need to use stiffer substrates and larger fields of view.</p><p>The camera used in our work was specified in the appropriate subsection of the Materials and Methods (“All WARP and ERISM images were acquired using an Andor Zyla 4.2 sCMOS camera (Andor Technology, Belfast, UK)”). We apologise that the exact frame rate used in our current work was not mentioned in our original manuscript; this has now been added to the ‘Freely behaving animals force imaging’ section of the Materials and Methods (page 23, lines 574-577).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(1.9) It would be helpful to have a discussion of the limits of the techniques presented and tradeoffs that might be involved in overcoming them. For instance, what is the field of view of the WARP microscope, and could it be increased by choosing a lower power objective? What would be required to allow WARP microscopy to measure horizontal forces? Can a crawling larva be imaged over many strides by recentering it in the field of view, or are there only particular regions of the elastomer where a measurement may be made?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that some discussion of the limitations of our technique will allow readers to have a more informed appreciation of what we are capable of measuring using WARP. However, as this is the first work to ever demonstrate such measurements, the limitations and tradeoffs cannot all be known with certainty at the present stage.</p><p>To answer your individual questions:</p><p>(1) There is a trade-off between numerical aperture and the ability to resolve individual interference fringes. Since our approach to calculate displacement from reflection maps relies upon counting of individual fringe transitions, going to a lower powered objective risks having these fringes blend and thus the identification of the individual transitions becoming impossible. The minimum numerical aperture of the objective will therefore generally depend on the steepness of indentations produced by the animals; the steeper an indentation, the closer the neighbouring fringes and thus the higher the required magnification to resolve them.</p><p>(2) From WARP and ERISM data, one can make inferences about horizontal forces, as is described in detail in our earlier publications about ERISM (ref, 23). However, quantitation of horizontal forces at sufficient temporal resolution to allow the investigation of behaving <italic>Drosophila</italic> larva is currently not possible.</p><p>(3) Many strides can indeed be imaged using our technique, however, this comes with additional technical challenges. Whether or not the animal itself can be recentred is an ongoing challenge. We have found that the animals are amenable to recentring themselves within the field of view if chasing an attractive odorant. However, manual recentering using a paintbrush risks destroying the top surface of the soft elastic resonator and recentering the microscope stage would require real-time object tracking which has been outside the scope of this original work, given the other challenging requirements on hardware and optics for obtaining high quality force maps.</p><p>To provide more information on limitations of our technique, we have added the following text into the discussion (pages 13-14, lines 356-370).</p><p>‘Despite the substantial advances they have provided, the use of WARP and ERISM also brings challenges and has several technical limitations. For example, fabrication of resonators is much more challenging than preparation of the agarose substrates conventionally used for studying locomotion of <italic>Drosophila</italic>. This problem is compounded by the fragility of the devices owing to the fragility of the thin gold top mirror. This becomes problematic when placing animals onto the microcavities, as often the area local to the initial placement of the animal is damaged by the paintbrush used to move the animals. Further, as a result of the combining of the two wavelengths, the effective framerate of the resultant displacement and stress maps is equal to half of the recorded framerate of the interference maps. To be able to monitor fast movements, recording at very high framerates is therefore necessary which, depending on hardware, might require imaging at reduced image size, but this in turn reduces the number of peristaltic waves that can be recorded before the animal escapes the field of view. A further limitation is that WARP and ERISM are sensitive mainly to forces in the vertical direction; this is complementary to TFM, which is sensitive to forces in horizontal directions. Using WARP in conjunction with high speed TFM (possibly using the tuneable elastomers presented here) could provide a fully integrated picture of underlying vertical and horizontal traction forces during larval locomotion.’ And further on page 13, lines 337-341:</p><p>‘More detailed characterisation of this behaviour remains a challenge owing to the changing position of the mouth hooks. Due to their rigid structure and the relatively large forces produced in planting, mouth hooks produce substrate interaction patterns which our technique struggles to map accurately due to overlapping interference fringes ambiguating the fringe transitions.’</p><p>We trust that the above discussion and our modifications to our manuscript resulting from these will address the reviewer’s concerns.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>(2.1) With a much higher spatiotemporal resolution of ground dynamics than any previous study, the authors uncover new &quot;rules&quot; of locomotory motor sequences during peristalsis and turning behaviors. These new motor sequences will interest the broad neuroscience community that is interested in the mechanisms of locomotion in this highly tractable model. The authors uncover new and intricate patterns of denticle movements and planting that seem to solve the problem of net motion under conditions of force-balance. Simply put, the denticulated &quot;feet&quot; or tail of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> larva are able to form transient and dynamic anchors that allow other movements to occur.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their feedback and the information regarding which of our results is likely to resonate most impactfully with readers from a biological background.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The biology and dynamics are well-described. The physics is elementary and becomes distracting when occasionally overblown. For example, one doesn't need to invoke Newton's third law, per se, to understand why anchors are needed so that peristalsis can generate forward displacements. This is intuitively obvious.</p></disp-quote><p>We are sorry to hear that the reviewer found some of the physics details distracting. To address this concern, we have simplified some of the language while still attempting to keep the core arguments intact. For context and analogy, we still believe that including a brief reference to the laws of motion is helpful for some readers to explain some of our results and highlight their general implications, especially with regard to anchoring against reaction forces.</p><p>One of our objectives is to make this article accessible and interesting for biologists and physicists at all levels. We feel it is important to reach out to both communities and try to be inclusive as possible in our writing. Newton’s 3rd law is clearly relevant for our study and it is a common point of reference for anyone with a highschool education, and so we feel it is appropriate to mention it as a way to help readers across disciplines understand the biophysical challenges faced by the animals we study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2.2) Another distracting allusion to &quot;physics&quot; is correlating deformation areas with displaced volume, finding that &quot;volume is a consequence of mass in a 2nd order polynomial relationship&quot;. I have no idea what this &quot;physics&quot; means or what relevance this relationship has to the biology of locomotion.</p></disp-quote><p>Upon reflection, we agree that this language may be overly complex and distracts from what is, at its core, a simple, but important principle governing how <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae interact with their substrates. The point we are trying to make is that our data show that forces exerted by an animal are proportional in a non-linear way to contact area. This suggests that to increase force exerted on the substrate, an animal must increase contact area. We do not observe contact area remaining constant while force increases, or vice versa. To make this result more clear, we have made several changes in our revised manuscript. Figure 5B no longer shows the relationship between the protopodial contact area and the displaced volume of the elastic resonator, but instead now shows the protopodial contact area and recorded force transmitted into the substrate. This then shows that in order to increase force transmitted into the substrate, these animals must increase their contact area. We have made changes to the figure legend of Figure 5 and the statements in the Results section accordingly (Page 9, lines 220-222).</p><p>2.3 The ERISM and WARP methods are state-of-the-art, but aside from generally estimating force magnitudes, the detailed force maps are not used. The most important new information is the highly accurate and detailed maps of displacement itself, not their estimates of applied force using finite element calculations. In fact, comparing displacements to stress maps, they are pretty similar (e.g., Fig 4), suggesting that all experiments are performed in a largely linear regime. It should also be noted that the stress maps are assumed to be normal stresses (perpendicular to the plane), not the horizontal stresses that are the ones that actually balance forces in the plane of animal locomotion.</p><p>We largely agree with the statement made by the reviewer here. However, we have found that in many contexts, audiences appreciate having the absolute number of the forces and stresses involved reported. Therefore, where possible, we have used stress maps, rather than displacement maps. We also observe that while stress and displacement maps show similar patterns, features sometimes appear sharper in the stress map, which is a result of the finite element algorithm being able to attribute a broad indentation to a somewhat more localised downward force. We have thus opted to keep to original stress maps. We have been more explicit about WARP and ERISM being more tuned to recording vertically directed forces throughout the revised manuscript (lines 75, 78, 86, 162, 301, 305, 336).</p><p>We have also modified our Discussion section to encourage further investigation of our proposed model using a technique more tuned to horizontal stresses (pages 12-13, lines 324-328):</p><p>‘However, WARP microscopy is best suited to measurements of forces in the vertical direction, and though we can make inferences such as this as they are a consequence of fundamental laws of physics, we present this conclusion as a testable prediction which could be confirmed using a force measurement technique more tuned to horizontally directed forces relative to the substrate.’</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2.4) But none of this matters. The real achievements are the new locomotory dynamics uncovered with these amazing displacement measurements. I'm only asking the authors to be precise and down-to-earth about the nature of their measurements.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their perceptiveness in finding that though the forces are interesting, the interactions themselves are the most noteworthy result here. We trust that with the changes made in our revised manuscript, the description is now more “down-to-earth”, more concise where appropriate, and accurate as to which results are particularly important and novel.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2.5) It would be good to highlight the strength of the paper -- the discovery of new locomotion dynamics with high-resolution microscopy -- by describing it in simple qualitative language. One key discovery is the broad but shallow anchoring of the posterior body when the anterior body undertakes a &quot;head sweep&quot;. Another discovery is the tripod indentation at the tail at the beginning of peristalsis cycles.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this recommendation. We agree that including a more explicit statement of some of our findings, especially with regards to these new posterior tripod structures and the whole-abdomen preparatory anchoring prior to head sweeps, would make the paper more impactful. As a result, we have modified the discussion section to include a statement for each new result and have also amended our abstract as a result (lines 407-416):</p><p>“Here we have provided new insights into the behaviour of <italic>Drosophila</italic> larval locomotion. We have provided new quantitative details regarding the GRFs produced by locomoting larvae with high spatiotemporal resolution. This mapping allowed the first detailed observations of how these animals mitigate friction at the substrate interface and thus provide new rules by which locomotion is achieved. Further, we have ascribed new locomotor function to appendages not previously implicated in locomotion in the form of tripod papillae, providing a new working hypothesis of how these animals initiate movement. These new principles underlying the locomotion outlined here may serve as useful biomechanical constraints as called for by the wider modelling community (39).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2.6) As far as I know, these anchoring behaviors are new.

We have therefore changed the wording in the description of 2e,f to refer simply to the fact that wave duration can ‘largely determine' latencies in some instances, but is less able to in other instances, as is suggested by the R^2 (coefficient of determination) data. In discussion, we have also adjusted our wording.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 4 - please provide in the main figure or as a supplement the full images (i.e. not cropped to the assumed shape of the larva)</p></disp-quote><p>We do not feel that it is necessary or helpful to provide the full images given that the focus of the analysis is on dynamics of protopodia movements.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 5e top: single data points around wave duration 0.6s appear to dominate fit lines. Does removing these points alter the fits? To support the argument that 5e top shows a correlation and 5e bottom does not, some kind of statistical test, ideally a hierarchical bootstrap, should be conducted to compare between the two measurements.</p></disp-quote><p>In Figure 5e, we are showing all waves analysed across animals. If we remove thedatapoints at 0.6 s, A2 R^2 changes from 0.24 to 0.05, A4 R^2 changes from 0.48 to 0.11, A6 R^2 changes from 0.69 to 0.34; however we don’t feel it is appropriate to remove these data from our analysis. We take the point about needing to be cautious about making claims about correlation versus no correlation and have now reworded description of these results along same lines as Figure 4.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It appears from the methods (467-489) that animals were kept wet for warp imaging but not for ERISM imaging. Please confirm or explain further the presence or absence of a water layer in these two sets of measurements, as this could affect the adhesion forces.</p></disp-quote><p>In each case, the animals were transferred onto experimental substrates with a moistened paintbrush. We have added text explicitly stating this in the methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Kim et al. Nature Methods 2017 (10.1038/nmeth.4429) describes recording two images separated by less than 60 microseconds using a scientific CMOS camera with a frame rate of 200 Hz. This is accomplished by triggering a pulsed LED once at the end of one frame's capture window and then a second time at the beginning of the next frame's window (see Supplementary Figure 10). I'm not sure if this trick is widely known, but it's worth considering if the authors are running into a problem with movement between the two wavelength exposures in their WARP setup.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this tip. We will take this under consideration for future work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Is the setup compatible with optogenetics? (EG is the red light dim enough that it wouldn't activate CsChrimson, or could a longer wavelength led be used for interferometry?) If so, activation of mooncrawler descending neuron (MDN) could be used to study backward crawling (or thermogenetic activation of MDN), e.g. to contrast the sites and order of &quot;anchoring&quot; between the two directions of crawling.</p></disp-quote><p>The set-up is potentially compatible with optogenetics.
