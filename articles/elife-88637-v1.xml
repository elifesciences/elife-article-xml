factors. Gli is thought to be activated at the tip of primary cilium, but the underlying mechanism has remained poorly understood. Here, we show that <italic>U</italic>nc-51-<italic>l</italic>ike <italic>k</italic>inase 4 (Ulk4), a pseudokinase and a member of the Ulk kinase family, acts in conjunction with another Ulk family member Stk36 to promote Gli2 phosphorylation and Hh pathway activation. Ulk4 interacts with Stk36 through its N-terminal region containing the pseudokinase domain and with Gli2 via its regulatory domain to bridge the kinase and substrate. Although dispensable for Hh-induced Stk36 kinase activation, Ulk4 is essential for Stk36 ciliary tip localization, Gli2 phosphorylation, and activation. In response to Hh, both Ulk4 and Stk36 colocalize with Gli2 at ciliary tip, and Ulk4 and Stk36 depend on each other for their ciliary tip accumulation. We further show that ciliary localization of Ulk4 depends on Stk36 kinase activity and phosphorylation of Ulk4 on Thr1023, and that ciliary tip accumulation of Ulk4 is essential for its function in the Hh pathway. Taken together, our results suggest that Ulk4 regulates Hh signaling by promoting Stk36-mediated Gli2 phosphorylation and activation at ciliary tip.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Hedgehog</kwd><kwd>Ulk4</kwd><kwd>pseudokinase</kwd><kwd>Gli2</kwd><kwd>primary cilium</kwd><kwd>Stk36</kwd><kwd>Ulk1</kwd><kwd>Ulk3</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35GM118063</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jiang</surname><given-names>Jin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000928</institution-id><institution>Welch Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>I-1603</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jiang</surname><given-names>Jin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Phosphorylation of the pseudokinase Ulk4 by Stk36 promotes primary ciliary tip localization of both proteins to facilitate the phosphorylation and activation of Gli in response to Sonic hedgehog.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Pseudokinases, which comprise ~10% of the mammalian kinome, play essential biological functions, yet the mechanism of action for many pseudokinases has remained unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jacobsen and Murphy, 2017</xref>). One such pseudokinase is <italic>U</italic>nc-51-<italic>l</italic>ike <italic>k</italic>inase 4 (Ulk4), which is a member of Ulk kinase family found in most eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Luo et al., 2022</xref>). The Ulk family kinases, which include Ulk1 (Atg1 in yeast) and Ulk2 involved in autophagy initiation, contain a conserved kinase domain in their N-terminal regions and a variable regulatory domain in their C-terminal regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Luo et al., 2022</xref>). However, unlike other Ulk family members, Ulk4 contains a pseudokinase domain at its N-terminus and is predicted to be catalytically inactive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Preuss et al., 2020</xref>). Ulk4 plays a key role in neurogenesis in mice by regulating neural stem cell pool and neurite branching morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Liu et al., 2016a</xref>). In addition, Ulk4 regulates the integrity of white matter by promoting myelination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Liu et al., 2018b</xref>). Recent studies have implicated Ulk4 as a risk factor for neuropsychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Liu et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Luo et al., 2022</xref>). However, the signaling pathways in which Ulk4 is involved and the substrates it regulates have remained unknown. A recent proteome study has revealed that Ulk4 interacts with Stk36 in addition to many other proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Preuss et al., 2020</xref>). Stk36 is also a member of the Ulk family and mammalian homolog of <italic>Drosophila</italic> Fused (Fu), a Ser/Thr kinase implicated in Hedgehog (Hh) signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Murone et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wilson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Han et al., 2019</xref>). A recent study identified Ulk4 as a genetic modifier of the holoprosencephaly phenotype caused by impaired Shh pathway activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mecklenburg et al., 2021</xref>). In addition, this study showed that Ulk4 was localized to the primary cilia and that Ulk4 knockdown affected Shh induced <italic>Gli-luc</italic> reporter gene expression and Smoothened (Smo) ciliary localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mecklenburg et al., 2021</xref>). These observations have raised an interesting possibility that Ulk4 may participate in Hh signal transduction.</p><p>The Hh family of secreted proteins governs embryonic development and adult tissue homeostasis, and deregulation of Hh signaling activity has been implicated in a myriad of human disorders, including birth defect and cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Villavicencio et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jiang and Hui, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Briscoe and Thérond, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jiang, 2022</xref>). Hh exerts its biological influence via an evolutionarily conserved signaling cascade that culminates in the activation of Gli family of Zn-finger transcription factors. The core Hh signal reception system consists of two multi-span transmembrane proteins Patched1 (Ptch1) and Smoothened (Smo) that transduce vertebrate Hh signal at primary cilia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Goetz and Anderson, 2010</xref>). In quiescent cells, Ptch1 localizes to primary cilia where Smo is barely detectable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Corbit et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rohatgi et al., 2007</xref>); the full-length Gli (Gli<sup>F</sup>) undergoes ubiquitin/proteasome-mediated proteolytic processing to generate a truncated transcriptional repressor form (Gli<sup>R</sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wang et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jiang, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Tempé et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wang and Li, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen and Jiang, 2013</xref>). Hh inhibits Ptch1 activity and promotes its ciliary exit, allowing Smo and Gli proteins to accumulate in the cilia to transduce the Hh signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Corbit et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Haycraft et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rohatgi et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Tukachinsky et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2011</xref>). Activated Smo blocks the proteolytic processing of Gli into Gli<sup>R</sup> and converts Gli<sup>F</sup> to an active form (Gli<sup>A</sup>) that enters the nucleus to turn on the expression of Hh target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wang et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kim et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Tukachinsky et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Han et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arveseth et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Although it is generally thought that Smo converts Gli<sup>F</sup> into Gli<sup>A</sup> at ciliary tip (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Goetz and Anderson, 2010</xref>), the underlying mechanism has remained an enigma. Our recent studies have demonstrated that two Ulk family kinases Ulk3 and Stk36 play a role in converting Gli<sup>F</sup> into Gli<sup>A</sup> by directly phosphorylating Gli2 at multiple sites in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Han et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zhou et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zhou and Jiang, 2022</xref>). Here, we provide evidence that Ulk4 acts in conjunction with Stk36 to promote Gli2 phosphorylation and Hh pathway activation. We show that Ulk4 interacts with Stk36 through its N-terminal region containing the pseudokinase domain and with Gli2 via its C-terminal regulatory domain to bring Stk36 and Gli2 into proximity. We find that Ulk4 is not required for Stk36 kinase activation by Shh but is essential for Stk36 ciliary localization and Gli2 phosphorylation. We show that, in response to Shh stimulation, both Ulk4 and Stk36 colocalize with Gli2 at the tips of primary cilia, and that Ulk4 and Stk36 depend on each other for their ciliary tip accumulation. We further show that ciliary tip localization of Ulk4 depends on Stk36-mediated phosphorylation of Ulk4 on Thr1023, and that ciliary tip localization of Ulk4 is essential for its function in Hh signal transduction.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Ulk4 acts in conjunction with Stk36 to promote Gli2 phosphorylation and Hh pathway activation</title><p>To determine whether Ulk4 is required for Hh pathway activation, we depleted Ulk4 by RNA interference (RNAi) in NIH3T3 cells, a well-established system for studying Hh signaling.

We recently found that the Fu/Ulk family kinases directly phosphorylate Ci and Gli2 on multiple sites to promote their activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Han et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zhou et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zhou and Jiang, 2022</xref>). In mammalian cells, the Ulk family kinases Ulk3 and Stk36 (mammalian homolog of Fu) act in parallel to promote Gli2 phosphorylation and activation in response to Shh (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Han et al., 2019</xref>). In addition, Gli2 phosphorylation depends on its ciliary localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Han et al., 2019</xref>). In this study, we found that Stk36 accumulated to the tip of primary cilium and colocalized with Gli2 in response to Shh stimulation, consistent with Gli2 being converted into Gli2<sup>A</sup> at the ciliary tip. In addition, we identified another Ulk family member Ulk4, which is a pseudokinase, as a mediator of Shh-induced Gli2 phosphorylation. We found that Ulk4 and Stk36 act in the same pathway but in parallel with Ulk3 to promote Gli2 phosphorylation and activation in NIH3T3 and MEF cells. The positive role of Ulk4 in Shh signaling could explain why elevated expression of Ulk4 in certain genetic background could suppress the heart outflow tract defects and holoprosencephaly caused by partially reduced Shh signaling activity in LRP2-deficient mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mecklenburg et al., 2021</xref>). However, it remains to be determined whether Ulk4 participates in Hh signaling <italic>in vivo</italic> by loss-of-function study. Because knockout of Stk36 in mice did not affect Hh signaling during development, likely due to functional compensation by other kinases such as Ulk3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chen et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Merchant et al., 2005</xref>), we do not expect that loss of function of Ulk4 will affect Hh signaling during development. Therefore, double knockout of Ulk4 (or Stk36) and Ulk3 will be necessary to address the physiological role of the Fu/Ulk family members in mammalian Hh signaling. In addition, it will also be important to determine whether Ulk4/Stk36 and Ulk3 could be differentially required for Hh signal transduction in different cell types/tissues or in different contexts, for example, development vs tissue homeostasis or physiological vs pathological settings.</p><p>To determine the mechanism by which Ulk4 assists Stk36 to phosphorylate Gli2, we explored whether Ulk4 regulated (1) the enzymatic activity of Stk36; (2) Shh-induced Stk36 kinase activation; (3) the association of Stk36 and its substrate; and (4) ciliary localization Stk36. In an <italic>in vitro</italic> kinase assay, we found that immunopurified Stk36 phosphorylated GST-Gli2N equally well regardless of whether it interacted with Ulk4 or not, suggesting that Ulk4 does not regulate Stk36 kinase activity. Rather, we found that Ulk4 is required for Stk36 to bind to its substrate Gli2. Ulk4 interacts with Stk36 through its N-terminal region that contains the pseudokinase domain and with Gli2 via its C-terminal regulatory domain. Depletion of Ulk4 diminished the physical association between Stk36 and Gli2. As a further support of the notion that Gli2 is brought to Stk36 through Ulk4, we found that the kinase domain of Stk36, which binds Ulk4, also interacted with Gli2, whereas its C-terminal region interacted with neither Ulk4 nor Gli2. Of note, despite being a pseudokinase, Ulk4 contains an unusual ATP binding site that might regulate its ability to bind other proteins such as Stk36 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Preuss et al., 2020</xref>). Therefore, it would be interesting to determine in the future whether ATP binding to Ulk4 could regulate Shh signaling or other processes that Ulk4 is involved.</p><p>Although Stk36/Ulk4/Gli2 complex formation appears to be constitutive regardless of the presence or absence of Shh, Stk36 kinase activation depends on Shh stimulation. Like Fu, Stk36 is phosphorylated on multiple sites in the activation loop of its kinase domain in response to Shh likely through trans-autophosphorylation, and activation loop phosphorylation is essential for its kinase activation. Using a phospho-specific antibody that recognized pT158/pS159 in the kinase activation loop of Fu/Stk36, we found that Ulk4 depletion did not affect Shh-induced phosphorylation of Stk36 on T158/S159, a readout for Stk36 kinase activation, suggesting that Ulk4 is dispensable for Shh signaling to activate Stk36. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, the kinesin-like protein Costal2 (Cos2) mediates the activation of Fu kinase by Hh. Therefore, it would be interesting to determine whether mammalian homologs Cos2, Kif7, and/or Kif27 participate in Stk36 kinase activation in response to Shh stimulation.</p><p>Hh signaling depends on primary cilia in vertebrates. Upon Shh stimulation, key pathway components such as Smo and Gli proteins accumulate in primary cilia, and Gli2 is accumulated to the ciliary tip and thought to be converted into its activator form (Gli2<sup>A</sup>) in this ciliary compartment. Consistent with this notion, we found that Shh induced ciliary accumulation of both Ulk4 and Stk36 that colocalized with Gli2 at the ciliary tip. Furthermore, we found that Ulk4 is required for ciliary tip accumulation of Stk36. On the other hand, ciliary tip accumulation of Ulk4 depends on Stk36 kinase activity and phosphorylation of its C-terminal region on T1023. Preventing Ulk4 phosphorylation on T1023 abolished its ciliary tip accumulation and its ability to promote Stk36 ciliary tip accumulation, Gli2 phosphorylation, and Hh pathway activation. These results suggest that ciliary tip accumulation of Ulk4 is critical for its function in Hh signal transduction, likely by increasing the local concentration of Stk36 and Gli2 to promote effective phosphorylation of Gli2. It would also be important to examine the localization of endogenous Ulk4 and Stk36 in the future as exogenously expressed epitope-tagged protein might cause artifacts. In addition, the precise mechanism and dynamics of Ulk4 ciliary targeting remain to be determined in the future. For example, it would be important to determine how phosphorylation of T1023 promotes ciliary accumulation of Ulk4. A recent study identified several motor proteins of the kinesin family (KIF1B, KIF3A, KIF3B, and KAP3) as the interaction partners of Ulk4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Preuss et al., 2020</xref>). KIF3A, KIF3B, and KAP3 are components of kinesin2 motor that act in conjunction with intraflagellar transport (IFT) complexes to transport cargoes into primary cilia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Goetz and Anderson, 2010</xref>). It would be interesting to determine whether Ulk4 T1023 phosphorylation affects its interaction with KIF3A, KIF3B, KAP3, or components in the IFT complexes. Of note, a previous study suggested that Ulk4 regulated the ciliary localization of Smo, although the underlying mechanism was not explored (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mecklenburg et al., 2021</xref>). Therefore, it remains possible that Ulk4 could regulate mammalian Hh signaling at multiple steps similar to what Fu does in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> Hh pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Claret et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Liu et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Both Ulk4 and Stk36 have functions outside the Hh pathway. Stk36 is required for motile ciliogenesis, and its loss of function affects the construction of central pair apparatus of ‘9+2’ motile cilia in both zebrafish and mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wilson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nozawa et al., 2013</xref>). Ulk4 malfunction also affects motile ciliogenesis of ependymal cells in mutant mice, leading to hydrocephalus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Vogel et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Liu et al., 2016b</xref>). A recent study demonstrated that Ulk4 and Stk36 physically interact to mediate the assembly of motile flagella in the flagellated protist <italic>Leishmania mexicana</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">McCoy et al., 2023</xref>). However, the biochemical mechanism by which Ulk4/Stk36 regulates motile ciliogenesis has remained unknown. Ulk4 could regulate Stk36 ciliary localization and/or kinase–substrate interaction like what we have discovered for their role in Shh signaling. The relevant substrates for Stk36 in motile ciliogenesis remain to be determined. Knowing the phosphorylation consensus sites for the Fu/Ulk family kinase may facilitate the identification of Stk36 substrates involved in the assembly of motile cilia and flagella. Initially identified Fu/Ulk3/Stk36 phosphorylation sites in Ci/Gli and Cos2 fall into the consensus: S/T(X)<sub>5</sub>D/E, where the acidic residue at +6 position is essential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Han et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zhou and Jiang, 2022</xref>). However, subsequent studies suggested that the spacing between the phospho-acceptor site and the acid residue appears to be flexible. For example, a Ulk3/Stk36 phosphorylation site in the C-terminal region of Gli2 has a spacing of six residues between the phospho-acceptor site and the acid residue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zhou et al., 2022</xref>). Here, we found that an Stk36 phosphorylation site in the C-terminal region of Ulk4 contains only four residues between the phospho-acceptor site and the acid residue. Based on these findings, we propose an expanded consensus site for the Fu/Ulk family kinases as S/T(X)<sub>4-6</sub>D/E. It would be interesting to determine whether this phosphorylation consensus sequence could be extended to other members of the Ulk kinase family such as Ulk1/Atg1 and Ulk2, which are the initiating kinases for autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zachari and Ganley, 2017</xref>).</p><p>Ulk4 has been implicated in several human diseases, including hypertension and psychiatric disorder such as schizophrenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Luo et al., 2022</xref>). Ulk4 also plays a role in neurogenesis in mice by regulating neural stem cell pool and neurite branching morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Liu et al., 2016a</xref>). In addition, Ulk4 regulates the integrity of white matter by promoting myelination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Liu et al., 2018b</xref>). How Ulk4 participates in these diverse processes has remained unclear. A recent study revealed that Ulk4 binds several other kinases and phosphatases such as DAPK3, LMTK2, PTPN14, as well as proteins implicated in the regulation of neuronal differentiation and axonal regeneration, including CAMSAP family proteins CAMSAP1/3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Pongrakhananon et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Preuss et al., 2020</xref>). Given our findings regarding how Ulk4 regulates Hh signaling, it is tempting to speculate that Ulk4 may also function as a scaffold to bridge kinases or other enzymes to their substrates and/or regulate the subcellular localization of the interacting proteins in other biological processes.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>DNA constructs</title><p>Myc-Gli2 and GST-Gli2 were described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Han et al., 2019</xref>).

It is proposed that ULK4 acts as a scaffold, facilitating the essential interaction between STK36 and GLI2, thereby driving GLI2 phosphorylation by STK36. Notably, the research reveals that the N-terminal pseudokinase domain of ULK4 binds to Stk36, while the C-terminal regulatory domain of ULK4 interacts with Gli2. Moreover, the study presents compelling evidence for co-localization of ULK4 and STK36 with GLI2 at the ciliary tip within NIH 3T3 cells. Importantly, ULK4 and STK36 mutually rely on each other for their accumulation at this ciliary tip.</p><p>This intricate mechanism, orchestrated by ULK4, brings to light the nuanced modulation of the SHH pathway.

Deregulation or even temporal imbalances in the activity of one of the main players in the HH field, sonic hedgehog (SHH), can lead to a variety of human diseases, ranging from congenital brain disorders to diverse forms of cancers. SHH activates the GLI family of transcription factors, yet the mechanisms underlying GLI activation remain poorly understood. Modification and activation of one of the main SHH signalling mediators, GLI2, depends on its localization to the tip of the primary cilium. In a previous study the lab had provided evidence that SHH activates GLI2 by stimulating its phosphorylation on conserved sites through Unc-51-like kinase 3 (ULK3) and another ULK family member, STK36 (Han et al., 2019). Recently, another ULK family member, ULK4, was identified as a modulator of the SHH pathway (Mecklenburg et al. 2021). However, the underlying mechanisms by which ULK4 enhances SHH signalling remained unknown. To address this question, the authors employed complex biochemistry-based approaches and localization studies in cell culture to examine the mode of ULK4 activity in the primary cilium in response to SHH. The study by Zhou et al. demonstrates that ULK4, in conjunction with STK36, promotes GLI2 phosphorylation and thereby SHH pathway activation. Further experiments were conducted to investigate how ULK4 interacts with SHH pathway components in the primary cilium. The authors show that ULK4 interacts with a complex formed between STK36 and GLI2 and hypothesize that ULK4 functions as a scaffold to facilitate STK36 and GLI2 interaction and thereby GLI2 phosphorylation by STK36. Furthermore, the authors provide evidence that ULK4 and STK36 co-localize with GLI2 at the ciliary tip of NIH 3T3 cells, and that ULK4 and STK36 depend on each other for their ciliary tip accumulation. Overall, the described ULK4-mediated mechanism of SHH pathway modulation is based on detailed and rigorous Co-IP experiments and kinase assays as well as confocal imaging localization studies. The authors used various mutated and wild-type constructs of STK36 and ULK4 to decipher the mechanisms underlying GLI2 phosphorylation at the tip of the primary cilium. These novel results on SHH pathway activation add valuable insight into the complexity of SHH pathway regulation. The data also provide possible new strategies for interfering with SHH signalling which has implications in drug development (e.g., cancer drugs).</p><p>However, it will be necessary to explore additional model systems, besides NIH3T3, HEK293 and MEF cell cultures, to conclude on the universality of the mechanisms described in this study. Ultimately, it needs to be addressed whether ULK4 modulates SHH pathway activity <italic>in vivo</italic>. Is there evidence that genetic ablation of ULK4 in animal models leads to less efficient SHH pathway induction? It also remains to be resolved how ULK3 and ULK4 act in distinct or common manners to promote SHH signalling. Another remaining question is, whether cell type- and tissue-specific features exist, that play a role in ULK3- versus ULK4-dependent SHH pathway modulation. In particular for the studies on ciliary tip localization of factors, relevant for SHH pathway transduction, a higher temporal resolution will be needed in the future as well as a deeper insight into tissue/ cell type-specific mechanisms. These caveats, mentioned here, don't have to be addressed in new experiments for the revision of this manuscript but could be discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that it would be important to investigate in the future the <italic>in vivo</italic> function Ulk4 in Shh signaling, the relationship between Ulk3 and Ulk4/Stk36, and possible cell type/tissue specificity of these two kinase systems. This will need the generation of single and double knockout mice and examine Hh related phenotypes in different tissues and developmental stages. The precise mechanism by which Ulk4 and Stk36 are translocated to the ciliary tip is also an important and unsolved issue. We include several paragraphs in the “discussion” section to address these outstanding questions for future study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>The authors provide solid molecular and cellular evidence that ULK4 and STK36 not only interact, but that STK36 is targeted (transported?) to the cilium by ULK4.

In a recent study (Preuss et al. 2020;PMID: 33147475), the critical Lys39 for ATP binding was converted to Arg (KR mutation); however, unlike in most kinases the KR mutation affect ATP binding, the K39R mutation in the Ulk4 pseudokinase did not affect ATP binding although it slightly increased ADP binding (PMID: 33147475). Another mutation made by Preuss et al(PMID: 33147475), N239L, affected protein stability, making it impossible to determine whether this mutation affect ATP binding. Therefore, in the absence of clear approach to perturb ATP binding without affecting the overall structure of Ulk4, it would be challenging to address whether ATP binding regulates the ability of Ulk4 to bind its substrates.Nevertheless, we discuss the possibility that ATP binding might regulate Ulk4/Stk36 interaction and Shh signaling.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The discussion is excellent, and raises numerous important future work in terms of potential transportation mechanisms of this complex.

Therefore, we relied on the measure Ulk4 and STk36 mRNA expression by RT-qPCR to estimate the knockdown efficiency (Fig 1- figure supplement 1). We used mouse Ulk4 shRNA to carry out the knockdown experiments in NIH3T3 and MEF cells while the human version of Ulk4 (hUlk4) was used for the rescue experiments (Fig 1- figure supplement 2; Fig. 8). We have confirmed that the mUlk4 shRNA targeting sequence is not conserved in hUlk4; therefore, the hULK4 construct is RNAi resistant. The rescue experiments strongly argue that the effect of Ulk4 RNAi on Shh signaling is due to loss of endogenous Ulk4. This argument is further strengthened by the observations that mutations that affected Ulk4 and Stk36 ciliary tip localization also affected Shh signaling such as Gli2 phosphorylation and Ptch1/Gli expression (Fig. 8).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The sequence of ULK4 siRNAs is not included in the materials and methods as far as I can see.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added the mouse Ulk4 RNAi target sequence in the revised version.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>In this manuscript, Zhou et al. demonstrate that the pseudokinase ULK4 has an important role in Hedgehog signaling by scaffolding the active kinase Stk36 and the transcription factor Gli2, enabling Gli2 to be phosphorylated and activated.</p><p>Through nice biochemistry experiments, they show convincingly that the N-terminal pseudokinase domain of ULK4 binds Stk36 and the C-terminal Heat repeats bind Gli2.</p><p>Lastly, they show that upon Sonic Hedgehog signaling, ULK4 localizes to the cilia and is needed to localize Stk36 and Gli2 for proper activation.</p><p>This manuscript is very solid and methodically shows the role of ULK4 and STK36 throughout the whole paper, with well controlled experiments.

The biochemistry results are overall very convincing. Some data lack quantification and there needs to be more information on data analyses and statistics. The following suggestions and comments aim at strengthening the manuscript.</p><p>1. Please provide quantification normalized to input for IP experiments (Figures 1 E - F; Figure 8 C). More information on data analyses and statistics should be provided and included as information in the figure legends.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the suggestions, we have done the quantification and statistics analyses for Figures 1E-G and Figure8 C as requested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Did the authors investigate whether overexpressing hULK4 in the control NIH3T3 cells leads to an increase in pS230/232 (related to Figure 1E)? This would nicely support the notion of a promoting effect of ULK4 on GLI2 phosphorylation.</p></disp-quote><p>We did not. We speculated that overexpressing hULK4 may not significantly promote GLI2 phosphorylation because Ulk4 is a pseudokinase and endogenous Stk36 (the kinase partner of Ulk4) is limited.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. The CO-IP experiments to show GLI2 activation were performed in NIH3T3 cells, whereas HEK293 cells were used for the experiments shown in Figure 2. Is there a specific reason for switching between cell lines also for experiments shown in Figures 3 C- I? Did the authors repeat some of the key experiments in both cell lines?</p></disp-quote><p>In mammalian cells, Shh-induced activation of GLI2 depends on primary cilia (Han et al., 2019). NIH3T3 cells form the primary cilia but HEK293T cells do not. Therefore, we used NIH3T3 cells to examine the processes that are regulated by the Shh treatment assay (e.g., the Shh-induced phosphorylation of GLI2 and STK36). The HEK293 cells were used to map binding domain between ULK4 and STK36/GLI2/SUFU due to the high transfection efficiency.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. In Figure 2 D-E the authors nicely showed that hUlk4N-HA interacted with CFP-Stk36 but not with Myc-Gli2/Fg-Sufu whereas hUlk4C-HA formed a complex with Myc-Gli2/Fg-Sufu but not with CFP-Stk36. In Figure 4E the authors showed in their Co-IP experiments that Fg-Stk36 and Myc-Gli2 form a complex independent of SHH treatment. Did the authors see some pull down of Stk36, still in complex with Gli2, using hUlk4C IP and pull down of Gli2, still in complex with Stk36, using hUlk4N IP?</p></disp-quote><p>We did not test that. As we have shown in Figures 4A and 4E, knockdown of endogenous ULK4 nearly abolished the interaction between Myc-GLi2 and Fg-Stk36, suggesting that Ulk4 is the major scaffold to bring Skt36 and Gli2 together, and that there is little if any direct interaction between GLi2 and Stk36.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Another method to verify hULK4-Stk36-Gli2 complex formation (Figure 4) would be helpful. For example, proximity ligation assays, tripartite split GFP assays, or colocalization based on expansion STED immunofluorescence microscopy could be performed to temporally and spatially resolve localization of Ulk4, Stk36 and Gli2 upon SHH stimulation in the primary cilium</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the suggestions. We think that our current study using biochemical and cell biology approaches have provide sufficient evidence that Ulk4, Stk36 and Gli2 form complexes. We will keep in mind of those more sophisticated methods in our future endeavors.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Please provide more representative images of Ulk4, Stk36 and Gli2 localization in NIH3T3 cells or lower magnification overview images showing more than one cell (Figure 5).</p></disp-quote><p>We have provided more representative images in Figure 5- figure supplement 1A-F of the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Confirmation of the results shown in Figure 5 in a second cell line would strengthen the data.</p></disp-quote><p>We have confirmed the results in MEFs (see Figure 5- figure supplement 1G-J)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Did the authors add immunofluorescence for tubulin as a ciliary base marker to ensure correct assignment of ciliary tip versus ciliary base localization for quantification experiments (Figures 5 - 8)?</p></disp-quote><p>It has been well documented that GLi2 is accumulated at the ciliary tip in respond to Shh treatment; therefore, we used Gli2 as a marker for ciliary tip where both Ulk4 and Stk36 were also accumulated. γ tubulin staining could be another marker to assign the ciliary tip vs base; however, the antibody combination we have did not allow us to simultaneously stain γ tubulin and acetylated tubulin (Ac-Tub).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. SMO localization as a further readout of SHH pathway activation might be considered to be added for some of the key results (e.g., Figure 6). Is SMO trafficking affected after depletion or overexpression of ULK4?</p></disp-quote><p>Due to the lack of a workable antibody to detect endogenous Smo in our hands, we did not determine whether the trafficking of SMO is affected after depletion or overexpression of ULK4. However, we noticed that a recent study reported that the SHH-induced ciliary SMO accumulation was impaired in Ulk4 siRNA treated cells (Mecklenburg et al. 2021). We include this information and its implication in the discussion section</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Do the authors see ULK4 only at the ciliary tip after SHH stimulation or is there also a dynamic time-dependent localization along the ciliary shaft? The image in Figure 6E (dKO + Stk36 WT) seems to show ULK4 also in the shaft.</p></disp-quote><p>Unlike Smo that is evenly distributed alone the axoneme of primary cilia, ULK4 is mainly accumulated at ciliary tips upon Shh stimulation. Ulk4 is also located at low levels outside the cilia and sometimes in the ciliary shaft during its transit to the ciliary tip (e.g., see Figure 5- figure supplement 1F1-2; J1-2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Is the immunofluorescence signal for Ulk4 significantly reduced after shRNA treatment to deplete Ulk4 (Figure 6A)?</p></disp-quote><p>We constructed a cell line that stably expressed ULK4 shRNA. The knockdown efficiency was determined by measuring Ulk4 mRNA expression (Fig 1_figure supplement 1). Because we were unable to obtain a reliable ULK4 antibody for immunostaining, we did not examine by whether ULK4 signal was depleted by Ulk4 shRNA.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. The labelled ciliary tip resembles in some cases images seen for ciliary abscission. The authors could use membrane/ciliary membrane markers to ensure &quot;intraciliary&quot; localization of the investigated factors.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the suggestion. We will try that in our future experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. How many replicates were used in the three independent quantitative RT-PCR experiments (Figure 1 A-D)?</p></disp-quote><p>We used 3 replicates in each independent quantitative RT-PCR assay.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Please provide p values or statement on no significance for the comparison between Ulk3 single and Ulk3/Ulk4 double knockdown (Figure 1C) and between Stk36 single and Stk36/Ulk4 double knockdown (Figure 1D; Fig1_Figure Supplement 2).</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the suggestion, we have added the p value or “ns” as asked.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Figure legends in general are a bit short could have some more detailed information.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the suggestion, we have revised the Figure legends as asked.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. What do the asterisks present in Figure 4 C-D?</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the suggestion. The asterisks in Figure 4C-D indicated the full length STK36 and truncated form STK36N and STK36C fragments. We that included this information in the figure legend.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. The authors state that a previous study described ULK4 as a genetic modifier for holoprosencephaly and that this raised the possibility that ULK4 may participate in HH signal transduction. Primary ciliary localization of ULK4 in mouse neuronal tissue and SHH pathway modulation by ULK4 in cell culture have been shown by Mecklenburg et al. 2021 before. Maybe the authors could rephrase their introduction and discussion accordingly.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the suggestion, we have changed the introduction and discussion accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Overexpression studies in heterologous systems using tagged proteins can potentially have an influence on their subcellular localization and function. Please discuss this caveat.</p></disp-quote><p>We have mentioned this caveat in the “discussion” section of the revised manuscript. However, we have tried to express the transgene at low levels using the lentiviral vector containing a weak promoter to ensure that the exogenously expressed proteins are still regulated by Hh signaling. We have also confirmed that the tagged Ulk4 and Stk36 can rescue the loss of endogenous genes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. More details in the Methods section should be provided on the SHH induction in NIH3T3 cells, HEK293 cells and MEFs.</p></disp-quote><p>We have revised the methods section on Shh induction.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. ULK4 is known to have at least three isoforms that exhibit varying abundance across developmental stages in mice and humans (Lang et al., 2014) (DOI:10.1242/jcs.137604). Can the authors speculate on potential common and distinct functions of the different ULK4 isoforms on SHH pathway modulation based on their present results?</p></disp-quote><p>It is interesting that Ulk4 has multiple isoforms in both mouse and human. Several short isoforms in both mouse and human lack the pseudokinase domain while one short isoform in mouse lacks the C-terminal region essential for Ulk4 ciliary tip localization. We speculate that the C-terminally deleted isoform may not have a function in the Shh pathway based on our results shown in Fig. 7 and 8 but might still have functions in other cellular processes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>The paper is well written, and clear throughout, with excellent (up-to-date) citations to the field.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank reviewer #2 for the positive comments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>My only quibble is that the immunofluorescence images are a little confusing, especially to people outside of the field. Please include an image of the whole field and improve the captions. Is that a single cell for each cilia? Why are there so few cilia? The DAPI makes it seem like What are we looking at? Are those multiple nuclei in Figure 6? They seem a little small if that's the 5 uM scale bar</p></disp-quote><p>We provide uncropped images of Figure 5E to show the entire cells (below). We have added some context to improve the captions. Most of the mammalian cells such as MEF and NIH3T3 cells contain a single primary cilium; however, mutilated cells do exist. The DAPI staining indicated the nuclei. The cells shown in Figure 6 have single nucleus (the scale should be 2 µM). Due to the unevenness of DAPI signals in the nuclei, only the strong signals (puncta) were shown for individual nuclei.</p><fig id="sa4fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-88637-sa4-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>One small typo: GLL2 instead of GLI2 on line 363</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks, we have corrected this spelling mistake.</p></body></sub-article></article>
