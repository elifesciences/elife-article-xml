The metabolic phenotype can be under selection and contributes to adaptation. However, the networked and convoluted nature of an organism’s metabolism makes relating mutations, metabolic changes, and effects on fitness challenging. To overcome this challenge, we use the long-term evolution experiment (LTEE) with <italic>E. coli</italic> as a model to understand how mutations can eventually affect metabolism and perhaps fitness. We used mass spectrometry to broadly survey the metabolomes of the ancestral strains and all 12 evolved lines. We combined this metabolic data with mutation and expression data to suggest how mutations that alter specific reaction pathways, such as the biosynthesis of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, might increase fitness in the system. Our work provides a better understanding of how mutations might affect fitness through the metabolic changes in the LTEE and thus provides a major step in developing a complete genotype–phenotype map for this experimental system.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>adaptation</kwd><kwd>metabolomics</kwd><kwd>LTEE</kwd><kwd>bacteria</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35 GM124976</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shah</surname><given-names>Premal</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35 GM147566</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yadavalli</surname><given-names>Srujana Samhita</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CCSG P30CA072720-5923</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Su</surname><given-names>Xiaoyang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100011132</institution-id><institution>Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yadavalli</surname><given-names>Srujana Samhita</given-names></name><name><surname>Shah</surname><given-names>Premal</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007558</institution-id><institution>Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Su</surname><given-names>Xiaoyang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Metabolomic analysis shows how genome-wide changes in gene expression propagate to and affect the metabolomes of an organism during adaptation.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Adaptation is the process by which organisms become fitter for the environment in which they live. While rooted in genetic changes, adaptive evolution can be studied at many levels of molecular and organismal phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dobzhansky, 1964</xref>). An organism’s metabolism is one of the fundamental molecular phenotypes supporting its life. It is no surprise, then, that adaptive evolution can proceed through changes in metabolism. Studies have found evidence of adaptation by comparing the metabolomes of closely related organisms. An analysis of metabolic differences between species of <italic>Drosophila</italic> found that these differences can affect lifespan and are sex specific (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Harrison et al., 2022</xref>). In prokaryotes, studies suggest that the genes involved in secondary metabolite production evolve quickly and produce large varieties of phenotypes. For example, strains of <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> that can produces surfactants can better mitigate oxidative stress compared to those that cannot (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Santamaria et al., 2022</xref>). <italic>E. coli</italic> have been shown to evolve repeatable metabolic changes when grown under selection to increase their biomass production and metabolism is often targeted for directed evolution when engineering organisms for industrial uses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ibarra et al., 2002</xref>). <italic>E. coli</italic> have also been shown produce coexisting subclones that occupy particular metabolic niches in a lab setting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Spencer et al., 2008</xref>). Despite these natural and laboratory-based examples, relating genetic, metabolic, and fitness changes is challenging because complete sets of molecular data are often unavailable.</p><p>Laboratory evolution experiments provide ample opportunities to study metabolic evolution. The long-term evolution experiment (LTEE) is an experimental evolution system where 12 replicate populations of <italic>E. coli</italic> (designated as Ara+1:6 and Ara-1:6, hereafter referred to as A+1:6 and A-1:6) are propagated in a carbon-limited medium with a 24-hr serial transfer regime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lenski et al., 1991</xref>). Begun in 1988, the LTEE populations have evolved for more than 75,000 generations, making it the longest running experiment of its kind. Over time, all 12 populations have continued to adapt to this environment. For example, relative fitness (measured as growth rate relative to the ancestral strain) has increased in parallel across the 12 populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lenski et al., 2015</xref>). Cellular size in each population has also increased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Grant et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Philippe et al., 2009</xref>). Parallel genomic changes in the LTEE are well characterized, and while some genes are commonly mutated across the replicate populations, most mutations are unique to each line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tenaillon et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tenaillon et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Good et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Limdi et al., 2022</xref>). Despite the variability at the genetic level, the evolved populations display similar gene expression profiles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cooper et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Favate et al., 2022</xref>). In principle, mutations and changes to gene expression could affect the proteome by altering the function of a protein, the amount of protein produced, or the conditions under which it is translated. Because proteins are the biological catalysts for cellular chemistry, mutations, and gene expression changes may affect the metabolome. In the LTEE, several examples of metabolic changes have been documented. The A-3 population has uniquely evolved the ability to metabolize citrate under aerobic conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Blount et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Quandt et al., 2015</xref>) and A-2 has produced unique, coexisting ecotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lenski, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Plucain et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rozen and Lenski, 2000</xref>). These ecotypes exhibit growth-phase-dependent frequencies and differ in their ability to metabolize acetate, with one ecotype (the L ecotype) specializing on glucose and the other (the S ecotype) on acetate. The transposable element induced loss of the rbs operon occurred early and prevents the evolved lines from growing solely on ribose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cooper et al., 2001</xref>). Reduced ability to grow on maltose has occurred through other mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Meyer et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pelosi et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Travisano et al., 1995</xref>). Despite glucose being the only source of carbon provided, significant changes in the ability to grow on other carbon sources have occurred (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Leiby and Marx, 2014</xref>). In particular, the mutator lines exhibit reduced performance on carbon sources other than glucose. The evolved lines have increased rates of glucose uptake as well as altered flux through some central carbon metabolism pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Harcombe et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>While specific examples of how genetic changes result in metabolic changes in the LTEE (citrate, acetate, maltose, ribose) exist, a more general survey of the metabolome is lacking. Such a survey would allow a better understanding of the effects of genetic and expression changes on metabolism and provide the ability to test hypotheses from previous data. By integrating genomic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tenaillon et al., 2016</xref>), expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Favate et al., 2022</xref>), and metabolic datasets, we can relate mutations to expression changes and their effects at the metabolic level. We provide ample evidence for hypotheses that specific genetic changes may exert their fitness-altering effects by changing gene expression and, ultimately, metabolism.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Survey of metabolic changes in the LTEE</title><p>We used liquid chromatography coupled mass spectrometry (LC/MS) to scan a broad mass range using both positive and negative ionization modes to survey the metabolomes of both ancestral strains and clones from each of the 12 evolved lines of the LTEE at 50,000 generations. We sampled two time points, 2 and 24 hr, to represent exponential and stationary phase samples, each with two biological replicates. It is important to note that the 2 hr time point captures the evolved lines, including A-3, during their growth on glucose. Additionally, the evolved lines reach stationary phase after about 4 hr of growth, with A-3 experiencing growth that levels off slowly over around 14 hr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Blount et al., 2008</xref>). At our 24 hr time point, the evolved lines (except A-3) have been in stationary phase for around 20 hr. The differences between the early, mid, and late stationary phases are unknown. Metabolite abundances were estimated using normalized peak areas relative to standards as described in the Data processing and description. Many metabolites are detected in both ionization modes, making it unclear which mode most accurately represents the abundance of the compound in a sample. As a result, we used the combination of a compound and the ionization mode it was detected in as a feature of the data.</p><p>We begin by surveying the data in a metabolome-wide manner. Because <italic>E. coli</italic> exhibits large physiological differences across growth phases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jaishankar and Srivastava, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pletnev et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Navarro Llorens et al., 2010</xref>), we expected comparisons within a growth phase to be more similar than comparisons across growth phases. Indeed, the distribution of within growth-phase correlations of metabolite abundances is higher than the distribution of across growth-phase correlations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Because growth-specific differences have the potential to drown out signals of adaptation, we performed all subsequent analyses in a growth-phase-specific manner.</p><p>To identify large-scale differences in metabolite abundances, we performed a principal component analysis (PCA) of metabolite abundances in a phase-specific manner. In the exponential phase, the PCA strongly separates A-3 from the other samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). This is possibly due to the unique ability of A-3 to metabolize citrate. Citrate is present in the medium because it was originally added as a chelating agent. However, mutations in A-3 have allowed it to metabolize citrate under aerobic conditions, giving it access to additional carbon that the other lines do not have (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Turner et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Blount et al., 2012</xref>). Half of the evolved lines have a mutator phenotype and have at least an order of magnitude higher number of fixed point mutations than the non-mutators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tenaillon et al., 2016</xref>). Despite the large differences in the number of mutations that have accumulated, we do not observe a strong effect of mutator status on the separation between evolved lines in the PCA. This is consistent with previous observations of a minimal effect of mutator status on changes in gene expression patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Favate et al., 2022</xref>). The first two principal components are dominated by contributions of nucleoside monophosphates, amino acids, and compounds involved in carbon metabolism, such as glucose and succinate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Comparison of metabolic changes in evolved lines within each growth phase.</title><p>(<bold>A, B</bold>) Principal component analysis based on <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mi>g</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>10</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mspace width="thinmathspace"/><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>z</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mspace width="thinmathspace"/><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>k</mml:mi><mml:mspace width="thinmathspace"/><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mstyle></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> separated by growth phase.

The primary driver of variation in the first principal component (PC1) is the relative abundances of compounds in A-3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4A</xref>). In addition to A-3, A-2 also shows a higher degree of separation from the other lines. Though this experiment was performed with single clones, the 12 flasks in the LTEE are not isoclonal but instead consist of competing subclones that sometimes coexist for extended periods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Good et al., 2017</xref>). A-2 is the best-understood example, consisting of two major subclones, L and S (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lenski, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Plucain et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rozen and Lenski, 2000</xref>). The observed separation might be because the A-2 clone in this experiment comes from the L ecotype, which does not grow as well on acetate compared to the other lines. In contrast to exponential phase PCA, mutator status appears to be a driving factor of PC2 in the stationary phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4B</xref>) with mutator lines having lower abundances of nucleoside monophosphates relative to non-mutators during stationary phase. What this is indicative of is unclear.</p><p>A common theme in studies of LTEE is the high degree of parallelism observed at the genetic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tenaillon et al., 2016</xref>), gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Favate et al., 2022</xref>), and fitness levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wiser et al., 2013</xref>). For example, genes involved in flagellar biosynthesis and amino acid metabolism are commonly mutated across the evolved lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tenaillon et al., 2016</xref>) with associated changes in expression levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Favate et al., 2022</xref>). To examine the extent of parallel changes in metabolites, we calculated the ratio of the peak area in an evolved line to the peak area in the ancestor for each compound after averaging biological replicates. Pairwise Spearman’s correlations using these ratios are significantly higher than expected when comparing the observed distribution to a distribution generated by randomizing fold-changes within a sample prior to calculating correlations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf6"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">p</mml:mi><mml:mo>&lt;</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.001</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>, <italic>t</italic>-test). In the exponential phase, the lowest correlations were mainly between a pair involving one of A-2, A-4, or A-6, and another evolved line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). The correlations of metabolite abundances across evolved lines are more similar in the exponential phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) than in the stationary phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>) (<italic>t</italic>-test comparing the observed exponential and stationary phase correlations in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf7"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">p</mml:mi><mml:mo>&lt;</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.001</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>). It may be that the strategies of metabolite usage and abundance in the rapidly growing exponential phase are more similar across lines than the strategies of survival are in the stationary phase or that there is less selection on the metabolome during the stationary phase. Further studies would be required to understand this phenomenon.</p><p>To further quantify the extent of shared changes, we considered the difference between the number of shared changes that were observed and expected to be observed by chance. We approximated an expected distribution of shared changes using a Sum of Independent Non-Identical Binomial Random Variables (SINIB) method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Liu and Quertermous, 2018</xref>), essentially asking what the chance of repeatedly observing the same change in an increasing number of evolved lines is. For more details on this method, see Theoretical distributions for parallel changes in metabolites. For metabolic features (the combination of a compound and the ionization mode it was detected in) that shared alterations in only a few lines (generally six or less), we cannot suggest selection on these changes because we see fewer or as many changes as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplement 6</xref>). These may represent metabolites that negatively affect fitness when altered. On the other hand, we observe more changes shared in a higher number of evolved lines than expected. These shared changes may be beneficial, but this would need to be clarified by additional experiments. By combining genomic, expression, and metabolic datasets, we can better explore the nature of these changes and how they may impact fitness.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Increased nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide may facilitate higher energy demands during adaptation</title><p>In the LTEE, mutations to the nadR gene have occurred in all of the evolved lines and appear to have been under strong selection to improve fitness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Woods et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tenaillon et al., 2016</xref>).

ArgR, along with arginine, negatively autoregulates the arginine biosynthesis pathway by downregulating the participating genes when arginine is abundant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tian and Maas, 1994</xref>). As an amino acid, the primary role of arginine is in protein synthesis. However, various reactions produce and consume arginine; both its synthesis and the regulation of the enzymes involved are complex (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Charlier and Glansdorff, 2004</xref> and the EcoCyc <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Keseler et al., 2005</xref> pathway ‘superpathway of arginine and polyamine biosynthesis’). For example, arginine can be a source of nitrogen and carbon or be used for ATP synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Reitzer, 2005</xref>). Because of these complications, if mutations in argR and the subsequent changes in gene expression do affect this pathway, it is unclear at which step one might observe a change or if that change might be in a different pathway.</p><p>Mutations in argR are localized to specific regions, potentially disrupting the DNA-binding domain, the arginine sensing domain, or interaction domain, which is required for hexermerization of the protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tian and Maas, 1994</xref>).

This pattern also persisted in the stationary phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). While arginine is increased in both growth phases in most of the evolved lines, other compounds in this pathway show highly variable changes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Despite the consistent relationship between mutations, expression changes, and changes in the abundance of arginine, how this might affect fitness is not obvious. Higher intracellular abundances of amino acids could facilitate higher translation rates and promote faster growth. While we do observe that some amino acids show increases in their abundances in most evolved lines in the exponential phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>), further experiments would be needed to confirm if these amino acids are used in protein synthesis or in other pathways.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Functional changes in the central carbon metabolism</title><p>Low carbon availability is the key feature of the minimal medium used in the LTEE, and selection for better use of carbon is a driving force of adaptation in the system. Hence, how mutations and expression changes might affect fitness by altering central carbon metabolism pathways is of interest. The evolved lines have seen significant positive and negative changes in their ability to grow on different carbon substrates. Rather than metabolic specialization, this was found to be due to the accumulation of deleterious mutations that affect the ability to grow on other substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Leiby and Marx, 2014</xref>). Unique changes in A-3 allow it to metabolize citrate under aerobic conditions, granting it access to extra carbon from an unused ecological niche (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Blount et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Quandt et al., 2015</xref>). The evolved lines retain more carbon in their biomass compared to the ancestors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Turner et al., 2017</xref>), and increased glucose uptake rates have been demonstrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Harcombe et al., 2013</xref>). Despite the abundance of molecular data associated with the LTEE, the highly networked nature of the genes and metabolites involved in central carbon metabolism makes relating the various molecular data to each other challenging. In particular, mass spectrometry data alone will not allow us to differentiate between sources for compounds that are generated by many reactions. We might overcome this limitation by combining genomic, expression, and metabolic datasets.</p><p>We again sought instances of parallel sets of mutations and expression changes that may exert their effects at the metabolic level. Three genes that are key components in the glyoxylate cycle, aceB, aceA, and aceK were commonly upregulated in the evolved lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Favate et al., 2022</xref>). Their transcriptional regulators iclR and arcB are heavily mutated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tenaillon et al., 2016</xref>), and this is known to be beneficial in the LTEE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Quandt et al., 2015</xref>). The glyoxylate cycle allows the use of acetate as a carbon source by converting it to succinate, which can later be fed into the citric acid cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Keseler et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cioni et al., 1981</xref>). Because these genes had increased expression, the compounds they produce (succinate, glyoxylate, and malate) may be elevated in the evolved lines relative to the ancestor. Succinate and malate were reliably identified in our data, but glyoxylate was not. Unfortunately, acetate was part of the mobile phase of our liquid chromatography setup, thus preventing its accurate quantification. Likewise, most of the molecules in the glyoxylate cycle, including succinate and malate, are also components of the citric acid cycle and can be produced or consumed by other enzymes. Because we cannot distinguish where changes in these metabolites come from, we chose to look at compounds from central carbon metabolism in general, considering compounds from the glyoxylate cycle, glycolysis, and the citric acid cycle.</p><p>Overall, 18 compounds from these pathways are detected in our LC/MS assay. Regarding the glyoxylate shunt, malate, aconitate, and succinate were generally elevated in the evolved lines (median fold-change of 5.38, 1.66, and 2.30, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>)). Interestingly, the evolved lines appear to have similar or lower amounts of glucose despite having been shown to have increased glucose uptake rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Harcombe et al., 2013</xref>). This discrepancy is likely due to the fact that in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Harcombe et al., 2013</xref>, glucose uptake rates were calculated by measuring the depletion of glucose in the medium, whereas we measured glucose from inside the cells. Once inside the cell, we suspect that the glucose is quickly used.

It was previously noted that all of the evolved lines contain what are likely inactivating mutations in the gene pykF. pykF encodes pyruvate kinase I, one of two isozymes that generate ATP by converting PEP to pyruvate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Philippe et al., 2007</xref>). It was thought that inactivating mutations in pykF reduce the conversion of PEP to pyruvate, forcing a buildup of PEP, and that because PEP is the energy source for glucose import in the sugar-transporting phosphotransferase system, a buildup of PEP might increase glucose uptake rates. Our data, which shows increases in PEP, lend support to these hypotheses.</p><p>The citric acid cycle is a major metabolic pathway that extracts energy via the reduction of electron carriers like NAD. These electrons are shuttled to the electron transport chain by NAD, where they are used to generate ATP. NAD can be reduced at two points during the citric acid cycle, the conversion of alpha-ketoglutarate to succinate and the conversion of malate to oxaloacetate. If the citric acid cycle is running faster in the evolved lines due to their higher growth rates and hence higher energy demands, then more NAD may be required to efficiently shuttle electrons from the citric acid cycle to the electron transport chain. Interestingly, we measured a median fold-change of 3.13 for alpha-ketoglutarate and 5.38 for malate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Additionally, increases in these compounds are correlated with an increase in NAD compounds within an evolved line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). It may be that increases in NAD allow faster operation of the citric acid cycle. However, alternative hypotheses must be considered.</p><p>Overflow metabolism appears to be common in the evolved lines. Overflow metabolism refers to the seemingly wasteful production of metabolites that do not participate in the most efficient form of ATP generation, even when glycolytic substrates and oxygen are plentiful. The Warburg effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Warburg, 1956</xref>) and acetate production are examples of this phenomenon in human cancers and <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Enjalbert et al., 2017</xref>), respectively. Our observation of the buildup of PEP is an example of overflow metabolism and may lend support to the hypothesis that the evolved lines are using overflow metabolism to gain access to the glycolytic intermediates and using them for other purposes, like as an energy source for sugar import. Experiments using radioactive tracers to study flux through these pathways are needed to confirm any hypotheses.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The metabolome of a cell is the integration point of an organism’s environment, genetics, and gene expression patterns. Metabolism has been shown to contribute to generating adaptive phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Harrison et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Miyazawa and Noguchi, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hefetz and Blum, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chevrette et al., 2020</xref>). However, how mutations affect metabolism through changes in gene expression and ultimately affect fitness is less clear. Specific examples of this have been studied in the LTEE, such as the acquisition of citrate metabolism in A-3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Blount et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Quandt et al., 2015</xref>). We used metabolic mass spectrometry to study other aspects of the LTEE, relating mutations and expression changes to metabolic changes. This allowed us to lend support to previous hypotheses of how certain mutations affect fitness in the system. For instance, we show how mutations in nadR alter the expression of its target genes and increase the intracellular abundance of NAD. It also enables new areas of investigation, such as what role mutations to argR and subsequent expression and metabolic changes might mean for the system.</p><p>A key limitation of the data presented here is that it contains measurements of 196 metabolites out of the 3755 metabolites currently annotated in the <italic>E. coli</italic> metabolome database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sajed et al., 2016</xref>). Nonetheless, analysis of this subset of data can reveal some global patterns of metabolite changes. For example, distinct clustering of A-3 and A-2 in the PCAs suggests that even with a limited sampling of the metabolome, the unique characteristics of these lineages are observable at the metabolic level. Interestingly, while the mutator lines do not form a well-defined group in the exponential phase, their reduced abundances of nucleoside monophosphates in the stationary phase group them together (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Due to deletions of key biosynthetic genes, the mutators are less flexible than the non-mutators in their ability to grow on different carbon sources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Leiby and Marx, 2014</xref>). A-6, in particular, has one of the higher mutational burdens and is the least flexible in its ability to grow on different carbon substrates. Pathways with missing or broken genes may cause the shunting of those compounds to different pathways while also starving downstream reactions of the now missing reactants.</p><p>Though most studies of the LTEE focus on the activity of the evolved lines in the exponential phase, they spend most of their time in the stationary phase. Experiments studying the evolution of <italic>E. coli</italic> during long-term stationary phase (around 3 years of culture with no addition of resources) showed that mutations continue to accumulate during this time and that patterns suggestive of adaptive evolution had occurred (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Katz et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ratib et al., 2021</xref>). While our study chose the latest possible time point for examining the stationary phase (immediately before the transfer to a new flask), differences between early, mid, and late stationary phases may exist. Time course experiments with a finer resolution would reveal details about the specific nature of the stationary phase in the LTEE.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell culture</title><p>The A-3 clone used in this experiment is capable of metabolizing citrate, and the clone of A-2 is the L variant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Favate et al., 2022</xref>). Frozen bacterial stocks were revived by growing them in 5 ml LB broth for 24 hr. Following this, 1% of each culture was transferred to 5 ml standard LTEE medium for another 24 hr. After 24 hr, these cultures were used to initiate the final experimental cultures. Each clone was grown in 250 ml of medium in a 1-l flask following standard LTEE protocols. The medium used was standard LTEE medium with the standard amount of glucose, 25 mg/ml. After 2 hr of growth, 160 ml of the sample was removed for exponential phase mass spectrometry samples. After 24 hr of growth, 40 ml of the sample was removed for stationary phase samples.

When filtration was complete, the filter was placed cell-side down into the Petri dish. The metal tray was moved to wet ice to extract for 20 min. After 20 min, the acid was neutralized by the addition of 1.07% (final) ammonium bicarbonate, then cell debris was spun down at 14,000 rpm at 4°C for 10 min, and the clarified extract was transferred to a chilled 2 ml tube and stored at −20°C.

Normalization of the mass spectrometry data was performed in two steps. First, raw peak areas were normalized against internal standards as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Su et al., 2020</xref>. After these values were generated, all other data processing steps were performed using the R programming language (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">R Development Core Team, 2022</xref>) and the tidyverse set of packages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wickham et al., 2019</xref>). Code for this section can be found in the document titled data_processing.Rmd. Peak areas resulting from the first step of normalization were then taken as a proportion of the total peak area for a single sample to normalize against differences in input amounts.</p><p>As noted in the text, not all of the 196 compounds were detected in all samples. This varied depending on the compound, line, growth phase, and ionization mode. Overall, 168 compounds were present in all samples in at least one ionization mode, with the remaining 28 compounds being undetected in at least one of the samples in at least one of the ionization modes. We used methods from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wei et al., 2018</xref> and the accompanying R package imputeLCMD to evaluate different imputation methods for imputing missing data, settling on the quantile regression imputation of left-censored (QRILC) data method. Imputed values theoretically represent values below the limit of detection rather than a complete absence of compounds. As expected, our imputed values always fell below the detected values for a given compound (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). After imputation was performed, correlations between the replicates were high (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Compounds that were detected in both ionization modes show a modest correlation within a sample (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Distributions of normalized peak areas are similar across replicates and samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). This completed dataset was used for further analysis and is available as <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>. Where appropriate, we show data from both ionization modes, treating the combination of a compound and the ionization mode it was detected in as a feature of the data and compare these across samples.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Theoretical distributions for parallel changes in metabolites</title><p>The code for this analysis can be found in the document titled parallelism.Rmd. We used the R package SINIB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Liu and Quertermous, 2018</xref>) to calculate theoretical probabilities of finding a shared metabolic change in a particular number of evolved lines. First, we designated metabolic features (the combination of compound and the ionization mode it was detected in) as significant if they experienced an <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf10"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">|</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mi>g</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>f</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mi>h</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>g</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">|</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>≥</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>. Then, we determined the probability of randomly picking a significantly altered metabolic feature in each evolved line in a manner specific to the growth phase and direction of change. We then parameterized the dsinib function with these probabilities, essentially asking what the chance of repeatedly finding the same change in an increasing number of evolved lines is. We used these probabilities to determine the total number of metabolic features ones might expect to find altered in the same direction. These numbers can be compared to the observed distribution, showing that more parallel changes are observed than expected.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>Kyle S.

They use untargeted LC/MS methods that include standards and report both positive and negative ionization mode measurements. They initially use principal component analysis (PCA) to broadly compare how the metabolomes of these strains are similar and different. Then, they describe several instances where the changes in metabolite abundance they see in specific pathways correlate with mutations that lead to changes in the expression of genes that encode enzymes in those pathways.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The statistical analyses and presentation of the high-throughput data are excellent. The most compelling results are communicated in wonderful figures that integrate their measurements of metabolite levels in this study with results from a prior study they conducted looking at changes in gene expression levels in the same bacterial strains. These sections include the ones describing large increases in NAD(P) pools due to mutations in nadR, changes in the levels of arginine and related compounds due to mutations in argR, and changes in metabolites from glycolysis and the TCA cycle related to iclR and arcB.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>After addressing prior reviews, the main remaining weaknesses of the study are limitations inherent to the metabolomics approach that are noted by the authors. Namely, that it gives a static and incomplete picture of cellular metabolism, lacking any information about flux and missing measurements for many metabolites. Additional biochemical and genetic experiments will be necessary to fully test the hypotheses suggested by the metabolomics data.</p><p>Impact and Significance:</p><p>While there has been past speculation about the effects of LTEE mutations on metabolism, this study measures changes in the levels of metabolites in related metabolic pathways for the first time. Therefore, it provides useful information about how metabolism evolves, in general, and will also be a useful resource those studying other aspects of the LTEE related to metabolism, such as contingency in the evolution of citrate utilization.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.87039.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>This preprint presents a compelling study examining the relationship between genotypic changes and phenotypic traits in bacteria over an extended period using the Long-Term Evolution Experiment (LTEE) as a model. The primary advances in methodology include employing high-resolution mass spectrometry for comprehensive metabolic profiling and combining it with previous gene expression and DNA sequencing datasets. This approach provides insight into how specific genetic mutations can alter metabolic pathways over 50,000 generations, enabling a deeper understanding of how genetic changes lead to observed differences in evolved bacterial strains. The findings reveal that evolved bacteria possess more diverse metabolic profiles compared to their ancestors, suggesting that these populations have uniquely adapted to their environment.

The other strains are remarkably colinear on these plots, hinting that if the outliers were removed, one main component would emerge along which they are situated. It also seems possible that this additional analysis step would allow the second dimension to better differentiate them in a way that is interesting with respect to their mutator status or mutations in key metabolic or regulatory genes.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their positive comments and their constructive feedback on the manuscript. Following reviewer’s recommendation, we performed the PCA analysis on metabolism data after removing A-2 and A-3 data. We have detailed those results below. Consistent with a similar analysis performed on RNA-seq datasets in our previous publication, we find that removing these outliers has only a modest effect on separating mutators from non-mutators. We find that, while the new PC2 separates most mutators from the non-mutators, the separation is rather weak. Moreover, we do not see a similar distinction when looking at metabolic data in the Stationary phase. In the interest of improving the readability of the manuscript, we recommend not including these analysis in the final manuscript. We have presented the data for the reviewer’s benefit in Author response image 1, 2 and 3.</p><fig id="sa3fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-87039-sa3-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><fig id="sa3fig2" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-87039-sa3-fig2-v1.tif"/></fig><fig id="sa3fig3" position="float"><label>Author response image 3.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-87039-sa3-fig3-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>There is a missed opportunity to connect some key results to what is known about LTEE mutations that reduce the activity of pykF (pyruvate kinase I). This gene is mutated in all 12 LTEE populations, and often these mutations are frameshifts or transposon insertions that should completely knock out its activity. At first glance, inactivating an enzyme for a step in glycolysis does not make sense when the nutrient source in the growth medium is glucose, even though PykF is only one of two isozymes <italic>E. coli</italic> encodes for this reaction. There has been speculation that inactivating pykF increases the concentration of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) in cells and that this can lead to increased rates of glucose import because PEP is used by the phosphotransferase system of <italic>E. coli</italic> to import glucose (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1002/bies.20629">https://doi.org/10.1002/bies.20629</ext-link>). The current study has confirmed the higher PEP levels, which is consistent with this model.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out this missed opportunity. We have expanded the discussion around the role of pykF mutations and the elevated concentrations of PEP observed in our data in section 3.4.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In the introduction, the papers cited to show the importance of changes in metabolism for adaptation do not seem to fit the focus of this study very well. They stress production of toxins and secondary metabolites, which do not seem to be mechanisms that are at work in the LTEE. I can think of two areas of background that would be more relevant: (1) studies of how bacterial metabolism evolves in adaptive laboratory evolution (ALE) experiments to optimize metabolic fluxes toward biomass production (for example, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1038/nature01149">https://doi.org/10.1038/nature01149</ext-link>), and (2) discussions of how cross-feeding, metabolic niche specialization, and metabolic interdependence evolve in microbial communities, including in other evolution experiments (for example, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0708504105">https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0708504105</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1128/mBio.00036-12">https://doi.org/10.1128/mBio.00036-12</ext-link>).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out missed citations in our introduction. We agree that these papers are relevant to the topic and have added their citations. Additionally, following the suggestion of another reviewer, we have reorganized the introduction so that the concept of the role of metabolism in evolution is presented first and the LTEE second.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>[...] Overall, this is a significant and well-executed research study.

Title and Abstract: Add the study organism to the abstract, and probably also the title. Currently, <italic>E. coli</italic> is not mentioned in either! I'm also not sure that the LTEE is a sufficiently well-known acronym to abbreviate this in the title.</p></disp-quote><p>We have revised the title of the manuscript and now spell out LTEE and included <italic>E. coli</italic> in the title and the abstract.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Abstract: I would switch the usage of metabolome to metabolism in a few more places. For example, &quot;changes in its <italic>metabolism</italic>&quot;, &quot;networked and convoluted nature of <italic>metabolism</italic>&quot;. The metabolome, the concentrations of all metabolites, is what is being measured, but I think of this as a phenotypic readout of how metabolism evolving.</p></disp-quote><p>We have changed “metabolome” to “metabolism” in cases where we refer to what is evolving and use “metabolome” when we refer to what is being measured.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Line 16: Technically, the 12 LTEE populations were not initially identical. The Ara- differed from the Ara+ ancestors by one intentional mutation and one unintentional mutation that was not discovered until whole genomes were sequenced. I would rephrase this to &quot;where 12 replicate populations of <italic>E. coli</italic> are propagated&quot; or something similar so that it can be correct without needing to describe this unnecessary detail.</p></disp-quote><p>The line has been rephrased as suggested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. General Note: The text refers to populations as Ara-3 but the figures use A-3. I'd suggest going with A-3 and similar throughout for consistency.</p></disp-quote><p>Instances of Ara have been changed to A+/-, and a sentence specifying as such has been added to the intro to make mention of this.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Lines 43-44, 97-98. My understanding is that both S and L ecotypes in A-2 can use both glucose and acetate, but that the differentiation is related to their specialization that leads to each one being better on one or the other nutrient. The descriptions make it sound like each grows at a different time. Also, by definition, cells are not growing during &quot;stationary phase&quot;. The change from glucose utilization (and acetate secretion) to acetate utilization during one cycle of growth is better described as a diauxic shift.</p></disp-quote><p>We have reworded this part to remove mention of “growth” during stationary phase and changed the wording such that it no longer sounds like they grow at different times.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1.

Line 116: It's unclear whether the abundances of metabolites are &quot;strategies of survival&quot; in stationary phase. An equally valid explanation is that there is less selection on the metabolome to have a specific composition during stationary phase to have high fitness.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added a line about the possibility for alternative hypotheses.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Figure 1: There seems to be some information missing from the legend. What are R06 and R07 in Panels A and B?

Figures 2 and 3: Gene names should be in italics. To me, the gray for deleted genes is hard to tell apart from the blue/red. Perhaps you could put a little X in these boxes instead? I think that having a little triangle pointing from each gene or metabolite name its corresponding abundance panel would help the reader track which information goes with which features. In Fig. 3 the placement of L-aspartate is a bit awkward. I'd suggest moving it down so the dashed line does not have to go through the abundance panel.</p></disp-quote><p>These figures have been edited to include small triangles that link a gene or metabolite and its heatmap. Additionally, an X has been added where genes have suffered inactivating mutations and the placement of some elements has been moved to improve overall clarity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Lines 183-185: It would be easier to see and judge the consistency of these argR related relationships if a correlation graph of some kind was shown, probably as a supplemental figure. This plot could, for example, have genes/metabolites across the x-axis and fold-change on the y-axis with lines connecting points corresponding to each of the twelve populations across these categories (like Fig S8 but with lines added). Alternatively, it could be a heat map with the populations across one axis and the genes/metabolites across the other axis (like Fig S3).</p></disp-quote><p>We have added a supplementary figure consisting of heatmaps showing the consistency of these changes within an evolved line. It is now figure S9.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Line 195: I think adding a sentence elaborating on what exactly mutation accumulation means in this context would be helpful to readers.</p></disp-quote><p>We have attempted to clarify the meaning of this by specifically stating that it is due to the accumulation of deleterious mutations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1.

For instance, capturing Ara-3 during its exponential growth on glucose, but not citrate, at hour 2. Furthermore, except for Ara-3, the LTEE populations reach stationary phase after approximately 4 hours, and there could be significant differences between early, mid, and late stationary phase. This possibility should be acknowledged, and future follow-up work should consider exploring these differences.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added sentences in the first paragraph of the results section to include these details.

The low level of glucose in the LTEE does not drive innovation; instead, innovation occurs at random through the introduction of variation by mutation. Although the existence of the citrate resource acts as a reward that selects for variation that provides access to it, it is essential to remember that evolution is blind to such a reward. Moreover, regarding the evolution of the Cit+ trait, it is incorrect to assert that low glucose contributed to its evolution. As shown by Quandt et al. (2015), it seems probable that Cit+ evolution was potentiated by adaptation to specialization on acetate, which is produced by overflow metabolism resulting from rapid growth on glucose. This rapid growth only occurs when glucose is relatively abundant. The level of glucose seems low to us because it is low relative to traditional levels in bacteriological media, but not to the bacteria.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this is a semantical, but important distinction.

Overflow metabolism and acetate production appear to be prevalent in the LTEE, suggesting that many lineages only partially oxidize carbon derived from glucose, thereby bypassing the TCA cycle. While it is possible that this interpretation is incorrect, it would be helpful to see it addressed in the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this is a plausible hypothesis, we have added a paragraph at the end of this section that discusses the implications of overflow metabolism as an alternative hypothesis.</p></body></sub-article></article>
