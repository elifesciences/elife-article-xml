hallmark of alcohol use disorder, but the mechanisms that underlie this are not well characterized. Here, we show that kappa opioid receptor signaling in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) is a critical molecular substrate underlying abnormal stress responses to predator odor following heavy alcohol drinking. Exposure to predator odor during protracted withdrawal from intermittent alcohol drinking resulted in enhanced prefrontal cortex (PFC)-driven excitation of prodynorphin-containing neurons in the BNST. Furthermore, deletion of prodynorphin in the BNST and chemogenetic inhibition of the PFC-BNST pathway restored abnormal responses to predator odor in alcohol-exposed mice. These findings suggest that increased corticolimbic drive may promote abnormal stress behavioral responses to predator odor during protracted withdrawal. Various nodes of this PFC-BNST dynorphin-related circuit may serve as potential targets for potential therapeutic mediation as well as biomarkers of negative responses to stress following heavy alcohol drinking.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>The connection between stress and alcohol use is highly complex. On one hand, there is the idea of having a drink to ‘steady the nerves’. On the other hand, in alcoholics, abnormal responses to stress often accompany heavy drinking. In this case, it remains unknown whether stress cause excessive drinking, or vice versa.</p><p>Areas of the brain that normally help respond to stress work differently in long-term, heavy drinkers. One example is a structure called the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST), which is over-active in anxiety disorders and is also associated with some of the symptoms of alcohol withdrawal. The mechanism behind both problems is thought to be a specific ‘signaling system’ that is activated by a small molecule called dynorphin.</p><p>Previous research into the effects of dynorphin was performed either in the context of alcoholism or of anxiety disorders, but it was not known if there was a connection between the two. Therefore, Hwa et al. wanted to determine how prolonged alcohol use might affect responses to stress, and whether dynorphin signaling plays a role.</p><p>To model long-term alcohol use in the laboratory, a group of mice was given free access to alcohol every other day, ensuring that they developed the mouse equivalent of a drinking habit. After six weeks, these ‘heavy drinkers’ went through a period of abstinence, mimicking alcohol withdrawal. Then, the mice were stressed by exposing them to a chemical that smelled like a fox, one of the mice’s predators in the wild.</p><p>When mice smell predators, they normally respond by fleeing from the area and digging up debris to defend itself. As expected, the control mice in this study, which did not drink alcohol, did just that. In contrast, the heavy drinkers largely ignored the predator scent by not digging and even spent time hanging around the area that smelled like the predator. Blocking dynorphin-induced signaling in the alcoholic mice, either using a drug or by deleting the gene that codes for dynorphin, reset the stress response to normal, allowing these mice to avoid the predator and dig as normal. Furthermore, measuring the electrical activity in the brain revealed that the BNST was abnormally active in alcohol-drinking mice, driven by signals from another part of the brain, the prefrontal cortex. This reveals part of the circuitry in the brain responsible for the connection between alcohol withdrawal and the stress response.</p><p>These results shed new light on the biological mechanisms underpinning the relationship between alcohol use and stress. In the future, these could be used to determine why heavy drinking can overlap with anxiety disorders, or to develop new treatments that would help recovering alcoholics cope better with stress.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>alcohol</kwd><kwd>stress</kwd><kwd>predator odor</kwd><kwd>dynorphin</kwd><kwd>kappa opioid receptor</kwd><kwd>norBNI</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000027</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>K99AA027576</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hwa</surname><given-names>Lara S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000027</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32AA007573</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Flanigan</surname><given-names>Meghan E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000027</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F32AA026485</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pina</surname><given-names>Melanie M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000027</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F31AA027129</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yu</surname><given-names>Waylin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000027</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AA019454</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kash</surname><given-names>Thomas L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000027</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U01AA020911</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kash</surname><given-names>Thomas L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000027</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AA025582</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kash</surname><given-names>Thomas L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Heavy alcohol drinking primes dynorphin /kappa opioid systems in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis to alter stress responses in mice.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Alcohol abuse exacts a tremendous toll on society, and long-term drinking can dysregulate stress systems in the brain. Prolonged alcohol drinking and withdrawal experiences result in enhanced responsiveness and behavioral sensitivity to stress during protracted abstinence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Heilig et al., 2010</xref>). Reciprocally, clinical studies show that negative stress coping is predictive of higher levels of drinking in alcoholics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Noone et al., 1999</xref>). As blunted responses to stress have been identified in alcohol-dependent people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sinha et al., 2011</xref>), it is essential to consider mechanisms by which alcohol drinking impacts stress responses during protracted abstinence. While many studies have utilized animal models to investigate how stress drives increased alcohol drinking behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Becker et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gilpin and Weiner, 2017</xref>), few have explored the effects of alcohol drinking on subsequent stress responsivity.</p><p>Chronic alcohol exposure engages brain stress signaling systems that influence drinking behaviors in a dynamic and complex manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Koob and Kreek, 2007</xref>). One such stress system is the neuropeptide prodynorphin (Pdyn) and its receptor, the kappa opioid receptor (KOR), which has been studied in the contexts of both mood and alcohol use disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lutz and Kieffer, 2013</xref>). Limbic structures implicated in alcohol and stress behaviors, such as the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST), are rich in Pdyn and KOR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Le Merrer et al., 2009</xref>). The BNST is an integrative hub that may mediate the negative affective state associated with chronic alcohol use and withdrawal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Koob, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kash, 2012</xref>). KORs throughout the extended amygdala and the BNST alter anxiety-like behavior in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bruchas et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Crowley et al., 2016</xref>) and mediate stress-induced reinstatement for alcohol reinforcement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lê et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we tested whether BNST KOR/Pdyn signaling regulates abnormal stress responses after long-term alcohol drinking. We employed the ethologically relevant predator odor trimethylthiazoline (TMT) as a stressor, which is a compound isolated from fox feces. In rats and C57BL/6J mice, TMT activates specific brain regions involved in stress, anxiety, and fear, including the BNST (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Day et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Asok et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Janitzky et al., 2015</xref>), and inactivation of the BNST blocks TMT-induced freezing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fendt et al., 2003</xref>). Recent work suggests that distinct neuropeptide circuits in the BNST may drive opposing emotional states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Giardino et al., 2018</xref>), which may be dependent on inputs from cortical sites to affect stress coping behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Johnson et al., 2019</xref>). The current series of experiments investigate whether Pdyn neurons and KOR signaling in the BNST can modulate behavioral responses to stress in alcohol-exposed animals. We show that dysregulation of cortical inputs to BNST Pdyn neurons and BNST Pdyn neurons themselves underlie lasting behavioral changes to stressors that emerge after chronic drinking. This is a critical area of study, as mitigating stress responses can contribute to improved alcohol relapse outcomes.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Male C57BL/6J mice were given 6 weeks of intermittent access to alcohol (EtOH), a protocol known to induce heavy voluntary drinking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hwa et al., 2011</xref>), before behavioral testing during protracted (7–10 days) abstinence [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>]. Mice consumed high amounts of EtOH [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>] and increased their EtOH preference over time [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>]. Further, mice achieved greater than 80 mg/dl blood EtOH concentrations, indicative of intoxication, which correlated with drinking behavior [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>; R<sup>2</sup> = 0.59, p=0.0036]. To test stress responsivity during protracted abstinence from EtOH, mice were exposed to the predator odor TMT in the home cage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hwa et al., 2019</xref>). Both water (H<sub>2</sub>O)-drinking controls and EtOH drinking mice showed a TMT-induced increase in plasma corticosterone [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>; TMT main effect: F<sub>1,10</sub>=26.79, p=0.0004, H<sub>2</sub>O BL vs TMT t<sub>10</sub> = 3.32, p=0.0154, EtOH BL vs TMT t<sub>10</sub> = 3.99, p=0.005]. We tracked the location of the mouse relative to the TMT and measured the time spent contacting the TMT and in the far corners [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>]. EtOH-drinking mice displayed reduced avoidance of the TMT compared to the water (H<sub>2</sub>O)-drinking controls during protracted abstinence [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G–H</xref>]. As an initial screen to identify altered behavior separate from avoidance, we examined stress-related and exploratory behavior in three mice per condition on a second-by-second basis [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>]. Since the primary difference among stress-related activities was burying, we focused our further analyses on this typical behavior in response to noxious stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hwa et al., 2019</xref>). Specifically, EtOH drinkers demonstrated reduced burying behavior compared to controls [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>].</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>KOR regulation of responses to TMT predator odor after long-term alcohol drinking.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Experimental protocol for 5 mg/kg i.p.

First, we identified BNST<sup>PDYN</sup> as a stress- and alcohol-sensitive population using immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization. With whole cell patch clamp electrophysiology, we found that enhanced synaptic drive in BNST<sup>PDYN</sup> cells was reduced by KOR antagonism in stressed mice with a history of alcohol drinking. Finally, experiments with ex vivo optogenetics indicated that EtOH-drinking stressed mice had increased prefrontal cortical synaptic connectivity onto BNST<sup>PDYN</sup> cells compared to unstressed EtOH drinkers. We were able to manipulate EtOH-induced alterations in TMT stress reactions using BNST KOR antagonism, BNST Pdyn deletion, and PFC-BNST chemogenetic inhibition. Altogether, our findings indicate that engagement of Pdyn/KOR signaling in the BNST promotes an allostatic shift in stress-responses following EtOH drinking.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>BNST KOR/Pdyn gates stress reactions after EtOH</title><p>Previous articles from our laboratory have shown that wild-type and transgenic mice exhibit relatively modest intermittent EtOH drinking and preference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bloodgood et al., 2020</xref>) compared to those reported in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hwa et al., 2011</xref> publication, which was likely a results of varying vivarium conditions. However, mice in this study still achieved intoxicating blood EtOH concentrations, and this intermittent schedule may be favorable over drinking levels in continuous two-bottle choice access (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Yu et al., 2019</xref>). In our hands, 6 weeks of intermittent access to EtOH affected behavioral responses to TMT predator odor. We interpret the EtOH-induced lack of avoidance of the predator odor as a maladaptive reaction to an innately stressful stimulus. While control mice displayed an array of stress behaviors in response to TMT (i.e. freezing, grooming, stretch-attend, etc.), a lack of burying was a prominent behavioral feature of EtOH mice. Burying in response to an immediate threat is commonly interpreted as an innate, active coping behavior in rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">De Boer and Koolhaas, 2003</xref>).</p><p>While EtOH mice also showed increased anxiety-like behavior in the elevated plus maze during protracted withdrawal, this group difference was eliminated following TMT exposure, as seen in our control drug/virus experiments after BNST norBNI, Pdyn deletion, and mPFC-BNST inhibition, suggesting long-lasting impact of TMT on performance in the elevated plus maze (EPM). Since we chose to not use another cohort of surgerized/transgenic mice for testing in the EPM, it is important to note that testing without prior TMT exposure was a limitation. TMT can have mixed effects on time spent in the open arms of the EPM, which can be dependent on the TMT concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hacquemand et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">McGregor et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Makhijani et al., 2020</xref>). This points to the EPM as a distinct, novelty-related probe, which may not be robust to differentiate EtOH-related phenotypes after a confounding TMT exposure.</p><p>Using converging approaches of intra-BNST norBNI infusions and genetic deletion of BNST<sup>PDYN</sup> using a floxed mouse line, we show that reducing Pdyn/KOR signaling at the pre- or post-synaptic level, respectively, normalizes alcohol-induced impairments in TMT behavioral responses during protracted abstinence. These results are in line with literature showing KOR antagonists can block anxiety-like behaviors precipitated by acute withdrawal from alcohol vapor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Valdez and Harshberger, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rose et al., 2016</xref>) and suppress alcohol self-administration in post-dependent rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Walker and Koob, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Schank et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kissler et al., 2014</xref>). KORs in the BNST appear to be particularly important in mediating interactions between stress and alcohol drinking, as BNST norBNI attenuates stress-induced alcohol seeking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lê et al., 2018</xref>) and reduces alcohol withdrawal-induced 22 kHz ultrasonic vocalizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Erikson et al., 2018</xref>). While this previous research has established that there is critical involvement of this stress peptide system in promoting acute alcohol withdrawal behaviors, we demonstrate here that KOR is still engaged in protracted abstinence, particularly during episodes of high stress exposure. Taken together, this body of evidence suggests that KOR signaling in the BNST is a critical pharmacological target for treatment of alcohol use disorders.</p><p>Our findings using c-Fos immunolabeling show that BNST<sup>PDYN</sup> cells are synergistically engaged in responses to stressors in EtOH-drinking mice. This complements existing c-Fos work in the BNST after TMT predator odor exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Day et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Asok et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Janitzky et al., 2015</xref>) while newly connecting the Pdyn population with changes in stress responses following a history of EtOH drinking. As we were using a GFP reporter line to determine Pdyn-containing neurons, we also thought it was important to measure Pdyn and Oprk1 expression using fluorescence in situ hybridation. We observed that there was greater Pdyn content in EtOH mice, specifically a significant increase of Pdyn intensity and a trend towards Pdyn number. This suggests that increased c-Fos and Pdyn co-localization after EtOH exposure and stress could be due to the emergence of a larger pool of Pdyn neurons. Future studies should measure real-time engagement of BNST<sup>PDYN</sup> neurons during TMT exposure using fiber photometry, as specific subpopulation of BNST neurons are known to exhibit TMT-elicited calcium transients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Giardino et al., 2018</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Glutamatergic contribution to stress-enhanced signaling in BNST<sup>PDYN</sup> neurons</title><p>After assessing population activity of BNST PDYN/KOR after EtOH and stress and the contributions of this population to drinking-induced alterations in behavior, we performed synaptic transmission experiments on BNST<sup>PDYN</sup> neurons during protracted abstinence from EtOH. In addition, non-stressed intermittent EtOH mice displayed modestly increased sIPSC frequency in BNST<sup>PDYN</sup> cells. While some studies from our laboratory have reported increased sIPSC frequency in the BNST 24 hr after drinking in monkeys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pleil et al., 2015</xref>), others have found increased sEPSC/sIPSC ratios in C57BL/6J mice 48 hr after ethanol vapor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pleil et al., 2016</xref>) These differences are likely the result of cell-type-specific population targeting, variations in drinking/exposure protocols, and withdrawal time points. During protracted abstinence, there were no apparent synaptic transmission differences between withdrawn mice and controls, although previous reports have found increased sEPSC frequency at this time point in female drinkers in a BNST CRF population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Centanni et al., 2019</xref>). Rather, we found that TMT exposure increased glutamatergic transmission in BNST<sup>PDYN</sup> neurons after EtOH and TMT, suggesting enhanced glutamatergic activity across the region. While BNST<sup>PDYN</sup> synaptic drive did not differ between stressed H<sub>2</sub>O and EtOH mice, differences in transmission were revealed during KOR blockade with norBNI pretreatment. Altogether, while other studies have found that chronic EtOH exposure and withdrawal can impact BNST spontaneous glutamatergic and NMDAR function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kash et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wills et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">McElligott and Winder, 2009</xref>), our findings are the first to highlight plastic shifts in response to stressors and identify pathway-specific alterations in neuropeptide signaling.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>EtOH and stress interact revealing synaptic plasticity from cortical input</title><p>The mPFC, among other brain regions, is a known source of increased glutamatergic signaling onto BNST neurons. Previous work in the lab found that both central amygdala (CeA) and basolateral amygdala (BLA) inputs to the BNST are KOR-sensitive, but mPFC inputs are KOR-insensitive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Crowley et al., 2016</xref>). Notably, photostimulation of BLA inputs promotes anxiolysis in alcohol-naive mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Crowley et al., 2016</xref>). Taken together, these findings suggest a model in which increased activity of BNST<sup>PDYN</sup> neurons promote release of Pdyn, which in turn inhibit amygdala inputs to the BNST to promote increased engagement of mPFC glutamate signaling. We have previously identified prelimbic (PL) layer 2/3 neurons as a population engaged in response to acute TMT using a combination of slice physiology and immunohistochemical approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hwa et al., 2019</xref>), providing converging data for engagement of this pathway by this specific aversive stimulus. However, while Pdyn/KOR signaling in the CeA appears to promote EtOH consumption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bloodgood et al., 2020</xref>), Pdyn/KOR signaling in the BNST did not affect EtOH drinking in our study.</p><p>Our study provides valuable insight into how the synaptic strength of the mPFC to BNST<sup>PDYN</sup> pathway may be altered by combined exposure to EtOH and stress. Indeed, we found that a higher proportion of BNST<sup>PDYN</sup> neurons were light-responsive following stress or EtOH compared to H<sub>2</sub>O controls, suggesting that these stimuli increase connectivity between the mPFC and BNST<sup>DYN</sup> neurons. Taking into account the observed increases in oEPSC, AMPA, and NMDA amplitudes and AMPA/NMDA ratio after the combination of EtOH and TMT, it appears that EtOH exposure primes the synapse for aberrant responses to stressors under the control of a glutamatergic, mPFC-driven mechanism. Further, with repeated stimulation pulse trains, the EtOH TMT BNST<sup>PDYN</sup> cells show reduced short-term depression, suggesting increased fidelity and short-term plasticity in this circuit. Again, this is in line with known chronic EtOH-induced glutamate plasticity in BNST cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wills et al., 2012</xref>). In contrast to the mPFC-BNST pathway, we observed no differences in the strength of BLA inputs to BNST<sup>PDYN</sup> neurons after EtOH and stress. Since there was a stress-EtOH interaction observed from the cortical projection, we wanted to examine how inhibition of this pathway could alter behavior. In an mPFC-BNST DREADD experiment, we found that chemogenetic inhibition also improved burying behavior in EtOH mice. This was specific to TMT behavior, as the manipulation did not affect EtOH drinking or anxiety-like behavior in the elevated plus maze. It is also possible that systemic CNO injection may impact behavior via effects on collaterals of those mPFC-BNST that project to other brain regions. This is a caveat, and intra-BNST delivery of CNO would be more direct. These combined strategies of testing synaptic strength in slice and pathway-specific manipulation of behavior provide a mechanism for how long-term drinking and stress interact to dysregulate prefrontal inputs to BNST<sup>PDYN</sup> neurons.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>BNST circuitry control of stress behavior</title><p>A recent paper from the Radley lab explored the role of the PL mPFC to BNST pathway in stress-related behaviors in rats using optogenetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Johnson et al., 2019</xref>). Activation of the PL to BNST circuit negatively correlated with freezing behavior, a measure of passive coping, in response to a shock prod, while photoinhibition increased freezing and decreased burying, a measure of active coping. Notably, they found that these behavioral effects were related to downstream control of the periaqueductal gray. An important future direction will be to assess the role of specific downstream projection targets of BNST Pdyn neurons, including the periaqueductal gray, in EtOH-induced alterations in TMT behavioral responses. It is also possible that excitatory local microcircuity in the BNST activates GABA neurons that inhibit ventral tegmental area GABA output signaling reward, which leads to anhedonia-like behavior and reduced stress responding. Our results illustrating aberrant responses to stress during protracted withdrawal from alcohol complement established research characterizing a more general role for the BNST in anxiety-related behaviors employing chemo- and optogenetics in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kim et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jennings et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Marcinkiewcz et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mazzone et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Crowley et al., 2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Maladaptive responses to stress are a hallmark of alcohol use disorder, but the mechanisms that underlie this effect are not well characterized.

Further, our findings suggest that increased corticolimbic connectivity may underlie this phenomenon; thus, altered mPFC-BNST connectivity could serve as a potential biomarker of negative outcomes in alcohol use disorder. Disentangling this imbalance of corticolimbic-driven stress neuropeptide signaling may lead to the development of novel therapeutics to enhance stress coping in persons with alcohol use disorder.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source <break/>or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>Mus musculus</italic> male)</td><td>C57BL/6J</td><td>Jackson Laboratories</td><td>B6/J</td><td>Stock # 000664</td></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>Mus musculus</italic> male)</td><td><italic>Pdyn<sup>IRES-Cre</sup></italic></td><td>Jackson Laboratories</td><td>B6;129S-<italic>Pdyn<sup>tm1.1(cre)Mjkr</sup></italic>/LowlJ</td><td>Stock # 027958</td></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>Mus musculus</italic> male)</td><td>EGFP-<italic>L10a</italic></td><td>Jackson Laboratories</td><td>B6;129S4-<italic>Gt(ROSA) 26Sor<sup>tm9(EGFP/Rpl10a)Amc</sup></italic>/J</td><td>Stock # 024750</td></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>Mus musculus</italic> male)</td><td><italic>Pdyn<sup>lox/lox</sup></italic></td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bloodgood et al., 2020</xref></td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>anti-c-Fos (Rabbit polyclonal)</td><td>Millipore</td><td>Cat# ABE457, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2631318">AB_2631318</ext-link></td><td>(1:3000)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>anti-rabbit horse radish peroxidase-conjugated IgG (Goat polyclonal)</td><td>PerkinElmer</td><td>Cat# NEF812001EA, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2571640">AB_2571640</ext-link></td><td>(1:200)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>anti-mCherry (Chicken polyclonal)</td><td>Abcam</td><td>Cat# ab205402, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2722769">AB_2722769</ext-link></td><td>(1:500)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Alexa Fluor 488 anti-chicken (Donkey polyclonal)</td><td>Jackson Immuno Research Laboratories</td><td>Cat# 703-545-155, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2340375">AB_2340375</ext-link></td><td>(1:200)</td></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (AAV)</td><td>AAV5-CamKII-Cre-eGFP</td><td>UNC Vector Core</td><td>Lot 6450</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (AAV)</td><td>AAV5-CamKII-eGFP</td><td>UNC Vector Core</td><td>Lot 4621B</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (AAV)</td><td>AAV5-CamKIIa-hChR2(H134R)-mCherry-WPRE-hGH</td><td>Addgene</td><td>Lot CS1096</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (AAV)</td><td>AAV8-hSyn-DIO-hM4D(Gi)-mCherry</td><td>Addgene</td><td>Lot 6048</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (AAV)</td><td>AAV2retro-SL1-CAG-Cre</td><td>Janelia</td><td>Custom Prep</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Sequence-based reagent</td><td>Mm-Oprk1</td><td>ACDbio</td><td>316111</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Sequence-based reagent</td><td>Mm-Pdyn</td><td>ACDbio</td><td>318771</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Commercial assay or kit</td><td>TSA amplification kit with Cy3</td><td>PerkinElmer</td><td>Cat# NEL744001KT</td><td>(1:50)</td></tr><tr><td>Commercial assay or kit</td><td>RNAscope Florescent Multiplex Assay</td><td>ACDbio</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Commercial assay or kit</td><td>Corticosterone ELISA Kit</td><td>Arbor Assays</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>norBNI</td><td>Tocris</td><td>Cat# 0347</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>CNO</td><td>Hello Bio</td><td>Cat# HB6149</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>Prism 8</td><td>GraphPad</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>ClampFit 10.7</td><td>Molecular Devices</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>Ethovision XT</td><td>Noldus</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>BORIS</td><td>Friard and Gamba</td><td>DOI:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1111/2041-210X.12584">10.1111/2041-210X.12584</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Other</td><td>TMT</td><td>BioSRQ</td><td>Cat# 1G-TMT-97</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Other</td><td>Peanut oil</td><td>Harris Teeter</td><td/><td/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>Eight-week-old male C57BL/6J mice (Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME) were used for behavioral pharmacology experiments.

The BORIS software also generated representative ethograms/Gantt plots of stress-related and exploratory behaviors, including duration and frequency of burying, freezing, grooming, rearing, stretch-attend, and walking.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-2"><title>Plasma corticosterone assay</title><p>To measure plasma corticosterone 30 min following TMT predator odor exposure, 5 µl plasma samples were processed with a commercially available colorimetric ELISA kit (Arbor Assays, Ann Arbor, MI), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. All samples were run in duplicates.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-3"><title>Elevated plus maze</title><p>Mice were placed into the center of an elevated plus maze (75 cm) and allowed to explore for 5 min (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bloodgood et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Crowley et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mazzone et al., 2018</xref>). Light levels in the open arms were approximately 15 lux. Duration of time spent in the open arms and closed arms were recorded and calculated by Ethovision XT13. The time interval between TMT and elevated plus maze tests was 3 days.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Stereotaxic surgery</title><p>Adult mice (&gt;8 weeks) were deeply anesthetized with 3–4% isoflurane in oxygen and placed into a stereotaxic frame (Kopf Instruments, Tujunga, CA) while on a heated pad. Isoflurane anesthesia was maintained at 1–2% during the remainder of the surgery. After sterilization with 70% ethanol and betadine, a scalp incision was made and burr holes were drilled above the target. A 1 µl Neuros Hamilton syringe (Hamilton, Reno, NV) microinjected the virus or drug at a rate of 0.1 µl/min. Coordinates for the dorsal BNST were AP +0.30 mm, ML +/- 0.95 mm, DV −4.35 mm from bregma. Coordinates for the mPFC were AP +1.70 mm, ML +/- 0.30 mm, DV −2.50 mm from bregma. Coordinates for the BLA were AP −1.30 mm, ML +/- 3.25 mm, DV −4.95 mm from bregma. Mice recovered for 1 week before testing.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Drugs and viral vectors</title><p>5 mg/kg norBNI (Cat no. 0347, Tocris) or saline was administered i.p., 1 ml/100 g, 16 hr before testing to both EtOH and H<sub>2</sub>O mice. For intra-BNST norBNI microinfusions, 5 µg/µl norBNI or PBS was injected with 50 nl AAV5-CamKII-eGFP to mark the injection site. Intra-BNST administration of norBNI or PBS was a single, bilateral infusion of drug. Since animals underwent stereotaxic surgery for drug delivery, 7 days was the minimum time for post-operative recovery before TMT behavioral testing. Both 16 hr and 7 day drug pretreatment minimized handling stress prior to the predator odor exposure and allowed for KOR antagonism instead of non-specific mu opioid antagonism that occurs initially post-injection. norBNI is known for its ultra-long duration of action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Munro et al., 2012</xref>). While we did not directly test to see if KOR antagonism was still pharmacologically effective at the time of TMT and EPM testing, previous studies have shown the effects of norBNI in the mouse tail flick test up to 28 days after administration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Horan et al., 1993</xref>) and rat intracranial self-stimulation thresholds for at least 86 days after administration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Potter et al., 2011</xref>). Therefore, it is likely that norBNI was on board at the time of TMT testing.</p><p><italic>Pdyn<sup>lox/lox</sup></italic> mice received 300 nl AAV5-CamKII-Cre-eGFP (UNC Vector Core, Lot 6450) and control AAV5-CamKII-eGFP (Lot 4621B) in the BNST. 300 nl AAV5-CamKIIa-hChR2(H134R)-mCherry-WPRE-hGH (Addgene, Lot CS1096) was injected into the mPFC or BLA of Pdyn-GFP mice for synaptic connectivity experiments in the BNST. C57BL/6J mice were injected with 300 nl AAV8-hSyn-DIO-hM4D(Gi)-mCherry (Addgene, Lot 6048) into the mPFC and AAV2retro-SL1-CAG-Cre into the BNST for mPFC-BNST inhibition. All intracranial injections were bilateral.</p><p>To test DREADD-mediated inhibition on EtOH consumption, saline and CNO were administered 20 min before EtOH drinking on two final test days. EtOH and H<sub>2</sub>O fluid consumption were measured after 1, 4, and 24 hr. During protracted withdrawal 7 days later, CNO was administered 20 min before the TMT test, and again 20 min before testing in the EPM, which occurred after 3 days. 3 mg/kg clozapine N-oxide (CNO; Hello Bio, Princeton, NJ) was dissolved in saline before i.p. administration, 1 ml/100 g, 20 min before testing.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>c-Fos immunohistochemistry, histology, and microscopy</title><p>For c-Fos and histological verification, mice were deeply anesthetized with Avertin before transcardial perfusion with phosphate buffered saline and 4% paraformaldehyde. Brains were extracted 90 min following TMT exposure for c-Fos, cryoprotected, and then sliced at 45 µm on a Leica 1200S vibratome. Coronal sections of the Pdyn-GFP mice were stained for <italic>c-Fos</italic> immunofluorescence to visualize colocalization of Pdyn-containing (GFP) and <italic>c-Fos</italic> expressing cells. The immunofluorescence protocol for <italic>c-Fos</italic> was performed according to previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hwa et al., 2019</xref>) using tyramine signal amplification (TSA). After PBS washes, 50% methanol, and 3% hydrogen peroxide, tissue was incubated in blocking buffer with 0.3% Triton X-100% and 1% bovine serum albumin for 60 min. Slices were then incubated at 4°C for 48 hr in blocking buffer containing a rabbit anti-<italic>c-Fos</italic> antibody (1:3000, ABE457, Millipore, Bellerica, MA). After washes in TNT (0.1 M Tris-HCl, 0.15 M NaCl, 3% TritonX-100) and TNB (0.1 M Tris-HCl, 0.15 M NaCl, 0.5% Perkin Elmer blocking reagent) buffer, slices were incubated in a goat anti-rabbit horse radish peroxidase-conjugated IgG (1:200, NEF812001EA, PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA) for 30 min. After TNT washes, tissue was processed using a TSA kit with Cy3-tyramide (1:50, PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA) for 10 min. For the mPFC-BNST chemogenetic inhibition experiment, we enhanced the mCherry signal in the mPFC cell bodies and BNST terminals using a similar immunofluorescence protocol. After PBS washes, 3% hydrogen peroxide, PBS washes, and 30 min in 0.5% Triton X-100, tissue was incubated in 0.1% Triton X-100, 10% normal donkey serum, and 1% bovine serum albumin for 60 min. Slices were then incubated at 4°C for 24 hr in blocking buffer containing a chicken anti-mCherry antibody (1:500, ab205402, Abcam, Cambridge, MA). After PBS washes, tissue underwent secondary incubation for 2 hr at room temperature in PBS containing Alexa Fluor 488 donkey anti-chicken (1:200, Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc West Grove, PA).</p><p>For placement verification, viral injection sites were verified using a wide-field epifluorescent microscope (BX-43, Olympus, Waltham, MA). For quantification of <italic>c-Fos</italic> immunofluorescence, slices were imaged on a Zeiss 800 laser scanning confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss, Germany) and analyzed with Zeiss Zen 2 Blue Edition software. Using the Image Analysis Wizard in the Zen Blue software, Pdyn-GFP cells were identified as the parent classifier, and c-Fos Cy3-labeled cells were identified as the child classifer. Automatic segmentation parameters were identical for each image within each new frame drawn to delineate the dorsal BNST. Pdyn-GFP cells, c-Fos cells, and c-Fos cells nested within Pdyn-GFP cells were automatically counted for each image. Four coronal brain sections containing the bilateral BNST were stained, imaged, and analyzed for each animal.</p><p>For in situ hybridization, brains were extracted 30 min following TMT exposure under isoflurane anesthesia. Tissue was flash frozen on dry ice for 15 min and stored at −80°C until sectioned for in situ hybridization. 18 µm coronal slices containing the BNST were made on the Leica CM 3050S cryostat (Leica Biosystems, Nussloch, Germany) at −20°C, mounted directly onto microscope slides, and stored at −80°C. In situ was performed according to the manufacterer’s protocol for fresh frozen tissue sections (RNAscope Fluorescent Multiplex Assay; ACDbio, Newark, CA) with the following exceptions. PBS washes following tissue fixation were extended to 5 min each and protease treatment was shortened to 15 min. Probes utilized were RNAscope Probe-Mm-Oprk1 (Cat no 316111) and RNAscope Probe-Mm-Pdyn (Cat no 318771). Slides were incubated with DAPI, coverslipped with ProLong Gold (Life Technologies), and imaged on a Zeiss 800 laser scanning confocal microscope. ImageJ was used to count mean intensity of fluorescence for <italic>Pdyn</italic> (550 channel) and <italic>Oprk</italic> (647 channel), and the cell counter plug-in was used to hand count Pdyn-positive neurons. After verification with DAPI, cells labeled with at least three puncta were counted as containing Pdyn mRNA. Hand counts were tabulated by a blind observer.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Slice electrophysiology</title><p>Ninety minutes following TMT, during 7–10 day protracted withdrawal, mice were sacrificed via deep isoflurane anesthesia, and coronal brain slices containing the BNST were collected according to standard laboratory protocols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hwa et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Crowley et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bloodgood et al., 2020</xref>). Whole-cell voltage-clamp electrophysiological recordings were performed in dorsal BNST<sup>PDYN</sup> cells. Pdyn-GFP-containing cells were selected based on visualization using a 470 nm LED and GFP filter. The effects of EtOH and TMT on basal synaptic transmission were assessed in voltage clamp by adjusting the membrane potential and using a cesium methanesulfonate-based intracellular solution (135 mM cesium methanesulfonate, 10 mM KCl, 10 mM HEPES, 1 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM EGTA, 4 mM MgATP, 0.3 mM GTP, 20 mM phosphocreatine, pH 7.3, 285–290 mOsmol). Lidocaine n-ethyl bromide (1 mg/ml) was included in the intracellular solution to block postsynaptic sodium currents. Neurons were held at −55 mV to assess glutamatergic synaptic transmission. In the same cell, neurons were held at +10 mV to assess GABAergic synaptic transmission. Fluctuations in current were used to determine spontaneous post-synaptic current (sEPSC or sIPSC) frequency and amplitude, as well as to calculate sEPSC/sIPSC ratios. Synaptic transmission experiments in BNST<sup>PDYN</sup> cells were also performed in animals that received 5 mg/kg norBNI i.p. 16 hr prior to TMT. Electrophysiological recordings were then analyzed using Clampfit 10.7 software (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA).</p><p>For ex-vivo optogenetic experiments, tissue was evaluated for light-evoked action potentials in the mPFC. Brains were discarded and not used for further experimentation if injection sites were missed or if action potentials were not present. A blue LED (470 nm, CoolLed) was used to optically stimulate release from channelrhodopsin (ChR2)-containing fibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Crowley et al., 2016</xref>). Picrotoxin (25 μM), tetrodotoxin (500 nM), and 4-AP (200 μM) were added to the aCSF to isolate monosynaptic oEPSCs with cells held at −70 mV. The intracellular solution was cesium gluconate (117 mM D-gluconic acid and cesium hydroxide, 20 mM HEPES, 0.4 mM EGTA, 5 mM tetraethyl ammonium chloride, 2 mM MgCl26H2O, 4 mM Na2ATP, 0.4 Na2GTP, pH 7.3, 287–292 mOsmol). oEPSC amplitude (pA) was the first peak of the paired pulse ratio with a 50 ms interstimulus interval. Paired pulse ratio was calculated as the second peak amplitude divided by the first peak amplitude. Cells were held at −70 mV to isolate AMPAR-mediated current and at +40 mV for NMDAR-mediated current. In separate slices, ten 1, 5, and 10 Hz pulse trains were performed at −55 mV voltage clamp without the presence of ionotropic inhibitors with the cesium methanesulfonate internal solution. The nine subsequent amplitudes in the pulse train were normalized to the first peak.</p><p>For DREADD validation in slice, mPFC cell bodies were identified with mCherry expression. 10 µM CNO (Hello Bio, Princeton, NJ) was bath applied for 10 min, and the resting membrane potential was monitored in voltage clamp. Action potential firing was assessed before and after CNO application using an increasing ramp protocol in current clamp.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Statistics</title><p>Time spent in contact with the TMT, far corners, and burying behavior in seconds (s), and distance traveled (cm) were analyzed with two-way ANOVA with drug/virus and EtOH as factors. Post-hoc paired and unpaired t-tests were two-tailed and used where appropriate. In experiments where virus was injected before EtOH, cumulative 6 week alcohol intake and average ethanol preference were compared via t-test. BNST <italic>c-Fos</italic>, Pdyn-containing, and <italic>c-Fos</italic> and Pdyn colocalization were analyzed with two-way ANOVA with TMT exposure and EtOH as factors. With norBNI physiology, saline- and norBNI-injected stressed mice were compared in separate two-way ANOVA with drug and EtOH as factors. To compare proportion of light-responsive cells per condition, a Χ<sup>2</sup> test was performed. Furthermore, optically-evoked experiments (e.g. oEPSC amplitude) were analyzed with two-way ANOVAs comparing TMT and EtOH exposure. Pulse trains were analyzed with repeated measures two-way ANOVA across stimulus time and condition. Alpha was set to 0.05. Biological replicates throughout behavioral, immunohistochemical, and electrophysiological studies were combined. Statistical tests were analyzed with GraphPad Prism 8 (La Jolla, CA, USA).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title></ack><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Writing - original draft, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Data curation, Investigation, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Data curation, Investigation, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Data curation, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Data curation, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Data curation, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Data curation, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Data curation, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Data curation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Data curation, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con11"><p>Data curation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con12"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Writing - review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Animal experimentation: The UNC School of Medicine Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee approved all experiments (Protocol # 19-078).

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor.</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>In general, the reviewers were all enthusiastic about your findings, but the consensus formed during discussion was that as is, much of the data is not mechanistically linked, which was felt to limit the ability to make causal associations and conclusions about the findings in the manuscript. The reviewers did feel that more studies could be done to formally link both the photometry and electrophysiology data with the behavior. But these were deemed to be beyond the scope of a revision at <italic>eLife</italic>, which is limited to two months. As we are enthusiastic about these findings, if you are able to address each of these concerns, we will consider your manuscript again as a new submission once these have been completed. Please see detailed comments from the reviewers below.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This study aimed to test the role of BNST Pdyn-KOR signaling in stress coping (measured primarily via behavioral assessments during exposure to the predator odor TMT) following voluntary alcohol consumption in mice. The findings reported in this manuscript are interesting, but several issues need to be addressed. One major issue is overinterpretation of the data, as outlined in several points below, this study did not show that &quot;altered responses to an innate stressor were associated with enhanced PFC-driven excitation of prodynorphin-containing neurons in the BNST&quot; nor did it show that &quot;KOR dysregulation of corticolimbic circuits underlies lasting behavioral changes to stressors that emerge after chronic drinking.&quot; This manuscript includes a set of interesting but disparate findings that provide separate pieces of evidence for stress and ethanol effects on BNST cellular activation, stress and ethanol effects on BNST KOR signaling, stress and ethanol effects on corticolimbic circuits, and stress/ethanol/KOR drug effects on stress related behavior. No experiments tested the relationship, causal or otherwise, between stress behaviors/stress response strategies and stress/ethanol effects on peptide signaling and physiology. Furthermore, the discussion of &quot;maladaptive&quot; and &quot;impaired&quot; stress coping is an overinterpretation that should either be removed or operationalized and incorporated into all analyses. The inclusion of data showing a causal relationship between stress effects on biology and behavior (or at least an association between these outcomes in the same animals) would greatly strengthen the manuscript.</p><p>1) The statement &quot;Altered responses to an innate stressor were associated with enhanced PFC-driven excitation of prodynorphin-containing neurons in the BNST&quot; and &quot;KOR dysregulation of corticolimbic circuits underlies lasting behavioral changes to stressors that emerge after chronic drinking&quot; are overinterpretations of the data. For example, it is not possible to know how the fiber photometry data in Figure 2 relates to behavior if at all. The same can be said for animals used for slice electrophysiology recordings. Why were TMT behavioral assessments not performed during fiber photometry recordings of BNST Pdyn neurons? This would provide information (at least correlative) regarding the role of BNST Pdyn signaling in these behaviors in alcohol- vs. water-exposed mice.</p><p>2) In general, terms like &quot;maladaptive&quot; stress coping are used too liberally. For example, &quot;we tested whether BNST KOR/Pdyn signaling regulates maladaptive stress reactions after long-term alcohol drinking.&quot; Maladaptive how? Behavior was clearly affected by the independent variables, but there is no evidence that one response is more or less &quot;adaptive.&quot; Also, what is meant by &quot;negative&quot; stress coping?</p><p>3) The use of no-injection controls instead of vehicle-injected controls is atypical and not ideal because it does not match groups for the stress of injections (Figure 1D-F). This concern is magnified in a study that examines stress coping. It is difficult to interpret drug effects in the absence of a vehicle-injected control group.</p><p>4) It is unclear when systemic or intra-BNST norBNI injections were given in relation to TMT behavioral testing. Comparing Figure 1A and 1G, it appears that systemic norBNI injections were given immediately prior to TMT behavioral testing and intra-BNST norBNI injections were given at the end of the intermittent alcohol exposure period (7-10 days prior to TMT behavioral testing). This should be clarified. If systemic and intra-BNST treatments occurred at different time points, the reason for this should be explained and its potential impact on results and interpretation should be discussed.</p><p>5) Include fiber photometry data from the 2nd TMT trial (TMT2) in addition to data from TMT1 and TMT3 (Figure 2I).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The authors have conducted a series of elegant experiments in mice to examine the hypothesis that prodynorphin/kappa opioid receptor signalling in the BNST is responsible for impaired behavioral responses to acute stress during protracted withdrawal from chronic alcohol drinking.</p><p>Overall, I think the manuscript is interesting and has high translational value for the treatment of alcohol use disorders. Their behavioral results seem robust and the experiments are well-reasoned and mostly appropriately designed. The manuscript is well written, and the figures are informative. The methodology used is appropriate and is capable to investigate many levels of the phenomenon. That said, I have some concerns with the current form of the manuscript.</p><p>1) The main behavioral effect in EtOH-drinking mice – increased time spent closed to TMT containing cotton tip – is convincing and very robust across experiments. However, I have some concerns regarding the interpretation of these behavioral changes at this point, as there may be alternative explanations that should be addressed or ruled out. For example, olfactory deficits have been repeatedly described in patients with chronic alcohol abuse, and BNST plays a critical role in olfactory function. How would the authors rule that EtOH drinking mice approached TMT simply because their olfactory impairments instead of stress-coping deficits? There are more options to investigate this question, including i) carrying out similar tests with neutral odors, ii) investigating effects of different TMT concentrations, or iii) performing different stress-coping tests during the protracted withdrawal period. At least, authors should provide a more detailed analysis of behaviour during the TMT test, including distance moved, freezing and possibly types of exploratory behaviour (i.e. flat-back approach), preferentially also during the habituation period (during which an empty cotton tip holder was placed into to the home cage), in order to strengthen the claim that increased TMT-contact reflects impaired coping with stress.</p><p>2) There is some confusion in the interpretation of results which is reflected both in the title and the impact statement of the paper, as authors did not investigate to effects of “alcohol drinking” per se but the effects of alcohol drinking during protracted alcohol withdrawal which seem to be qualitatively different. This should be clearly stated and discussed, whereas title and significance statement should be formulated accordingly.</p><p>3) According to Figure 1B, alcohol intake as well as alcohol preference levels in EtOH drinking mice remained substantially lower than in mice in the cited paper (Hwa et al., 2011); in fact, mice of the current experiments did not prefer ethanol over water. What could be an explanation for this? Was the protocol of Hwa et al., 2011 followed and increasing amounts of ethanol were induced during the first week?</p><p>4) Are there any &quot;classical&quot; symptoms of ethanol withdrawal (e.g. hyperactivity or convulsions) at this later time point when authors carried out their measurements?</p><p>5) Does &quot;burying&quot; mean defensive burying during the test? Is the movement generally directed towards TMT? The effects of EtOH drinking and of Pdyn/KOR-manipulations on burying behavior varied across experiments. This – along with a more precise description of this type of behavior – should be clearly stated and discussed.</p><p>6) Although it is mentioned in Results section that behavior in the forced swim test was only affected during early, but not during protracted abstinence, the latter data are not shown. How would the authors interpret the different time-related changes between the two behavioral tests?</p><p>7) In fiber photometry experiments, calcium activity of BNST<sup>PDYN</sup> neurons did not differ between EtOH and H<sub>2</sub>O drinking mice during the first session (when all other behavioral, immunohistochemical and electrophysiological measurements were carried out) but only after repeated exposure to TMT. It would be nice to see correlated behavioral changes over TMT trials which may help to interpret these results. Maybe I'm mistaken but is seems that Figure 3B and 3F, 3C and 3G, as well as 3D and 3H depict the very same animals in non-injected, TMT-exposed H<sub>2</sub>O and EtOH groups, even though these were described as subsequent, separate experiments. This is not elegant and should be clarified.</p><p>8) Figure 3 and Figure 3—figure supplement 1 show that the TMT-induced increase in BNST<sup>Pdyn</sup> sEPSC frequency did not seem to depend EtOH-drinking history, while KOR antagonism also seemed to induce very similar effects in H<sub>2</sub>O and EtOH drinking mice. Rather, sEPSC/IPSC ratio of non-Pdyn cells of EtOH drinking stressed animals seemed to differ from H<sub>2</sub>O drinking mice, suggesting that EtOH-related effects here were not directly regulated by the Pdyn system. Therefore, the last sentence in Results paragraph six and third sentence of the Discussion are over-interpreting these results and should be formulated much more carefully.</p><p>9) How was injection volume and targeting of CTB controlled for across mice in tracing studies shown in Figure 4G? Are cell counts normalized in some way to expression within the BNST? It would be good to see injections sites for this experiment as well.</p><p>10) There is no reference to Figure 4—figure supplement 1 F-H in the text. These figures suggest that – although functional connections from the mPFC to BNST may be strengthened in EtOH animals (but see concerns above about missing information on normalizing CTB counts and injection sites) – , activation of this projection upon TMT presentation does not depend on EtOH history (Figure 4—figure supplement 1H). Therefore, the first sentence in subsection “EtOH and stress interact revealing synaptic plasticity from cortical input” is misleading and should be re-formulated.</p><p>11) Out of curiosity. Ethanol consumption and preference during intermittent ethanol drinking period seemed to show a rather large variation among animals. I assume that such variation may correlate with behavioral/neuronal changes during withdrawal, i.e. heavy drinkers would show more profound stress-related impairments. Is there any effect of the amount of voluntary consumed alcohol on later outcome?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>In this study the authors characterize the effect of stress (TMT exposure) on activity of the prodynorphin/kappa opiate receptor (Pdyn/KOR) system in the BNST, in mice either following prolonged EtOH abstinence or control H<sub>2</sub>O mice. They first show that blocking BNST KORs with norBNI or genetic deletion of Pdyn in BNST normalizes the response to TMT in mice during protracted abstinence. They next showed that TMT exposure increases c-Fos expression in BNST Pdyn neurons, with greater expression in EtOH mice than H<sub>2</sub>O mice. Electrophysiological studies showed a TMT-induced non-specific increase in glutamatergic neurotransmission in the BNST, with little effect on inhibitory transmission; this effect was not sensitive to nor-BNI. Retrograde labelling indicated the mPFC likely contributed significantly to the TMT-induced increase in BNST glutamatergic transmission.</p><p>In general, this is an interesting manuscript with a novel emphasis on effects of stress after protracted abstinence. The writing is clear, but somewhat frustrating because much of the quantitative data is only found in the figure legends but not in the text in the Results section. Even then, the descriptions of the data in the figure legends appears somewhat cursory (perhaps due to relatively few figures with a tremendous number of individual panels).</p><p>1) There is one issue which remains unclear to me. It is stated &quot;TMT increased expression of Pdyn GFP-expressing neurons in the BNST&quot;. Are the authors suggesting an increase in the number of Pdyn neurons in the BNST, an increase in Pdyn content in BNST, or both? Subsequently, it is stated that colocalization of c-Fos with Pdyn-neurons was greatest in the stressed-EtOH group. Is this due to increased c-Fos expression, increased Pdyn expression, or both?</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Alcohol Drinking Alters Stress Response to Predator Odor via BNST Kappa Opioid Receptor Signaling in Male Mice&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Kate Wassum as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, we are asking editors to accept without delay manuscripts, like yours, that they judge can stand as <italic>eLife</italic> papers without additional data, even if they feel that they would make the manuscript stronger. Thus the revisions requested below only address clarity and presentation.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript reveals the prodynorphin-kappa opioid receptor system in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis as a critical neural substrate underlying abnormal stress responses following heavy alcohol drinking. The experiments are elegant and the conclusion is supported at multiple levels (cellular, circuit, behavioral). The emphasis on the effect of stress after protracted abstinence from alcohol is novel. The data reported in this manuscript have high translational value for the treatment of alcohol use disorders.</p><p>All the reviewers were impressed by the revisions made on the manuscript and agreed that the new version had improved significantly. There are no further experiments that were viewed as necessary for this, but the reviewers did have a collection of points that require attention, please see them detailed below.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The rebuttal letter states that &quot;we have added a saline-injected behavioral cohort (Figure 1G-I).&quot; These new data strengthen the manuscript. But it is unclear if the new saline-injected controls were tested in parallel with a new norBNI-injected group, or if data from the new saline-injected group is being compared to previously collected data from the norBNI-injected group included in the first submission. If the latter, this should be stated as a caveat.</p><p>2) Elevated plus-maze tests: it is somewhat difficult to understand the presented findings, as H<sub>2</sub>O and EtOH mice with or without previous TMT exposure were not tested for anxiety in the EPM in the same experiment. If we accept that the lack of anxiogenic effect in EtOH groups in some experiments might originate from the prior exposure to TMT, how can these data be interpreted? TMT exposure is associated with maladaptive behavioral responses in EtOH drinkers, but the very same TMT exposure reduces/restores anxiety in a subsequent EPM test, a novelty-related stress situation? These discrepancies/limitations need to be clearly discussed.</p><p>3) What was the time interval between TMT and EPM tests across experiments? Were systemic and intra-BNST norBNI treatments repeated before EPM tests or how did the authors assume that KOR antagonism is still “working” several days later?</p><p>4) Systemic and intra-BNST administration of norBNI were administered at different timepoints i.e. 16 hrs vs. 7 days before TMT test. What was the reason for that? This is a large difference in protocols that should be discussed and evaluated more clearly.</p><p>5) The description of DREADD-experiments should be clarified at several points. It is not clear when animals received CNO treatments during the alcohol-drinking period. Was CNO administered only once (when?) to measure subsequent acute changes in EtOH consumption or was it administered repeatedly (how?) during intermittent EtOH drinking? Were the same animals tested in the TMT and EPM tests?

What follows is the authors’ response to the first round of review.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>This study aimed to test the role of BNST Pdyn-KOR signaling in stress coping (measured primarily via behavioral assessments during exposure to the predator odor TMT) following voluntary alcohol consumption in mice. The findings reported in this manuscript are interesting, but several issues need to be addressed. One major issue is overinterpretation of the data, as outlined in several points below, this study did not show that &quot;altered responses to an innate stressor were associated with enhanced PFC-driven excitation of prodynorphin-containing neurons in the BNST&quot; nor did it show that &quot;KOR dysregulation of corticolimbic circuits underlies lasting behavioral changes to stressors that emerge after chronic drinking.&quot; This manuscript includes a set of interesting but disparate findings that provide separate pieces of evidence for stress and ethanol effects on BNST cellular activation, stress and ethanol effects on BNST KOR signaling, stress and ethanol effects on corticolimbic circuits, and stress/ethanol/KOR drug effects on stress related behavior. No experiments tested the relationship, causal or otherwise, between stress behaviors/stress response strategies and stress/ethanol effects on peptide signaling and physiology. Furthermore, the discussion of &quot;maladaptive&quot; and &quot;impaired&quot; stress coping is an overinterpretation that should either be removed or operationalized and incorporated into all analyses. The inclusion of data showing a causal relationship between stress effects on biology and behavior (or at least an association between these outcomes in the same animals) would greatly strengthen the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s comments; however, we respectfully disagree with the characterization that there was no experiment that tested the relationship of BNST Pdyn/KOR signaling to behavior. We locally infused a KOR antagonist and used a genetic approach to knockout dynorphin in the BNST, both of which produced alterations in this behavior after alcohol exposure, supporting an interaction. However, we do agree that we should have done more work examining the physiological properties of BNST neurons and how they related to observed behaviors.</p><p>We have included the correlation between alcohol drinking history and BNST Pdyn synaptic transmission as Figure 4—figure supplement 1C-D in the revised manuscript. Regarding the overinterpretation of stress behavior, we agree, so we have toned down our discussion of coping in favor for more operationalized descriptions throughout the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) The statement &quot;Altered responses to an innate stressor were associated with enhanced PFC-driven excitation of prodynorphin-containing neurons in the BNST&quot; and &quot;KOR dysregulation of corticolimbic circuits underlies lasting behavioral changes to stressors that emerge after chronic drinking&quot; are overinterpretations of the data.</p></disp-quote><p>Again, the first point raised, we have experimentally examined and can provide correlations between the parameters measured and behavioral responses exploring this relationship in Figure 4—figure supplement 1C-D. In addition, we have newly added a pathway-specific DREADD inactivation approach of PFC to BNST to explore alcohol-induced disruption of TMT-driven behavioral responses (Figure 7). These were specific to affecting TMT behavior, but not alcohol drinking (Figure 7E-H) or anxiety-like behavior in the elevated plus maze (Figure 7N-O).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>For example, it is not possible to know how the fiber photometry data in Figure 2 relates to behavior if at all.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer raises a good point. In light of the comments on photometry, we have removed this data set from the manuscript, as it is simply too preliminary.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The same can be said for animals used for slice electrophysiology recordings.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree, and have provided a correlation between drinking behavior and electrophysiology in Figure 4—figure supplement 1C-D.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Why were TMT behavioral assessments not performed during fiber photometry recordings of BNST Pdyn neurons? This would provide information (at least correlative) regarding the role of BNST Pdyn signaling in these behaviors in alcohol- vs. water-exposed mice.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this was not explored sufficiently. In light of other concerns about this experiment, we have removed the photometry from the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) In general, terms like &quot;maladaptive&quot; stress coping are used too liberally. For example, &quot;we tested whether BNST KOR/Pdyn signaling regulates maladaptive stress reactions after long-term alcohol drinking.&quot; Maladaptive how? Behavior was clearly affected by the independent variables, but there is no evidence that one response is more or less &quot;adaptive.&quot; Also, what is meant by &quot;negative&quot; stress coping?</p></disp-quote><p>In our interpretation, a lack of avoidance of predator odor is maladaptive in the sense it is more likely to result in the wild to lead to an interaction with a predator, which could lead to death. However, in light of the reviewer’s concerns, we can speak to the measured variables and limit our interpretation to a small section of discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The use of no-injection controls instead of vehicle-injected controls is atypical and not ideal because it does not match groups for the stress of injections (Figure 1D-F). This concern is magnified in a study that examines stress coping. It is difficult to interpret drug effects in the absence of a vehicle-injected control group.</p></disp-quote><p>Initially we thought that the period of time between injection and behavior, 16 hours, would limit this potential confound. In response to this concern, we have added a saline-injected behavioral cohort (Figure 1G-I) and saline-injected slice physiology cohort (Figure 4E-H), and our interpretations of the data have not changed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) It is unclear when systemic or intra-BNST norBNI injections were given in relation to TMT behavioral testing. Comparing Figure 1A and 1G, it appears that systemic norBNI injections were given immediately prior to TMT behavioral testing and intra-BNST norBNI injections were given at the end of the intermittent alcohol exposure period (7-10 days prior to TMT behavioral testing). This should be clarified. If systemic and intra-BNST treatments occurred at different time points, the reason for this should be explained and its potential impact on results and interpretation should be discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize and have clarified these details in the Materials and methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Include fiber photometry data from the 2nd TMT trial (TMT2) in addition to data from TMT1 and TMT3 (Figure 2I).</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested above, we have removed the photometry data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>[…]</p><p>1) The main behavioral effect in EtOH-drinking mice – increased time spent closed to TMT containing cotton tip – is convincing and very robust across experiments. However, I have some concerns regarding the interpretation of these behavioral changes at this point, as there may be alternative explanations that should be addressed or ruled out. For example, olfactory deficits have been repeatedly described in patients with chronic alcohol abuse, and BNST plays a critical role in olfactory function. How would the authors rule that EtOH drinking mice approached TMT simply because their olfactory impairments instead of stress-coping deficits? There are more options to investigate this question, including i) carrying out similar tests with neutral odors, ii) investigating effects of different TMT concentrations, or iii) performing different stress-coping tests during the protracted withdrawal period. At least, authors should provide a more detailed analysis of behaviour during the TMT test, including distance moved, freezing and possibly types of exploratory behaviour (i.e. flat-back approach), preferentially also during the habituation period (during which an empty cotton tip holder was placed into to the home cage), in order to strengthen the claim that increased TMT-contact reflects impaired coping with stress.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an interesting point, and we thank the reviewer for the suggestion. In part, we felt that the reversal of the phenotypes by BNST-specific manipulations ruled out olfactory deficits, but we now examined this using two additional approaches. First, we examined the TMT-induced corticosterone response, and found that TMT elicited increases in both alcohol and control mice, suggesting the alcohol mice can still smell the odor (Figure 1E). Second, we then tested how animals interacted with peanut oil, an odorant that elicits approach behavior (Figure 1—figure supplement 2A-C). We found no difference in approach to peanut oil between the alcohol and water groups.</p><p>Regarding a more rigorous examination of behavior during the TMT test, we now provide ethograms/Gantt plots of mouse TMT responses after alcohol, water, alcohol + norBNI, and water + norBNI (Figure 1—figure supplement 1). On the reviewer’s request, we included observations of burying, freezing, grooming, rearing, stretch-attend (similar to the suggested flat-back approach), and walking. As the mice generally spend most time burying compared to the other behaviors, we decided to forego formally quantifying the minimal time spent freezing, grooming, etc. We now include distance traveled in our measures related to drug/viral manipulations, as well.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) There is some confusion in the interpretation of results which is reflected both in the title and the impact statement of the paper, as authors did not investigate to effects of “alcohol drinking” per se but the effects of alcohol drinking during protracted alcohol withdrawal which seem to be qualitatively different. This should be clearly stated and discussed, whereas title and significance statement should be formulated accordingly.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the comment, we have clarified this in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) According to Figure 1B, alcohol intake as well as alcohol preference levels in EtOH drinking mice remained substantially lower than in mice in the cited paper (Hwa et al., 2011); in fact, mice of the current experiments did not prefer ethanol over water. What could be an explanation for this? Was the protocol of Hwa et al., 2011 followed and increasing amounts of ethanol were induced during the first week?</p></disp-quote><p>There are multiple environmental differences from the original paper including diet, cage types, sipper tubes, bedding, enrichment, etc. We did not ramp up the mice, just started at 20% ethanol. While it is plausible that this drives differences, others have published the escalation over time without the increasing of ethanol concentrations. We have now added blood ethanol concentrations in Figure 1D to show these mice drink to &gt;80 mg/dl intoxication. As reviewer 1 also commented, we have included a brief discussion on this in the revised manuscript, subsection “BNST KOR/Pdyn gates stress reactions after EtOH”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Are there any &quot;classical&quot; symptoms of ethanol withdrawal (e.g. hyperactivity or convulsions) at this later time point when authors carried out their measurements?</p></disp-quote><p>We did not overtly measure any classic symptoms of withdrawal. We have added a subtle difference in anxiety-like behavior at this protracted time point; however, after TMT exposure, the group difference dissipates. We have included distance traveled and elevated plus maze behavior and as additional measures in the revision.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Does &quot;burying&quot; mean defensive burying during the test? Is the movement generally directed towards TMT? The effects of EtOH drinking and of Pdyn/KOR-manipulations on burying behavior varied across experiments. This – along with a more precise description of this type of behavior – should be clearly stated and discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>We have purposefully kept “burying” as including both defensive burying, movement directed towards the TMT, and non-specific burying around the home cage. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>, we show a detailed analysis of the burying behavior, split into the two directional categories.</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-59709-resp-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Although it is mentioned in Results section that behavior in the forced swim test was only affected during early, but not during protracted abstinence, the latter data are not shown. How would the authors interpret the different time-related changes between the two behavioral tests?</p></disp-quote><p>This is a good question. However, we have decided to remove the early withdrawal data, as it was removed from the central question we asked.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) In fiber photometry experiments, calcium activity of BNST<sup>PDYN</sup> neurons did not differ between EtOH and H<sub>2</sub>O drinking mice during the first session (when all other behavioral, immunohistochemical and electrophysiological measurements were carried out) but only after repeated exposure to TMT. It would be nice to see correlated behavioral changes over TMT trials which may help to interpret these results. Maybe I'm mistaken but is seems that Figure 3B and 3F, 3C and 3G, as well as 3D and 3H depict the very same animals in non-injected, TMT-exposed H<sub>2</sub>O and EtOH groups, even though these were described as subsequent, separate experiments. This is not elegant and should be clarified.</p></disp-quote><p>In light of the photometry data being somewhat preliminary, we have removed it from the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Figure 3 and Figure 3—figure supplement 1 show that the TMT-induced increase in BNST<sup>Pdyn</sup> sEPSC frequency did not seem to depend EtOH-drinking history, while KOR antagonism also seemed to induce very similar effects in H<sub>2</sub>O and EtOH drinking mice. Rather, sEPSC/IPSC ratio of non-Pdyn cells of EtOH drinking stressed animals seemed to differ from H<sub>2</sub>O drinking mice, suggesting that EtOH-related effects here were not directly regulated by the Pdyn system. Therefore, the last sentence in Results paragraph six and third sentence of the Discussion are over-interpreting these results and should be formulated much more carefully.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewers comment and will adjust our verbiage. We have also eliminated the non-Pdyn cells, as these data are not helpful.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) How was injection volume and targeting of CTB controlled for across mice in tracing studies shown in Figure 4G? Are cell counts normalized in some way to expression within the BNST? It would be good to see injections sites for this experiment as well.</p></disp-quote><p>While injection volume was consistent across mice in tracing studies, we did not normalize to expression within the BNST. This remains a limitation, so we have removed this data set from the revision.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) There is no reference to Figure 4—figure supplement 1 F-H in the text. These figures suggest that – although functional connections from the mPFC to BNST may be strengthened in EtOH animals (but see concerns above about missing information on normalizing CTB counts and injection sites) – , activation of this projection upon TMT presentation does not depend on EtOH history (Figure 4—figure supplement 1H). Therefore, the first sentence in subsection “EtOH and stress interact revealing synaptic plasticity from cortical input” is misleading and should be re-formulated.</p></disp-quote><p>We have adjusted our verbiage here, thank you.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) Out of curiosity. Ethanol consumption and preference during intermittent ethanol drinking period seemed to show a rather large variation among animals. I assume that such variation may correlate with behavioral/neuronal changes during withdrawal, i.e. heavy drinkers would show more profound stress-related impairments. Is there any effect of the amount of voluntary consumed alcohol on later outcome?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree, this is an interesting question. We have conducted a series of correlations including all mice used for TMT behavioral testing, including Pdyn-GFP mice used in slice physiology, saline-injected controls, GFP-injected controls, PBS-injected controls. There does not appear to be a robust correlation between total alcohol consumption and TMT behavior.</p><fig id="respfig2"><label>Author response image 2.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-59709-resp-fig2-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>[…]</p><p>In general, this is an interesting manuscript with a novel emphasis on effects of stress after protracted abstinence. The writing is clear, but somewhat frustrating because much of the quantitative data is only found in the figure legends but not in the text in the Results section. Even then, the descriptions of the data in the figure legends appears somewhat cursory (perhaps due to relatively few figures with a tremendous number of individual panels).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for his/her positive comments. In the revised manuscript, we now include descriptions of the data in the body of the text instead of the figure legends.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) There is one issue which remains unclear to me. It is stated &quot;TMT increased expression of Pdyn GFP-expressing neurons in the BNST&quot;. Are the authors suggesting an increase in the number of Pdyn neurons in the BNST, an increase in Pdyn content in BNST, or both? Subsequently, it is stated that colocalization of c-Fos with Pdyn-neurons was greatest in the stressed-EtOH group. Is this due to increased c-Fos expression, increased Pdyn expression, or both?</p></disp-quote><p>This is an interesting question, so we quantified <italic>Pdyn</italic> and <italic>Oprk1</italic> expression after alcohol and TMT exposure using fluorescent in situ hybridization, shown in Figure 2F-J. There was greater Pdyn expression in the EtOH + TMT group compared to H<sub>2</sub>O+TMT group, so it appears there is an interaction of greater c-Fos activity in a greater number of Pdyn-expressing cells in the dBNST.</p><p>[Editors’ note: what follows is the authors’ response to the second round of review.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The rebuttal letter states that &quot;we have added a saline-injected behavioral cohort (Figure 1G-I).&quot; These new data strengthen the manuscript. But it is unclear if the new saline-injected controls were tested in parallel with a new norBNI-injected group, or if data from the new saline-injected group is being compared to previously collected data from the norBNI-injected group included in the first submission. If the latter, this should be stated as a caveat.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for bringing up this point regarding whether additional norBNI mice were tested at the same time as the newer saline-injected controls. Yes, saline-injected controls were added along with additional nor-BNI injected experimental mice for consistency.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Elevated plus-maze tests: it is somewhat difficult to understand the presented findings, as H<sub>2</sub>O and EtOH mice with or without previous TMT exposure were not tested for anxiety in the EPM in the same experiment. If we accept that the lack of anxiogenic effect in EtOH groups in some experiments might originate from the prior exposure to TMT, how can these data be interpreted? TMT exposure is associated with maladaptive behavioral responses in EtOH drinkers, but the very same TMT exposure reduces/restores anxiety in a subsequent EPM test, a novelty-related stress situation? These discrepancies/limitations need to be clearly discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers that the results using the elevated plus maze (EPM) are difficult to interpret. While we have not tested it statistically, it appears that TMT changed baseline values for control group, occluding a difference following alcohol. We have added the following text to more directly address this difference: “While EtOH mice also showed increased anxiety-like behavior in the elevated plus maze during protracted withdrawal, this group difference was eliminated following TMT exposure, as seen in our control drug/virus experiments after BNST norBNI, Pdyn deletion, and mPFC-BNST inhibition, suggesting long-lasting impact of TMT on performance in the elevated plus maze. […] This points to the elevated plus maze as a distinct, novelty-related probe, which may not be robust to differentiate EtOH-related phenotypes after a confounding TMT exposure.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) What was the time interval between TMT and EPM tests across experiments? Were systemic and intra-BNST norBNI treatments repeated before EPM tests or how did the authors assume that KOR antagonism is still “working” several days later?</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the confusion. The time interval between TMT and EPM tests was three days, which is now clarified in the Materials and methods. Systemic and intra-BNST norBNI administration were a single injection and were not repeated before EPM tests for fear of compounding dose concentrations. We have added the following text, “norBNI is known for its ultra-long duration of action (Munro et al., 2012). […] Therefore, it is likely that norBNI was on board at the time of TMT testing.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Systemic and intra-BNST administration of norBNI were administered at different timepoints i.e. 16 hrs vs. 7 days before TMT test. What was the reason for that? This is a large difference in protocols that should be discussed and evaluated more clearly.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the lack of information, so we have added these points to the drug methods, “Intra-BNST administration of norBNI was a single, bilateral infusion of drug. Since animals underwent stereotaxic surgery for drug delivery, 7 days was the minimum time for post-operative recovery before TMT behavioral testing. […] Therefore, it is likely that norBNI was on board at the time of TMT testing.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The description of DREADD-experiments should be clarified at several points. It is not clear when animals received CNO treatments during the alcohol-drinking period. Was CNO administered only once (when?) to measure subsequent acute changes in EtOH consumption or was it administered repeatedly (how?) during intermittent EtOH drinking? Were the same animals tested in the TMT and EPM tests? What was the lag time between tests (and CNO treatments)?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for allowing us to further describe the DREADD experimental methods. “To test DREADD-mediated inhibition on EtOH consumption, saline and CNO were administered 20 min before EtOH drinking on two final test days. EtOH and H<sub>2</sub>O fluid consumption were measured after 1, 4, and 24 hr. During protracted withdrawal 7 days later, CNO was administered 20 min before the TMT test, and again 20 min before testing in the EPM, which occurred after 3 days.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The intersectional strategy for targeting Gi-DREADDs to the mPFC-BNST circuit coupled with systemic CNO injection may have off-target effects on collaterals of those mPFC that project to other brain regions – this should be acknowledged as a caveat.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this important suggestion. Text has been added acknowledging this caveat in the Discussion: “It is also possible that the systemic CNO injection may impact behavior via effects on collaterals of those PFC-BNST that project to other brain regions. This is a caveat, and intra-BNST delivery of CNO would be more direct.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Results and Discussion should be double checked as there are still several inaccuracies in data presentation and discussion that result in overinterpretations. e.g. in Discussion, authors claim that &quot;Experiments with ex vivo optogenetics indicated that EtOH-drinking stressed mice had increased prefrontal cortical synaptic connectivity onto BNST<sup>PDYN</sup> cells compared to stressed H<sub>2</sub>O drinkers and unstressed EtOH drinkers.&quot; This is not true, no parameter differed significantly between stressed EtOH and H<sub>2</sub>O drinkers; stressed EtOH drinkers only differed from non-stressed groups.
