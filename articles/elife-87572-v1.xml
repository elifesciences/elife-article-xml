However, the relationship between chromatin mobility and other genomic processes remains unclear. Hence, we set out to label the DNA directly in a sequence unbiased manner and followed labeled chromatin dynamics in interphase human cells expressing GFP-tagged proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), a cell cycle marker and core component of the DNA replication machinery. We detected decreased chromatin mobility during the S-phase compared to G1 and G2 phases in tumor as well as normal diploid cells using automated particle tracking. To gain insight into the dynamical organization of the genome during DNA replication, we determined labeled chromatin domain sizes and analyzed their motion in replicating cells. By correlating chromatin mobility proximal to the active sites of DNA synthesis, we showed that chromatin motion was locally constrained at the sites of DNA replication. Furthermore, inhibiting DNA synthesis led to increased loading of DNA polymerases. This was accompanied by accumulation of the single-stranded DNA binding protein on the chromatin and activation of DNA helicases further restricting local chromatin motion. We, therefore, propose that it is the loading of replisomes but not their catalytic activity that reduces the dynamics of replicating chromatin segments in the S-phase as well as their accessibility and probability of interactions with other genomic regions.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>aphidicolin</kwd><kwd>cell cycle</kwd><kwd>chromatin tracking</kwd><kwd>diffusion</kwd><kwd>DNA replication</kwd><kwd>DNA labeling</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Project-ID 393547839 - SFB 1361</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cardoso</surname><given-names>M Cristina</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CA 198/9-2 Project-ID 232488461</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cardoso</surname><given-names>M Cristina</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CA 198/15-1 (SPP 2202) Project-ID 422831194</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cardoso</surname><given-names>M Cristina</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RO 2471/10-1 (SPP 2202) Project-ID 402733153</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rohr</surname><given-names>Karl</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFB 1129 (project Z4) Project-ID 240245660</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rohr</surname><given-names>Karl</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Live cell tracking of labeled DNA reveals that replisome loading rather than DNA synthesis decreases the chromatin motion during S-phase in human cells.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Dynamic yet functionally stable organization of cellular processes is a crucial feature of biological systems, which allows them to respond to external stimuli and survive. The eukaryotic nucleus is a complex subcellular organelle where DNA metabolism, including its replication, repair, and transcription, occurs. Eukaryotic DNA is organized in the nuclear space by interactions with histones and architectural proteins to form a hierarchy of domains and compartments of the interphase chromatin. Nuclear architecture is dynamically modulated due to the binding of biomolecules and epigenetic changes of the chromatin. It is also interdependent with DNA metabolism mediated by the action of enzymes on the chromatin. The maintenance of the DNA (including its replication and repair) and its transcription into RNA are spatio-temporally organized within the cell nucleus.</p><p>Analysis of the local chromatin dynamics in live cells revealed that an essential aspect of interphase chromatin is its mobile nature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gasser, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Marshall et al., 1997</xref>). The movement of chromatin loci was shown to be consistent with an anomalous (constrained) diffusion model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Scipioni et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Shukron et al., 2019</xref>). This model indicates that a single chromatin locus is corralled within a sub-micron radius and exhibits random diffusion motion and will execute multiple random jumps into neighboring compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bronshtein et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chubb et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Heun et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Levi et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Marshall et al., 1997</xref>). This behavior, which we refer to as local chromatin diffusion (LCD), has been described in multiple systems, suggesting that it is likely to represent a fundamental aspect of chromatin dynamics in eukaryotes.</p><p>According to the current paradigm, the 4D organization of the chromatin inherently includes its physical properties as a long polymer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Esposito et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Esposito et al., 2019</xref>), while stochastic thermodynamically driven events are likely to play a key role in the domain organization of the chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Conte et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Shin and Brangwynne, 2017</xref>) and in the regulation of genomic processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hnisz et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kilic et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Laghmach et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Nozaki et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Spegg and Altmeyer, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Uchino et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>Some studies have reported that chromatin mobility is enhanced due to active transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Gu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Tunnacliffe and Chubb, 2020</xref>), whereas others report rather a decrease in mobility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mach et al., 2022</xref>). Furthermore, other studies report diverse effects of RNA polymerase II inhibition on chromatin motion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Germier et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ku et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Shaban et al., 2018</xref>). It has been also shown that the removal of RNA polymerase II from chromatin relaxes chromatin and increases its mobility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Babokhov et al., 2020</xref>). Conversely, there is an established view that chromatin mobility at the sites of double-stranded DNA breaks increases concomitant with their repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Eaton and Zidovska, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hauer and Gasser, 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hauer and Gasser, 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hauer et al., 2017b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Nagai et al., 2010</xref>). Analysis of fluorescently tagged histones using displacement correlation spectroscopy has shown that chromatin undergoes coherent micron-scale motion at the time scales of 5–10 s independently of the cell cycle stage in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Zidovska et al., 2013</xref>). This coherent motion extended beyond individual chromosomes, suggesting mechanical coupling between chromosomes. Furthermore, the correlated motion of chromatin was ATP-dependent and completely disappeared upon DNA damage induction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Eaton and Zidovska, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Zidovska et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>DNA replication is a highly conserved energy-dependent process occurring in S-phase of the cell cycle, when chromatin structures undergo extensive reorganization to facilitate DNA synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Vincent et al., 2008</xref>). An early study in budding yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Heun et al., 2001</xref>) demonstrated that individual heterologous loci became constrained in S-phase when integrated close to early- and late-firing replication origins, but not at the telomeric or centromeric regions. However, changes in chromatin mobility in S-phase were not observed when analyzing it at the level of chromosome territories in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Walter et al., 2003</xref>). Recent work using a CRISPR-based DNA imaging system suggests that local chromatin motion is restricted upon S-phase entry and more markedly in mid-late S-phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ma et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Altogether, it is not clear whether and how chromatin mobility changes during DNA replication and a mechanism behind the changes in chromatin motion. Therefore, it is important to address how changes in structure and metabolism of chromatin affect its mobility. It is quite intriguing to postulate that the process of genome duplication in mammals, which is performed at the level of naked DNA and involves local chromatin decondensation and rearrangements at the complete hierarchy of domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baddeley et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chagin et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Löb et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sadoni et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Sporbert et al., 2002</xref>), is associated with changes in chromatin mobility. Furthermore, it is tempting to speculate that the modulation of LCD may play a regulatory role; for example, by helping to define the transcriptional profile of the nucleus, by provoking collisions between regulatory regions, promoter regions, and transcription factories. These events could be halted or slowed down during the replication of the genome, avoiding collisions of the transcription with the replication machineries. An alternative but not mutually exclusive model is that changes in LCD result from the execution of nuclear processes such as transcription or replication. This is particularly appealing as DNA/RNA helicases and polymerases are, in essence, motor proteins that reel DNA through. To distinguish between these possibilities, alterations in LCD must be characterized within the context of relevant nuclear processes and by labeling DNA directly and in an unbiased manner.</p><p>The process of genome replication has a particular and intrinsic connection between chromatin organization and the spatio-temporal progression of genome replication (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mamberti and Cardoso, 2020</xref>). In that sense, firing of origins of replication by the activation of DNA helicase complexes followed by the loading of synthetic polymerase complexes tracks chromatin compaction and upon DNA duplication the focal chromatin organization at multiple hierarchical levels is preserved and can be detected over several cell generations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cremer et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Jackson and Pombo, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sadoni et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Sparvoli et al., 1994</xref>). Importantly, genome replication is the only DNA metabolic process that encompasses the entire genome, thus ensuring the preservation of the genetic material upon cell division.</p><p>As most of the studies introduce artificial DNA sequences in genomic loci and use a large array of chromatin binding proteins to visualize the loci, chromatin dynamics may be altered in the subsequent process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Germier et al., 2017</xref>). Therefore, a more direct way to measure chromatin dynamics is to label and track the DNA directly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Schermelleh et al., 2001</xref>). A similar procedure has previously been used to mark chromosome territories and characterize their long-term rearrangements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bornfleth et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Pliss et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Walter et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we investigated the mobility of chromatin in human cells, focusing on how changes in chromatin mobility are influenced by cell cycle progression and, in particular, DNA replication. To achieve this, we performed a detailed analysis of chromatin mobility in S-phase by combining locus-independent global labeling of DNA with reliable particle tracking. Measurement of the DNA content of the labeled structures allowed us to elucidate whether DNA replication affects chromatin mobility at the level of replication domains. Our results show that chromatin mobility generally decreases during S-phase and, in particular, at the proximity of the DNA polymerase complexes. Furthermore, we extended our study to dissect mechanisms behind the S-phase-related changes in chromatin mobility and inhibited DNA synthesis using small molecule inhibitors. We showed that chromatin mobility is further decreased in S-phase after inhibition of DNA synthesis. These results imply that loading of the polymerase complexes rather than the synthesis of DNA per se restraints DNA mobility.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Genome-wide labeling of DNA and quantification of labeled chromatin domains</title><p>To evaluate LCD relative to the cell cycle stage, we first developed an experimental system to monitor both replication and chromatin changes in living cells in real time. We generated HeLa cell lines that stably express GFP-tagged proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and single stranded DNA binding protein or replication protein A (RPA) (Materials and methods, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1a</xref>). We transfected fluorescent PCNA plasmid to label replication sites in human normal diploid fibroblasts (IMR90) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Nichols et al., 1977</xref>). PCNA is a core component of the DNA replication machinery and a marker for cell cycle progression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chagin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Easwaran et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Leonhardt et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Moldovan et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Prelich et al., 1987</xref>). To visualize the mobility of native chromatin, we took the advantage of the ongoing DNA replication. We delivered a pulse of the fluorescently labeled nucleotide Cy3-dUTP by electroporation into an asynchronously growing population of human HeLa GFP-PCNA tumor cells and human diploid IMR90 fibroblasts, which allowed us to study chromatin dynamics in a global genome-wide manner (Materials and methods, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The nucleotide is incorporated into the nascent DNA of the cells in various periods of S-phase, effectively labeling the chromatin directly in an unbiased manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Manders et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sadoni et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Schermelleh et al., 2001</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Incorporation of Cy3-dUTP in HeLa cell nuclei labels the whole genome randomly and with equal probability.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic illustration of the labeling system for monitoring chromatin mobility and cell cycle progression. During S-phase, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) accumulates within the nucleus at sites of active DNA replication and exhibits a distinct puncta pattern. During G1 and G2, GFP-PCNA is diffusely distributed throughout the nucleus. Asynchronously growing populations of cells were exposed to electroporation to promote the uptake of Cy3-dUTP. In cells undergoing DNA replication, this fluorescent nucleotide is incorporated into nascent DNA strands at sites of active DNA replication, resulting in the direct fluorescent labeling of genomic segments. Based on the PCNA pattern, different cell cycle stages can be differentiated as shown in the image on the right (Se – early S, Sm – mid S, SL – late S, G1/G2 – gap phases, green – PCNA).

The representative images of different cells using time-lapse microscopy were shown to depict the patterns of PCNA (shown in green) in each sub-stage and their change over time (co-localized signals in yellow). This was used to classify cells in G1, S, and G2 phases of the cell cycle for motion analysis.

Since LCD measurements depend on the object size, it was important to evaluate the size of the labeled DNA domains. This allowed us to correlate the chromatin domain sizes and their diffusion rates. For this purpose, we measured the total DNA amount in a cell and the fraction of it that corresponded to the labeled domain (Materials and methods, DNA quantification of labeled chromatin). First, we applied chemical fixation to cells labeled with Cy3-dUTP using formaldehyde. The total DNA was then labeled using the DNA dye DAPI. Next, we segmented the entire nucleus as well as the individual labeled chromatin foci within the same cell. The fraction of DAPI intensity within the segmented replication focus (I<sub>RFi</sub>) over the total DNA intensity within the cell (I<sub>DNA total</sub>) yields the amount of DNA present per labeled chromatin focus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Since nuclear DNA amount doubles continuously throughout the S-phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chagin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Leonhardt et al., 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), it was important to scale the total DNA amount by a correction factor depending on S-phase sub-stage to measure the DNA amount per focus more accurately. The relative amount of DNA throughout the cell cycle stages and sub-stages of S-phase was calculated and plotted as histograms, with the mean of the histogram for each cell cycle (sub)stage constituting the cell cycle correction factor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). The fraction of DAPI intensities were corrected by multiplication with the genome size corresponding to the cell cycle stage. The genome size of HeLa Kyoto cells is GS = 9.682 ± 0.002 Gbp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chagin et al., 2016</xref>) and for IMR90 fibroblasts the genome size is 6.37 Gbp as measured earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Nichols et al., 1977</xref>). We plotted the DNA amount present in each replication focus in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> for HeLa on left and IMR90 on right. The highest frequency of average DNA amount per focus (mode +1 bin) was about 300–600 kbp of DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Altogether, with our labeling approach, we labeled DNA domains of sizes ranging from 0.5 Mbp to 10 Mbp, with the vast majority corresponding to 0.5 Mbp, which correspond well to multi-loop chromatin domains corresponding in size to topological associated domains (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Giorgetti and Heard, 2016</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Principle of measuring DNA content per labeled DNA focus using confocal data.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) To determine the amount of DNA per labeled DNA focus, we used the total DAPI signal (DNA amount) of the segmented whole nucleus (I<sub>DNA TOTAL</sub>). The DNA intensity per labeled DNA focus within the segmented foci is obtained (I<sub>RFi</sub>) by masking the replication foci and estimating the corresponding portion of DAPI signal. (<bold>B</bold>) Throughout the S-phase progression the amount of DNA increases twofold from early to late S-phase. The amount of DNA present in the nucleus at a particular cell cycle stage can be determined by measuring the DNA amount in the population of cells, while using the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) pattern to determine the cell cycle stage and S-phase sub-stage (see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The relative mean amount of DNA of each of the cell cycle (sub-)stages is used to calculate the cell cycle correction factor. The cell cycle correction factor (C/cell cycle stage) was estimated as: 1.0/G1; 1.05/early S-phase; 1.25/mid-S-phase; 1.77/late S-phase, 2/G2. The G1 genome size (GS) for HeLa cells is 9.7 Gbp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chagin et al., 2016</xref>).

Normal diffusion or Brownian motion is a linear diffusion model with ɑ=1 and when ɑ&gt;1 it is termed super diffusion. First, the cells were annotated according to the different cell cycle stages (G1, S, G2) based on the PCNA subnuclear pattern (Materials and methods). PCNA forms puncta or foci at the active replication sites during S-phase and this was used to classify cells in S-phase. We were able to distinguish between G1 and G2 cells, even though they exhibit a similar diffused PCNA subnuclear distribution, based on the information on the preceding cell cycle stage from the time-lapse analysis performed after Cy3-dUTP labeling (Materials and methods, Microscopy). Specifically, cells with diffusely distributed PCNA signal which had previously undergone mitosis were in G1 phase, whereas the ones with similar diffuse PCNA pattern that had previously undergone S-phase (punctated PCNA pattern) were classified as being in G2 phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The PCNA signal was also used to segment the nucleus, and the individual chromatin foci were detected within the segmented nuclei.

For this purpose, we performed time-lapse microscopy of GFP-PCNA and GFP-RPA34 expressing cells. During active DNA synthesis, the DNA polymerase clamp and processivity factor PCNA is loaded onto the DNA as a trimeric ring and is tightly bound to the DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). During aphidicolin treatment though, PCNA dissociated from DNA as shown before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Görisch et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Rausch et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Aphidicolin treatment does not stop helicase activity and the replication protein A (RPA) is loaded on the ssDNA after being unwound by the DNA helicase. The more the DNA double helix is unwound, the more RPA loads onto the ssDNA generated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Rausch et al., 2021</xref>). For this analysis, we generated a HeLa cell line stably expressing GFP-RPA34 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>). We performed time-lapse microscopy on HeLa GFP-RPA34 cells every 5 min for 60 min for both aphidicolin-treated and control DMSO-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4A</xref>). We observed that RPA accumulated over time on DNA at replication sites in aphidicolin-treated cells but not in the control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4</xref>). RPA accumulation indicated that the DNA helicase complexes continued unwinding the DNA, which allowed for increasing amounts of RPA to bind and, at the same time, the DNA polymerases were not active displacing the RPA while synthesizing the second (complementary) DNA strand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Görisch et al., 2008</xref>). Therefore, we studied the kinetics of accumulation of RPA on chromatin upon DNA synthesis inhibition by quantifying the accumulation of GFP-RPA34 in live cells upon treatment with aphidicolin normalized to DMSO-treated cells using the coefficient of variation (Cv), which indicates the amount of RPA protein accumulated over time (Materials and methods, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s5">Figure 5—figure supplement 5</xref>). We observed clear accumulation of RPA over time relative to control, showing that the ssDNA binding protein accumulates on chromatin. Hence, this indicates that upon stress the DNA helicase remained active unwinding the DNA.</p><p>Next, we analyzed the distribution of the helicase subunit MCM2 and its phosphorylated (p108) form along with DNA polymerases α, ε, and δ (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1d</xref>) at the chromatin. It has been previously described that the phosphorylated form of MCM2 is the active form for DNA unwinding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Forsburg, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Montagnoli et al., 2006</xref>). We predicted from the RPA accumulation that the helicase subunit was present at the replication sites and actively spooling the DNA through after the DNA synthesis inhibition. We first performed western blot analysis of different replication factors from asynchronous populations of HeLa cells after isolating the cytoplasm, nucleoplasm, and chromatin fractions (Materials and methods). We tested the fractionation protocol by blotting the membranes with antibodies to α-tubulin for the cytoplasmic fraction and macro H2A1 histone for the chromatin fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). The same fractions were then incubated with antibodies for different replication factors. We observed significant dissociation of PCNA from chromatin and accumulation of RPA on chromatin upon aphidicolin treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>) consistent with our fixed cell and live cell microscopy analysis. We found no significant changes in MCM2 helicase subunit levels on chromatin and higher levels of phosphorylation of MCM2 upon treatment with aphidicolin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Lastly, we incubated the blots with antibodies recognizing the catalytic subunits of the DNA polymerases α, δ, and ε complexes (Materials and methods, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1d</xref>). The DNA polymerases showed a different behavior as compared to the DNA polymerase clamp protein, with DNA polymerase α being enriched on chromatin upon stress, with only minor to no changes being observed for the processive DNA polymerases δ and ε (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C and D</xref>). It is of note that both these processive DNA polymerases bind the polymerase clamp PCNA whereas the far less processive DNA polymerase α does not. The full-length blots are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s6">Figure 5—figure supplement 6</xref>.</p><p>We then performed an orthogonal analysis using high-throughput microscopy and image analysis. We labeled cells with EdU for 10 min to mark the S-phase cells and treated cells with DMSO/aphidicolin and subsequently performed pre-extraction to remove the unbound fraction of proteins and only detect the chromatin-bound proteins. In this manner, we separately quantified accumulation only in S-phase cells and not in populations of cells including all cell cycle stages as in the previous western blot analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). The pre-extracted cells were fixed and immunostained for different replisome components (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). The cells were imaged using a spinning disk confocal microscopy system (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1e</xref>) and image analysis was performed using the KNIME software with custom pipeline to quantify the accumulation/loss of replication factors on chromatin in S-phase cells (Materials and methods, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1i</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s7">Figure 5—figure supplement 7</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s8">Figure 5—figure supplement 8</xref>). Using the EdU signal, the S-phase cells were selected for the quantitation of chromatin-bound replisome components (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). We found that PCNA dissociated from chromatin and RPA accumulated on chromatin upon stress in accordance with our previous analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). We found no changes in MCM2 helicase subunit but an increase in active MCM2p108 levels upon stress. This is consistent with no new loading of DNA helicases but de novo activation of already loaded helicase complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ge et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ibarra et al., 2008</xref>). Finally, we observed significant accumulation of DNA polymerases α and δ on chromatin after aphidicolin treatment. PCNA does not associate with DNA polymerase α, which has a low processivity, but it associates with DNA polymerases ε and δ, which constitute the processive synthetic machinery responsible for most of the duplication of the genome. Hence, it was surprising that these two polymerases remain associated and even load de novo at non-synthetizing replication sites. The increase in DNA polymerase α could lead to the recruitment of alternative polymerase clamp 9-1-1 as reported before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Michael et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Van et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Yan and Michael, 2009a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Yan and Michael, 2009b</xref>). Several scenarios explaining the different levels of DNA polymerases α and δ upon stress are possible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>): (i) multiple polymerase complexes may load within the same Okazaki fragment, which is less likely in view of what is known on DNA replication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>); (ii) multiple Okazaki fragments each with DNA polymerase α and δ within the same replication fork may form on the extended ssDNA unwound by the helicase complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>); (iii) additional replication origins may fire in the proximity of the stalled replication fork, which would explain the increase in both active phosphorylated helicase and DNA polymerases α and δ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Having established the conditions in which DNA synthesis but not DNA unwinding is blocked and concomitantly polymerases are accumulated, we then addressed the consequences for chromatin motion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Accumulation of replisome components but not processive DNA synthesis per se restricts chromatin motion</title><p>To elucidate the roles of the processive DNA synthesis and loading of synthetic machinery in chromatin motion decrease in S-phase, we imaged single cells for PCNA, RPA34, and Cy3-dUTP pre- and post-aphidicolin treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, see also <xref ref-type="video" rid="video4">Videos 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video5">5</xref>). The PCNA and RPA patterns did not change in G1/G2, whereas in S-phase the PCNA was dissociated from chromatin and RPA was accumulated at the same previously replicating sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, see also <xref ref-type="video" rid="video6">Videos 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video7">7</xref>). Chromatin motion analysis was performed on DNA labeled with Cy3-dUTP for both G1/G2 cells and S-phase cells pre- and post-treatment with aphidicolin. We observed that chromatin motion was unaffected in G1/G2, which fit with our prediction, as in G1/G2 there is no active DNA synthesis besides possible DNA repair processes on a limited genomic scale (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). As hydroxyurea, another DNA synthesis inhibitor, significantly affected chromatin mobility outside of S-phase, we did not further pursue it. Surprisingly, aphidicolin treatment and inhibition of DNA synthesis led to additional decrease in chromatin motion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>) and the chromatin became even more constrained than at the proximity of the active replication sites in S-phase cells (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). As quantified above, after aphidicolin treatment, the helicases were still loaded and actively spooling DNA through, whereas the DNA polymerases α and δ albeit not synthesizing DNA accumulated on chromatin at the sites of helicase/RPA accumulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Inhibition of DNA synthesis by aphidicolin further restricts chromatin mobility in S-phase but not in G1/G2 cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative images of HeLa GFP-RPA34 cells transfected with a construct coding for miRFP670-proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and Cy3-dUTP nucleotides for both G1/G2 and S-phase cells pre- and post-aphidicolin (Aph) treatment.

Cy3 and GFP were excited sequentially using 543 nm and 488 nm solid-state diode laser lines to minimize crosstalk. The standard protocol for examining chromatin mobility in Cy3-dUTP-labeled nuclei was as follows: first, a reference image comprising the miRFP670/GFP-PCNA, Cy3-dUTP, and the phase-contrast signal was collected from a single focal plane corresponding to the middle of the nucleus. This image demarcated the nuclear boundary, provided cell cycle information, and, in the case of S-phase cells, allowed us to correlate the positions of Cy3-dUTP foci with sites of DNA replication. Second, while maintaining the same focal plane, a time series (30–60 s) at a frame rate of 500 ms was captured. To maximize the temporal resolution, the time series consisted solely of the Cy3-dUTP channel and a PCNA reference frame at the beginning to obtain information on the cell cycle stage.</p><p>Multiple point time-lapse microscopy was performed using the multi-time option available in the spinning disk Volocity 6.3 software to image the chromatin (Cy3-dUTP) of the same cells pre- and post-treatment of aphidicolin. To minimize photo-toxicity over the course of the experiment, transmitted light contrast imaging was used to focus the cells. Live cell imaging was performed by following cells through the cell cycle and G1 and G2 stages were classified based on the previous cell cycle stage.</p><p>For the inhibition experiments (aphidicolin) different cells/points were chosen using the multipoint function of the Perkin Elmer spinning disk, and image sequences before the treatment were acquired. The reference image consisted of GFP-RPA34, Cy3-dUTP, and miRFP670-PCNA using 488 nm, 561 nm, and 640 nm solid-state diode lasers, respectively. After acquiring the reference images, the media containing the small molecule inhibitor was added to cells on the microscope for the required time and after treatment image sequences were acquired for analysis of chromatin motion.</p><p>High-throughput imaging was performed using the 40×/0.95 numerical aperture air objective of the PerkinElmer Operetta system. We used different filters (excitation/emission: 360/400, 460/490, 560/580) to image DAPI, EdU, and different replication proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1e</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>Quantification of DNA synthesis inhibition</title><p>The high-throughput images were used to quantify the percentage of cells with inhibition of DNA synthesis upon aphidicolin treatment. A minimum of 100 fields with around 2000–5000 cells were acquired in all channels. The images were then analyzed using the PerkinElmer Harmony software. The steps in brief (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>) include segmentation of nuclei using cell types of specific parameters like the diameter, splitting coefficient, and intensity threshold. The segmentation was then validated by visually checking it in randomly selected regions. Once the nuclei were segmented, cells touching the border were omitted. The intensity values with mean, median, standard deviation, and the sum of the intensities were obtained for individual cells. The datasheets were then imported to R and plots were generated. EdU signal was used to identify the population of cells actively replicating upon aphidicolin treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). The background intensity for EdU staining was determined using a negative control which was not treated with EdU but stained. The cells showing a mean intensity greater than the background intensity were separated into an EdU positive population and plotted.</p></sec><sec id="s3-7"><title>DNA quantification of labeled chromatin</title><p>DNA quantification of the labeled foci was done by automated image analysis. Image sequences with labeled chromatin were acquired on a Ultra-View VoX spinning disk microscope, using a 60× objective (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). For segmentation of replication foci, we used the protocol originally described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chagin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chagin et al., 2015</xref>. The channels comprising DAPI replication foci signals were imported into the software Perkin Elmer Volocity 6.3 and converted into volumes. The pixel dimensions of the images were set to the specifications for the spinning disk (x/y: 0.066 μm and z: 0.3 μm). The following processing steps were applied: Find objects (‘nucleus’) using the DAPI channel, method ‘Intensity’ (set manually to the optimal value), use fill holes in object/dilate/erode until the object optimally fits the nucleus, exclude objects by size &lt;500 μm<sup>3</sup>. Find objects using the label channel, method ‘Intensity’ (lower limit: 1, upper limit: 65535), separate touching objects, exclude ‘foci’' not touching ‘nucleus’. Using the detected foci, the DNA content of foci was determined via the sum of intensities in the DAPI channel and the genome size of the cell type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-8"><title>Automated tracking of chromatin structures in time-lapse videos</title><p>The motility of fluorescently labeled chromatin structures in live cell fluorescence microscopy images was quantified within manually segmented single nuclei. The background image intensity was adjusted for each image sequence to the computed mean intensity value over all time points within a manually selected region of interest (ROI) of the background. Automatic tracking of multiple fluorescently labeled chromatin structures was performed using a probabilistic particle tracking approach, which is based on Bayesian filtering and multi-sensor data fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Ritter et al., 2021</xref>). This approach combines Kalman filtering with particle filtering and integrates multiple measurements by separate sensor models and sequential multi-sensor data fusion. Detection-based and prediction-based measurements are obtained by elliptical sampling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Godinez and Rohr, 2015</xref>), and the separate sensor models allow considering different uncertainties. In addition, motion information based on displacements from past time points is exploited and integrated in the cost function for correspondence finding. Chromatin structures are detected by the spot-enhancing filter (SEF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sage et al., 2005</xref>) which consists of a Laplacian-of-Gaussian filter followed by thresholding the filtered image and determination of local maxima. The threshold is automatically determined by the mean of the absolute values of the filtered image plus a factor times the standard deviation. We used the same threshold factor for all images of an image sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-9"><title>Chromatin motility analysis</title><p>Based on the computed trajectories, the motility of chromatin structures was analyzed, and the motion type was determined for different cell cycle stages along with active replication sites, and inhibition of DNA synthesis with aphidicolin. We performed an MSD analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Saxton, 1997</xref>) and computed the MSD as a function of the time interval Δt for each trajectory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). The MSD curves for all trajectories with a minimum time duration of 10 s (corresponding to 20 time steps) under one condition were averaged. We considered only the trajectories with a time duration larger than the minimum time duration which improved the accuracy of the motility analysis. We fitted the anomalous diffusion model to the calculated MSD values to obtain the anomalous diffusion coefficient α. The motion was classified into confined diffusion, obstructed diffusion, and normal diffusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bacher et al., 2004</xref>). To determine the diffusion coefficient D (μm²/s), the diffusion model was fitted to the MSD values. In case of IMR90 cells, affine image registration was performed using the method in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Celikay et al., 2022</xref>, to address the stronger cell movement compared to HeLa cells.</p></sec><sec id="s3-10"><title>CCD/proximity analysis</title><p>Automatic proximity analysis of chromatin and PCNA was performed using the computed trajectories of chromatin structures and detected sites of active DNA synthesis represented by fluorescently labeled PCNA. Only trajectories of chromatin structures present at the first time point of an image sequence and with a minimum time duration of 10 s (corresponding to 20 time steps) were considered. PCNA foci were automatically detected in the fluorescence microscopy images by the SEF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). For each PCNA image, a single nucleus was manually segmented, and the background intensity was adjusted to the computed mean intensity value within a manually selected ROI of the background. Proximity was determined for the first time point of the trajectory of a chromatin structure and detected PCNA foci using a graph-based k-d-tree approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bentley, 1975</xref>). Due to the k-d-tree structure, this approach allows efficient computation of the nearest neighbor query based on the Euclidean distance between foci in the chromatin and PCNA channel. If a chromatin structure at the first time point of the image sequence has a nearest PCNA neighbor within a maximum distance, the trajectory of a chromatin structure is considered within CCD. Otherwise, the trajectory is considered outside the CCD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-11"><title>Accumulation analysis</title><p>To analyze the focal RPA accumulation upon DMSO/aphidicolin treatment, cell nuclei were segmented using the Volocity software (Version 6.3, Perkin Elmer). The GFP-RPA34 signal was segmented before and after treatment of the same cell in the live experiments and plotted over time after DMSO and drug treatment. The GFP-RPA intensities were measured and the coefficient of variation cV = σ/µ, with σ = standard deviation and µ=mean, was calculated for all time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s5">Figure 5—figure supplement 5</xref>).

The image analysis pipeline was constructed as follows (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s7">Figure 5—figure supplement 7</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s8">Figure 5—figure supplement 8</xref>). Briefly, the channels were separated. The DAPI channel was used for the nuclei segmentation. Nuclei were segmented based on manually chosen intensity threshold, the Watershed Transform was applied next to separate the close-positioned nuclei. The segmented nuclei were converted into a mask with each nucleus DAPI intensity and texture features recorded. The nuclei population was further thresholded by nucleus area and circularity to eliminate segmentation artifacts. The EdU and replication protein channels were subjected to foci segmentation based on a wavelet transform algorithm. The algorithm parameters were selected individually for each type of the replication protein and maintained the same between the control and treated samples. The nuclear mask and EdU foci/replication protein foci masks were overlaid to filter only the foci inside the nuclear areas. The EdU foci/replication protein foci intensity parameters (total focus intensity, mean focus intensity), area, and foci number per nucleus were exported as XLSX files for further analysis. The data was analyzed in RStudio (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/">https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/</ext-link>). First, the S-phase cell population was identified by the number of EdU foci per nucleus. The EdU foci number threshold was set as 50 for the cells in control samples, and 55 for aphidicolin-treated samples among all datasets. The nuclei in S-phase were next analyzed for their replication protein accumulation. The total levels of the replication proteins were plotted as box plots, ***p&lt;0.001 by Wilcoxon rank-sum test, for aphidicolin-treated vs. control sample.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s4"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Visualization, Writing - original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Software</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Software</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Software, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Formal analysis</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Software</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con11"><p>Conceptualization, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con12"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con13"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>The <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> contains tables 1a–1i, which describes the materials, software, and datasets.</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-87572-supp1-v1.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s6"><title>Data availability</title><p>All data are available from the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://cc-omero.bio.tu-darmstadt.de/webclient/userdata/?experimenter=-1">OMERO open microscopy environment public repository</ext-link> and TUdatalib (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.48328/tudatalib-873">https://doi.org/10.48328/tudatalib-873</ext-link>).

Although interesting, reduced chromatin mobility in S relative to G1 phase is not new to the field.</p></disp-quote><p>It was first shown in yeast (Heun et al. 2001; DOI:10.1126/science.1065366) that the S-phase mobility is reduced compared to the G1 phase. This was followed by other papers showing the same in yeast [(Gasser 2002; DOI:10.1126/science.1067703), (Smith et al. 2019; DOI: 10.1091/mbc.E19-08-0469)]. The relation between chromatin motion and cell cycle progression in the mammalian genome is less studied. Over recent years there have been a few studies that addressed chromatin mobility and cell cycle progression but from a different perspective. In the publication Nozaki et al. (2017;DOI:10.1016/j.molcel.2017.06.018) chromatin motion analysis was performed on single histones. The study did not find a significant change of histone/nucleosome mobility measured during cell cycle progression. Using CRISPR/dCas9 to label random DNA loci, Ma et al. (2019; DOI:10.1083/jcb.201807162) found that chromatin motion in S-phase was significantly lower than in the G1 phase. However, most of the studies measure the chromatin motion using either insertion of ectopic loci or proteins marking the loci (dCas9) or histones. Using either ectopic loci addition or CRISPR/dCas9 might have an effect on the chromatin mobility itself and measuring single histone motion is not equivalent to measuring the motion of DNA segments. We, therefore, opted to label the DNA directly using the replication of the DNA. In this manner we preserve the native chromatin structure and, thus, motion.</p><p>Importantly, in addition to measuring decreased DNA motion in S-phase, our study indicates that it is not the DNA synthesis per se but the loading of replisomes onto chromatin that slows down its motion. This allowed us to propose a mechanism on how chromatin motion is affected by DNA replication in S-phase.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The genome in HeLa cells is greatly abnormal with heterogeneous aneuploidy, which makes quantification complicated and weakens the conclusions.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the HeLa cells are aneuploid and we have addressed the heterogeneity of HeLa Kyoto within our detection methods (for clarification see point 3). To validate our conclusions in normal diploid human cells, we performed the chromatin mobility analysis using human fibroblasts (IMR90 cells in figures 2, 3 and S2) and plotted the MSD curves for different cell cycle stages. The outcome of this analysis showed that the mobility of chromatin in diploid fibroblasts in S-phase is lower than in G1 and G2. In fact, this effect is stronger in IMR90 cells than in HeLa Kyoto cells. Hence, this is not an aneuploid tumor cell phenomenon.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript is difficult to follow in places due to insufficient clarity. The manuscript should be written in a way that can be understood without referencing previous articles. Overall, the work is moderately impactful to the field.</p><p>Major recommendations:</p><p>1. In Figure 1B, the illustration and images for S phase are confusing. The author should specify which is early S and which is late S. Do the yellow circles represent GFP-PCNA foci? How did the authors distinguish mid S from early S and late S (in Figure 2)? Are all images in Figure 1 scaled to the same contrast threshold?</p></disp-quote><p>The yellow circles correspond to the colocalized signal of GFP-PCNA and Cy3-dUTP that overlap and represent the labeled chromatin sites that are replicated in the next cell cycle.</p><p>We clarified all the points mentioned above and updated figure 1 and figure 2 accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. In Figure 2B, the y-axis is marked as &quot;Frequency of cells&quot; but the equation listed below is counting DNA (per focus). How to convert DNA (per focus) to DNA (per cell)? The x-axis is marked as &quot;Genome size&quot; without any unit (e.g., kb? Mb?) The x-axis seems to be the C factor, not the genome size.</p></disp-quote><p>To determine the amount of DNA present in each labeled DNA focus, we first segmented the whole nucleus and measured the total intensity of DAPI (DNA amount) which is called IDNA TOTAL. Then the labeled replication foci are segmented and the intensity of label present in each segmented foci is measured (IRFi). Throughout the S-phase progression the amount of DNA increases twofold from early to late S-phase. The cells at each cell cycle stage were determined using the PCNA pattern. By plotting the frequency (number of cells) and the relative genome content normalized to the G1 stage we calculated the relative genome size otherwise called cell cycle correction factor for each stage from G1 to G2. The ratio of DNA intensity in labeled replication (IRFi)/ to the total DNA intensity of DAPI (IDNA total) gives the fraction of DNA present in each foci compared to the whole nucleus. This ratio was then multiplied by the genome size (Kbp) of HeLa Kyoto cells which was measured and published in Chagin et al. (2016; DOI:10.1038/ncomms11231). This gives us the approximate amount of DNA present in each labeled replication foci in Kbp. Since the genome duplicates over cell cycle stages, the measured DNA content in IRFi was corrected to the cell cycle stage (determined by PCNA) by multiplying the cell cycle correction factor.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. HeLa cells are known to be highly heterogeneous and heavily aneuploidy. Cells in one sample have different numbers of chromosomes ranging from 50 - 80. Therefore, GS (genome size) for each cell should not be the same. Using one constant GS in the equation for every cell introduces errors. Has the cell-to-cell variation been considered and corrected in the data? If not, the authors should provide information regarding cell-to-cell variations, such as the intensity variation of nuclear DAPI signals in synchronized cells.</p></disp-quote><p>It is true that the HeLa genome is aneuploid. However, the heterogeneity of the genome is true, if one compares different HeLa strains as studied in Frattini et al. (2015; DOI:10.1038/srep15377), where they show the variability of genome and RNA expression profiles and small genomic rearrangements among different HeLa strains. However, to our knowledge, it is not studied extensively or shown whether the heterogeneity and aneuploidy would also be a cell to cell variation. Therefore, we performed a control experiment to verify the variability between HeLa Kyoto cells, where we either synchronized or not and stained with DAPI and the DNA content profiles of all cells were plotted as a histogram (supplementary figure 1B) to show that cell to cell variations is not present and by synchronizing, we see that the cell population in G1, has similar DNA content showing that the cell to cell variability is negligible in our detection methods. Nonetheless, we have obtained data using normal diploid human fibroblasts, which validated our outcome.</p><p>STABLE:</p><p>Macville, Merryn, et al. &quot;Comprehensive and definitive molecular cytogenetic characterization of HeLa cells by spectral karyotyping.&quot; Cancer research 59.1 (1999): 141-150.</p><p>UNSTABLE:</p><p>Liu, Yansheng, et al. &quot;Multi-omic measurements of heterogeneity in HeLa cells across laboratories.&quot; Nature biotechnology 37.3 (2019): 314-322.</p><p>Landry, Jonathan JM, et al. &quot;The genomic and transcriptomic landscape of a HeLa cell line.&quot; G3: Genes, Genomes, Genetics 3.8 (2013): 1213-1224.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The chromatin foci are in a variety of sizes and intensities. How were boundaries of foci determined? Weak foci were picked up in one image but not in another. This is a concern because the size of the chromatin domain could influence mobility measurement. The authors should provide control experiments or better explanations for detecting and selecting chromatin foci.</p></disp-quote><p>The method for detecting chromatin foci is described in “Materials and Methods” section “Automated tracking of chromatin structures in time-lapse videos”. “Chromatin structures are detected by the spot-enhancing filter (SEF) (Sage et al., 2005; doi:10.1109/TIP.2005.852787) which consists of a Laplacian-of-Gaussian (LoG) filter followed by thresholding the filtered image and determination of local maxima. The threshold is automatically determined by the mean of the absolute values of the filtered image plus a factor times the standard deviation.” For reasons of consistency, we used the same threshold factor for all images of an image sequence. Therefore, depending on the intensity distribution in an image, it can happen that weak foci are not detected in some images. Alternatively, one could manually adapt the threshold factor for all single images, which, however, would be subjective. We now added the information that we used the same threshold factor for all images of an image sequence.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. In Figure 3, the authors combined MSD from G1 and G2 in one group. Has any published data suggested that chromatin dynamics are the same in G1 and G2?</p></disp-quote><p>To clarify this we separated G1 and G2 mobility measurements in supplementary figure S2 and updated the figures and text accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. In Figure 3B, cytoplasmic CY3-dUTP foci are found in the G1/G2 and S images. Are these CY3-dUTP aggregates? If so, are they also found in the nucleus? What is the mobility of the cytoplasmic CY3-dUTP foci?</p></disp-quote><p>These are aggregates and not found in the nucleus. These foci were excluded from the analysis by using a nuclear mask based on the PCNA signal. This information was added to the figure 3B legend.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. In Figure 4, how is colocalization defined? 1.8 um is approximately the size of a chromosome territory, which is much larger than 0.5 Mb. Two foci that are 1.8 um apart should not be considered in the same chromosome.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that colocalized would indeed mean that the signals are overlapping. Therefore, we updated the figures and text as center to center distance or proximity analysis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor comments:</p><p>1. Figure 3D should be presented by a box and whisker plot. The histogram does not show an actual distribution of the data.</p></disp-quote><p>The histograms shown in figure 3D is the average mean square displacement measurement value for different cell cycle stages. These are the same data shown in the table. Therefore, the histogram is removed and the table in figure 3C is retained.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Please explain Figure 3C error bars in the figure legend. Are they SD?</p></disp-quote><p>The error bars of the MSD curves (highlighted in bright color around the curves) in figure 3C show the standard error of the mean (SEM) representing the deviations between the MSD curves for an image sequence. We clarified this in the legend of Figure 3C.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. In Figure 5C, some western blotting results seem to be assembled from replicate experiments. Comparing signals from one experiment with the same background is suggested.</p></disp-quote><p>We made sure that the western blots from the same replicates are cropped and the information is also added to the respective figure legends.</p></body></sub-article></article>
