Current antifungal treatments fail, at least in part, because <italic>C. albicans</italic> can initiate a strong drug tolerance response that allows some cells to grow at drug concentrations above their minimal inhibitory concentration. To better characterize this cytoprotective tolerance program at the molecular single-cell level, we used a nanoliter droplet-based transcriptomics platform to profile thousands of individual fungal cells and establish their subpopulation characteristics in the absence and presence of antifungal drugs. Profiles of untreated cells exhibit heterogeneous expression that correlates with cell cycle stage with distinct metabolic and stress responses. At 2 days post-fluconazole exposure (a time when tolerance is measurable), surviving cells bifurcate into two major subpopulations: one characterized by the upregulation of genes encoding ribosomal proteins, rRNA processing machinery, and mitochondrial cellular respiration capacity, termed the Ribo-dominant (<italic>Rd</italic>) state; and the other enriched for genes encoding stress responses and related processes, termed the Stress-dominant (<italic>Sd</italic>) state. This bifurcation persists at 3 and 6 days post-treatment. We provide evidence that the ribosome assembly stress response (RASTR) is activated in these subpopulations and may facilitate cell survival.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Many drugs currently used to treat fungal diseases are becoming less effective. This is partly due to the rise of antifungal resistance, where certain fungal cells acquire mutations that enable them to thrive and proliferate despite the medication. Antifungal tolerance also contributes to this problem, wherein certain cells can continue to grow and multiply, while other â genetically identical ones â cannot. This variability is partly due to differences in gene expression within the cells. The specific nature of these differences has remained elusive, mainly because their study requires the use of expensive and challenging single-cell technologies.</p><p>To address this challenge, Dumeaux et al. adapted an existing technique to perform single-cell transcriptomics in the pathogenic yeast <italic>Candida albicans</italic>. Their approach was cost effective and made it possible to examine the gene expression in thousands of individual cells within a population that had either been treated with antifungal drugs or were left untreated.</p><p>After two to three days following exposure to the antifungal treatment, <italic>C. albicans</italic> cells commonly exhibited one of two states: one subgroup, the âRibo-dominantâ cells, predominantly expressed genes for ribosomal proteins, while the other group, the âStress-dominantâ cells, upregulated their expression of stress-response genes. This suggests that drug tolerance may be related to different gene expression patterns in growing cell subpopulations compared with non-growing subpopulations.</p><p>The findings also indicate that the so-called âribosome assembly stress responseâ known to help bakerâs yeast cells to survive, might also aid <italic>C. albicans</italic> in surviving exposure to antifungal treatments.</p><p>The innovative use of single-cell transcriptomics in this study could be applied to other species of fungi to study differences in cell communication under diverse growth conditions.

Systemic <italic>C. albicans</italic> infections are the second most common cause of mortality from infectious diseases in extremely premature infants (15â20% mortality), and the fourth most common cause of nosocomial bloodstream infections (30â50% mortality) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Benjamin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Brown and Netea, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Pfaller et al., 2019</xref>). The frequency of drug resistance is far lower than the frequency of treatment failures, such that most infections that fail to respond to antifungal drug treatments are susceptible to the drug. This clinical persistence can result from heterogeneity in antifungal drug responses, variations in host immune status, and the inability of drugs to reach their fungal target sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Delarze and Sanglard, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">Wuyts et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>A <italic>resistant</italic> fungal isolate can thrive in the presence of an antifungal drug at concentrations exceeding the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of that species, with detectable growth within 24 hr of drug exposure. For a <italic>tolerant</italic> fungal isolate, a proportion of cells (typically 5â95% of the population) can grow, albeit slowly, at concentrations surpassing the population average MIC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Berman and Krysan, 2020</xref>); tolerance is detectable only 48 hr after drug exposure, which is longer than most clinical assays are performed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Espinel-Ingroff et al., 2017</xref>). Approaches for predicting patient response to an infection, based solely on the average response of cells to a drug challenge across a population after 24 hr, can overlook such subpopulations with behaviors that have the potential to significantly impact the evolution of drug resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Altschuler and Wu, 2010</xref>).</p><p>Resistance usually results from mutations that directly influence interaction of the drug with its target (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Berman and Krysan, 2020</xref>), while tolerance is thought to stem from phenotypic heterogeneity or cell-to-cell variations in phenotypic responses within an isogenic cell population. Microbial phenotypic heterogeneity can arise from mechanisms including stochastic or periodic gene expression, protein stability, cell age, cell-cell interactions, chromatin modifications, and genomic neoplasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ackermann, 2015</xref>). Heterogeneity in microbial populations can confer benefits like bet-hedging, rapid metabolic shifts, division of labor, and resource sharing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ackermann, 2015</xref>). It is important to note the distinction between antibacterial and antifungal drug tolerance. For bacteria, tolerance is defined by the duration of cell survival following periodic exposure to a bactericidal drug (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Brauner et al., 2016</xref>). By contrast, for fungi, tolerance is characterized by the proportion of growth in supra-MIC drug concentrations relative to growth without the drug and is best characterized in <italic>C. albicans</italic> treated with fluconazole (FCZ). The underlying mechanisms and implications of antifungal drug tolerance differ from those of bacterial heteroresistance, in which a small subpopulation exhibits growth in bacteriocidal drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Andersson et al., 2019</xref>). In this study, the focus is on antifungal tolerance to FCZ, a well-known fungistatic drug.</p><p>Previous studies have characterized key aspects of drug tolerance in <italic>C. albicans</italic>. Tolerance is largely drug concentration-independent and high tolerance correlates with poor clinical outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Astvad et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Levinson et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Rosenberg et al., 2018</xref>). Tolerance increases the effective population size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Cowen and Lindquist, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Vincent et al., 2016</xref>). The emergence of higher tolerance cannot be attributed solely to the accumulation of adaptive point mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Wertheimer et al., 2016</xref>), as selected tolerant cells and their original parent give rise to mixed populations of tolerant and non-tolerant cells in similar proportions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Rosenberg et al., 2018</xref>). Adjuvant drugs used alongside the common fungistatic FCZ not only inhibit tolerance but prevent the evolution of resistance because these drug combinations are fungicidal. Such adjuvant drugs can modulate the tolerance response by targeting Hsp90, calcineurin, TOR, PKC, and sphingolipid biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Cowen and Lindquist, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Karababa et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Rosenberg et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Sanglard et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Vincent et al., 2016</xref>). The molecular mechanisms coordinating tolerance regulation across cellular pathways are not yet fully understood, although stress responses appear to be central (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Cowen and Lindquist, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Rosenberg et al., 2018</xref>). Several cellular processes are essential for tolerance, including ergosterol biosynthesis and proteasome function (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Berman and Krysan, 2020</xref>).</p><p>Most previous studies of drug tolerance, ranging from classic growth assays to omics profiling, have treated surviving fungal subpopulations as a homogenous whole, mainly due to a lack of technology to efficiently study large numbers of individual fungal cells. While single-cell (sc) transcriptomic assays have been applied extensively to mammalian systems, their use in fungal contexts remains limited due to the challenges of disrupting the rigid cell wall, lysing the membrane, and the small overall amount of RNA per cell. In the model yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, several limited microfluidic or barcoding sc studies examined approximately a hundred cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Gasch et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Nadal-Ribelles et al., 2019b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Nadal-Ribelles et al., 2019a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Urbonaite et al., 2021</xref>), and two high-throughput fungal transcriptome studies profiled ~40K cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Jackson et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Jariani et al., 2020</xref>). In our preliminary pre-printed study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Bettauer et al., 2020</xref>), we profiled <italic>C. albicans</italic> using a fungal nanoliter droplet-based assay (DROP-seq), modified from the original system presented by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Macosko et al., 2015</xref>. This approach overcomes technical challenges that arise in fungal settings, providing a flexible, cost-effective solution. Here, we extend the data and analysis from Bettauer et al. to better understand subpopulation-specific responses to drug stress. Since the original sc study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Bettauer et al., 2020</xref>), a second <italic>C. albicans</italic> sc study was performed to investigate the initial response (within 3 hr) to high FCZ concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Dohn et al., 2022</xref>). Dohn and colleagues observed increased expression of ergosterol genes, an increase in cell cycle arrest genes, and a transient increase in stress response gene expression at 1.5 hr. The work also identifies interesting variability in the temporal response to acute drug exposure but does not address molecular heterogeneity in the subsequent emergence from cell cycle arrest that can only be observed as tolerance after longer times (days 2â3), the focus of this study.</p><p>Here, we use the fungal DROP-seq system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Bettauer et al., 2020</xref>) to explore phenotypic heterogeneity in the <italic>C. albicans</italic> response to antifungal drugs. We profiled the transcriptomes of thousands of individual cells from <italic>C. albicans</italic> populations that were either untreated (UT) or exposed to antifungal compounds with a focus on FCZ across several days. This data is integrated with bulk DNA sequencing and fluorescence microscopy to provide in-depth analyses that focus on subpopulation composition and phenotypic heterogeneity across isogenic cell populations. We detect a heterogeneous response to FCZ within isogenic populations, supporting the idea that different cells exhibit distinct survival strategies, including some with increased expression of genes related to drug tolerance. This study underscores molecular events that may lead to drug tolerance and that hold potential for future therapeutic targeting.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>C. albicans</italic> exhibits drug tolerance 2 days after exposure to FCZ</title><p>To uncover molecular events associated with the emergence of drug tolerance in <italic>C. albicans</italic>, we performed a series of disk diffusion assays, focusing on a 6-day time series with FCZ, detailed in Appendix 1. When assayed at 48 hr, both disk assays and broth microdilution assays report on tolerance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Rosenberg et al., 2018</xref>). Drug tolerance increased significantly between days 1 and 2 (p&lt;0.001, Kruskal-Wallis Ï<sup>2</sup> test) and increased slightly at day 3, after which the tolerance level did not change. Thus, tolerant cells are present in all cultures starting at day 2. Since these populations originate from a single isogenic colony, we assume that tolerant and non-tolerant cells in the same culture differentially express pathways and processes relevant to their ability to grow (or not grow) in the presence of the drug. We do not observe widespread drug resistance at any time point.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>An optimized sc profiling assay to explore drug tolerance in <italic>C. albicans</italic></title><p>Although sc profiling with a commercial system is feasible in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Jackson et al., 2020</xref>), specific aspects of fungal biology motivated us to develop a low-cost alternative tailored for fungi, specifically <italic>C. albicans</italic>.

UT samples were collected during the logarithmic growth phase and treated samples were collected at days 2 and 3 post-drug exposure. This is the period when FCZ tolerance becomes evident.

Gene and cell quality control are challenging exercises in all sc profiling efforts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Svensson, 2019</xref>), and especially in fungi because of the small amount of RNA per cell, especially under the stress of growth in antifungal drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Jariani et al., 2020</xref>). A series of quality control procedures were used to estimate gene/cell expression levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A</xref>, Materials and methods, âQuality control, basic processing, and normalization of the sc profilesâ).The pipeline identified 18,854 high-quality cells across the 11 drug/time point conditions with an average of 1714 cells per sample. On average, 184 transcripts were identified in each cell, however there is large dispersion in the right tail representing many cells with significantly more transcripts (max. 1984) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). On average, these transcripts arose from 94 unique genes per cell, again with large right tail dispersion (max. 825) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1B and C</xref>). Since theoretical results highlight the importance of many cells over the number of identified genes per cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib123">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>), we reasoned that inclusion of the sparse cells (left tail) would strengthen the analyses and help identify large subpopulations with strong differentially expressed transcriptional programs across the different treatments. Moreover, although the gene by cell count matrix was sparse, there was very high concordance between FCZ pseudo-bulk profiles (i.e., aggregated sc counts) at day 2 and day 3 (R=0.82; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2A</xref>), indicating that the assay robustly quantifies the expression of genes across different batches.</p><p>To further investigate the robustness of the assay, we performed bulk RNA-sequencing of FCZ-treated cells at day 2 post-treatment (Materials and methods, âBulk transcriptomicsâ) and compared this bulk profile with the pseudo-bulk derived from mapping sc reads to the reference genome but ignoring barcodes (unfiltered âpseudo-bulkâ profiles; Materials and methods, âConstruction of pseudo-bulk profilesâ). The comparison identified 6071 genes with only 172 genes not detected in one or more of the pseudo-bulk profiles. We note that missing genes were mostly lowly expressed genes in the bulk profile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2B</xref>). Moreover, day 2 and day 3 pseudo-bulk replicates were significantly correlated with the bulk RNA-sequencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2C</xref>).

Here, the signatures included processes such as cell cycle, stress responses (both specific and general), the TCA cycle, and metabolic pathways (such as glycolysis) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2âsource data 1</xref>, Materials and methods, âCell clustering, trajectory, and signature analysesâ).

We also found that a small group of cells with very high expression of heat-shock response exhibited the lowest expression of M and S phase, glycolysis, and RP-coding-related genes (cell indices ~2700â3000). These few cells likely experienced cell cycle arrest due to high levels of cellular stress. Most other M phase cells with relatively high expression of heat-shock protein-coding genes (indices 3000â5000) also exhibited high expression of glycolysis-related genes. In contrast, cells with the least evidence of M phase expression, sometimes exhibited high S phase gene expression, low expression of the heat-shock signature, and relatively high expression of the oxidative stress signature (cell indices 0â2700, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>). Overall, these results indicate that expression heterogeneity in UT cells is primarily related to different cell cycle phases, distinct stress responses, and metabolic states.

This revealed five main clusters containing 92% of all N=16,371 cells, in addition to ~20 small clusters. We used Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) to visualize these patterns in 2D; cells are colored by their cluster assignment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). To investigate the resilience of the cell clusters, we randomly repeated the clustering process 100 times, each time using a random subset consisting of 95% of the cells. Cells originally assigned to four of the main clusters almost always remained in that cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1C</xref>). A significant portion of cells allocated to the (smaller) cluster 5 (5-purple, N=501 cells, 3%) were categorized together with cluster 3 cells, which is indicative of only subtle gene expression differences and suggests the two clusters are collapsed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1C</xref>).

In this context, we propose that the drug tolerance response in <italic>C. albicans</italic> may involve RP aggregation (in <italic>Rd</italic> cells), which activates RASTR, and induces the expression of Hsf1 (in <italic>Sd</italic> cells). This process might allow cells to transition from the <italic>Rd</italic> to <italic>Sd</italic> state, where genes implicated in drug tolerance are expressed.</p><p>To test this hypothesis, we collected a list of <italic>C. albicans</italic> orthologs of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> RASTR genes (gene list supplied by B Albert, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1A</xref>) together with a list of <italic>C. albicans</italic> genes which are targets of Hsf1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Leach et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1B</xref>).

Cluster stability analysis however did not find strong support separating clusters 1 and 2 (panel B), meaning that they could be collapsed together. FCZ day 3 cells are primarily located on the right in clusters 2 and 4; FCZ day 6 cells are primarily located on the left in clusters 1 and 3 (panels C and F). We detected the <italic>Rd</italic> response, predominantly in clusters 1 and 2. Specifically, these two clusters have RP and low HSP scores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D and E</xref>). The <italic>Sd</italic> response is predominantly in clusters 3 and 4. Note that both the <italic>Rd</italic> and <italic>Sd</italic> subpopulation are detected in FCZ day 6 cells (cluster 1 and cluster 3, respectively). This suggests that the bifurcation is still present 3 days post-drug treatment after receiving fresh growth media.</p><p>Furthermore, because clusters 1 and 2 represent cells with only minor differences in the underlying expression patterns (because the two clusters are not stable), and because day 3 FCZ cells are primarily in cluster 2 and day 6 FCZ cells are primarily in cluster 1, we can conclude that day 3 and day 6 FCZ <italic>Rd</italic> cells have strong similarities. Given the strong resemblance in expression patterns between the <italic>Rd</italic> cells at day 3 and day 6, it is likely that the day 6 cells are âdescendantsâ of day 3 cells. Moreover, these Rd cells largely remain in the same state regardless of the increased time since FCZ exposure, suggesting Rd cells remain viable or largely unchanging at the transcriptional level.</p><p>Clusters 3 and 4 harbor day 6 FCZ and day 3 FCZ <italic>Sd</italic> cells, respectively. There are significantly differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between these two groups for example, the alcohol dehydrogenase signature is most highly expressed at day 6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G and H</xref>). Heat-shock stress is slightly reduced in day 6 compared to day 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). We also observe a substantial change in the relative proportions of the <italic>Rd</italic> and <italic>Sd</italic> populations: at day 3 we observe 70% <italic>Rd</italic> and 30% <italic>Sd</italic> but at day 6 we observe an almost even ratio (56% <italic>Rd</italic> and 44% <italic>Sd</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> versus <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). Upon resuspension in fresh media, OD<sub>600</sub> measurements confirmed that cells exposed to FCZ for 3 days and then resuspended in fresh media and allowed to grow for 3 days without drug, proliferate more slowly, and reach lower biomass levels than UT cells propagated without drug for 3 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I</xref>). Together this suggests that <italic>Sd</italic> cells, unlike <italic>Rd</italic> cells, are significantly changing over time since the FCZ exposure (although they do retain many of the molecular properties of day 3 cells) and may have either a higher proliferative capacity or survival rate relative to Rd cells.</p><p>We also used computational trajectory analysis to investigate the relationship between these clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, black tree; Materials and methods, âCell clustering, trajectory, and signature analysesâ, slingshot analysis).

Overall, these findings suggest that there is more evidence that day 6 FCZ <italic>Sd</italic> cells are âdescendantsâ of day 3 FCZ <italic>Sd</italic> cells compared to, for example, day 6 Sd cells âdescendingâ from day 3 <italic>Rd</italic> cells.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Sc approaches can facilitate the characterization of phenotypic heterogeneity in microbial populations by enabling the detailed examination of individual microbial cells, revealing the full range of diversity in their gene expression. Here, we characterized two distinct subpopulations of cells with different expression profiles â the <italic>Rd</italic> and <italic>Sd</italic> states â among isogenic cells treated with FCZ, the most widely used antifungal drug. This result supports the observation that antifungal tolerance is due to a subpopulation of cells that grows in the presence of FCZ, while other cells in the population do not.</p><p>Despite the technical challenges associated with sc profiling of yeast cells, we identified heterogeneity in the gene expression of UT prototrophic SC5314 <italic>C. albicans</italic> cells that reflects the cell cycle phase and associated metabolic and stress responses. Specifically, glycolysis and several heat-shock genes were more highly expressed during M phase, and oxidative stress genes were more highly expressed in a distinct subset of cells that appear to be from G1/S phase. The existence of these distinct subpopulations is consistent with observations in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Chiu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Finkel and Hwang, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Hossain et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Senn et al., 2012</xref>). The magnitude of stress signatures is much lower than in cells exposed to antifungal drugs. We also validated the distinct subpopulations by fluorescence microscopy with tagged genes differentially expressed in different cell cycle stages. Thus, the sc transcriptional profiling detects cell-to-cell heterogeneity within UT <italic>C. albicans</italic> cultures.</p><p>We then examined the transcriptional profiles of individual drug-treated cells. During FCZ exposure, distinct subpopulations of <italic>C. albicans</italic> appeared: on day 2, FCZ-treated cells were either in the <italic>Rd</italic> or <italic>Sd</italic> state with a higher frequency of Rd cells. By day 3, the <italic>Sd</italic> subpopulations become more balanced suggesting either the <italic>Sd</italic> subpopulation is more proliferative, or perhaps that cooperation between the two subpopulations is required, for example, for the exchange of metabolites. Before and after treatment, the vast majority of cells are in the white morphology so <italic>C. albicans</italic> morphological state does not explain this <italic>Rd/Sd</italic> population split.</p><p>The <italic>Rd</italic> response is characterized by high expression of ribosomal protein (RP) and ribosomal RNA (rRNA) processing genes. An imbalance of RP and rRNA can lead to proteotoxic stress and RP aggregation in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Tye et al., 2019</xref>), and might do so as well in <italic>C. albicans</italic>. The <italic>Sd</italic> state involves the heat-shock transcription factor Hsf1, which upregulates <italic>HSP90, HSP70,</italic> and other genes in the UPR, which have been shown to suppress RP expression in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> to protect against toxic protein build-up, and restores cell growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Albert et al., 2019</xref>).

Importantly, <italic>Sd</italic> cells also highly express several genes associated with drug tolerance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Delarze et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Garnaud et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Liu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Mayer et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Nagao et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Rosenberg et al., 2018</xref>) as well as genes involved in filamentous growth, adhesion, and biofilm formation. This is consistent with a potential role of Hsf1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Hahn et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Leach et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Leach et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Veri et al., 2018</xref>) as a trigger of RASTR.</p><p>Overall, the molecular profiles of the <italic>Rd</italic> and <italic>Sd</italic> states suggest a model in which some fraction of the cells exposed to FCZ initially enter the <italic>Rd</italic> response and trigger the RASTR response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Albert et al., 2019</xref>) which in turn causes the cells to transit into the <italic>Sd</italic> state. This could suggest that <italic>Sd</italic> cells may represent a <italic>C. albicans</italic> subpopulation that have mounted a successful drug tolerance stress response. Alternatively, it could be the case that both subpopulations are necessary for cell survival.</p><p>We also treated cells with RAPA (analysis in Appendix 2). RAPA in isolation is considered to have weak antifungal properties, but drug tolerance (but not drug resistance) is ablated when used in combination with FCZ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Rosenberg et al., 2018</xref>). We did not identify any RAPA-treated cells in the Rd state. This is perhaps not surprising given that RAPA targets Tor1 and shuts down ribosomal biogenesis, an important component of the Rd state. In fact, RAPA-exposed cells also had the weakest RP expression. Of note, RAPA specifically triggers the expression of genes involved in hyperosmotic stress. Previous work established that the Tor1 pathway controls phase separation and the biophysical properties of the cytoplasm by tuning macromolecular crowding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Delarue et al., 2018</xref>). Hyperosmotic stress response to RAPA exposure might reflect disruption of the biophysical properties of the cytoplasm, altering the osmotic balance in cells.</p><p>Whereas nearly every RAPA-treated cell had an <italic>Sd</italic> transcriptional profile, nearly every CSP-treated cell after 2 days exposure had an <italic>Rd</italic>-like transcriptional profile (analysis in Appendix 2). The echinocandin CSP is fungicidal with a mechanism of action distinct from FCZ â it inhibits Î²-1,3 glucan synthesis and disrupts the fungal cell wall. We did not find any CSP-treated cells in the <italic>Sd</italic> subpopulation by day 3. Although we used low concentrations of CSP to avoid cell aggregation and therefore it is possible that alternative CSP concentrations could induce <italic>Sd</italic> cells, it appears that survivors of the fungicidal drug are transcriptionally far more homogeneous at early time points (days 2â3).</p><p>After resuspension in fresh media and 3 days of growth (day 6), both the <italic>Sd</italic> and <italic>Rd</italic> subpopulations persist. In fact, now <italic>Sd</italic> outnumbers the <italic>Rd</italic> subpopulation. Their persistence hints that these surviving cells have some âmemoryâ of treatment with FCZ. In the case of <italic>Rd</italic> cells, there are few transcriptional changes between days 3 and 6. For <italic>Sd</italic>, there is a downregulation of the heat-shock response and an increase in the alcohol dehydrogenase pathway, suggestive of cellular proliferation in the fresh medium. <italic>Sd</italic> cells at day 6 still however largely retain differential expression of genes, pathways, and proteins identified in <italic>Sd</italic> cells at day 3.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The use of a nanoliter droplet-based assay adapted for fungal cells enabled a detailed sc analysis of <italic>C. albicans</italic> in the absence and presence of antifungal drugs over a period of days. The assay was cost-effective and encountered minimal issues or failed runs. Studies of thousands of individual cells enriched our understanding of community structure and population heterogeneity. Specifically, this study refines published bulk transcriptome studies by differentiating between genes, pathways, and responses that are expressed universally in all cells, and those that are restricted to specific subpopulations. Here, by examining cellular trajectories across populations in a high-throughput manner, we obtained new insights into time-sensitive processes, such as the emergence of drug tolerance during 2â3 days of drug exposure and the existence of cells with <italic>Rd</italic> and <italic>Sd</italic> states, which reflect two different cellular states within the RASTR response described as a molecular signature of an <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> stress response.

By ignoring the R1 (left) read of the sc profile that contains the cellular barcode, we are effectively performing âbulkâ RNA-sequencing using only the R2 (right) read that aligns to a transcript in the sample. This collapses all cells to a single profile. We compared two different techniques to compute pseudo-bulk profiles, or we can first use the barcoded reads to partition cells into classes (e.g., <italic>Rd</italic> versus <italic>Sd</italic>) and then form a pseudo-bulk profile specific to each of the classes. The <italic>unfiltered</italic> pseudo-bulk data is derived from counting raw reads aligned to the reference genome using the <monospace>STAR</monospace> tool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Dobin et al., 2013</xref>).

Using the sc profiles, we investigated whether there is evidence that the comets are interesting biological phenomena versus stochastic noise from the sc profiling technique. Since the small size of the comets (comets contain 7â126 cells) creates significant technical/statistical challenges, our investigation and findings are built using several distinct analysis methods.</p><p><italic>DEG</italic>s: all comets combined versus the five major clusters. All cells that belong to comets were combined into one âsuper cometâ and contrasted against the five major clusters to identify DEGs using two different approaches (Materials and methods, âDGE analysisâ; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app2fig2">Appendix 2âfigure 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="app2fig2sdata1">Appendix 2âfigure 2âsource data 1</xref>).

There are at least three reasons why <italic>C. albicans</italic> cells may be depleted of amino acids: (i) exposure of <italic>C. albicans</italic> to FCZ reduces the pool size of amino acid biosynthesis intermediates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Katragkou et al., 2016</xref>), (ii) the cells are exporting amino acids, which is consistent with the observed upregulation of efflux signatures in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> or (iii) the amino acid starvation response could be related to changes in the translational machinery when cells experience extreme stress. This is consistent with the observation of low expression of rRNAs in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>.</p><p>GO analysis of the DEGs also revealed an enrichment of genes involved in DNA replication regulation, actin cytoskeleton, plasma membrane organization, and mitotic ring assembly, all highly expressed in comet clusters (<italic>NHP6A, HHF22, HHF1, SBA1, NCE102, KIN2, RVS167, CDC12</italic>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="app2fig2sdata1 app2fig2sdata2">Appendix 2âfigure 2âsource data 1; 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app2fig2">Appendix 2âfigure 2</xref>). This is in line with the observation that FCZ affects bud formation and is associated with DNA replication or spindle pole body duplication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Harrison et al., 2014</xref>). In our prior research, we discovered that within 4â8 hr of drug exposure (at concentrations greater than the MIC), approximately 20% of mother-daughter cell pairs produced a single granddaughter cell, resulting in three cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Harrison et al., 2014</xref>). Despite this, the mother and daughter nuclei continued to divide, generating four daughter nuclei. This process led to one cell containing twice the normal DNA content, and the resulting 4N cells frequently underwent abnormal divisions, giving rise to aneuploid offspring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Harrison et al., 2014</xref>). Using the sc data, we searched for aneuploidy evidence by calculating the percentage of reads assigned to genes in each chromosome. We found that cells in cluster 16 have a significantly higher proportion of reads assigned to genes in chromosome 2, which could indicate trisomy or local chromosomal amplification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app2fig2">Appendix 2âfigure 2</xref>).</p><p><italic>DEGs</italic>: each comet versus each main cluster. Although the number of cells per comet cluster is small (from 7 to 126 cells), individual molecular marker genes could be identified in some comets. Some of these markers have been reported previously to be involved in FCZ tolerance or resistance (Appendix 2âfigure supplement 2B; Materials and methods, âDGE analysisâ; top 5 with Bayes factor &gt;3 and proportion of non-zero value &gt;0.2). These included cell wall organization and adhesion (<italic>ADA2, TPK2, LMO1, KRE9, RDH54, DFI1</italic>) and chromosomal and cytoplasmic division (<italic>AXL2, HOS3, RDH54, RFA2 RIM15, NPL4, CDC5 BUB2</italic>).</p><p>In summary, although the comets each contain a small number of cells make it difficult to assess any statements with statistical rigor, comets generally overexpress GCN4 and related genes encoding amino acid biosynthetic enzymes, suggesting the cells are starved for amino acids. Pathway analysis is consistent with various known reasons for amino acid starvation. Specifically, efflux pumps are concomitantly overexpressed and translational machinery is underexpressed. Comets also consistently overexpress DNA replication regulation, actin cytoskeleton, plasma membrane organization, and mitotic ring assembly processes. We have previously established that FCZ exposure is associated with DNA replication or spindle pole body duplication, leading to aneuploidy. At least one comet has strong evidence of an aneuploidy along chromosome 2.</p></sec><sec sec-type="appendix" id="s9-3"><title>Subinhibitory dose of CSP triggers the <italic>Rd</italic> response</title><p>CSP, a first-line clinical treatment echinocandin, acts by inhibiting Î²-1,3 glucan synthesis and disrupting the fungal cell wall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">McCormack and Perry, 2005</xref>). Although it is effective against most <italic>Candida</italic> species, a known mechanism of echinocandin resistance involves point mutations in âhot spotâ regions of FS-encoded subunits of a glucan synthase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Perlin, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Pristov and Ghannoum, 2019</xref>). Tolerance to CSP increases with larger amounts of cell wall chitin, potentially due to aneuploidy and chromosome 5 rearrangement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Yang et al., 2017</xref>). Even though fungicidal CSP and fungistatic FCZ have different modes of action, they share similar tolerance mechanisms associated with Hsp90, the calcineurin pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Singh et al., 2009</xref>) and the pH-responsive RIM pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Garnaud et al., 2018</xref>). To treat a <italic>C. albicans</italic> population, we used a subinhibitory concentration of CSP, well below its MIC<sub>50</sub> (1 ng/ml), as higher doses led to significant cell aggregation, rendering the cells unsuitable for sc profiling.</p><p>On day 2, the majority of cells were found in cluster 1-darkpink, where <italic>Rd</italic> FCZ cells also reside (86% of all CSP, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app2fig1">Appendix 2âfigure 1</xref>). We examined the differences between CSP and FCZ cells in the <italic>Rd</italic> state and identified only one significantly differentially expressed gene (FDR &lt;0.1), suggesting a highly similar <italic>Rd</italic> response for both antifungal treatments, at least at the selected dosage levels and day 2 time point. Unlike FCZ, no bifurcation was observed for CSP at day 2 (i.e., we did not observe any <italic>Sd</italic> cells), which could be partially due to our choice of a low dosage level, a factor previously shown to be crucial in determining the cellular response to CSP in <italic>C. albicans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Enjalbert et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Enjalbert et al., 2003</xref>).

Since HSP70 was identified as a strong marker of the <italic>Sd</italic> response, we analyzed microscopy images of our GFP-tagged HSP70 cells exposed to CSP or FCZ for 2 and 3 days. Although a significant fraction of FCZ-treated cells highly expressed HSP70 at days 2 and 3, confirming the presence of <italic>Sd</italic> cells, no similar trend was observed in CSP-treated cells at either time point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app2fig1">Appendix 2âfigure 1</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, cells treated with CSP closely co-clustered with FCZ <italic>Rd</italic> response cells, but there was no evidence of CSP cells in the <italic>Sd</italic> response at day 3. The similarity in the early response is intriguing, considering that CSP and FCZ have distinct mechanisms of action (i.e., disrupting cell wall biosynthesis versus disrupting ergosterol biosynthesis).

A similar trend is observed in RAPA-treated cells, but they mostly display a pronounced hyperosmotic stress response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app2fig1">Appendix 2âfigure 1</xref> ). In fact, this elevated hyperosmotic stress response is present in all RAPA cells, regardless of their cluster classification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app2fig1">Appendix 2âfigure 1</xref> , light blue curves). Specifically, RAPA cells express high levels of the sodium pump ENA2 and the glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase GPD2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app2fig1">Appendix 2âfigure 1</xref> ).

This is expected, as RAPAâs inhibition of TOR signaling is known to decrease RP gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Powers and Walter, 1999</xref>). Consequently, no RAPA cells are found in the <italic>Rd</italic> state, which is characterized by high RP. When RAPA and FCZ are used together, drug tolerance is eliminated, but drug resistance remains unaffected. Our findings suggest that this might happen due to the inhibition of the <italic>Rd</italic> response, preventing cells from transitioning to the tolerant <italic>Sd</italic> state. Interestingly, RAPA specifically induces the expression of hyperosmotic stress-related genes. Past research has shown that the Tor1 pathway regulates phase separation and the biophysical properties of the cytoplasm by modulating macromolecular crowding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Delarue et al., 2018</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Naama Barkai as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: David Shore (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>As you will see from the reviewers' individual reports, there was consensus that the manuscript and work reported are interesting but also had concerns about presentation and some of the controls used in the study. Thus, the manuscript will require revision, including potentially additional experiments, and one more round of review.</p><p>1) There is concern that there is significant overlap (and lack of clarity) with respect to data previously published (Battauer et al. 2020) and data that are new to this study. It will be imperative to clearly explain where the data in this new manuscript are coming from.</p><p>2) There was consensus among reviewers for a revised Introduction section that better sets up the rationale for this study (e.g., Reviewer #2, point #2 and Reviewer #3, point #1).</p><p>3) There was concern about the use of different time-points associated with controls vs. treatments (e.g., Reviewer #2, point #4) â addressing this point might necessitate collection of additional data.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Since the underlying biology here will be of most interest to researchers who are unlikely to be versed in the experimental and analytical methods used throughout, I think that the authors should make a better effort to help the reader begin to understand the bases of their analytical methods and their potential pitfalls. For example, they don't even define the ubiquitously applied &quot;UMAP&quot; method, much less explain in general how it works, what it reveals, and what its limits might be (though it is defined in the McInnes et al. reference title). I suspect that most readers will be unfamiliar with the details of single-cell transcriptomic analysis, which is complex and relatively recent. Îore science-related comments are as follows:</p><p>1. The significance of the dozen or so small &quot;comet&quot; clusters is unclear. On line 525 they are referred to as possible &quot;trimeras&quot; (What does that mean? Should it read &quot;trisomes&quot;) &quot;â¦with unstable genomes previously identified after FCZ treatmentâ¦which might have arisen as a response to amino-acid starvation.&quot; This latter point might be testable by increasing amino acid concentrations in the medium, which might then abolish the formation of some clusters.</p><p>2. In the Discussion the authors describe &quot;bulk DNA-level profiling&quot; of untreated cells and four FCZ treated populations (days 2, 3, 6, and 12). They state that attempts to assign the aberrations they observe to either the Î± or Î² response were inconclusive, but it's unclear how this would have even been possible to do. Please clarify. It is also stated in the text that variation levels peak at day 3, but it would seem to me to be day 2. Furthermore, on day 2 there would appear to be a nearly uniform increase in signal for all chromosomes shown, suggesting that there might be widespread trisomy. These points all need to be addressed and clarified.</p><p>3. The significance of the so-called &quot;trajectory&quot; in Figure 4A (black line) is unclear to me. From the text, it would appear to me that clusters 3 and 4 represent Î²-like cells on days 6 and 3, respectively. But what are the expression differences between these two groups? A similar question arises for clusters 1 and 2, which are said to be Î±-like cells. Does the black &quot;trajectory&quot; line imply a strict mode of transition between these 4 states? Why do Î±-like cells seem to be predominant when longer times are stated elsewhere to favor the Î²-like state?</p><p>4. The authors should state clearly how fast the cultures are growing (bulk measurement) at the time points they examine, and whether they have any way of knowing the growth rate as a function of transcriptome state and time of drug exposure. Related to this, do the authors imagine that Î±-like cells predominate early simply because they derive from those cells that had the highest levels of RP and ribosome biogenesis gene expression prior to treatment and thus might have been faster growing and/or more capable of escaping the early effects of drug treatment?</p><p>5. What is the actual evidence that Î² cells are derived from Î± cells through induction of RASTR in the latter population of cells? Related to his, could it be shown that Î± cells display a higher level of protein aggregation than Î² cells, perhaps by looking at RP fusions to GFP, versus HSP70-GFP?</p><p>6. Can the authors compare in more detail the transcription states of their Î² cells to the profile of RASTR cells (<italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>) described by Albert et al.? For example, are the targets of Hsf1 known in detail in <italic>Candida albicans</italic>, and if so, how well do they match with the up-regulated genes observed in Î² cells? Does Hsf1 also target genes encoding components of the proteasome (as in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>)?</p><p>7. Furthermore, can the authors show that Ifh1 is &quot;condensed&quot; in Î² cells, as seen clearly using Ifh1-GFP fusions in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>? In addition, what is known about Ifh1 targets in <italic>C. albicans</italic> (are they mostly RP genes?), and how well does this group overlap with the profiles of down-regulated genes in Î² cells? Perhaps the datasets are not robust enough to give this sort of information, but the issues should at least be addressed in the text by the authors.</p><p>8. The idea that a kind of persistent RASTR response promotes tolerance is very interesting. Perhaps the authors could test this idea further by asking whether inducing RASTR prior to drug treatment (with diazaborin or an RNA Pol I inhibitor) might strongly increase the fraction of tolerant cells.</p><p>9. Line 591: what is meant by &quot;reinitiate translational machinery&quot; with respect to the Î± cells? And how is this related to their persistence over time?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. This manuscript emphasizes the lack of single-cell transcriptomics in <italic>C. albicans</italic> (and fungi broadly), although there does appear to be other work published in this area (Dohn et al. 2021 â which also includes antifungal treatment). Relationship to other work in this area should be more clearly addressed, and differences in findings with regards to antifungal treatment should also be addressed.</p><p>2. The introduction to this manuscript is framed around antifungal drug tolerance, and throughout this research, antifungal tolerance is highlighted as a central research question. However, it is not clear how the experimental design of this work addresses antifungal tolerance in any way. Cells are treated with antifungal drugs and subjected to transcriptomic analysis, but this does not represent a distinct 'tolerant' population of fungi that are being analyzed. This either needs to be much more clearly explained and justified, or more likely, the framing of this work needs to be substantially re-assessed.</p><p>3. The authors make reference to another study of theirs (Battauer et al. 2020) and suggest that the transcriptomic profiles reported in this work combine profiles from their previous work. This needs to be much more clearly explained. Have parts of this work already been previously published? How is this analysis unique and novel? The title of the previous manuscript seems very similar to that of this manuscript suggesting there might be a substantial overlap between these works.</p><p>4. The major analysis in this work compares untreated cells in log phase, to antifungal drug treated cells grown for 2-3 days in antifungals. It is not clear why untreated cells were not grown for the same duration of time as drug-treated cells, which would certainly alter the findings and analysis. It is thus unclear if the transcriptomic responses described in this manuscript truly represent the consequence of drug treatment itself, or are also influenced by the growth state of the cells (which are in stationary phase after 2-3 days of drug treatment). A comparison to untreated cells in stationary phase would be a more appropriate comparison.</p><p>5. The work describes the identification of 184 transcripts on average in each cell, which seems like an incredibly small number. Is this in line with other similar single-cell transcriptomic analysis? Does this number of transcripts enable robust conclusions to be drawn on the transcriptional profile of individual cells?</p><p>6. While the paper is generally well written, it is written in an extremely technical manner with much methodological detail (as well as discussion) incorporated throughout the main Results section. Major Results sections also lack clear and concise conclusions to help readers understand and interpret the major findings. This diminishes the clarity of the work and makes the manuscript at times quite dense and difficult to fully interpret.</p><p>7. It is unclear why stress response pathways are being assessed in untreated cells without any stress exposure. Should this be analyzed in the drug-treated cells instead?</p><p>8. In the growth curves in Figure 3 Supp 1a, it seems that both untreated and drug-treated cells take 2-3 days to reach stationary phase. This seems very unusual for cells that replicate quite rapidly under many growth conditions. Is this due to a nutrient-limited media or some other explanation?</p><p>9. It seems surprising that extremely different antifungals (cidal vs. static, different cell targets) elicit a very similar transcriptional response based on this analysis (line 345-348). Can this be explained?</p><p>10. Section 8-9 on expanding the analysis to day 6 was difficult to interpret in terms of the rationale for the experimental design and how the findings can be interpreted. It is also unclear how solid agar media-based tolerance assays can be extrapolated to liquid media growth assays with drugs, as these are very different conditions. It is also unclear if there is a day 6 untreated control that is being assessed.</p><p>a. The microscopy in associated Figure 4 K is very difficult to see and lacks scale bars.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Below I provide a few suggestions for how the authors may improve the manuscript, but overall I found it well done.</p><p>1. First, it is my understanding that tolerance is defined as survival, but not growth, after exposure above the MIC for drugs that normally would kill most of the population of cells (for non-static drugs). This is the definition put forward in Balaban et al. (&quot;Definitions and guidelines for research on antibiotic persistence&quot;; Nat Rev Microbiol; 2019). I would have called what the authors describe as phenotypic resistance, i.e., a sub-population of cells that can continue to grow after exposure above the MIC, and a non-genetically heritable state (i.e., readily reversible). This is a known phenomenon for some antimicrobials/species combinations, as the authors describe. I think it would be good to standardize usage of the word tolerance through the manuscript, or the authors can better explain how the phenomenon they observe is consistent with Balaban et al.'s definition of tolerance. This is an important semantics issue. Second, the drug concentrations used were at or well-below their MICs. This raises the question of whether the authors are studying the clinical phenomenon that they describe as tolerance (i.e., above the MIC) when the experiment was conducted below the MIC. While I understand their reasoning for using low drug concentrations, and I think there is still something to be learned at these concentrations, I think the authors should better contextualize the clinical relevance of their findings with the caveat that the experimental results were probably collected at sub-clinical concentrations. Admittedly, drug concentration is dynamic during treatment, so at some point the concentration in vivo likely passes through the author's choice of in vitro concentrations. It would be interesting to know how much their results are invariant to the drug concentration chosen.</p><p>2. The author's interpretation of the &quot;comets&quot; is questionable. On L244 they say, &quot;This pattern suggests that the small set of cells from each comet have strong transcriptional similarity but each such comet is transcriptionally distinct from the other comets.&quot; I do not see how the cells within comets share &quot;strong&quot; transcriptional similarity because they are still spread out. Rather, the comet tails could be interpreted as lineages of descent, wherein each cell becomes more distinct (along some transcriptional axis) than its ancestor. This pattern is commonly observed in genetic data plotted with PCA, which is somewhat related to what is being shown here. Therefore, an alternative interpretation is that some lineages are moving toward a transcriptionally distinct state and leaving behind progeny along their trajectory, especially given that the experimental setup may not quickly remove ancestral cells in the two day exposure. Another explanation is that the comets are composed of a different (minority) morphology, such as filamentous growth. Another (less?) plausible interpretation is that these are noise clusters due to the inherent stochasticity involved in single-cell analyses. I see no reason why these explanations aren't equally reasonable to the author's explanation. Perhaps the authors can incorporate these alternative into their interpretations, but (at a minimum) there needs to be more justification given for the claim of &quot;strong&quot; intra-cluster transcriptional similarity.</p><p>3. L434: I am skeptical of the author's interpretation here about the relative fitness of Î± and Î² states. It could also suggest switching rates between phenotypic states are different between Î± and Î² populations. Also in this paragraph (L439), the authors use OD600 to show a higher growth rate for Î² over untreated. However, Î² also reaches a higher yield, which is unexplained. Having done many growth rate experiments with OD600 data, I am always skeptical of drawing large inferences about fitness from OD600. A better test of fitness is a competition experiment. I suggest the authors remove or downplay their conclusions about relative fitness here. Also, why isn't OD600 plotted in log-space (log(OD600)) if the goal is to see the difference in growth rate?</p><p>4. The authors did not seem to analyze feature importance in Leiden clustering, preferring to look at cluster associations (z-scores) instead. Leiden clustering is not guaranteed to be optimal, so some understanding of cluster stability would have been useful. That is, if inputs changed somewhat (e.g., subsampling or resampling), would the identified clusters have been similar? This is particularly important given that the UMAP1 versus UMAP2 clusters look like blobs that are split along arbitrary axes. It seems doubtful these clusters are stable, yet the whole manuscript analyzes them as though the blobs are discretized correctly.</p><p>5. I have some concerns about the comparison between untreated and treated at the same (or similar) time points. If the transcript profile changes over time, as presumably it would, then it is reasonable to expect that the treated and untreated cells are at different <italic>equivalent</italic> times because their growth rates are different. I have a similar concern with comparing different time points (days 3 versus 6) because fresh medium (YPD) was used in this experiment. How much are transcript abundances static over time? This should minimally be discussed further in the manuscript. Also, the conclusions in L472-475 and L579-592 may need this caveat mentioned.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.81406.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) There is concern that there is significant overlap (and lack of clarity) with respect to data previously published (Battauer et al. 2020) and data that are new to this study.

We have adjusted the text in the introduction (and early Results section) to better explain this relationship. Briefly, we originally released the Bettauer et al. BioRxiv in 2020 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.01.21.914549">https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.01.21.914549</ext-link>), although we were unsatisfied with the descriptive nature of the single cell results, which primarily focused on the identification of the Î± and Î² responses. Our rationale was that two senior graduate students were set to finish their degrees, and we thought that the underlying technical contribution alone towards fungal single cell approaches was in and of itself sufficient to form a preprint and useful for the community (several other fungal groups had expressed interest in using our technology and we did not have the capacity ourselves to assist them directly).</p><p>However, we continued to do additional validation work (the fluorescence microscopy, CRISPR-mediated knockouts, DNA-sequencing and additional single cell RNA-sequencing) and this new data gave us deeper insight into the nature of the Î± and Î² responses. Bettauer et al. (2020) bioRxiv was not published elsewhere. Instead this data was merged with new data into this current effort.</p><p>Lastly, when we prepared for the first submission to <italic>eLife</italic>, we attempted to modify the Bettauer et al. (2020) preprint, but bioRxiv was tardy in re-opening the manuscript (we waited several weeks). We felt we could not delay submission any longer and submitted a new preprint instead: Dumeaux et al. (2022) bioRxiv (https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.07.20.500774). This data and analyses in this preprint are supersets of what appeared in Bettauer et al. (2020).

We also moved a comparison of UT cells to the FCZ day 2 and 3 cells to Appendix 2 [Changes L 822-833]; this short comparison is not central to the main findings of the manuscript and has caused confusion as to our primary goal.

The section has been completely re-written and clarification of the trimeras term is provided. Specifically, we were referring to our previous study in Harrison et al. where we observed three connected cells composed of a mother, daughter and granddaughter bud, termed trimeras, were observed within hours of FCZ exposure and were shown to give rise to aneuploidies at high frequency. This concept is not strictly necessary for this manuscript except to say that we do observe evidence of the associated aneuploidies [Changes L837-897].</p><p>It is an interesting idea to test if increased concentrations in the medium would ablate the appearance of such comets, and we certainly plan to explore this in the future. It is, however, somewhat tangential to the current effort and due to cost issues we havenât explored this further to date. Disappearance of the comets might indicate that the GCN4-mediated amino acid starvation pathway is central to the formation of aneuploidies and/or provide insight into the rapid evolution of resistant micro-colonies post FCZ exposure. This in itself would constitute a significant manuscript.</p><p>Please also see our response to Reviewer #3, Comment 3 which touches on similar issues.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

Please clarify.</p></disp-quote><p>Before proceeding, we mention here that we decided in light of your comment to remove this paragraph from the Discussion section. Originally we intended to indicate that we did look at issues of chromosomal aberrations, which are common to <italic>C. albicans</italic> especially under stress, but our bulk DNA profiling was inconclusive. The sum of our data, analysis and validation experiments really require a full independent manuscript and the brief mention we make here is likely to only cause confusion.</p><p>To answer your technical question: The genes within each observed amplified genomic region were identified. We then examined whether those genes were simultaneously expressed more in either the Î±<italic>/Rd</italic> or Î²/<italic>Sd</italic> subpopulations according to the single-cell transcriptomics. The hope here was to find that a set of amplified genomic regions which were statistically enriched for genes that were over-expressed in exactly one of the Î± or Î² subpopulations. Since both the Î±<italic>/Rd</italic> and Î²/<italic>Sd</italic> subpopulations could âcontributeâ amplified genomic regions (and therefore over-expressed transcripts for their corresponding genes), we could perhaps assign some genomic regions uniquely to either the Î± or Î² subpopulations.

Note however the trimera occurrences described by Harrison et al. are not the only mechanism by which instability is observed in <italic>C. albicans</italic> in response to (drug) stress. In particular, the seminal papers by Ford et al. (doi: 10.7554/<italic>eLife</italic>.00662), Selmecki et al. (2009) and Todd and Selmecki (2020) (cited in the Introduction) describe other mechanisms for aneuploidy and loss across <italic>C. albicans</italic>. This includes recombination/amplification events involving specific-sequence motifs found across the <italic>C. albicans</italic> chromosomes. What we observe here may be due to other mechanisms besides the trisomy. For example, we did perform some ad hoc analysis comparing the predicted sites from Todd/Selmecki with regions of the <italic>C. albicans</italic> genome that were amplified in this study. Straightforward statistical approaches (based on the hypergeometric tests for enrichment) suggest that there is significant (albeit imperfect) overlap with their predictions. We also compared our regions of amplification with those of Ford et al. (see above) and again found significant, albeit imperfect, overlap. This suggests to us that there may be multiple mechanisms âcontrollingâ genome instability in the <italic>C. albicans</italic> response to stress. The strength of amplification (black ticks) for chromosomes 4, 5, 6 and 7 are dramatic compared to other chromosomes (which appear closer to the pattern observed in the untreated samples), with only a few sporadic regions of amplification or loss. We have added to the text to clarify this analysis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The significance of the so-called &quot;trajectory&quot; in Figure 4A (black line) is unclear to me. From the text, it would appear to me that clusters 3 and 4 represent Î²-like cells on days 6 and 3, respectively. But what are the expression differences between these two groups? A similar question arises for clusters 1 and 2, which are said to be Î±-like cells. Does the black &quot;trajectory&quot; line imply a strict mode of transition between these 4 states? Why do Î±-like cells seem to be predominant when longer times are stated elsewhere to favor the Î²-like state?</p></disp-quote><p>We note that we have re-written these paragraphs entirely to improve their readability.

Discussion about the trajectory and meaning: [L368-373]</p><p>Indeed, clusters 3 and 4 represent Î²/<italic>Sd</italic> cells on days 6 and 3, respectively. First, we should emphasize that there are quite a few genes that are differentially expressed between Î²/<italic>Sd</italic> cells on days 6 and 3. The main differences are highlighted on L354-367 and Figure 3G.</p><p>In contrast, there are no significant robust difference for Î±<italic>/Rd</italic> day 3 versus day 6 (cluster stability analysis, Figure 5B).</p><p>Trajectory analysis based on single-cell RNA profiles allowed us to order cells along a âdifferentiationâ trajectory. We now inserted intuitive descriptions for trajectory analysis in the manuscript; the essential idea is to consider the transcriptional profile of a cell as a sort of single still image from an animation. If the trajectory analysis (based on a tool called Slingshot) can order the still images to make a complete animation (denoted by the black lines), then this is considered one type of evidence that, when one population is adjacent to a second population (black edge), then the first population is derived from, or at least related to, the second population. In the end, the trajectory helps to confirm that Î²/<italic>Sd</italic> day 6 cells have evolved from Î²/<italic>Sd</italic> day 3 cells. For Î±<italic>/Rd</italic>, the lack of any robust transcriptional changes would already suggest that day 6 cells evolved from day 3 cells.</p><p>We think that there may be some confusion w.r.t. the last comment, as <italic>Î±/Rd</italic> cells are predominant at day 3 but Î²/<italic>Sd</italic> cells are predominant (or at least equal) at day 6.

The authors should state clearly how fast the cultures are growing (bulk measurement) at the time points they examine, and whether they have any way of knowing the growth rate as a function of transcriptome state and time of drug exposure. Related to this, do the authors imagine that Î±-like cells predominate early simply because they derive from those cells that had the highest levels of RP and ribosome biogenesis gene expression prior to treatment and thus might have been faster growing and/or more capable of escaping the early effects of drug treatment?</p></disp-quote><p>First, please note that we re-did the growth assays of cultures subjected to the different drugs at the relevant time points (Figures 3 figure supplemental 1B, Figure 5I).

What is the actual evidence that Î² cells are derived from Î± cells through induction of RASTR in the latter population of cells? Related to his, could it be shown that Î± cells display a higher level of protein aggregation than Î² cells, perhaps by looking at RP fusions to GFP, versus HSP70-GFP?</p><p>6. Can the authors compare in more detail the transcription states of their Î² cells to the profile of RASTR cells (<italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>) described by Albert et al.? For example, are the targets of Hsf1 known in detail in Candida albicans, and if so, how well do they match with the up-regulated genes observed in Î² cells? Does Hsf1 also target genes encoding components of the proteasome (as in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>)?</p></disp-quote><p>Our primary sources of evidence are the transcriptional profiles of Î±<italic>/Rd</italic> and Î²/<italic>Sd</italic> now presented in more detail in Section 5 of the Results. We expanded our analyses and have re-written some text to better express our core findings [changes L305-329]. One source of evidence for this relationship originates from analyses of the list of RASTR genes (and its associated processes, Table 1) from the literature and how they are expressed in either the Î±<italic>/Rd</italic> and Î²/<italic>Sd</italic> subpopulations. To investigate your questions in more detail, we identified <italic>C. albicans</italic> orthologs of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> RASTR genes (gene list supplied by B. Albert) together with a list of constitutive Hsf1 target genes identified in <italic>C. albicans</italic> <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?Hz4XNo">(Leach et al., 2016)</ext-link>. These genes, and their direction of expression, are now listed in Table 1A and B. Note for example that Î²/<italic>Sd</italic> cells exhibit decreased gene expression of ribosome processing (RP) genes (Figure 3E-F), consistent with the RASTR list in Table 1A (from B. Albert).</p><p>We also investigated whether Î²/<italic>Sd</italic> cells have enhanced expression of genes that are upregulated in RASTR by developing a signature score presented in Figure 4A (Albert list). Figure 4A shows that the right side of the UMAP, which is the location of the Î²/<italic>Sd</italic> cells, more highly express the genes listed as upregulated by Albert at al. (protein folding, proteolysis, glucose and pyruvate metabolic process, and others). Similarly, Figure 4B shows the expression of Hsf1 target genes from Leach et al. Again, the Î²/<italic>Sd</italic> cells show heightened expression of the constitutive targets of Hsf1. This comparison alone is not sufficient to argue that Î²/<italic>Sd</italic> cells are derived from the Î±<italic>/Rd</italic> cells. We can only hypothesize that Î²/<italic>Sd</italic> cells, which express all the hallmarks of RASTR activation, would survive and assume a transcriptional profile consistent with RASTR. At this time point, we do not know how we could track individual cells (e.g. via barcodes) and perform single-cell profiling to establish this dynamic behavior. The reviewer is correct to question our implication of causality. We have modified the text in the last section of the Results and Discussion to clarify this.</p><p>The observation that Î±<italic>/Rd</italic> cells predominate early (day 2) but there is an increase in the relative fraction of Î²/<italic>Sd</italic> cells at day 3 and day 6 also at least suggests a model whereby RASTR is âsavingâ Î±<italic>/Rd</italic> cells and sending them to Î²/<italic>Sd</italic> heaven.</p><p>At this stage, we do not know how to directly test for the relative degree of protein aggregation of Î±<italic>/Rd</italic> versus Î²/<italic>Sd</italic> cells. We had difficulties to establish a good dual fluorescent strain to measure both aggregation in the Rd and Sd cells simultaneously. We do observe evidence of aggregation, but we are unable to strictly limit this to Î±<italic>/Rd</italic> and not Î²/<italic>Sd</italic> cells. We do want to stress here that Î±<italic>/Rd</italic> transcriptional profiles are very distinct with overexpression of many genes almost exclusively related to ribosome biogenesis, rRNA processing and protein translation [L285-290; Figure 3 âfigure supplement 2B; Figure 3 â source data 1,2].</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. Furthermore, can the authors show that Ifh1 is &quot;condensed&quot; in Î² cells, as seen clearly using Ifh1-GFP fusions in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>? In addition, what is known about Ifh1 targets in C. albicans (are they mostly RP genes?), and how well does this group overlap with the profiles of down-regulated genes in Î² cells? Perhaps the datasets are not robust enough to give this sort of information, but the issues should at least be addressed in the text by the authors.</p></disp-quote><p>These are excellent suggestions. Unfortunately, the Ifh1 gene is not well represented in our sc-transcriptomics data, and the meager detected expression is not significantly different between the Î±<italic>/Rd</italic> and Î²/<italic>Sd</italic> subpopulation.

Among those, 103 are detected in our profiles. We selected the most variable genes across cells (n=74) and plotted their expression in the heatmap in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>.

The rest of the IFH1P targets (n = 10 at the bottom of heatmap) are most highly expressed in cluster (green cluster 3) enriched for untreated cells; they are not differentially expressed between the Î±/<italic>Rd</italic> and Î²/<italic>Sd</italic> subpopulations except for <italic>CCP1</italic> (stress response), <italic>ERG251</italic> (ergosterol biosynthesis), and <italic>ADE17</italic> (adenine biosynthesis).

This manuscript emphasizes the lack of single-cell transcriptomics in C. albicans (and fungi broadly), although there does appear to be other work published in this area (Dohn et al. 2021 â which also includes antifungal treatment). Relationship to other work in this area should be more clearly addressed, and differences in findings with regards to antifungal treatment should also be addressed.</p></disp-quote><p>We have adjusted the Introduction to better cover the results of Dohn et al. However, we would like to note that the original bioRxiv (2020) version of this paper appeared well before Dohn et al. in 2021. It is an unfortunate oversight that Dohn et al. does not cite our effort as microbial DROP-seq (mDROP-seq) has similarities to our published protocol. Nevertheless, there are many differences in the tools and parameters between our two efforts with respect to the quality control and pre-processing of sc-transcriptomics data, yet the number of genes/transcripts per cell were quite comparable.</p><p>The results in Dohn et al. support our findings, including those reported in our original 2020 bioRxiv preprint. To summarize their results:</p><p>â A âmixed sampleâ of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>C. albicans</italic> was DROP-seqâd. They could differentiate between these two fungi. This is reminiscent of the first DROP-seq experiments from Macosko et al. (2015) Cell where mixed mouse and human samples were used to establish the technical efficacy of their system. A nice experiment but independent of any of our results here.</p><p>â They examine <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> subjected to heat shock. This is not related to our manuscript and is similar in structure to several previous single cell profiling efforts that looked at heat shock in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, including the series of papers from the Gasch and later McClean labs. A nice experiment but we do not examine <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> here so we cannot compare.</p><p>â They contrast control <italic>C. albicans</italic> at 1.5 hours and 3 hours post exposure to FCZ. We examine <italic>C. albicans</italic> populations at 2, 3, and 6 days post treatment. Although these are very different time scales, there is still some overlap between our differentially expressed genes (e.g. <italic>WH11</italic> which is discussed in Bettauer et al., 2020). Their analysis of the cell cycle relies on older bulk transcriptional profiles from Spellman et al. By contrast, we combined several sources of evidence including cell cycle related information obtained from more modern transcriptomics data. It is hard to âalignâ our data with their data for these reasons. At 1.5-3 hours post treatment, Dohn et al. appear to have captured an early cellular stress response. The trajectory analyses mostly point to differences in cell cycle. [Changes located at L102-108]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The introduction to this manuscript is framed around antifungal drug tolerance, and throughout this research, antifungal tolerance is highlighted as a central research question. However it is not clear how the experimental design of this work addresses antifungal tolerance in any way. Cells are treated with antifungal drugs and subjected to transcriptomic analysis, but this does not represent a distinct 'tolerant' population of fungi that are being analyzed. This either needs to be much more clearly explained and justified, or more likely, the framing of this work needs to be substantially re-assessed.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out aspects of the introduction that were not clear. We indeed designed the study to focus on antifungal tolerance, by using drug concentrations at and just above the MIC (MIC of <italic>C. albicans</italic> lab strain SC5314 is 0.25-0.5 Âµg/ml fluconazole) and by analyzing cells at 48 h of drug exposure (a time at which the differences between tolerant and non-tolerant cell growth is evident) (Rosenberg et al. 2018; Gerstein et al. 2016). We now address this by highlighting several aspects of tolerance: First, when tolerance appears, some cells are dividing much more than others. The dividing cells are those exhibiting tolerance to fluconazole, which is a fungistatic drug. We now highlight this, as it is a major distinction between the definition of fluconazole tolerance in fungal cells being treated with a fungistatic drug and the definition of antibacterial tolerance in bacterial cells being treated with a bactericidal drug. The question we are asking is whether there are major distinct subpopulations of cells exhibiting different responses to drug within a single population of isogenic cells. The answer to this is clearly yes, especially with respect to fluconazole, and the two major types of cells are those with an Î±<italic>/Rd</italic> and those with a Î±<italic>/Rd</italic> and Î²/<italic>Sd</italic> response pattern. [Changes L53-73].</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The authors make reference to another study of theirs (Battauer et al. 2020) and suggest that the transcriptomic profiles reported in this work combine profiles from their previous work. This needs to be much more clearly explained. Have parts of this work already been previously published? How is this analysis unique and novel? The title of the previous manuscript seems very similar to that of this manuscript suggesting there might be a substantial overlap between these works.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see our response to these questions above (Essential Revisions #1 and the changes located at L96-99; L109;-114; L137-141). Briefly here, the first preprint from the Hallett lab was never published beyond bioRxiv. Here, this manuscript uses that original bioRxiv data in addition to new data including: more replicates of the sc-transcriptional profiles, as well as microscopy, CRISPR knockouts, DNA-sequencing and disk assays. This manuscript goes significantly further than the first bioRxiv paper, which primarily detailed the technical aspects of the sc-RNAseq assay and identified the existence of the Î±<italic>/Rd</italic> and Î²/<italic>Sd</italic> survivor subpopulations after FCZ treatment. Several additional authors were added to this manuscript to assist us with the interpretation of the data (for example, the Berman team, which provided antifungal drug tolerance expertise and performed some of these additional studies).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The major analysis in this work compares untreated cells in log phase, to antifungal drug treated cells grown for 2-3 days in antifungals. It is not clear why untreated cells were not grown for the same duration of time as drug-treated cells, which would certainly alter the findings and analysis. It is thus unclear if the transcriptomic responses described in this manuscript truly represent the consequence of drug treatment itself, or are also influenced by the growth state of the cells (which are in stationary phase after 2-3 days of drug treatment). A comparison to untreated cells in stationary phase would be a more appropriate comparison.</p></disp-quote><p>There appears to be a misunderstanding. The untreated cells were in log phase, which allowed us to define cell-cycle-specific gene expression patterns. The tolerant cells exposed to drug were still growing, but much more slowly, and they continued to grow between days 2 and 3 of the experiment (Figure 3 âfigure supplemental 1B). Between days 3-6, the cells were returned to medium without drug so that recovery could be documented, although in this case, because they had three days to recover, the cells were well past log phase when they were analyzed. It is true that many factors beyond the drug may affect heterogeneity. We think that the interesting observation in these results is that, even after 3 days of recovery, the Î±<italic>/Rd</italic> and Î²/<italic>Sd</italic> split persisted. In addition, we note that the Î±<italic>/Rd</italic> and Î²/<italic>Sd</italic> cell clusters are defined solely within each culture and neither by contrasting cultures between time points nor by comparing UT versus drug treatments.</p><p>We have made more clear in the Methods and in the manuscript in several places e.g. [L196, L509], that state of the cells at time of profiling for each drug/day. We also re-perform the growth curves (Figure 3 figure supplemental 1B and Figure 5I) to provide the reader with a more quantitative estimate of the state of these cells at time of profiling.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. The work describes the identification of 184 transcripts on average in each cell, which seems like an incredibly small number. Is this in line with other similar single-cell transcriptomic analysis? Does this number of transcripts enable robust conclusions to be drawn on the transcriptional profile of individual cells?</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, expressed in this manner, 184 transcripts per cell on average appears to be a very small number. However, we strongly caution the reviewer from concluding too much based only on the first moment (mean) of a distribution in this context. First, note that there is a very long right tail representing cells with far more transcripts; these cells strongly influence the downstream analyses.</p><p>Specifically, every sc-transcriptomics method begins with a quality control pipeline that selects âhigh qualityâ cells. The definition of high quality is based on approximately 10 underlying parameters that are determined by different types of <italic>ad hoc</italic> statistical analyses and specific bioinformatics tools (e.g. EmptyDrops software that seeks to determine thresholds of detected RNA that represent successful co-capture of a cell in a droplet versus sequencing of ambient RNA ubiquitously present in the suspension). There are many ways to increase the mean transcripts per cell at the expense of throwing out some sparse cells; however these sparse cells may contribute useful information to the overall patterns in the data. For example, key markers of the Î±<italic>/Rd</italic> and Î²/<italic>Sd</italic> classes may be expressed in these âsparse cellsâ and assist to delineate between subpopulations.</p><p>This leads to the question: If you cannot maximize both the number of cells you sequence and the number of transcripts you sequence per cell, which would you choose? It turns out that it is better to increase the number of cells (Zhang, Ntranos, Tse (2020) Nature Communications), even though this may seem counterintuitive at first. A standard approach in sc studies is to first use the sparse sc-data to identify subpopulations. Once identified, we can then pool the data within each subpopulation (ignore barcodes) and do traditional differential analysis. This is exactly what we did in this manuscript: we used the sparse single-cell profiles to discover the Î±<italic>/Rd</italic> and Î²/<italic>Sd</italic> subpopulations. We then used traditional bulk analysis by simply binning cells as either Î±<italic>/Rd</italic> or Î²/<italic>Sd</italic> (or neither) and then ignored the cell barcodes. This approach provided pseudo-bulk RNA-seq profiles of the Î±<italic>/Rd</italic> and Î²/<italic>Sd</italic> subpopulations that were quite robust. It also allowed us to drill down into the genes that are differentially expressed between the two subpopulations.</p><p>As we are the first to do sc sequencing in <italic>C. albicans</italic> at large scale, it is a challenge to establish comparisons with previous studies. A study in Saccharomyces performed 11 replicates of their samples with a commercial 10x Inc system (Jackson et al. (2020) <italic>eLife</italic>). Nevertheless, they had a very similar number of transcripts per cell to our data â we captured a maximum of 5956 transcripts/cell and they captured a maximum 5437 transcripts/cell. Note, however, that the lower bound of transcripts/cell is a function of many parameters and, if we repeated the DROP-seq nine more times, we could discard cells to raise our lower bound to an equivalent of 735 transcripts per cell reported by Jackson et al. At the time the experiments were done, each run on the Chromium 10x system was approximately 10x more expensive than a run using our system.</p><p>The numbers from Dohn et al. were almost identical to the numbers in this manuscript, although there are differences in many parameters: concentration of beads used, number of DROP-seq runs combined before sequencing, depth of sequencing, quality control parameters etc. Overall, they profile a smaller number of cells (however we consider multiple drugs and more time points). However, it does really come down to Zhang et al.âs observation above â it is more important to increase the number of cells analyzed, than to capture more transcripts per cell. Our goal was to show proof or principle for fungal sc-transcriptional profiling at a reasonable cost, and we think we have achieved that: we were able to identify and partially validate subpopulations that can be explored more deeply.</p><p>We also note that section 2 of the Results describes comparisons with bulk transcriptional profiling (Methods 5) and bulk differential expression analyses (Methods 9), which support the idea that the sc-profiling is largely detecting the same transcripts (~6700 in common, only 172 that differ).</p><p>In conclusion, whether 184 transcripts per cell (for our specific choice of thresholds and parameters) is or is not sufficient depends on the complexity of the samples, the types of questions that are investigated and the ability to independently validate the existence of subpopulations. Here, for FCZ treated cells for example, we only needed sc-profiles to be of sufficient quality to separate cells into the Î±<italic>/Rd</italic> and Î²/<italic>Sd</italic> subpopulations. Improvements to the technology would allow us to identify rarer subpopulations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. While the paper is generally well written, it is written in an extremely technical manner with much methodological detail (as well as discussion) incorporated throughout the main Results section.

It is unclear why stress response pathways are being assessed in untreated cells without any stress exposure.

In Figure 2 â source data 1 (list of gene signatures), we added a column entitled âUT relevantâ, which indicates which of the 43 curated gene signatures is relevant for analyses associated with profiles of UT cells. Note however that there is evidence in the literature that some stress pathways do have (at least slight) differential expression across different cell cycle states. This includes, for example, heat shock proteins. This is reflected in the data where the signatures corresponding to these different stress pathways are also differentially expressed (for example, the oxidative stress response).

In the growth curves in Figure 3 Supp 1a, it seems that both untreated and drug-treated cells take 2-3 days to reach stationary phase. This seems very unusual for cells that replicate quite rapidly under many growth conditions. Is this due to a nutrient-limited media or some other explanation?</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for this confusion. Indeed, the cells were grown in YPD media so there should not have been any nutrient limitation per se. Although the underlying growth experiments had been repeated several times, we were concerned that there may have been some error in the measurement. Thus, we repeated these experiments and found different results. We now replaced these figures with the new data (Figure 3 figure supplemental 1B; Figure 5I); indeed the stationary phase is reached much earlier, and drug-treated cells exhibit slower growth as expected. We suspect that the confusion was due to a failure to account for the dynamic range of the spectrophotometer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9. It seems surprising that extremely different antifungals (cidal vs. static, different cell targets) elicit a very similar transcriptional response based on this analysis (line 345-348). Can this be explained?</p></disp-quote><p>To be clear here, we observed that the majority of caspofungin (CSP) survivors have similar transcriptional profiles to FCZ cells in the Î±<italic>/Rd</italic> state; we did not see any CSP survivors with profiles resembling the Î²/<italic>Sd</italic> state, so there are some similarities and some differences between CSP, which is fungicidal in <italic>C. albicans</italic> and FCZ, which is fungistatic. Of note, because CSP is fungicidal, we used subinhibitory CSP concentrations (to ensure that a sufficient number of cells survived for profiling) and the CSP sc-profiling was only done at day 2. Nonetheless, we did examine cultures at later time points and with higher concentrations of CSP using microscopy. We always observed high levels of cell-cell aggregation which makes them inadequate for sc-profiling, yet did not observe any indication that CSP survivors of type Î²/<italic>Sd</italic> under any conditions (see eg Appendix 2 â figure 1E depicting Hsp70 fluorescence, marker of Î²/<italic>Sd</italic> cells, at day 2-3 for CSP-treated cells). In summary, perhaps cells at early time points post-treatment with low doses of CSP primarily cope with protein aggregation, a property shared with FCZ, but not with other tested compounds such as Rapamaycin.</p><p>We have added text to the Discussion section on the CSP response L428-435 and additional text regarding the RAPA response (which conversely only induces Î²/<italic>Sd cells</italic> L418-427).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10. Section 8-9 on expanding the analysis to day 6 was difficult to interpret in terms of the rationale for the experimental design and how the findings can be interpreted. It is also unclear how solid agar media-based tolerance assays can be extrapolated to liquid media growth assays with drugs, as these are very different conditions. It is also unclear if there is a day 6 untreated control that is being assessed.</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, agar assays (disk diffusion assays, DDAs) and liquid assays (broth microdilution assays) do not give exactly the same results. This is because, in liquid cultures, cells grown in the presence of a drug can out-compete those cells that fail to grow in the drug. Nonetheless, when assayed at 48 hours, both disk assays and broth microdilution assays can report on tolerance (Rosenberg et al. 2018). Usually tolerance is measured at 48 hrs for cultures that grow at normal rates, and sometimes at 72 hrs for slow-going cultures. The reviewer is correct to question the meaning of the DDAs presented in Appendix 1 at day 6: whereas the cells harvested for sc-profiling at day 6 are return-to-growth without drug, the 6 day measurement in the DDA has not received replenished media. Nevertheless, the DDAS of Appendix 1 still indicates that the cultures do exhibit drug tolerance in the 2-3 day window relevant to our sc-profiling and that we do not observe drug resistance. We have added text in Appendix 1 to clarify this. [Changes L122-131 and in Appendix 1 L782-820].</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>a. The microscopy in associated Figure 4 K is very difficult to see and lacks scale bars.</p></disp-quote><p>We have decided to remove this panel; the two microscopy images were primarily there to show that we observed cells at the day 6 time point. The images do not advance the main findings in the manuscript significantly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Below I provide a few suggestions for how the authors may improve the manuscript, but overall I found it well done.</p><p>1. First, it is my understanding that tolerance is defined as survival, but not growth, after exposure above the MIC for drugs that normally would kill most of the population of cells (for non-static drugs). This is the definition put forward in Balaban et al. (&quot;Definitions and guidelines for research on antibiotic persistence&quot;; Nat Rev Microbiol; 2019). I would have called what the authors describe as phenotypic resistance, i.e., a sub-population of cells that can continue to grow after exposure above the MIC, and a non-genetically heritable state (i.e., readily reversible). This is a known phenomenon for some antimicrobials/species combinations, as the authors describe. I think it would be good to standardize usage of the word tolerance through the manuscript, or the authors can better explain how the phenomenon they observe is consistent with Balaban et al.'s definition of tolerance. This is an important semantics issue.</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed we are discussing a phenotypic heterogeneity, (which is due to slow growth during constant exposure to a static drug); reviewers of prior work that characterized this phenomenon insisted that it be termed `toleranceâ because some older studies had referred to it in this way. Thus, although we suggested using a different term (perseverance) to distinguish this phenomenon from bacterial tolerance (which indeed is due to survival and not growth during periodic exposure to a cidal drug), editors of that paper (Rosenberg et al. 2018) agreed with the reviewers, and thus we are stuck with as suboptimal term which has different meanings in different contexts. For this manuscript, we tried to clarify this issue in the introduction (and to point out that the definition differs from that in bacteria treated periodically with cidal drugs). [Changes 62-73]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Second, the drug concentrations used were at or well-below their MICs. This raises the question of whether the authors are studying the clinical phenomenon that they describe as tolerance (i.e., above the MIC) when the experiment was conducted below the MIC. While I understand their reasoning for using low drug concentrations, and I think there is still something to be learned at these concentrations, I think the authors should better contextualize the clinical relevance of their findings with the caveat that the experimental results were probably collected at sub-clinical concentrations. Admittedly, drug concentration is dynamic during treatment, so at some point the concentration in vivo likely passes through the author's choice of in vitro concentrations. It would be interesting to know how much their results are invariant to the drug concentration chosen.</p></disp-quote><p>There appears to be some misunderstanding: the FCZ MIC<sub>50</sub> of <italic>C. albicans</italic> SC5314 is 0.5-1 Âµg/ml. Here we used 1Âµg/ml fluconazole which is above the MIC (1-2x MIC<sub>50</sub>). We had previously stated ~1x MIC<sub>50</sub> as this was an estimate based on MIC<sub>50</sub> obtained from the literature. We have added a broth microdilution experiment to better estimate the FCZ MIC<sub>50</sub> for the specific strain used in this study. The result now presented in Figure 3 âfigure supplement 1A for FCZ at days 2 and 3, and Figure 5I for day 6.</p><p>Indeed, antifungal tolerance occurs at higher drug concentrations as well. However, antifungal tolerance is often very similar at drug concentrations ranging from just above the MIC to concentrations far above the MIC (e.g., Rosenberg et al. 2018, Nat. Comm.; Yang et al., mbio 2023; Todd et al., 2023). The reviewer is correct that the concentrations used here are sub-clinical and we agree that it would be very interesting to look at this question in a series of drug concentrations. This is a major challenge however in and of itself, and the cost of profiling/sequencing samples across a range of FCZ concentrations and time points with suitable controls is prohibitive, and would require substantial funding. In general, we agree it would be very interesting to better understand the dynamics of fungal drug tolerance in in vivo models relevant to the clinical setting and we hope to do so in the future.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The author's interpretation of the &quot;comets&quot; is questionable. On L244 they say, &quot;This pattern suggests that the small set of cells from each comet have strong transcriptional similarity but each such comet is transcriptionally distinct from the other comets.&quot; I do not see how the cells within comets share &quot;strong&quot; transcriptional similarity because they are still spread out. Rather, the comet tails could be interpreted as lineages of descent, wherein each cell becomes more distinct (along some transcriptional axis) than its ancestor. This pattern is commonly observed in genetic data plotted with PCA, which is somewhat related to what is being shown here. Therefore, an alternative interpretation is that some lineages are moving toward a transcriptionally distinct state and leaving behind progeny along their trajectory, especially given that the experimental setup may not quickly remove ancestral cells in the two day exposure. Another explanation is that the comets are composed of a different (minority) morphology, such as filamentous growth. Another (less?) plausible interpretation is that these are noise clusters due to the inherent stochasticity involved in single-cell analyses. I see no reason why these explanations aren't equally reasonable to the author's explanation. Perhaps the authors can incorporate these alternative into their interpretations, but (at a minimum) there needs to be more justification given for the claim of &quot;strong&quot; intra-cluster transcriptional similarity.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for these insights. Because we do not consider the âcometsâ to be central to the main findings of the manuscript, and because we think that they potentially detract and distract from the central points, we decided to move the section on comets to the Appendix 2. In addition, we modified the text concerning comets to clarify the previous presentation [Changes L837-897]. Below we provide specific responses to the points raised above concerning interpretations of the comet data.</p><p>&quot;This pattern suggests that the small set of cells from each comet have strong transcriptional similarity but each such comet is transcriptionally distinct from the other comets.&quot; I do not see how the cells within comets share &quot;strong&quot; transcriptional similarity because they are still spread out.</p><p>There are 19 smaller clusters or âcometsâ outside of the 5 major clusters analyzed in the main body of the manuscript. Each comet cluster is, in turn, comprised of a set of 7 to 126 cells. The cells within each comet are similar at the transcriptional level â the UMAP embedding procedure groups them together based only on their transcriptional profiles. However, the 19 different comets are not necessarily transcriptionally similar to one another, as noted, because âthey are still spread outâ and found in distinct clusters. [Changes 837-839]</p><p>Nevertheless, when we pooled all 19 comets and computed the list of all genes that were differentially expressed in the pooled comets relative to the 5 main clusters, we did find some interesting genes and pathways that suggest that these âoutliersâ are not simply technical artifacts of the DROP-seq profiling or the UMAP clustering algorithm. In particular, we discuss the ILV pathway which is over-represented in this group and its relationship to amino-acid starvation amongst other pathways revisited below.</p><p>We appreciate the original presentation of the analysis was dense and thus, we rewrote the section to better explain the use of the different tools and statistics. The comets are small and the sc-profiles are sparse, so analysis here really benefits from alternative methods. We have tried to better delineate these different sources of evidence [e.g. italic subtitles for each method on L844, 854, and 882]. Fortunately the different approaches largely highlight the same take home message, which we have tried to clarify in the presentation. [Changes L837-897]</p><p>We also removed the somewhat poetic language of âradiating from the centre of the UMAPâ. We fully agree that this sort of âtrajectoryâ is often reflective of some sort of model underlying the decomposition technique whether PCA (which is linear) or UMAP (which could be non-linear). This âlinear radiationâ first suggested to us that the comets might be some sort of technical artifact, but the differentially expressed genes and the pathway enrichment analysis suggests alternative explanations that have some support in the previous literature of <italic>C. albicans</italic> drug tolerance and its potential relationship with the genomic instability observed in <italic>C. albicans</italic>. [Changes 267-269]</p><p>We caution against interpreting the linear trajectories as true âevolutionaryâ trajectories. This is certainly one possibility, but the size of each comet and the current limitations of sc-transcriptional profiling would make a rigorous statistical assessment of this very difficult.</p><p>That the comets could be due to stochastic noise is another option, but we disagree that it is equally likely, given that both the differentially expressed gene analysis and the pathway analysis are tools underpinned by sound statistical models, and both provide evidence (at reasonable p-values or confidence intervals) that there is enrichment in specific functional processes. It is more difficult to estimate a formal confidence in the mapping of reads to chromosomal position (i.e., cluster 16 to chromosome 2) however it is at least visually convincing that ~38% of all reads from cells in cluster 16 mapped to this chromosome. We also note that comets are almost exclusively observed after FCZ treatment (and not after Rapamycin, for example). We have added a statement to the end of the section that all of our findings should be taken with caution due to the small sample sizes. Changes L889-890.</p><p>It is possible that some of these clusters correspond to filamentation, although (i) we filtered out large filamentous cells before profiling, (ii) filamentation signatures are not identified in the analysis, (iii) microscopy analysis of the cultures before filtering identified &lt;1% of cells in a filamentous state. (Please see L148-149 and L492-493 in the manuscript.) It is possible that these cells could be representative of âsmallâ germ tube cells, although we did not identify marker genes related to morphological switches.</p><p>This trifecta of analyses is why discussion regarding the comets remained in the manuscript â the enrichment of processes established to be central in fungal drug tolerance was far too high for this to be explained by ânoiseâ (or the background models of any of these tools).</p><p>Our text was confusing (e.g. nature of intra- and inter-comet variability) and perhaps did not highlight why the extensive alternative analyses led us away from the idea that these were mere technical artifacts. However we agree that we are not able to fully characterize the comets at this point (e.g. exploring rigorously through DNA-seq what chromosomal aberrations exist and whether they line up well with the seminal work of Todd and Selmecki) so it remains descriptive at this point. We have minimized the discussion about DNA level aberrations (we also removed a paragraph about whole genome DNA profiling of the samples from the Discussion to simplify the manuscript).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. L434: I am skeptical of the author's interpretation here about the relative fitness of Î± and Î² states. It could also suggest switching rates between phenotypic states are different between Î± and Î² populations. Also in this paragraph (L439), the authors use OD600 to show a higher growth rate for Î² over untreated. However, Î² also reaches a higher yield, which is unexplained. Having done many growth rate experiments with OD600 data, I am always skeptical of drawing large inferences about fitness from OD600. A better test of fitness is a competition experiment. I suggest the authors remove or downplay their conclusions about relative fitness here. Also, why isn't OD600 plotted in log-space (log(OD600)) if the goal is to see the difference in growth rate?</p></disp-quote><p>We fully agree with the skepticism regarding the relative fitness of Î±<italic>/Rd</italic> and Î²/<italic>Sd</italic> states, and these comments motivated us to revisit our groupâs previous discussions as to what we can say regarding fitness and growth rates of the Î±<italic>/Rd</italic> and Î² populations. First, it is important to clarify that L439, which previously referenced Figure 4I (now Figure 5I) does not show Î²/<italic>Sd</italic> cells over untreated cells. The survivors at day 3 are a mixture of Î±<italic>/Rd</italic> and Î²/<italic>Sd</italic> cells. However, we did report that FCZ day 3 survivors grew faster after receiving new medium from days 3 to 6 compared to untreated cells, an observation that we struggled to explain. We decided to repeat the growth assays analysis of UT cells and FCZ day 3 survivors (Figure 5I) with care to ensure that both populations were diluted to the same OD<sub>600</sub> initially (Methods 1C). (See response to Reviewer 2 Question 8). After correcting some prior issues with dilution and the dynamic range of the spectrometer, we now observe the more intuitive outcome where UT cells grow faster than FCZ survivors. Our previous manuscript stated that âAt these concentrations, FCZ treatment slows growth relative to UT controls in the first days after exposureâ which is now more visible with growth curves fitting what you would expect. We are sorry for this confusion.</p><p>Currently, we do not have a way to directly test the fitness of the Î±<italic>/Rd</italic> versus Î²/<italic>Sd</italic> survivors. We do comment however on the relative sizes of the Î±<italic>/Rd</italic> subpopulations compared to Î²/<italic>Sd</italic> subpopulations. In particular, from day 2 to day 6, we see that the Î²/<italic>Sd</italic> becomes more prevalent (L359-367). We do not have a mechanistic explanation but we offer at least two different models that are both consistent with our data as to why this may be the case (Changes L364-367 and L393-399, L413-417).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The authors did not seem to analyze feature importance in Leiden clustering, preferring to look at cluster associations (z-scores) instead. Leiden clustering is not guaranteed to be optimal, so some understanding of cluster stability would have been useful. That is, if inputs changed somewhat (e.g., subsampling or resampling), would the identified clusters have been similar? This is particularly important given that the UMAP1 versus UMAP2 clusters look like blobs that are split along arbitrary axes. It seems doubtful these clusters are stable, yet the whole manuscript analyzes them as though the blobs are discretized correctly.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an excellent point. We now include an updated analysis that incorporates measures of cluster stability throughout the manuscript. Before describing our changes and additional analyses, we want to note that the vast majority of single cell transcriptomic studies are performed with mammalian tissues. The diversity of cellular lineages and cell types (and extreme disruptions of normal physiological states in studies related to disease) induce UMAPs with distinct, non-overlapping clusters. We hypothesize here that this degree of separation will not be observed in a fungal population where the cells are isogenic and different only in their response to environmental cues. For example, we might expect that many cellular processes are similar across all individuals in the population at least in comparison to, for example, an epithelial versus a B-cell in the tumor microenvironment. Additionally, of course, fungal single cell profiling is in its infancy and better technologies that capture more transcripts per cell will likely produce more distinct clusters. Here, we hope that the reviewer agrees that we have provided evidence that the technology and analyses have succeeded to delineate, at least to some degree, between a handful of different types of cellular responses which we discuss individually below.</p><p>Additionally, we would like to clarify the nature of the methodology used here. We use a neural network (scVI) to process the raw data into a lower dimensional latent (hidden space). Leiden clustering is based solely on the expression profiles; the algorithm looks for evidence of separation between groups of cells. UMAP only maps the latent space (from scVI) down to 2D for visualization. Finally, pathway analysis used the identified Leiden clusters; this supervised analysis ultimately yields z-scores. As such, if a signature has higher expression in one Leiden cluster compared to other clusters, pathway analysis used in this manner is a form of cross validation: random clusters are not expected by chance to contain differentially expressed genes from the same functional categories. That is, the clusters point to interesting biological differences.</p><p>The microscopy depicted in Figure 2 C-E also represents a second source of cross-validation; it supports the separation of these clusters based only on GFP/RFP strains. It is therefore independent of the sc-transcriptomics data. Of course, this is not definitive and we agree fully with the reviewer that additional statistics can be used to examine stability which we present next.</p><fig id="sa2fig2" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-81406-sa2-fig2-v2.tif"/></fig><p>We revisited the analysis of UT cells (this corresponds to Results subsection 3, paragraphs 1 and 2 L184-211). The reviewerâs question is primarily regarding the stability of the blue pink and green clusters in the clustering above on the right hand side (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2</xref>, this was Figure 2A in the original manuscript). Towards this end, we labeled every cell with a unique Cell ID (x-axis of the right hand side of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2</xref>). Then, we resampled 100x each time picking a subset of 95% of all UT cells each time, reapplying the scVI algorithm (to re-compute the model of expression) and reapplying the Louvain clustering algorithm (code available at https://github.com/vdumeaux/sc-candida_paper). We then determined which cluster each cell was found in. In the figure on the right hand side (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2</xref>), original cluster 1 corresponds to the darkblue/G1-S phase cluster in the left hand side image, cluster 3 corresponds to the green/M phase cluster and cluster 2 corresponds to sampled cluster labelled `1-3â. Some cells that were placed in cluster 1 originally again find themselves in cluster 1 in the resampling (that is the light purple pattern at the top right). Other cells are placed in cluster `1-3â. This means that, although there is good evidence that cluster 1 exists, the Leiden clustering is far from perfect and there is some confusion with clusters 2. This is also true for original cluster 3. Sometimes these cells are re-classified as cluster 3 but sometimes they are grouped again with cluster <bold>`</bold>1-3â.So although the three clusters are certainly not absolutely distinct there is strong evidence for all three clusters.</p><p>To better address the instability of some clusters within the manuscript, we re-represent our results so that they do not rely on the grouping of cells into discrete clusters. We produced an alternative to Figure 2 (page 8 of new manuscript) which shows the signature scores for each cell individually. For these signatures, we can observe that cells differentially express these signatures and that when a cell expresses a specific signature highly, it also tends to express other signatures highly. For example, a set of cells (cell indices &gt;3000) exhibit elevated expression of genes involved in M phase, the heat-shock response and glycolysis.</p><p>Again we assigned all cells a unique Cell ID. They are ordered from left to right in the same manner across all 6 plots, providing the ability to compare them more readily, and to better highlight the differences of expression for specific signatures/biological processes. The text in the subsection describes essentially the three sets of cells (Index 0-2700, 2701-3000, and 3001-5000) and their inter-relationships. Note that here the analysis w.r.t. UT cells no longer depends upon the Leiden clusters.</p><p>Perhaps not surprisingly, the Leiden clusters identified post drug treatment (Figure 3, page 11 of new manuscript) are far more stable when we apply the same resampling technique. Figure 3 â Supplement figure 1C has been added to the manuscript. It shows that the 5 main clusters are quite stable (the 19 comet clusters were not included in the results due to their small sizes and given that we considered them both as one pooled comet and as distinct clusters in our analyses).</p><p>Figure 3 âfigure supplement 1C was included to depict the considerable stability of the clustering that included untreated (UT) and drug-treated cells.</p><p>Figure 5B was also added to characterize the stability of clusters identified when investigating FCZ day3 survivors at day 3 and 6 after resuspension in fresh media. Most identified clusters are robust except for cluster 1 and 2 which includes Î±/Rd cells at day 6 and day 3, respectively. The lack of robust transcriptional differences between cluster 1 and 2 is described L347-350 and confirms that day 6 Î±/Rd cells likely evolved from day 3 Î±/Rd cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. I have some concerns about the comparison between untreated and treated at the same (or similar) time points. If the transcript profile changes over time, as presumably it would, then it is reasonable to expect that the treated and untreated cells are at different equivalent times because their growth rates are different. I have a similar concern with comparing different time points (days 3 versus 6) because fresh medium (YPD) was used in this experiment. How much are transcript abundances static over time? This should minimally be discussed further in the manuscript. Also, the conclusions in L472-475 and L579-592 may need this caveat mentioned.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that comparisons between UT and drug-treated populations are problematic. However we do not rely on direct comparisons between UT and drug-treated cells. Rather, analysis of the UT cells was performed to validate the efficacy of the sc-transcriptomics assay and provide a âsanity checkâ.</p><p>Unfortunately, the previous version of the manuscript had several sources of confusion with respect to the growth rate of the different <italic>C. albicans</italic> populations (for example Reviewer #2, Questions 4 and 8), and we have revisited the Discussion points with these criticisms in mind. Briefly, we better emphasize that the primary goal is not to compare UT with drug treated cells and that the major finding of the manuscript is the existence of the âº/<italic>Rd</italic> and Î²/<italic>Sd</italic> subpopulations initially identified in FCZ at day 2. This result is independent of any other time point or drug treatment (including untreated). The manuscript focuses on the observation that this same split between âº/<italic>Rd</italic> and Î²/<italic>Sd</italic> cells continues to exist at day 3 and even at day 6. While it is possible that some of the distinction between âº/<italic>Rd</italic> and Î²/<italic>Sd</italic> cells is not entirely due to drug treatment, it also cannot be due to cell cycle or nutrient levels alone and was not observed with other drug treatments (e.g. CSP and RAPA).</p></body></sub-article></article>
