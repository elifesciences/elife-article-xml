Among numerous physiological tasks, the vascular network transports oxygen and nutrients and eliminates waste products, all critical for organ survival and cellular homeostasis. During early stages of embryogenesis, by a process called vasculogenesis, a part of the mesoderm differentiates into endothelial cells, forms a lumen, and deposits a basal lamina to create a vascular plexus de novo. To become functional, blood vessels mature and specialize by recruitment of mural cells and form a network of arteries, capillaries, and veins. During development and in the adult, new blood vessels are formed from pre-existing ones by a process called angiogenesis. This mechanism involves specialized endothelial cells named tip cells. Thanks to the expression of specific receptors, tip cells can sense the microenvironment, and respond to guidance cues to lead the angiogenic sprout. Thus, angiogenesis not only allows the rapid vascularization of developing tissues and organs but ensures appropriate vascularization rate adapted to specific needs in nutrients and oxygen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Carmeliet and Jain, 2011</xref>).</p><p>Peripheral nerves, connecting the central nervous system (CNS) to the rest of the body, are composed of axons covered by myelinating and non-myelinating Schwann cells (SC). During neural development, axons are guided through embryonic tissues to reach their final targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Stoeckli, 2018</xref>), supported by secreted trophic factors ensuring axonal survival until the connection is ultimately stabilized when the appropriate target is reached (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ye et al., 2019</xref>). Simultaneously, SC precursors (SCP) derive from the neural crest cells and migrate from the neural tube around embryonic day E10.5 to contact axons and differentiate into immature SC (iSC) around E15/E16 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Woodhoo and Sommer, 2008</xref>). Finally, around birth they differentiate into either myelinating or non-myelinating SC. SC are necessary to ensure axonal survival during development and also in regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jessen et al., 2015</xref>). Myelin sheaths are produced by SC wrapping larger axons in a 1:1 ratio to allow rapid saltatory conduction of action potentials. In rodents, myelination is progressive, starts around birth, and lasts during about 2 weeks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Woodhoo and Sommer, 2008</xref>). Non-myelinating SC associate with multiple small caliber axons to form Remak bundles without forming compact myelin sheaths. Adult nerves are stable structures, with nerve fibers surrounded and protected by three layers of connective tissues: the endoneurium, perineurium, and epineurium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kaplan et al., 2009</xref>). While nerves acquire a complex, multi-cellular composition, especially with connective tissue, specific metabolic needs are covered by an adapted and specific vascularization. Indeed, a dense network called the <italic>vasa nervorum</italic> ensures the maintenance of proper nerve homeostasis. This is of particular importance when nerves are formed from axons covering a long distance from their soma to the innervated target. The organization of this vascular system has been previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Boissaud-Cooke et al., 2015</xref>). In fact, blood vessels are found within the three connective tissues, all along the nerve length, forming the peri- and intra (INV)-nervous vascular system. They are composed of a single layer of endothelial cells surrounded by mural cells: the SMC and pericytes allowing the contraction of the blood vessel to adapt the blood flow.</p><p>Whereas the different developmental stages of the axons, connective tissues and SC have been documented, it remains unclear when and how the <italic>vasa nervorum</italic> develops. A better understanding of the normal development of the peripheral nerves and their components, especially the <italic>vasa nervorum</italic>, is of crucial importance as nerves control many organs and tissues. Moreover, understanding the molecular control of nerve vascularization and re-vascularization after injury is of primary importance in regenerative medicine. In fact, after transection, peripheral nerves can repair and reconnect and this process implicates migration of SC to guide regrowing axons. It has been shown that blood vessels inside the nerve are used by SC to direct this migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cattin et al., 2015</xref>). Moreover, nerve grafts appears to be more efficient when their vascularization is preserved, allowing a better regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">D′Arpa et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we performed a time course analysis of the intra-nervous vascularization and discovered mechanisms for the development and maturation of the INV in the sciatic nerve. Importantly, we decipher the cellular and molecular actors governing the <italic>vasa nervorum</italic> formation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The INV develops rapidly from embryonic day E16</title><p>To define when the first blood vessels penetrate the nerves and mature into <italic>vasa nervorum</italic>, sciatic nerves were dissected and analyzed for the presence of blood vessels at successive stages starting from embryonic day 15 (E15). At this stage arteries and nerves start to be aligned in the skin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mukouyama et al., 2002</xref>). Endothelial cells were visualized using CD31 marker in order to assess the level of nerve vascularization. At E15.5, the extrinsic artery of the primitive sciatic nerve is aligned with axons (TUJ-1 staining). However, no blood vessels were observed inside or surrounding the nerve (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). At E16, we noticed new blood vessels emerging from the aligned extrinsic artery to form a peri-nervous vascular plexus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref><italic>, arrowhead</italic>). Developing from this latter, numerous angiogenic sprouts invade the inside part of the immature nerve, starting to form the intra-nervous vascular network (INV) as observed in the optical section of the proximal part of the nerve (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref><italic>, arrowhead</italic>). However, at E16, in the distal part no blood vessels were found inside the nerve (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), suggesting a proximo-distal gradient of nerve invasion by blood vessels. Soon after, at E16.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>) and E17.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>), we found more blood vessels inside the nerve. Later, at E19, many angiogenic sprouts are still found inside a dense vascular plexus, implying that angiogenesis is still ongoing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G and H</xref><italic>, arrowheads</italic>). At birth (P0) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>), angiogenic sprouts were also found inside the nerve (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>, <italic>arrowheads</italic>). Finally, at P2 and P5, very few angiogenic sprouts were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K and L</xref>). This level of angiogenesis was quantified by counting the number of angiogenic sprouts found inside the nerve at different stages during peri-natal development. We found that the number of angiogenic sprouts per mm<sup>2</sup> significantly decreases throughout development, between E19 and P0 and between P0 and P2, to reach a number of almost zero angiogenic sprout at P5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1M</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Intra-nervous vascular system (INV) develops rapidly starting from embryonic day E16 and angiogenesis is still ongoing at P0.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Whole-mount immunofluorescence staining of sciatic nerve showing axons (TUJ-1, green) and blood vessels (endothelial cells expressing CD31, magenta) at embryonic day E15.5.

Endothelial cells of arterioles specifically express the protein connexin-40 (Cx-40), as observed at P0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). These branches are also covered by smooth muscles cells (SMC) to control their diameter and adapt the blood flow. The extrinsic artery, expressing Cx-40, visualized by GFP expression, and covered by SMC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref><italic>, arrowhead</italic>) is divided into continuous ascending and descending arterioles to directly supply each region of the nerve and ensure arterial blood flow to the entire nerve. Pre-existing blood vessels of the INV also undergo arterial differentiation, as observed in sciatic nerve at P5. Endothelial cells expressing Cx-40 in an isolated manner were visible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref><italic>, arrowheads</italic>), suggesting that new arterial branches undergo differentiation inside the nerve. Notably, arterialization of the penetrating vessels is still ongoing as some parts are already covered by SMC whereas newly differentiated arteries have still not recruited SMC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The Cx-40/CD31 integrated density was higher in nerves at P0 compared to P5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Moreover, pericytes, expressing the protein NG2 and covering endothelial cells, are important for maintenance of the blood-nerve barrier and are able to contract to change the capillary diameter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bergers and Song, 2005</xref>). At P0, numerous endothelial cells of the INV are already covered by pericytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Some of these cells cover new blood vessel branching (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>) as it has been already reported that pericytes are critical for angiogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bergers and Song, 2005</xref>). These pericytes at P0 have an elongated shape and their coverage is relatively sparse compared to the pericytes observed at P10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). Blood vessel coverage by pericytes NG2+ cells increase between P5 and P10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>) suggesting maturation and stabilization of the new blood vessels whereas angiogenesis is almost stopped. Thus, at birth, INV already displays vessel wall maturation that will remain during nerve post-natal morphogenesis.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Intra-nervous vascular system (INV) matures during post-natal stages with arterial differentiation and pericytes recruitment.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Whole-mount immunofluorescence staining of a sciatic nerve from a connexin-40 (Cx-40)-GFP reporter mouse at P0 showing an artery composed of endothelial cells expressing the protein Cx-40 (in green) and covered by smooth muscle cells (stained in magenta, smooth muscle actin staining [SMA]).

In fact, at E19, there is significantly less SC (expressing SOX10) in sciatic nerves from <italic>Wnt1-Cre;Krox20<sup>GFP(DT)/+</sup></italic> mutant mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A, A', B and B'</xref>) and at P5, less myelinating SC (normally expressing S100β protein) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C and C'</xref>). These animals survive only few days after birth. Therefore, we analyzed the level of vascularization of sciatic nerves at P5. As expected, the sciatic nerves of <italic>Wnt1-Cre;Krox20<sup>GFP(DT)/+</sup></italic> mice were thinner as compared to <italic>Wnt1-Cre</italic> control littermates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref>). This was due to the lack of SC and their myelin sheaths, which normally considerably increase the nerve’s caliber. Furthermore, the INV network is disrupted, denser, and more anastomotic, resembling embryonic immature plexus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). To further analyze the consequences of the SC ablation on the INV, we performed 3D reconstruction of this vasculature in toto (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D and E</xref>). We quantified the total length of the vasculature tree in blue and the number of blood vessel branching points in red. These values were normalized to the nerve size which was found to be significantly different between the two groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). Sciatic nerves from mutant pups display an increased total length of blood vessel network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>) with more branches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>) as compared to the control littermates. To make sure that the phenotype we observed was not a consequence of decreased nerve size, we also analyzed the INV of sciatic nerves from <italic>Wnt1-Cre;Krox20<sup>GFP(DT)/+</sup></italic> mice but at P0 (at the beginning of myelination) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A and A'</xref>). At this stage, nerve size is not different between the two groups, whereas vasculature is disrupted and more dense in the sciatic nerves of <italic>Wnt1-Cre;Krox20<sup>GFP(DT)/+</sup></italic>mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2B and B'</xref>). Altogether, these results suggest that myelinating SC could control INV development and maturation probably by negatively controlling angiogenesis in order to ensure a proper amount of blood vessels inside the nerve.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Schwann cells ablation disrupt sciatic nerve vasculature.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Whole-mount immunofluorescence staining of sciatic nerve from control <italic>Wnt1</italic>-Cre mouse at P5, the blood vessels are stained with CD31 and shown in red.

As previously described, in these mice, <italic>Krox20</italic> from the floxed allele is expressed until enough Cre recombinase accumulates resulting in the delayed inactivation of the <italic>Krox20</italic> gene in myelinating SC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Decker et al., 2006</xref>). Indeed, <italic>Krox20</italic> gene is normally activated at E15 but the protein is detectable shortly after birth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Thus, general organization of the mutant sciatic nerve, including proportion of iSC, is not affected between E15.5 and E18.5. At P1, Krox20 protein is fairly expressed but there is no difference between <italic>Krox20<sup>Cre/Fl</sup></italic> mice and wild-type (WT) littermates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Decker et al., 2006</xref>). The level of Krox20 protein progressively decreases in the mutant (50% at P4) to become undetectable at P28 and beyond. Thus, during embryonic period of the nerve development, in particular at the stages when INV is initiated (E16.5), sciatic nerve remains unaffected. Therefore, development of the sciatic nerve of <italic>Krox20<sup>Cre/Fl</sup></italic> mice is unaffected until birth and thus early angiogenesis events leading to INV formation should not be affected in the mutant. <italic>Krox20</italic> inactivation blocks SC at an early stage of their differentiation, progressively prevents the formation of myelin sheaths (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>) and this phenotype is maintained through the 3 weeks of survival observed for those mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Decker et al., 2006</xref>). Indeed, <italic>Krox20<sup>Cre/Fl</sup></italic> mutants survive around 20 days after birth and show tremors. Besides a complete absence of the myelin sheath, <italic>Krox20</italic> deletion in promyelinating Schwan cells does not alter any other property in the post-natal sciatic nerve, with a normal axonal density, as already described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Decker et al., 2006</xref>). We chose to analyze sciatic nerves before lethality, at P19, so that the sciatic nerves from control pups are fully myelinated whereas the ones from <italic>Krox20<sup>Cre/Fl</sup></italic> mice are devoid of myelin. The vasculature of sciatic nerves from control and mutant mice were compared using CD31 staining on whole-mount preparations. Interestingly, sciatic nerves of mutant mice appear to be more densely vascularized compared to control littermates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B and B’</xref>). Thus, we performed 3D reconstruction of the INV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C and C’</xref>). As compared to control mice, quantifications revealed a similar nerve size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>) but higher blood vessel total length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>) and higher number of branching points in mutant’s sciatic nerves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). We then aimed to better characterize vascular network defects and assessed maturation and permeability of the INV. Endothelial cells composing the INV express claudin-5, a tight junction protein, important for the acquisition of a barrier property (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Peltonen et al., 2013</xref>). At P18, in sciatic nerves from control mice, claudin-5 staining colocalized with CD31 staining in almost all blood vessels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). In sciatic nerves from <italic>Krox20<sup>Cre/Fl</sup></italic> mice, claudin-5 is poorly expressed by endothelial cells as almost all blood vessels branches are claudin-5 negative (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G’</xref>, <italic>arrowheads</italic>). Altogether, those data suggest that myelin sheath controls sciatic nerve vascularization by inhibiting angiogenesis and by limiting vascular rate and maturation.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Sciatic nerve is hypervascularized upon myelination inhibition.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic illustrating <italic>Krox20</italic> knock-out leading to myelination inhibition.

Netrin-1 is a guidance molecule known to control axonal guidance and also angiogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Boyer and Gupton, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bradford et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Park et al., 2004</xref>).

Therefore, we asked whether Netrin-1 could regulate sciatic nerve vascularization during normal development. As we described, vascularization of sciatic nerves is still ongoing around birth, involving active angiogenesis. First, we used <italic>Ntn1<sup>lacZ/+</sup></italic> knock-in mice to report Netrin-1 protein expression in the nerve. At E16, β-galactosidase expression was found in different regions of the embryo’s limb, but not inside the sciatic nerve (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>). At E17, a stage during which new blood vessels are attracted into the endoneurial part of the nerve, we noticed that β-galactosidase expression was found inside and surrounding the nerve (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref> and B’). At P2, β-galactosidase activity, reporting Netrin-1 expression, was found close to blood vessels, in areas compatible with a potential role of Netrin-1 in endothelial cell guidance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>).

We found no difference in terms of sciatic nerve diameter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1F</xref>), suggesting that the lack of Netrin-1 did not have a significant impact on sciatic nerve development and thickness of the segment analyzed in our study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A</xref>), reflecting no major axonal guidance defect nor defasciculation at this sciatic nerve level at that developmental stage. We then explored sciatic nerves vascularization of embryos at E17.5, when INV has already initiated. Embryonic sciatic nerves were dissected and we assessed blood vessels quantity using CD31 staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1G and G'</xref>). Whereas there is no difference in terms of nerve area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>), we found that nerves from mutant embryos are less vascularized as compared to control embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). To confirm this result, and to make sure that the dissection did not alter the nerve integrity and vascularization, we quantified nerve vasculature at this stage directly within the embryonic limb. Embryos’ limbs were entirely dissected, as they contain the sciatic nerve (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F and F’</xref><italic>,</italic> left top corner, dotted area). We performed whole-mount immunostaining of the entire limb to stain axons (neurofilament [NF]) and blood vessels (CD31). Limbs were then cleared using an adapted iDISCO+ protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Renier et al., 2014</xref>) and the areas of interest were imaged in three dimensions. Using <italic>Imaris</italic> software, we observed the sciatic nerve inside the limb, thus keeping the physical integrity of the nerve and its surrounding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G and G’</xref>). We also found that, whereas sciatic nerves of <italic>Ntn1<sup>lacZ/lacZ</sup></italic> embryos had the same area as control littermates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>), they were less vascularized. This was confirmed by quantification of CD31-positive area density inside the nerve (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I</xref>), with a similar ratio and in agreement with our findings on dissected nerves. Interestingly, when we looked at the sural nerve, a purely sensory branch of the sciatic nerve (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A</xref>), we found no blood vessels at this stage in neither <italic>Ntn1<sup>lacZ/lacZ</sup></italic> nor <italic>Ntn1<sup>+/+</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2B and B'</xref>). Other nerve types such as phrenic nerve, intercostal (mixed motor/sensory), or cutaneous (purely sensory nerve) were also devoid of INV at peri-natal stages (E17.5-P2) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2C to E''</xref>).</p><p>As Netrin-1 controls angiogenesis via its receptors expressed by endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Castets and Mehlen, 2010</xref>), we checked whether endothelial cells from sciatic nerves express known Netrin-1 receptors: UNC5B, DCC, and neogenin1. To do so, we isolated endothelial cells from sciatic nerves of mice at P2 and performed quantitative PCR (qPCR). We found that endothelial cells from INV do not express <italic>dcc</italic> mRNA, whereas <italic>neogenin1</italic> is weakly expressed and <italic>unc5b</italic> is highly expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6J</xref>).

Finally, we also confirmed that UNC5B protein is expressed by those endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6L</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1I</xref>).</p><p>In order to address the role of the receptor UNC5B regarding the development of the INV, we injected pups (at P0) with blocking antibodies targeting specifically UNC5B and analyzed the level of vascularization of sciatic nerves 1 day after injection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1J and J'</xref>).

This study provides the time course of the development and maturation of the mouse sciatic nerve’s INV. We find that INV appears relatively late during embryonic development, around E16, as compared to the vasculature of the CNS which begins around E9.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Tata et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Himmels et al., 2017</xref>) to ensure adequate delivery of oxygen and nutrients to neural progenitors. This temporal difference lies in the specific timing of CNS morphogenesis that starts earlier and maturates over a longer time. E16 in the mouse embryo represents a turning point for the peripheral nervous system (PNS) as SCP acquire an immature phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jessen and Mirsky, 2019</xref>). Interestingly, this step matches the apparition of the first blood vessels inside the nerve, suggesting there may be different molecular cues, expressed by immature SC participating in the attraction of blood vessels into the nerve. Another interesting observation is that other nerve types such as phrenic, intercostal (mixed motor/sensory), cutaneous, and sural nerve (purely sensory branch of the sciatic nerve) appeared devoid of INV at E17.5. Thus, as those nerves are very thin and mostly unmyelinated or poorly myelinated in the adult, the timing of vascularization may be different from what is observed in the sciatic nerve, or devoid of blood vessels as their caliber might allow oxygen diffusion from peri-nervous vascularization. One could thus wonder about the relationship between nerve type and INV development or absence of blood vessels.</p><p>Microvascular density is adapted to tissue oxygen and metabolic needs. During embryonic and post-natal development, nerves gain size and volume, due to myelination and production of the connective tissues. We hypothesized that this leads to increased blood vessel density, mainly based on potential formation of hypoxic zones inside the nerve during nerve growth driving angiogenesis. Interestingly, we found the opposite: the vascular tree stabilizes, angiogenesis is stopped, or remains very low, and as a consequence INV density decreases during post-natal development. This suggests that nerves reach their optimal blood vessel density around P10 similarly to the CNS in which angiogenesis continues until P10 in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Harb et al., 2013</xref>). At P5, there is still angiogenesis ongoing but at a much lower rate. Thus, myelination rate is faster than vascularization, leading to vascular density decrease and stabilization around P10, when both processes seem to end.</p><p>Even though SC and blood vessels are significant players in peripheral neuropathies pathogenesis and nerve repair mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cattin et al., 2015</xref>), no studies were available regarding their relationship during physiological development. In the developing PNS, the vascularization needs to be tightly controlled and we have shown that SC have a central role. To our knowledge, we here provide the first evidence that myelinating SC control the vascularization of the sciatic nerve during development. As the major phenomenon of the post-natal development of the PNS is myelination and that concomitantly the INV density is decreasing, we hypothesized that myelinating SC may be responsible for the blocking of angiogenesis. We were able to discriminate specific role of SC and myelination by genetically ablating either SC or myelin production. In both cases, we found that this ablation led to a hypervascularized nerve. Nevertheless, we observed that SC death provokes a more disrupted and immature INV, as compared to the phenotype of sciatic nerves only lacking myelin sheaths. Mukouyama and colleagues have shown that SC are required for arterial differentiation in the skin of mouse embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mukouyama et al., 2002</xref>). This suggests that SC bodies provide physical and/or chemical cues that control blood vessel maturation. This is also what we observe as blood vessels of the INV failed to express ‘barrier proteins’ such as claudin-5 when myelin production was inhibited. Another study has suggested that SC-conditioned medium inhibits endothelial cell proliferation and migration in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Huang et al., 2000</xref>), whereas another found that SC stimulates endothelial cell migration in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ramos et al., 2015</xref>). Since inhibition of myelination alone and total ablation of myelinating SC both led to hypervascularized sciatic nerves, this suggest that in vivo, SC may have in fact an anti-angiogenic effect on endothelial cells during post-natal development possibly by producing anti-angiogenic molecules. We cannot exclude the possibility that the hypervascularized sciatic nerve phenotype is due to an over-proliferation of promyelinating SC in <italic>Krox20<sup>Cre/Fl</sup></italic> mice. Yet, when SC are ablated in <italic>Wnt1-Cre;Krox20<sup>GFP(DT)/+</sup></italic> mice, INV at birth is also already more dense, suggesting that promyelinating SC could have an anti-angiogenic role. Thus, our results are in favor of a permissive environment provided by unmyelinating SC rather than a pro-angiogenic effect of over-numerous and proliferative SC. Despite the fact that <italic>Krox20<sup>Cre/Fl</sup></italic> mutants exhibit the same axon density, the possibility that axons induce angiogenesis to cope with lack of trophic support has to be considered. Nevertheless, during development, SCP (present around E13) and iSC (from E15 to P0) provide trophic support for neurons allowing their survival and normal nerve fasciculation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fledrich et al., 2019</xref>). In <italic>Krox20<sup>Cre/Fl</sup></italic> mutant mice, those cells are present (SC blocked in immature stage and unmyelinating SC which do not express Krox20) and are expected to support the metabolic demand of axons, as normal axonal density was found (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Decker et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>Moreover, compact myelin sheaths are dense structures, composed of lipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Salzer, 2015</xref>), and could have biophysical properties not favorable or less permissive to the migration and propagation of blood vessels. This environment could also block the diffusion of pro-angiogenic factors produced by other cells in the nerve such as vascular endothelial growth factor expressed by neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Li et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Altogether, our data demonstrate that different stages of SC development orchestrate the INV formation: around E16 when the immature SC proliferate, INV starts to develop. Between P0 and P10, when myelination is happening, INV density decreases but maturation occurs. This anti-angiogenic effect of the glial cells appears to be the opposite in the CNS. Interestingly, it has been shown that, oligodendrocytes promote angiogenesis and endothelial cell proliferation in the white matter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Yuen et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Another question raised by our findings is do SC and myelin have a role in the maintenance of the INV? Since <italic>Wnt1-Cre;Krox20<sup>GFP(DT)/+</sup></italic> and <italic>Krox20<sup>Cre/Fl</sup></italic> mice die soon after birth (around P5 and P20, respectively), we could not study further in time the role of SC and myelin regarding the maintenance of the INV. To gain insights into this and to know if myelin is not only necessary for INV onset, but also for its maintenance, futures studies could be done in mice models of demyelination at adult stage using PLPCre-ERT2; Krox20<sup>Fl/Fl</sup> animals. This could also provide useful information on the role of INV in degenerative diseases in which myelin is targeted, as INV maintenance could perhaps delay disease progression by maintaining nerve homeostasis.</p><p>Guidance molecules controlling angiogenesis in different systems during embryogenesis are reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Michaelis, 2014</xref>) but the molecular control of INV formation is not well known. We chose to focus on Netrin-1, a protein known to play a role in migration of different cell types, including endothelial cell, during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bradford et al., 2009</xref>). The role of Netrin-1 regarding angiogenesis remains controversial, and seems to be dual, as it is in axon guidance, depending on the receptor it binds to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Yang et al., 2007</xref>. It has been shown that Netrin-1 stimulates angiogenesis in vitro and also in vivo, in the retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Park et al., 2004</xref>). In the developing sciatic nerve, Netrin-1 is expressed by the epi-perineurial cells with a concomitant expression of its receptor UNC5B by endothelial cells composing the INV. Despite the possible involvement of other factors, both independent loss of Netrin-1 or UNC5B function was responsible for INV formation defects, even though this was not sufficient to completely block nerve’s vascularization. Indeed, in our study, Netrin-1 hypomorph provokes hypovascularized sciatic nerves at E17.5 and the blocking of UNC5B receptors at P0 leads also to a less vascularized sciatic nerve. This point out that the molecular couple Netrin-1/UNC5B is involved in INV establishment.</p><p>Since the formation of INV is finely regulated, molecularly and cellularly, by actors we have identified, the data presented here suggest a novel role for Netrin-1 and SC during the coordinated wiring of the nervous and vascular systems. Our study opens the exciting possibility that INV and SC/myelin could be linked not only during development but also during peripheral nerve diseases progression. Thus, INV implication in demyelinating diseases should not be overlooked.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource"

The supernatants obtained after centrifugation (14,000 rpm for 15 min at 4°C) were used as samples. The extracted proteins were assayed with the Bio-Rad kit (Hercules, CA) by spectrophotometry using BSA as a standard. Equal quantities of proteins (15 μg) were denatured by heating in Laemmli buffer containing β-mercaptoethanol, then separated in a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The proteins were then transferred to a Hybond-C nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Biosciences). The non-specific binding sites of the membrane were blocked in Tris buffer containing 0.4% Tween (TBS-T) supplemented with 5% milk powder, for 3 hr at room temperature. The membrane was then incubated in TBS-T supplemented with 1% milk powder, mixed with rabbit polyclonal antibodies to Krox20 (1/2000, Covance, Berkeley, CA) overnight at 4°C. After washing, it was incubated with an anti-rabbit antibody conjugated with HRP peroxidase (1/5000) (Amersham Biosciences), for 1 hr at room temperature. Actin was labelled with mouse monoclonal anti-β-actin primary antibodies (1/5000) followed by HRP-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibodies (1/5000).

Using mouse genetic models, the authors find that Schwann Cells (SCs) regulate vascularization of the sciatic nerve and are required for a decrease in vascular density postnatally. They initially use immunofluorescence to describe the timeline of INV development and then test the relationship between nerve vascularisation and myelination by examining INV development following Schwann cell ablation. In addition, the authors show that in Netrin1 mutant mice, peripheral nerve vascularisation is reduced, suggesting Netrin1 as a molecular regulator of this process.</p><p>Overall, the reviewers find this work interesting and novel. While they agree that the technical level of the work is adequate and the manuscript is well written, they also feel that some of the data appear a bit preliminary and that more detailed and deeper analyses would allow a firmer interpretation of many of the experiments.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed these issues with each other after submitting their reviews, and they agreed that the following points will be essential in order for the manuscript to be considered for publication:</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. The effects of the Krox20 knockout in Schwann cells: In order to better describe the role of SCs in sciatic nerve vascularization, it would be important to understand whether deletion of Krox20 in promyelinating Schwan cells does not alter any other property in the nerve beside the lack of myelination. As the authors show, Krox20 mutant Schwann cell precursors are highly proliferative and remain undifferentiated. Could the effects on INV be caused by a signal originating from these abnormal cells, rather than by the absence of myelin per se? By ascribing most of the phenotype to the absence of myelin in Krox20, the authors might be over-interpreting their data. Similarly, as SCs are known to provide metabolic support to axons, the possibility exists that when this support is not provided, axons respond by inducing angiogenesis to cope with their metabolic demand.</p><p>2. The role of Netrin1: It would be important to understand which cells express netrin-1, what is the source of Netrin-1 that regulates vascularization (neurons, Schwann cells, pericytes?) and whether netrin-1 acts directly on endothelial cells? In addition, any extra data the authors can show or discuss on the netrin receptors expressed by endothelial cells in the growing vessels, would be very interesting for this paper.</p><p>3. The authors should rule out involvement of Netrin1 in the development of peripheral nerves.</p><p>4. Additional markers need to be analyzed for the different cell types assessed. For example, endothelial cells are only identified using CD31, despite many other markers being available.</p><p>5. Quantifications need to be provided for all experiments. Additionally, the authors should provide clear description of the number of animals analysed in each experiment. For some experiments, it is not clear whether the n is the number of limbs or individual animals. For other experiments, the number of animals in which the observations are made is not reported at all (Figure 1 etc). Also, additional controls/normalisations regarding the size of the nerves are necessary. The nerve looks smaller in Krox20 mutants…</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Myelinating Schwann cells and Netrin-1 control intra-nervous vascularization of the developing mouse sciatic nerve&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Anna Akhmanova (Senior Editor), Karina Yaniv as Reviewing Editor and the original reviewers.</p><p>While the reviewers agree that some of their concerns have been satisfactorily solved, there are remaining issues that need to be addressed in order for the manuscript to be considered for publication. The reviewers feel that the potential of this study is not fully developed with many opportunities and controls missed. The reviewers emphasize that they do not expect the authors to severely expand the scope of the study, but rather to be as thorough as expected. In light of their comments, addition of the experimental data requested below, will be absolutely essential for further consideration of this manuscript.</p><p>1. In general, the reviewers find the provided quantifications and its statistical power to be convincing. A remaining concern in this regard relates to the size measurements of the sciatic nerve. For instance, the sciatic nerve in Figure 6 and its S1 is very different between mutant and controls in terms of its branching pattern, thickness etc. This rises some doubts about whether the measurement are done consistently in all animals. The authors need to provide additional information and examples on how the nerve size was measured.</p><p>2. An additional major problem is that some of the reviewers' concerns have been addressed through the rebuttal letter without any significant or explicit edits in the manuscript. For example, the comment #1 about the specificity of the effects of the Krox20 mutation on myelination gets 5 paragraphs and many references in the rebuttal letter, but only a Results section mention that the sciatic nerves &quot;from Krox20 Cre/Flmice are devoid of myelin&quot; (line 218). Generally, in the rebuttal, the authors use unpublished observations, and references to on-line databases but these are not validated. This should be fully amended in the revised version.</p><p>3. The identity of netrin1 expressing cells is not convincing and needs further work. The authors added a new result, showing that at E17 (onset of vascularization) the netrin1 signal appears close to the developing vasculature, as opposed to E16.5, where netrin signal is dispersed (supp. Figure 6A, B). They suggest that at P1 Netrin1 is expressed by the epineurial and perineurial cells and proliferating fibroblast like cells, based on a recent scRNA-seq analysis from Gerber et al., 2021. However, the authors didn't provide any validation to this using relevant markers to show the co-expression with these cells. The qPCR quantification of netrin1 receptor expression also falls short of a developmental paper. What is missing is a demonstration of mRNA expression by in situ, for example using RNAscope.</p><p>4. The authors did a good job demonstrating the development of the sciatic nerve vascularization and that the elimination of the Schwann cells/myelination disrupts the regulation of the angiogenesis, however, it is still not clear whether this is a direct effect, or secondary effect due to affected neurons. Netrin1 is required for the normal development of peripheral nerves. Poliak et al. (PMID: 26633881) show this explicitly. Netrin1 mutation (same one as used here) affects the guidance of motor axons within peripheral nerves, including the sciatic nerve. The authors should extend the analysis to additional nerves (e.g., the diaphragm, which is a classic peripheral nerve, or purely sensory/cutaneous nerves) to convincingly argue that the phenotypes are generalizable to different peripheral nerves, as previously suggested by the reviewers.</p><p>5. The expression of the suggested Netrin1 receptors (unc5b) by the endothelial cells of the sciatic nerve – the data provided by the authors are not sufficient to suggest that Netrin1 regulates angiogenesis through this receptor. Although this might require the analysis of another transgenic line, or perhaps isolation and culture of ECs from sciatic nerves, this part would be a clear prove of the direct role of Netrin1 in the sciatic vasculature.</p><p>6. Throughout Figure 1 the authors use the &quot;tip cell&quot; term to refer to angiogenic sprouts. However, endothelial tip cells are characterized by the presence of specific markers that the authors do not provide in their characterization. Hence the definition and corresponding quantification should be changed to either &quot;branching points&quot;, &quot;end points&quot; or angiogenic sprouts. All these are standardized measurements offered by different image processing tools.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.64773.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1.

In this original paper characterizing and describing the phenotype of <italic>Krox20<sup>cre/Fl</sup></italic> mutant mice, the authors showed, using electron microscopy, a complete absence of the myelin sheath, despite a normal axonal density (89 ± 2 and 88 ± 7 axonal fibers per 100 μm2 in wild-type and <italic>Krox20<sup>Cre/flox</sup></italic> mice, respectively) in the postnatal sciatic nerve (P28) (Decker et al. 2006).</p><p>In the sciatic nerve, transcription of <italic>Krox20</italic> gene is activated at E15 but the protein is detectable shortly after birth (see Figure 5-figure supplement 1). Consistent with these results, general organization of the mutant sciatic nerve, including proportion of iSC are not affected between E15.5 and E18.5. Finally, there is no significant differences from microarray comparison of <italic>Krox20<sup>Cre/flox</sup></italic> mutant versus control nerves at E18.5 (unpublished data from P.Topilko). In conclusion, development of the sciatic nerve of <italic>Krox20<sup>Cre/flox</sup></italic> mice is unaffected until birth (whereas the INV onset is at E16,5) and thus early angiogenesis effects leading to INV formation should not be affected in the mutant.</p><p>After birth, SC progressively stop dividing to initiate myelination process. In <italic>Krox20<sup>Cre/flox</sup></italic> mice, the lack of myelin is intimately correlated with hyper proliferation of SC in order to cover all axons. To our knowledge, there is no mutant where myelination is affected while SC number remains unchanged. Thus, to not over-interpret the data in our study, we added a short paragraph in the discussion addressing possibility that the hypervascularization phenotype of the mutant sciatic nerve might be due to an over proliferation of promyelinating SC. Yet, genetic SC ablation in <italic>Wnt1-</italic>cre;<italic>Krox20</italic><sup>GFP(DT)/+</sup> mice promote increased INV density at birth, suggesting that promyelinating SC could have an anti-angiogenic role. Moreover, INV density decreases during post-natal stages, while myelin is progressively produced (showed in figure 3) and this observation also supports the hypothesis that myelinated SC negatively control angiogenesis. Thus, our results are in favor of unmyelinated SC providing a permissive environment to endothelial cells to vascularize the nerve tissue rather than a pro-angiogenic effect of over numerous and proliferative SC.</p><p>Despite the fact that postnatal mutants exhibit the same axon density, the possibility that axons induce angiogenesis to cope with lack of trophic support was raised. Nevertheless, we know that during development, Schwann cell precursors (SCP) (present around E13) and immature SC (from E15 to P0) provide trophic support for neurons allowing their survival and normal nerve fasciculation (Fledrich et al. 2019). In <italic>Krox20<sup>cre/Fl</sup></italic> mutant mice, those cells are present (SC blocked in immature stage and unmyelinating SC which do not express Krox20) and should support the metabolic demand of axons (as normal axonal density was found (Decker et al. 2006)).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The role of Netrin1: It would be important to understand which cells express netrin-1, what is the source of Netrin-1 that regulates vascularization (neurons, Schwann cells, pericytes?) and whether netrin-1 acts directly on endothelial cells? In addition, any extra data the authors can show or discuss on the netrin receptors expressed by endothelial cells in the growing vessels, would be very interesting for this paper.</p></disp-quote><p>As Netrin-1 is a secreted protein, we first tried to label it directly by immunofluorescent staining but it did not give satisfying results (and protein secretion makes it difficult to accurately identify producing cells). Thus, we chose to use an anti-β-galactosidase antibody to indirectly visualize Netrin-1 expression and sources in Ntn1<sup>LacZ/+</sup> reporter mice. At E16, before INV onset, we found no β-galactosidase expression near the sciatic nerve (figure 6 S1 A). At E17,5, when the INV onset has started, β-galactosidase seems to be expressed by the nerve and particularly at the periphery, at the level of the epinerve/perinerve (figure 6 S1 B). Furthermore, in a recent paper, Gerber and colleagues have published the single cell RNA sequencing analysis of the different cell types constituting sciatic nerves, during perinatal development (Gerber et al. 2021). According to the atlas on this study (https://snat.ethz.ch/), <italic>Ntn1</italic> is in fact expressed at P1 by epineurial and perineurial cells and proliferating fibroblast like cells. This data corroborates our results as this cell type profile fits the in situ 3D observation we made (figure 6 S1 B).</p><p>Concerning the presence and/or the identification of Netrin-1 receptors, we purified endothelial cells from sciatic nerves at P2 using magnetic CD31- beads and performed RNA extraction followed by qPCR. We found that <italic>unc5b</italic> is highly expressed by endothelial cells, whereas <italic>neogenin1</italic> is weakly expressed and <italic>dcc</italic> is not expressed (figure 6B). This result is supported by the data of the published atlas: <italic>dcc</italic> is not expressed by endothelial cells of sciatic nerve at P1, <italic>neogenin1</italic> weakly expressed and <italic>unc5b</italic> highly expressed (Gerber et al. 2021).</p><p>Altogether, those data support the hypothesis of a direct effect of Netrin1 on sciatic nerve endothelial cells, as both the ligand and receptors are present at the right time and place to allow a direct angiogenic response.</p><p>Those data were included and discussed in the main text page 12 (Netrin1 localization and Netrin1 receptors expression).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The authors should rule out involvement of Netrin1 in the development of peripheral nerves.</p></disp-quote><p>In order to only study the role of Netrin-1 regarding the INV development, we chose to use the <italic>Ntn1<sup>LacZ</sup></italic> hypomorph model rather than a complete null. Indeed, in the <italic>Ntn1<sup>LacZ</sup></italic> hypomorph, some of the wild-type transcripts are present, presumably by splicing over the inserted sequences, resulting in milder developmental defects (Serafini et al. 1996). In fact, whereas Ntn1 null animals commissural axons rarely cross the midline, resulting in strong phenotype defects at late embryonic stages, Ntn1 hypomorphs retain many axons with normal trajectories. Thus, low levels of Ntn1 can account for persistent attraction to the midline in hypomorphs (Yung, Nishitani, and Goodrich 2015).</p><p>In <italic>Ntn1<sup>LacZ/LacZ</sup></italic> embryos at E10.5, lack of strong ventral attraction by netrin 1/Dcc signalling could enable CNS-derived interneurons to grow towards weaker attractive signals in the periphery, leading to CNS exit. But at older age (E12,5), centrally located neurons project axons into the periphery of <italic>Ntn1<sup>LacZ/LacZ</sup></italic> embryos and no significant over numerous spinal interneuronal axons was found in the dorsal root ganglia or at a different axial level (Laumonnerie et al. 2014).</p><p>In addition, the majority of published papers are about the role of Netrin-1 signaling in peripheral nerve regeneration (Dun and Parkinson 2017). In fact, only few data concerning the role of the axonal cue Netrin-1 in the development of peripheral nerves during late embryogenesis are available in the literature, but suggesting a minor impact of Netrin-1 (Bin et al. 2015; Laumonnerie et al. 2014).</p><p>Nevertheless, to rule out a potential involvement of Netrin-1 specifically during sciatic nerve development and at the onset of vascularization, we quantified and compared the sciatic nerve diameter at E16 of <italic>Ntn1<sup>LacZ/LacZ</sup></italic> and <italic>Ntn1<sup>+/+</sup></italic> control embryos. We found no difference between the two groups (figure 6 S1 C) indicating that Netrin-1 does not affect nerve formation in the <italic>Ntn1<sup>LacZ/LacZ</sup></italic> mutant. This could be due to either (1) Netrin-1 not being involved in sciatic nerve formation or (2) implicated at early guidance steps, but already compensated by other molecular cues guiding pioneer axons allowing migration and fasciculation of other axons to form primitive nerve properly in <italic>Ntn1<sup>LacZ/LacZ</sup> embryos</italic>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Additional markers need to be analyzed for the different cell types assessed. For example, endothelial cells are only identified using CD31, despite many other markers being available.</p></disp-quote><p>In our study, we aim to describe and quantify intra-nervous vasculature during development. So we had to choose the best marker to homogeneously stain blood vessels at all stages and in the mutant mice. Indeed, one of the main goals of our study was to be able to compare each stage and samples with quantification of exact same parameters. We also wanted to compare the spatio-temporal organization of INV that require identical markers. In order to do so, we chose CD31 as it is the most specific marker of endothelial cells, and it is expressed constitutively on the surface of these cells at all stages throughout the development. It was also the optimized marker to reconstruct in 3D and accurately quantify the vascular network and to visualize endothelial tip cells. Moreover, this marker is classically used in studies of the nerve’s vascular system. Thus, this choice allows a robust comparison with existing data from the literature.</p><p>In addition, we aimed to visualize SMA, NG2 and Cx40 to describe the maturation steps of the INV (arterial differentiation and mural cell recruitment), as it was not known (Figure 2). In the scope of another study, it would be interesting to study further the molecular identity of endothelial cells at specific stages or their potential heterogeneity. Again, our point here was not to extensively describe the INV molecular identity but rather its development (and maturation) and the cells/molecular cues involved in this phenomenon.</p><p>As for the SC, we used Sox10 as all SC expresses it at all stages, so it was convenient to mark SC in both the mutant and control mice. No additional markers were required because those mice were already described.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Quantifications need to be provided for all experiments. Additionally, the authors should provide clear description of the number of animals analysed in each experiment. For some experiments, it is not clear whether the n is the number of limbs or individual animals. For other experiments, the number of animals in which the observations are made is not reported at all (Figure 1 etc). Also, additional controls/normalisations regarding the size of the nerves are necessary. The nerve looks smaller in Krox20 mutants…</p></disp-quote><p>We fully agree with the reviewers that more quantitative data were needed, thus we added new quantifications in all figures (except Figure 3 with already quantified data) and we modified the text accordingly. We also added information regarding the number of animals in each figure legends. Unless otherwise stated, one sciatic nerve per animal is used for quantification.</p><p>The nerve size was used to normalize the INV in our manuscript as this is generally the case to describe and compare vascularization of organs (as vascularization rate is directly comparable without size/developmental consideration in the literature). To quantify the nerve size, an axonal staining (neurofilament or Tuj-1) was used and with fiji or imaris, we did a Z projection and delineated the nerve to obtain a surface in μm<sup>2</sup>.</p><p>For the quantification of the INV, when the nerve size was not different, no additional controls/normalizations were needed. However, when the nerve size was different, we considered the “vascular rate” (blood vessel length over nerve area) as a pertinent data to compare the level of vascularization. This for 3 reasons: (1) We believe it makes more sense physiologically to talk about the “vascular rate” to better appreciate the level of vascularization of a tissue. (2) This method is often used in the literature. (3) We searched for other methods but other parameters, notably the diameter, can vary more than the size. In particular, in <italic>Wnt1-</italic>cre;<italic>Krox20</italic><sup>GFP(DT)/+</sup> mice, the nerve is indeed smaller at P5 as compared to the control, that is why we normalized the blood vessel length and number of branch points with the nerve area to obtain the vascular rate. Additionally, we also analyzed those mice at P0, when the nerve size is the same (Figure 4 S2).</p><p>References</p><p>Bin, Jenea M., Dong Han, Karen Lai Wing Sun, Louis Philippe Croteau, Emilie Dumontier, Jean Francois Cloutier, Artur Kania, and Timothy E.

The reviewers feel that the potential of this study is not fully developed with many opportunities and controls missed. The reviewers emphasize that they do not expect the authors to severely expand the scope of the study, but rather to be as thorough as expected. In light of their comments, addition of the experimental data requested below, will be absolutely essential for further consideration of this manuscript.</p><p>1. In general, the reviewers find the provided quantifications and its statistical power to be convincing. A remaining concern in this regard relates to the size measurements of the sciatic nerve. For instance, the sciatic nerve in Figure 6 and its S1 is very different between mutant and controls in terms of its branching pattern, thickness etc. This rises some doubts about whether the measurement are done consistently in all animals. The authors need to provide additional information and examples on how the nerve size was measured.</p></disp-quote><p>We are grateful to the reviewers to raise this issue. Indeed, in this study we analyzed either dissected sciatic nerves or cleared limbs at different developmental stages. Methodology was adapted depending on stage to be as accurate as possible. From cleared limbs, the same portion of the sciatic nerve, from the node formed by the 3 branches coming from the DRG to the first distal branches was always used for the 3D reconstruction (Figure 6- Figure supp 2 A). In Figure 6 and its S1, we did not analyze the same parameter: at E17,5, when the sciatic nerve is vascularized, we quantified the nerve area and found no significant difference; whereas at E16 (not vascularized) the nerve morphology is different and more branched.</p><p>We concluded that measuring the nerve average diameter (reflecting the thickness) was more accurate, and would take into account potential differences between the mutant and control in term of branching and fasciculation. In addition, we added a figure describing how the nerve area was measured (Figure 7) and a corresponding paragraph (<bold>‘</bold>Quantification of the nerve area’) in the MandM section that give precise information for all figures regarding the method used.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. An additional major problem is that some of the reviewers' concerns have been addressed through the rebuttal letter without any significant or explicit edits in the manuscript. For example, the comment #1 about the specificity of the effects of the Krox20 mutation on myelination gets 5 paragraphs and many references in the rebuttal letter, but only a Results section mention that the sciatic nerves &quot;from Krox20 Cre/Flmice are devoid of myelin&quot; (line 218). Generally, in the rebuttal, the authors use unpublished observations, and references to on-line databases but these are not validated. This should be fully amended in the revised version.</p></disp-quote><p>We fully agree and we introduced modifications in the revised version of the manuscript according to the reviewer’s comments. In particular, argumentations concerning the major point 1 in the first rebuttal letter can now be found in the manuscript, in results and discussion (pages 10 and 17). References to online databases have also been now validated by RNAscope and immunostaining data (Figure 6).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The identity of netrin1 expressing cells is not convincing and needs further work. The authors added a new result, showing that at E17 (onset of vascularization) the netrin1 signal appears close to the developing vasculature, as opposed to E16.5, where netrin signal is dispersed (supp. Figure 6A, B). They suggest that at P1 Netrin1 is expressed by the epineurial and perineurial cells and proliferating fibroblast like cells, based on a recent scRNA-seq analysis from Gerber et al., 2021. However, the authors didn't provide any validation to this using relevant markers to show the co-expression with these cells. The qPCR quantification of netrin1 receptor expression also falls short of a developmental paper. What is missing is a demonstration of mRNA expression by in situ, for example using RNAscope.</p></disp-quote><p>According to the referee’s suggestions we added new data concerning the expression of Netrin-1 and UNC5B at the mRNA and protein levels. Using RNAscope and immunolabelling we confirmed the expression of UNC5B by the endothelial cells and of Netrin-1 by the fibroblasts located at the peri and epineurial layers (Figure 6B, C, C’ ,K, K’ and L).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The authors did a good job demonstrating the development of the sciatic nerve vascularization and that the elimination of the Schwann cells/myelination disrupts the regulation of the angiogenesis, however, it is still not clear whether this is a direct effect, or secondary effect due to affected neurons. Netrin1 is required for the normal development of peripheral nerves. Poliak et al. (PMID: 26633881) show this explicitly. Netrin1 mutation (same one as used here) affects the guidance of motor axons within peripheral nerves, including the sciatic nerve. The authors should extend the analysis to additional nerves (e.g., the diaphragm, which is a classic peripheral nerve, or purely sensory/cutaneous nerves) to convincingly argue that the phenotypes are generalizable to different peripheral nerves, as previously suggested by the reviewers.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment and understood that there was a concern about (1) sciatic nerve misguidance of motor neurons and (2) sensory nerves vascularization. In the article published by Poliak et al., misguidance of motor axons were observed at E11,5 and E12,5 in the ventral and dorsal (upper/lower) limb region in <italic>Ntn1<sup>Lac/LacZ</sup></italic> corresponding to the future tibial and peroneal nerves. As explained above, we analyzed (a) at later stages (E16 and E17.5) and (b) the segment of the sciatic nerve anatomically located before the division of the two dorsal and ventral branches of the motor nerves, that was not analyzed in Poliak et al. study. The guidance defects reported by Poliak et al. are aberrant and misguided motor axons along the dorsoventral axis of the limb, but this misguidance affect different sciatic nerve branches than the segment analyzed in our study that is located before those branches. Indeed, we have not identified any significant differences in sciatic nerve thickness at E16 and E17,5 between <italic>Ntn1<sup>+/+</sup></italic> and <italic>Ntn1<sup>Lac/LacZ</sup></italic> (Figure 6 D and H, and supplement figure 6 D) in the segment analyzed.</p><p>To address the question about the role of Netrin on vascularization of other, mixed or purely sensory nerves we analyzed 3 other nerve types: phrenic nerve, and intercostal (mixed motor/sensory), cutaneous and sural (purely sensory branch of the sciatic nerve). None of those nerves appears vascularized in peri-natal stages (E17,5-P2) (Figure 6- Figure supp 2). Thus, as those nerves are very thin at peri-natal stages and mostly unmyelinated or poorly myelinated in the adult, the timing of vascularization may be delayed making it impossible to study the vascular phenotype in the <italic>Ntn1<sup>Lac/LacZ</sup></italic> model (because they die before birth). Furthermore, as for the cutaneous and sural nerves, if vascularized, the vascularization of those nerves will be more peri nervous and therefore different from what is observed in the sciatic nerve. In fact, in the adult mouse, the sural nerve, aligned with a vein, is reported to have just a small amount of micro vessels, “often on the nerve’s surface as nerve diameters approach the typical diffusion lengths for molecular oxygen” (Dudele, Rasmussen, and Østergaard 2020).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. The expression of the suggested Netrin1 receptors (unc5b) by the endothelial cells of the sciatic nerve – the data provided by the authors are not sufficient to suggest that Netrin1 regulates angiogenesis through this receptor. Although this might require the analysis of another transgenic line, or perhaps isolation and culture of ECs from sciatic nerves, this part would be a clear prove of the direct role of Netrin1 in the sciatic vasculature.</p></disp-quote><p>To tackle this issue, we chose to perform in vivo inactivation of UNC5B using blocking antibodies to explore its role in the sciatic nerve vasculature. We chose to inactivate UNC5B at P0, a stage when angiogenesis is still ongoing as attested by the presence of angiogenic sprouts (Figure 1M) and UNC5B and Netrin1 are expressed by INV endothelial cells and epi/perineurial cells respectively (Figure 6 A-C’; K-L). We added new data showing that injections of a UNC5B blocking antibody to WT pups at P0 is sufficient to significantly reduce the density of blood vessels inside sciatic nerve (Figure 6M), phenocopying the observations made in <italic>Ntn1<sup>Lac/LacZ</sup></italic>. Altogether those data support the hypothesis that Netrin1 regulates angiogenesis through UNC5Breceptor<italic>.</italic></p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. Throughout Figure 1 the authors use the &quot;tip cell&quot; term to refer to angiogenic sprouts. However, endothelial tip cells are characterized by the presence of specific markers that the authors do not provide in their characterization. Hence the definition and corresponding quantification should be changed to either &quot;branching points&quot;, &quot;end points&quot; or angiogenic sprouts. All these are standardized measurements offered by different image processing tools.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers, and we changed the “tip cell” term to “angiogenic sprout”.</p><p>Dudele, Anete, Peter Mondrup Rasmussen, and Leif Østergaard. 2020. “Sural Nerve Perfusion in Mice.” <italic>Frontiers in Neuroscience</italic> 14(December):1–12.</p></body></sub-article></article>
