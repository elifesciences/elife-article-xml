This altered poly(A) pattern is extremely similar to that observed in cells containing Pol II derivatives with slow elongation rates. Conversely, cells containing derivatives with fast elongation rates show a subtle downstream shift in poly(A) sites. Polyadenylation patterns of many genes are sensitive to both fast and slow elongation rates, and a global shift of poly(A) utilization is strongly linked to increased purine content of sequences flanking poly(A) sites. Pol II processivity is impaired in diauxic cells, but strains with reduced processivity and normal Pol II elongation rates have normal polyadenylation profiles. Thus, Pol II elongation speed is important for poly(A) site selection and for regulating poly(A) patterns in response to environmental conditions.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>polyadenylation</kwd><kwd>transcription elongation</kwd><kwd>RNA polymerase II</kwd><kwd>gene expression</kwd><kwd>gene regulation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM 30186</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Geisberg</surname><given-names>Joseph V</given-names></name><name><surname>Moqtaderi</surname><given-names>Zarmik</given-names></name><name><surname>Struhl</surname><given-names>Kevin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM 131801</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Geisberg</surname><given-names>Joseph V</given-names></name><name><surname>Moqtaderi</surname><given-names>Zarmik</given-names></name><name><surname>Struhl</surname><given-names>Kevin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The elongation rate of RNA polymerase II broadly affects the profile of poly(A) sites, and hence 3' mRNA isoforms, and it can mediate alternative polyadenylation in response to environmental conditions.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In eukaryotes, transcription by RNA polymerase II (Pol II) and subsequent RNA processing steps give rise to numerous same-gene mRNA isoforms. These isoforms can exhibit substantial differences in sequence due to alternative splicing, differential 5’ and/or 3’ end utilization, and other co- and post-transcriptional processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Geisberg et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Berkovits and Mayr, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Floor and Doudna, 2016</xref>). This broad mRNA isoform repertoire is important for proper cellular regulation of protein isoform composition, synthesis rate, and localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mayr, 2016</xref>).</p><p>Alternative cleavage/polyadenylation in 3’ untranslated regions (3’UTRs) is an important mechanism for generating same-gene mRNA isoforms. Most eukaryotic mRNAs are cleaved and polyadenylated at multiple locations within 3’UTRs to generate same-gene isoforms that can be separated by as little as a single nt or by as much as several kb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ozsolak et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sherstnev et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Moqtaderi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pelechano et al., 2013</xref>). In <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and related yeast species, a typical gene possesses ~60 mRNA 3’ isoforms, the vast majority of which are found within the first ~300 nt of the 3’UTR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Moqtaderi et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>3’UTR regions contain binding sites for proteins and (in many eukaryotes) microRNAs that affect the function of the bound mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bartel, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baltz et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Freeberg et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, same-gene isoforms that contain or lack particular 3’UTR sequences can differ in their protein and microRNA binding sites, leading to differences in translation efficiency, intracellular localization, and mRNA stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mayr, 2016</xref>). In yeast, same-gene 3’ mRNA isoforms, even those that differ by 1–3 nt, can possess different half-lives, in vivo structures (based on DMS profiling), and poly(A)-binding protein (Pab1) binding levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Moqtaderi et al., 2018</xref>). Sequences responsible for isoform-specific structures, differential Pab1 binding, and mRNA stability are evolutionarily conserved, indicating biological function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Moqtaderi et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Alternative polyadenylation is regulated on a transcriptome scale by environmental or developmental conditions. For example, cancer cells and pluripotent stem cells preferentially express shorter 3’ mRNA isoforms, whereas differentiated cells preferentially express longer 3’ mRNA isoforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mayr and Bartel, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Weill et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Elkon et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Li and Lu, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tian and Manley, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Masamha et al., 2014</xref>). The mechanism by which thousands of genes undergo regulated polyadenylation is poorly understood but is thought to involve mis-regulation of cleavage/polyadenylation factors. Upregulation of CSTF64, FIP1, NUDT21, and PCF11 favors more proximal isoforms, while numerous factors, including CFI25/NUDT21, CPSF6, CFI68, and ELAVL2/3, enhance the usage of more distal poly(A) sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ogorodnikov et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kamieniarz-Gdula et al., 2019</xref>). In yeast, alternative polyadenylation in response to environmental conditions has been observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sparks et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sparks and Dieckmann, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Graber et al., 2013</xref>). Pcf11 and the CPF complex are important contributors to cleavage/polyadenylation site selection, as their inactivation or down-regulation causes a downstream shift in poly(A) sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Graber et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Liu et al., 2017b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gruber and Zavolan, 2019</xref>). In addition, numerous other RNA binding proteins can affect the distribution of 3’ mRNA isoforms in vivo in a more limited fashion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tian and Manley, 2017</xref>).</p><p>Transcriptional elongation is mechanistically linked to post-transcriptional processes such as splicing, polyadenylation, nuclear export, and histone modification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lei et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Strässer et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Krogan et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ng et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bentley, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wallace and Beggs, 2017</xref>). In yeast cells, Pol II derivatives with slow elongation rates have defects in processivity, the ability of Pol II to travel completely down the gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mason and Struhl, 2005</xref>). Similarly, mammalian cells harboring a Pol II derivative with a slow elongation rate exhibit reduced Pol II density in 3’ UTRs, whereas cells with a fast Pol II mutant show increased Pol II at more distal sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fong et al., 2015</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, a slow Pol II mutant affects poly(A) site selection in 3–5% of genes, with an equal number showing increased upstream or downstream utilization of poly(A) sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Liu et al., 2017a</xref>). Pol II elongation rates of individual mammalian genes can vary by more than an order of magnitude and are conserved across cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Veloso et al., 2014</xref>). Kinetic competition between elongating Pol II and the Xrn2 exonuclease, which degrades mRNA after cleavage in the 3’ UTR, affects transcriptional termination a few hundred nucleotides downstream (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kim et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fong et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baejen et al., 2017</xref>). Similar competition between elongating Pol II and the cleavage/polyadenylation machinery might also affect the choice of poly(A) sites.</p><p>Here we show that cells undergoing the diauxic shift, a metabolic shift preceding stationary phase, exhibit a transcriptome-wide 3’ upstream shift in poly(A) site use, leading to shorter 3’ mRNA isoforms. This upstream shift is strikingly mimicked in strains harboring Pol II derivatives with reduced elongation rates. Conversely, albeit to a lesser extent, strains having Pol II derivatives with increased elongation rates show a downstream shift in poly(A) sites. Like yeast Pol II derivatives with slow elongation rates under standard growth conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mason and Struhl, 2005</xref>), wild-type Pol II shows a processivity defect in diauxic conditions; this defect is strongly correlated with the magnitude of upstream shift. In contrast, mutant strains defective in Pol II processivity but with normal elongation rates display normal patterns of polyadenylation. Thus, Pol II speed influences alternative polyadenylation, and it likely explains the poly(A) pattern changes that occur in yeast cells undergoing the diauxic shift. We suggest that regulation of the Pol II elongation rate in response to environmental or developmental changes represents a novel mechanism to reprogram the 3’ mRNA isoform repertoire that is distinct from changes in the cleavage/polyadenylation machinery.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Poly(A) sites are shifted upstream under diauxic conditions, favoring shorter 3’ isoforms</title><p>To examine mRNA 3’ isoform distribution as a function of growth condition, we grew duplicate <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> cultures to mid-log phase in glucose-containing rich medium (YPD), galactose-containing rich medium (YPGal), nutrient-poor minimal medium (MM), and YPD containing 1M sorbitol (Sorbitol), an inducer of osmotic stress. In addition, we examined the early stages of diauxic shift, a condition in which the primary carbon source (glucose) and other metabolites are depleted, by growing the cells for 3 days in YPD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Vivier et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Galdieri et al., 2010</xref>). We used 3’ READS to map 3’ mRNA isoforms at single nucleotide resolution on a transcriptome scale (~20 million reads/sample). Biological replicates exhibit very high correlation to one another on a combined gene expression basis (R = 0.91 to &gt; 0.99; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>) as well as at the individual isoform level (R = 0.88 to &gt; 0.99; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B,C</xref>).</p><p>As expected, the total number of sequence reads within a given 3’ UTR can vary under different conditions, reflecting regulated expression of many genes under one or more conditions. However, this work focuses on poly(A) profiles, not overall expression levels, of individual yeast genes. Thus, for each gene, we define the level of the most highly expressed 3’ mRNA isoform to be 100 and use this to normalize the levels of all other isoforms of the same gene.</p><p>The span of genomic sequence encompassing all of a given gene’s poly(A) sites is termed the gene’s ‘end zone,’ and a yeast end zone may contain upwards of 60 3’ isoform endpoints (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Moqtaderi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pelechano et al., 2013</xref>) across conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). To avoid problems related to sequencing depth, we limited our analyses to genes with &gt;1000 sequencing reads. Within this subset, we generally focused on each gene’s major isoforms, which we define as being at least 5% as abundant as that gene’s most highly expressed isoform. On average, a yeast gene gives rise to eight major isoforms (representing ~30% of all 3’UTR polyadenylation sites) under a variety of growth conditions. The section of the end zone occurring between the most proximal and most distal major isoform endpoints is termed the ‘major end zone’, and the length between these boundaries is the ‘major end zone span’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). For simplicity, we will sometimes summarize the characteristics of an end zone by referring to the major end zone span and boundaries, the maximally expressed isoform endpoint, and the weighted average isoform endpoint (the arithmetic mean of all isoform endpoints in the end zone).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Poly(A) sites are shifted upstream in diauxic cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative end zone profile (histogram of isoform frequencies) with key landmarks indicated.

As elongating Pol II complexes are exceptionally stable and hence unlikely to simply dissociate, premature Pol II dissociation is likely to be an active process such as cleavage/polyadenylation followed by exonucleolytic RNA degradation, as described in the torpedo model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kim et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baejen et al., 2017</xref>). In this view, a slow Pol II would give extra time for the cleavage/polyadenylation machinery to function, leading to a 5’ bias in poly(A) sites. By analogy, Pol II derivatives with a slow elongation rate show a 5’ bias in alternative splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">de la Mata et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dujardin et al., 2014</xref>). We therefore considered whether the upstream shift of poly(A) sites under diauxic conditions might be a consequence of reduced Pol II processivity and/or slower speed.</p><p>To examine the influence of Pol II elongation rate on isoform distribution, we generated yeast strains with mutations (either H1085Q or F1086S) in the largest Pol II subunit (Rpb1) that decrease the elongation rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Braberg et al., 2013</xref>). These mutations lie within the ‘trigger loop’ region of Rpb1, a region that physically interacts with the non-templated strand and is important for ribonucleotide selection, catalysis, and Pol translocation II along the template strand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wang et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kaplan, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barnes et al., 2015</xref>). We refer to these alleles by their relative speeds with respect to wild-type Pol II: ‘slow’ (F1086S; 2.5-fold slower than wild-type) or ‘slower’ (H1085Q; 5-fold slower than wild-type) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kaplan et al., 2012</xref>). mRNA 3’ isoform profiling of these strains reveals a substantial upstream end zone shift that is nearly as dramatic as that observed in diauxic conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Globally, most end zone parameters are shifted ~10–20 nt upstream relative to those of the wild-type isogenic strain, and the averaged meta-gene end zone profile most closely resembles that of the wild-type strain in diauxic conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and C</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Furthermore, 90% of individual genes with an upstream shift in diauxic conditions also show upstream shifts in both slow-Pol II strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), an outcome that is extremely unlikely to occur by chance (p&lt;10<sup>−100</sup>).

xlink:href="http://www.python.org">www.python.org</ext-link>). After separating sequence reads from multiplexed libraries by barcode into output from individual samples, we removed adapter sequences from read ends and discarded reads with ambiguous bases and reads not starting with a T (corresponding to an A at the mRNA 3’ end, potentially from polyadenylation). We counted and deleted consecutive Ts at the beginning of each read, saving the number of initial Ts for reference by appending it to the read ID. We mapped the first 17 nt of remaining sequence for each read to the <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> genome (version Sac cer3) using Bowtie [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Langmead et al., 2009</xref>], allowing no mismatches and excluding non-unique matches. To ensure that we were working with post-transcriptionally adenylated RNA, we examined the genomic sequence immediately downstream of each mapped read, keeping only those reads for which the initial T count exceeded the number of consecutive As in the adjacent genomic sequence. Lastly, we scaled the remaining mapped reads for each replicate to a total of 25 million.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>End zone profiles, important parameters, and definitions</title><p>We assigned reads to a gene if they mapped within the 400 nt 3’ UTR window downstream of its ORF. For each sample, we tabulated mRNA 3’ isoform endpoint frequencies for all non-A positions within the first 400 nt of each 3’UTR. These isoform endpoint positions are numbered relative to the end of the associated ORF; for example, position 100 refers to the position 100 nt after the stop codon. We limited most of our analyses to the 2790 genes with ≥1000 normalized reads (combined from both biological replicates) in each of the 11 conditions/strains described in this work.</p><p>We constructed end zone profiles by setting the maximally expressed isoform (max isoform) in each gene’s 3’UTR to 100 percent and linearly scaling expression levels of all other isoforms for that gene relative to this maximal value. The overall pattern of isoform expression over the 3’UTR constitutes a gene’s end zone profile. ‘Major isoforms’ are any isoforms with expression levels equaling or exceeding 5% relative to the max isoform. The ‘major end zone’ comprises the region between the 5’-most and 3’-most major isoforms; the ‘major end zone span’ is its length. The ‘weighted average isoform endpoint’ for a gene is computed by adding up the endpoint positions (relative to the ORF end) of all reads mapping to its 3’ UTR and dividing the result by the total number of reads summed.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Percent coordinate usage analysis</title><p>For the 2790 genes analyzed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>, we first calculated the total number of all non-A positions at each of the 400 locations (+1 to +400) of the 3’ UTR. We then tabulated the total number of genes that had non-zero reads at each position within the 3’ UTR. Finally, at each location in the 3’UTR, we divided the total number of genes with non-zero reads at that location by the total number of all non-A positions at the same coordinate and multiplied the resulting fraction by 100 to obtain the percentage of genes with reads at each coordinate.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Correlations of biological replicates</title><p>We assessed the reproducibility of biological replicates in several ways. First, we compared the total expression by gene between replicates. For each gene, we obtained the total expression level by summing all reads mapping anywhere within the first 400 nt after the ORF. For each of our 11 experimental conditions/strains, we computed the Pearson correlation of total gene expression at a minimum of 5000 genes across two biological replicates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>, panel 1). Second, we compared the expression of 25,000–75,000 individual 3’ isoforms genome-wide across replicates of the same 11 conditions/strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>, panel 2), omitting isoforms with fewer than 10 reads. Third, we compared end zone profiles of individual genes between biological replicates. For this, we analyzed the 2790 genes whose combined expression in both biological replicates was ≥1000 normalized reads in all 11 conditions/strains. For each gene, we computed the Pearson R coefficient across biological replicates by correlating scaled read counts by position for the entire 400 nt 3’UTR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, panel 3). Combined 3’ READS data from both biological replicates of exponentially growing JGY2000 compare favorably to our previously published no-DMS control dataset for DREADS, a closely-related assay that captures structural information on individual mRNA 3’UTR isoforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Moqtaderi et al., 2018</xref>; data not shown).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Classification of genes by sensitivity to pol II elongation rate perturbations</title><p>For each of the slow or fast Pol II strains (JZY5, JZY6, JZY14, and JZY15), we constructed an error model to identify and classify genes whose end zone profiles are significantly shifted (either upstream or downstream) due to changes in the Pol II elongation rate. First, we computed individual percentile coordinates (10%, 25%, 50%, 75% and 90%) for all 2790 genes in each biological replicate for all the Pol II mutant strains and the exponentially growing JGY2000. These coordinates represent 3’UTR locations at which the indicated percentage of total reads occurs upstream of (and including) the calculated coordinate.</p><p>For every gene in each strain, we then subtracted the individual percentile coordinates in each biological replicate from each other to obtain raw error values at all five percentile coordinates. Individual raw error values from the four Pol II elongation rate strains were then separately averaged with the corresponding raw error values from the exponentially growing JGY2000 dataset, and the rounded absolute values of those measurements were termed either the 10<sup>th</sup>-, 25<sup>th</sup>-, 50<sup>th</sup>-, 75<sup>th</sup>-, or 90<sup>th</sup>-percentile errors. The frequency distributions of the 10<sup>th</sup>-, 25<sup>th</sup>-, 50<sup>th</sup>-, 75<sup>th</sup>-, and 90<sup>th</sup>-percentile errors for JZY4, JZY5, JZY14, and JZY15 (2790 values/percentile for each strain) were tabulated after dividing all non-zero errors by two in order to account for the fact that the error could be either positive or negative.</p><p>Using the 10<sup>th</sup> percentile parameter as an example, cumulative probabilities at each error value <italic>x</italic> were calculated by the following equation,<disp-formula id="equ1"><mml:math id="m1"><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mfenced separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>x</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced><mml:mo>=</mml:mo> <mml:mi/><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:munderover><mml:mo movablelimits="false">∑</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mi>x</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">M</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">a</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">x</mml:mi> <mml:mi/><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:munderover><mml:mrow><mml:mi>f</mml:mi><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2,790</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:math></disp-formula>where Max(<italic>x</italic>) represents the maximum observed 10<sup>th</sup>-percentile error value and <italic>f</italic>(<italic>i</italic>) is the frequency of the error <italic>i</italic> in the distribution. Therefore, the probability that an experimentally observed net shift of magnitude |<italic>k</italic>| in the 10<sup>th</sup> percentile coordinate is due to pure chance is given by <italic>P</italic>(|<italic>k</italic>|). In cases where |<italic>k</italic>| &gt; Max(<italic>x</italic>), P(|<italic>k</italic>|) was assigned the lowest non-zero probability of 3.58 × 10<sup>−4</sup>, which equals to 1/2,790.

Using JZY5 as an example (the same methodology applies to JZY6, JZY14, and JZY15), we (1) subtracted the individual percentile coordinates (see above) at every gene in each biological replicate of JZY5 from their corresponding values in the biological replicates of exponentially growing JGY2000, (2) divided the values by two and (3) rounded the difference to the nearest whole number to obtain the raw shift values. From raw shift values we then subtracted the corresponding raw error values (see above) to obtain net shift values (<italic>k</italic>). <italic>k</italic> was set to zero for all cases where the raw error value was greater than the corresponding raw shift value.</p><p>The five net shift values (per gene) represent error-subtracted measures of poly(A) position shifts at the indicated percentiles. Negative <italic>k</italic> values represent upstream shifts in poly(A) usage of JZY5 relative to exponentially-growing JGY2000. Conversely, positive <italic>k</italic> values reflect greater downstream poly(A) utilization at the indicated percentile categories in JZY5 versus the strain with the normal Pol II elongation rate (exponentially-growing JGY2000).</p><p>For each |<italic>k</italic>|, a probability <italic>P</italic>(<italic>k</italic>) was computed based on the error model (see above). A single-gene probability value <italic>P</italic>(<italic>g</italic>) was computed by multiplying all the individual <italic>P</italic>(<italic>k</italic>) probabilities at the five percentile categories by one another and then by five in order to correct for multiple hypotheses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dunn, 1961</xref>).</p><p>For each gene, we calculated two additional parameters: a cumulative net shift and the net number of positions shifted. The former parameter represents the sum of all net shifts (Σ<italic>k</italic>) at the five percentile coordinates. A positive cumulative net shift represents an overall downstream shift in JZY5 poly(A) sites, while a negative number implies a greater prevalence of shorter 3’UTR isoforms in JZY5 relative to exponentially growing JGY2000. The net number of positions shifted is a measure of the total number (as well as the direction of the shift; see below) of the five percentile coordinates that had a non-zero net shift. It was computed by assigning each of the five gene-specific percentile coordinates a value of either −1 (representing a net upstream shift, or negative <italic>k</italic> value, at that position), +1 (implying a net downstream shift, or a positive <italic>k</italic> value, at that position), or 0 (no net shift). The sum of the five values for each gene is the net number of shifted positions. A negative net number of positions shifted means that the overall shift in JZY5 poly(A) sites is more likely to be upstream, while a positive net number of positions shifted indicates a distal poly(A) shift in JZY5 relative to exponentially growing JGY2000. This parameter, along with the cumulative overall shift, is especially helpful in assigning genes to specific categories in more complex cases where some of the <italic>k</italic> values point to shifts in opposite directions.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Initial classification of poly(A) shift direction by gene</title><p>For each of the four Pol II strains (JZY5-6, JZY14-15), we first assigned the 2790 genes into one of three categories based on the comparison of each gene’s end zone profile in the Pol II mutant strain to its profile in the exponentially growing JGY2000. The three categories consisted of (1) genes whose poly(A) sites were shifted upstream in a given Pol II mutant strain relative to exponentially growing JGY2000 (‘upshifted’), (2) genes whose end zone profiles in the given mutant Pol II strain were shifted downstream relative to exponentially growing JGY2000 (‘downshifted’), and (3) genes whose end zone profiles were not classified as either upstream or downstream (‘other’). Genes were categorized as upshifted if they met the all of following criteria: (a) a negative cumulative net shift, (b) a negative net number of positions shifted and (c) a <italic>P</italic>(<italic>g</italic>) value &lt;0.01. In order to be categorized as downshifted, a gene had to possess (a) a positive cumulative net shift, (b) a positive net number of positions shifted and (c) a <italic>P</italic>(<italic>g</italic>) value &lt;0.01.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Combined classification of poly(A) shift behavior by gene across multiple strains</title><p>We classified each of the 2790 genes by combining data from the individual, strain-specific categorization (see above) into one of four groups: ‘Upstream’, ‘Downstream’, ‘Neutral’ and ‘Other’. In the combined classification, a gene was classified as Upstream if it was upshifted in both Pol II elongation rate-defective strains (JZY5 and JZY6; see above), irrespective of its behavior in the two fast Pol II strains (JZY14 and JZY15). Similarly, a gene was classified as Downstream if it was downshifted in the each of the two Pol II strains with the fast elongation rate, without regard for its behavior in the slow Pol II strains. A gene was called Neutral if it was classified as ‘other’ in all four of the Pol II elongation rate mutant strains. All genes that didn’t fit any of the criteria above (304 out of 2,790; for example, genes which were upshifted or downshifted in only one strain, etc.) were classified as Other. Finally, we noticed that a large proportion of Downstream genes were also classified as Upstream (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), and we named this sub-category (which represents the intersection of the Upstream and Downstream groups) ‘Both’.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Conservation of endpoints</title><p>Calculations of probabilities that major isoform positions in JZY5, JZY6, JZY14, JZY15 and diauxic JGY2000 overlap with those in exponentially grown JGY2000 were conducted in identical, pairwise fashion. First, for each of the 2790 genes, we identified the portion of the 3’ UTR in which meaningful polyadenylation was observed in any of our 11 strains/conditions. This ‘combined major end zone’ is the union of the gene’s major end zones in every condition tested. Its 5’ boundary is the most ORF-proximal of all major isoforms observed in any of the 11 conditions. Similarly, the 3’ boundary is the most ORF-distal of all major isoforms found in the 11 conditions/strains.</p><p>For each gene (using JZY5 as an example), the cumulative probability <italic>P</italic>(<italic>q</italic>) for major isoform overlap between JZY5 and exponentially growing JGY2000 is given by the hypergeometric distribution.<disp-formula id="equ2"><mml:math id="m2"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">I</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">F</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext></mml:mrow><mml:mi>α</mml:mi><mml:mo>≥</mml:mo><mml:mi>β</mml:mi><mml:mo>:</mml:mo><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>q</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:munderover><mml:mo>∑</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mi>c</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>β</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:munderover><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mtable columnspacing="1em" rowspacing="4pt"><mml:mtr><mml:mtd><mml:mi>β</mml:mi></mml:mtd></mml:mtr><mml:mtr><mml:mtd><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mtd></mml:mtr></mml:mtable><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mtable columnspacing="1em" rowspacing="4pt"><mml:mtr><mml:mtd><mml:mi>N</mml:mi><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mi>β</mml:mi></mml:mtd></mml:mtr><mml:mtr><mml:mtd><mml:mi>α</mml:mi><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mtd></mml:mtr></mml:mtable><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mtable columnspacing="1em" rowspacing="4pt"><mml:mtr><mml:mtd><mml:mi>N</mml:mi></mml:mtd></mml:mtr><mml:mtr><mml:mtd><mml:mi>α</mml:mi></mml:mtd></mml:mtr></mml:mtable><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac><mml:mspace width="thinmathspace"/><mml:mspace width="thinmathspace"/><mml:mspace width="thinmathspace"/><mml:mspace width="thinmathspace"/><mml:mspace width="thinmathspace"/><mml:mspace width="thinmathspace"/><mml:mspace width="thinmathspace"/><mml:mspace width="thinmathspace"/><mml:mspace width="thinmathspace"/><mml:mspace width="thinmathspace"/><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:mi>F</mml:mi><mml:mspace width="thinmathspace"/><mml:mi>β</mml:mi><mml:mo>≥</mml:mo><mml:mi>α</mml:mi><mml:mo>:</mml:mo><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>q</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:munderover><mml:mo>∑</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mi>c</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>α</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:munderover><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mtable columnspacing="1em" rowspacing="4pt"><mml:mtr><mml:mtd><mml:mi>α</mml:mi></mml:mtd></mml:mtr><mml:mtr><mml:mtd><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mtd></mml:mtr></mml:mtable><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mtable columnspacing="1em" rowspacing="4pt"><mml:mtr><mml:mtd><mml:mi>N</mml:mi><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mi>α</mml:mi></mml:mtd></mml:mtr><mml:mtr><mml:mtd><mml:mi>β</mml:mi><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mtd></mml:mtr></mml:mtable><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mtable columnspacing="1em" rowspacing="4pt"><mml:mtr><mml:mtd><mml:mi>N</mml:mi></mml:mtd></mml:mtr><mml:mtr><mml:mtd><mml:mi>β</mml:mi></mml:mtd></mml:mtr></mml:mtable><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></disp-formula>where N is the number of non-A positions in the combined major end zone, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:mi>α</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> is the number of major isoforms in exponentially growing JGY2000, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf2"><mml:mi>β</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> is the number of major isoforms in JZY5, and <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf3"><mml:mi>c</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> is the number of major isoform positions in common between the two strains.

The −1 position refers to the last genomically-encoded nucleotide (i.e., the base immediately upstream of the cleavage/polyadenylation site) within each isoform. Therefore, all positive positions (i.e. positions to the right of the cleavage/polyadenylation site) are not encoded in the actual isoforms. Nucleotide frequencies were computed by summing up the number of A’s, C’s, G’s and U’s at each position within a category, dividing these numbers by the total number of genes within the category and multiplying the resulting fraction by 100. The ‘overall’ category consisted of 2790 genes, while the Upstream and Downstream categories contained 1898 and 605 genes, respectively. The ‘Both’ sub-category, consisting of genes whose end zones are shifted upstream in both slow Pol II mutant strains and shifted downstream in both fast Pol II strains, contained a total of 462 genes. Finally, the ‘Neutral’ category comprised 445 genes.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Catherine Maddox for excellent technical assistance and Craig Kaplan for helpful advice on constructing the Pol II mutant strains.

Your article has been reviewed by James Manley as the Senior Editor, a Reviewing Editor, and three reviewers. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Nick J Proudfoot (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors have explored how a metabolic state change in budding yeast, known as the diauxic shift, impacts global cleavage and polyadenylation. In this research article, they determine that upon diauxic shift there is a broad change in poly(A) site usage to favor cleavage and polyadenylation sites more proximal to stop codons. The upstream shift of poly(A) site usage in the diauxic condition, interestingly, matches well with that observed in yeast expressing Pol II slow mutants. Because Hpr1 and Spt4 mutants, which have processivity issues, do not display such an upstream shift, the authors conclude that it is elongation rate, rather than processivity, that leads to the upstream shift in diauxic condition. Overall, this work reveals that environmental cues can broadly impact alternative polyadenylation that is likely manifested through alterations in Pol II elongation rates underscoring the interplay between Pol II function and RNA processing.</p><p>Below is a relatively short list of essential revisions that are believed to be addressable in a contained amount of time. The most prominent of those concerns is the need to provide stronger data indicating that Pol II elongation rate is indeed reduced during diauxic shift – a point central to the overall manuscript conclusion.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Experimental:</p><p>1) The Pol II fast mutants do not seem to lend much support to their model. Is this because of mitigation of alternative polyadenylation profile changes by RNA degradation? For example, if long isoforms are generated but are also preferentially degraded, the downstream shift may not be obvious. Also, the authors need to examine this possibility. The authors need to check Pol II fast mutants in diauxic condition to see if the upstream shift could be inhibited. This would greatly strengthen their conclusion. (This point is assuming that research has resumed.)</p><p>2) Figure 6 is a clear-cut data set showing that diauxic shift does indeed correlate with TSS proximal enhanced Pol II density over genes and that this is unaffected by loss of factors previously ascribed to processivity effects, rather than simply Pol II speed. However, some simple Pol II ChIPs here as well as bioinformatic Pol II occupancy measures would be helpful (Figure 6A and B).</p><p>Textual:</p><p>1) Figure 1 shows that diauxic shift as compared to simply different growth medium, switches many Pol II transcribed genes into usage of 5' located PAS. However, do these PAS switches affect mRNA levels of affected genes, i.e. does their gene expression change. Also does this correlate with gene ontology for changing the metabolic needs of the cell?</p><p>2) The bioinformatic data shown in Figure 3 that preferred PAS sites are non-random (presumably sequence specific) is somewhat over the top and that really these bioinformatic data are of less interest (maybe good for supplementary data?).</p><p>3) Improve the readability of Figure 5 as multiple reviewers found it hard to follow. A simple table of base composition would suffice rather than the hard-to-see graphical data across PAS sequences. Ideally the significance of a reduction in U (and C) richness correlating with PAS speed sensitivity needs to be tested by direct mutation? Also, they need to compare the same poly(A) sites that are upregulated or downregulated in diauxic condition vs. other conditions.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for re-submitting your article &quot;The transcriptional elongation rate regulates alternative polyadenylation in yeast&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revision has been re-reviewed by James Manley as the Senior Editor, a Reviewing Editor, and two reviewers. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>There was a mixed response by the reviewers upon inspection of your revision. Ultimately, through discussion, a consensus was reached to request a revision that addresses their concerns. We stress that this revision need only be textual and agree with the reviewers that some aspects of the manuscript need additional clarification. Provided reasonable modifications to the text are made, we anticipate not sending this revision back to them. Rather than summarize their reviews, which are short, they are appended below.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>Geisberg et al. provided a forceful response to the previous review. Overall, while I am not fully convinced by the arguments presented, I am not in favor of prolonging the review, especially in the current difficult research situation caused by the pandemic. After all, the authors have done a solid work to generate substantial data that are useful to the community. I therefore suggest that the authors incorporate some of their response in the paper so that readers would not miss the true significance and novelty of this work. Specifically, they may want to emphasize (1) the true novelty of this work is the second theme, and (2) the features of speed-sensitive 3'UTRs. Regarding other potential explanations for poly(A) site usage in diauxic conditions, they may want to mention that alternation of some key 3' end processing factors may lead to similar changes.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>This is a revised manuscript. The editor and reviewers previously concluded that the authors needed &quot;to provide stronger data indicating that Pol II elongation rate is indeed reduced during diauxic shift&quot; to support the authors' conclusions, which the authors have not done. Nor have they adjusted the text of the manuscript to reflect this gap. Instead the authors argue in the rebuttal that the reviewers and editor confused two separate themes with theme one being that slow polymerase causes an upstream shift in poly(A) sites and theme 2 being that poly(A) sites shift upstream during diauxic shift. However, the manuscript continues to prominently suggest a mechanistic link between the two. The abstract literally ends with the bottom line that &quot;Pol II elongation speed is important.…. for regulating poly(A) patterns in response to environmental conditions.&quot; This is not the only prominent occurrence where the authors draw very strong causal relationship (e.g. in subsection “Yeast cells containing Pol II derivatives with slow elongation rates show a poly(A) pattern that strikingly resembles the pattern in diauxic shift” where the authors say &quot;strongly suggests a mechanistic relationship&quot;; in subsections &quot;Evidence that pol II elongation rate is decreased in diauxic conditions&quot;, “Pol II elongation rate, not processivity, is important for polyadenylation patterns” where the authors say &quot;is the cause&quot;; and in subsection “Evidence that regulated polyadenylation during the diauxic shift is due to decreased elongation rate” where the authors say &quot;due to&quot;). While a manuscript presenting two separate, but related, themes would be acceptable, that is not what the current manuscript does.</p><p>Most other comments have been successfully addressed.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.59810.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors have explored how a metabolic state change in budding yeast, known as the diauxic shift, impacts global cleavage and polyadenylation.

Because Hpr1 and Spt4 mutants, which have processivity issues, do not display such an upstream shift, the authors conclude that it is elongation rate, rather than processivity, that leads to the upstream shift in diauxic condition. Overall, this work reveals that environmental cues can broadly impact alternative polyadenylation that is likely manifested through alterations in Pol II elongation rates underscoring the interplay between Pol II function and RNA processing.</p><p>Below is a relatively short list of essential revisions that are believed to be addressable in a contained amount of time. The most prominent of those concerns is the need to provide stronger data indicating that Pol II elongation rate is indeed reduced during diauxic shift – a point central to the overall manuscript conclusion.</p></disp-quote><p>1) The paper has two major themes, but the reviewers have focused on the first theme, namely regulated polyadenylation in response to an environmental condition via Pol II speed. They largely overlooked the second theme, namely a detailed analysis of how Pol II speed affects polyadenylation. The few papers that investigate this second theme are much less advanced, typically using only a single slow Pol II derivative, not done at the nucleotide level (i.e. mRNA isoforms), and providing no information on the difference between speed-sensitive vs. speed-insensitive 3’ UTRs. As such, some of the results that the reviewers considered to be peripheral (which they are for theme 1) are critical for theme 2 and represent a significant advance over current knowledge. We previously considered dividing the paper into 2 back-to-back short papers, one for each theme. However, the two themes are both important and clearly related, which is why we presented them together.</p><p>2) Regarding the request to “provide stronger data indicating that Pol II elongation rate is indeed reduced during the diauxic shift,” we believe that our results and conclusions are compelling, even if below the level of formal proof (which we do not claim and which rarely happens in any paper). The poly(A) patterns under diauxic conditions and in two slow Pol II mutants are remarkably similar over thousands of genes. Diauxic conditions clearly show decreased Pol II processivity, a known feature of slow Pol II. Processivity per se is ruled out by the <italic>spt4</italic> and <italic>hpr1</italic> deletion experiments. I can’t think of anything plausible that could explain all these data other than our conclusion that Pol II elongation rate is reduced in diauxic conditions. If the reviewers can come up with a plausible alternative, we would be happy to mention it.</p><p>Furthermore, there are technical and conceptual problems in trying to “provide stronger data.” Technically, I don’t know how we can measure Pol II speed in diauxic conditions. We can’t use our glucose-shutoff method. Conceptually, even if we could measure speed, it would be impossible to disentangle a true effect on Pol II speed vs. a general slowdown of molecular processes in diauxic conditions, in which cells are barely growing. Trying to correct/normalize the effects of cell growth on molecular processes is a quagmire many have encountered and few have solved. The processivity experiments in the paper get around this, because it is the pattern that is affected, not the absolute rate.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Experimental:</p><p>1) The Pol II fast mutants do not seem to lend much support to their model. Is this because of mitigation of alternative polyadenylation profile changes by RNA degradation? For example, if long isoforms are generated but are also preferentially degraded, the downstream shift may not be obvious. Also, the authors need to examine this possibility. The authors need to check Pol II fast mutants in diauxic condition to see if the upstream shift could be inhibited. This would greatly strengthen their conclusion. (This point is assuming that research has resumed.)</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewers are correct that the fast Pol II mutants are largely irrelevant to the regulation in response to the diauxic shift (i.e. theme 1), and we did not use them at all for this purpose. As such, the other aspects of this comment are also irrelevant for theme 1. However, they are critical to theme 2, which was largely overlooked by the reviewers.</p><p>The suggestion that long isoforms in the fast Pol II mutants might be preferentially degraded is extremely unlikely based on what we and others have already published about mRNA decay in yeast (Geisberg et al., 2014; Gupta et al., 2014). Our previous work identified many hundreds of stabilizing and destabilizing elements within 3’UTRs. These elements can occur anywhere within a given 3’UTR, meaning that longer isoforms arising from a given gene can be either more or less stable than shorter isoforms. Furthermore, a completely independent series of experiments clearly demonstrated there was no correlation between 3’UTR length and stability (Gupta et al., 2014). While longer mRNA isoform destabilization had been reported (and varies in its extent) in cancer cells and other cell lines (Mayr and Bartel, 2009; Lin et al., 2012; Spies et al., 2013), the results from both studies described above are completely inconsistent with a general destabilization of longer 3’ isoforms. Furthermore, the key point of Figure 3 is that the same poly(A) sites are used in all Pol II derivatives, so mRNA stability of these isoforms will be the same in all strains. Nevertheless, in response to this comment, the revised paper now discusses issues related to mRNA stability.</p><p>The suggested experiment to check fast Pol II mutants under diauxic conditions would yield uninterpretable results. Pitting an upstream-shifting condition against a downstream-shifting condition merely asks which is more potent and provides no mechanistic information. Typically, such experiments give intermediate effects, which in the case here would be an upstream shift that is somewhat less pronounced than a wt strain under diauxic conditions (especially because the upstream shift in diauxic conditions is much stronger than the downstream shift caused by the fast Pol II mutant). However, the precise answer could be anything, and hence it would provide no information to strengthen any conclusion in the paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Figure 6 is a clear-cut data set showing that diauxic shift does indeed correlate with TSS proximal enhanced Pol II density over genes and that this is unaffected by loss of factors previously ascribed to processivity effects, rather than simply Pol II speed. However, some simple Pol II ChIPs here as well as bioinformatic Pol II occupancy measures would be helpful (Figure 6A and B).</p></disp-quote><p>We don’t understand this comment about doing Pol II ChIP experiments. Figure 6A is a Pol II ChIP experiment, with the results plotted with respect to the upstream shift in Figure 6B. Processivity and speed experiments for the Spt4 and Hpr1 mutants were published 15 years ago (Mason and Struhl, 2005), and they involved Pol II ChIP.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Textual:</p><p>1) Figure 1 shows that diauxic shift as compared to simply different growth medium, switches many Pol II transcribed genes into usage of 5' located PAS. However, do these PAS switches affect mRNA levels of affected genes, i.e. does their gene expression change. Also does this correlate with gene ontology for changing the metabolic needs of the cell?</p></disp-quote><p>Because the paper is concerned with poly(A) profiles, the results are normalized for each gene with the maximal isoform given a value of 100. The reviewers are correct that this presentation ignores the changes in expression level under the various conditions. As such, we now add a paragraph about this (the expression values are present in the Excel files in our GEO submission). As expected, whether or not a gene is regulated under a given conditions does not affect its poly(A) profile. Under all conditions except diauxic, the poly(A) profiles are the same even though expression levels of many genes are regulated. Under diauxic conditions, the vast majority of genes shift in the same manner, even though only a subset is regulated at the expression level.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The bioinformatic data shown in Figure 3 that preferred PAS sites are non-random (presumably sequence specific) is somewhat over the top and that really these bioinformatic data are of less interest (maybe good for supplementary data?).</p></disp-quote><p>Figure 3 makes the important point that upstream and downstream shifts involve the same poly(A) sites, just a rebalancing of how much they are used. While this might (or might not) have been expected, it is important to demonstrate, especially as it has mechanistic implications (e.g. see above response about suggested experiments). Moreover, it is a useful piece of information for theme 2, and in this regard, we are unaware of anyone looking at this issue at the nucleotide level on a transcriptome scale. As such, we believe that it merits a proper figure.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Improve the readability of Figure 5 as multiple reviewers found it hard to follow. A simple table of base composition would suffice rather than the hard-to-see graphical data across PAS sequences. Ideally the significance of a reduction in U (and C) richness correlating with PAS speed sensitivity needs to be tested by direct mutation? Also, they need to compare the same poly(A) sites that are upregulated or downregulated in diauxic condition vs. other conditions.</p></disp-quote><p>As requested, we simplified Figure 5 to show how speed-sensitive 3’UTRs differ in base composition from neutral 3’UTRs. Specifically, we showed this only for the wild-type strain, meaning only 2 lines for each nucleotide. This result is identical for all other comparisons including slow only and fast only Pol II, as well as the diauxic condition, and the data for all these other comparisons is now part of the supplemental figure associated with Figure 5. We think it important to keep the form of the original figure because the level of nucleotide preferences varies over the range examined, and the readers should see this instead of a Table that is a simple summary of preferences at an arbitrary location(s).</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(…)</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>Geisberg et al. provided a forceful response to the previous review. Overall, while I am not fully convinced by the arguments presented, I am not in favor of prolonging the review, especially in the current difficult research situation caused by the pandemic. After all, the authors have done a solid work to generate substantial data that are useful to the community. I therefore suggest that the authors incorporate some of their response in the paper so that readers would not miss the true significance and novelty of this work. Specifically, they may want to emphasize on (1) the true novelty of this work is the second theme, and (2) the features of speed-sensitive 3'UTRs. Regarding other potential explanations for poly(A) site usage in diauxic conditions, they may want to mention that alternation of some key 3' end processing factors may lead to similar changes.</p></disp-quote><p>1) As requested, we now consider the suggestion that alteration of some 3’ processing factor might account for the poly(A) shift in diauxic conditions. We thank the reviewer for bringing up an alternative explanation to our conclusion, which is very helpful for readers of the paper. However, as discussed in a new paragraph, this suggested model is extremely unlikely for two reasons. First, this suggested model would require such a altered 3’ processing factor to cause a virtually identical poly(A) pattern to those of two different slow Pol II mutants over thousands of genes. Second, if the shift in diauxic conditions is due to a 3’ processing factor, why is there such a pronounced Pol II processivity defect, a hallmark of reduced Pol II speed? In addition and unbeknownst to the reviewers, we actually have looked at poly(A) patterns in numerous 3’ processing and transcriptional elongation factors, and we have never seen an upstream shift like those in diauxic and slow Pol II conditions. These data are unpublished and not fully analyzed, but this result is clear.</p><p>2) As requested, we have added text to the subsection “Pol II elongation rate, not Pol II processivity, affects poly(A) site selection” to further emphasize theme 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>This is a revised manuscript. The editor and reviewers previously concluded that the authors needed &quot;to provide stronger data indicating that Pol II elongation rate is indeed reduced during diauxic shift&quot; to support the authors' conclusions, which the authors have not done. Nor have they adjusted the text of the manuscript to reflect this gap. Instead the authors argue in the rebuttal that the reviewers and editor confused two separate themes with theme one being that slow polymerase causes an upstream shift in poly(A) sites and theme 2 being that poly(A) sites shift upstream during diauxic shift. However, the manuscript continues to prominently suggest a mechanistic link between the two. The abstract literally ends with the bottom line that &quot;Pol II elongation speed is important.…. for regulating poly(A) patterns in response to environmental conditions.&quot; This is not the only prominent occurrence where the authors draw very strong causal relationship (e.g. in subsection “Yeast cells containing Pol II derivatives with slow elongation rates show a poly(A) pattern that strikingly resembles the pattern in diauxic shift” where the authors say &quot;strongly suggests a mechanistic relationship&quot;; in subsections &quot;Evidence that pol II elongation rate is decreased in diauxic conditions&quot;, “Pol II elongation rate, not processivity, is important for polyadenylation patterns” where the authors say &quot;is the cause&quot;; and in subsection “Evidence that regulated polyadenylation during the diauxic shift is due to decreased elongation rate” where the authors say &quot;due to&quot;). While a manuscript presenting two separate, but related, themes would be acceptable, that is not what the current manuscript does.</p></disp-quote><p>As requested, we have softened the statements in a few places and also explicitly discussed an alternative explanation of the data (see point 1 of reviewer 2). However, we find it difficult to respond to this re-review. While there was a general request “to provide stronger data indicating that Pol II elongation rate is indeed induced during diauxic shift,” no specific experiments were suggested in the “essential revisions” of the first review and none are suggested in the re-review. Furthermore, in our response to the original reviews, we provided detailed arguments about (1) why our conclusion is compelling (even if not formally proven, which we never claim), (2) why a direct measurement of Pol II speed in diauxic conditions is technically impossible, and (3) why any such measurement could not be interpreted due to complications related to slow growth. Reviewer 3 did not challenge or address these arguments.</p><p>I think we accurately stated the strength of our conclusions and have never described them with terms such as “proven”, “conclusive” or “definitive”. “Evidence that” is clearly a qualified statement. The examples of “is the cause” and “due to” are misleading because in all of these examples were qualified by strongly suggest (which we have now softened to suggest) in the same sentence.</p><p>There appears to be some confusion about what themes 1 and 2 are. Theme 1 is about regulated polyadenylation and includes upstream shifts in <italic>both</italic> diauxic and slow Pol II mutants and the processivity experiments. Theme 2 concerns mechanistic information about the relationship of Pol II speed to polyadenylation and includes the fast Pol II data, gene specificity and sequence determinants of speed dependence, and rebalancing of sites upon the shift and the absence of new sites. We mentioned the two themes in our initial response because theme 2 was largely overlooked in the original reviews even though we (and reviewer 2) thought it an important aspect of the paper. It had nothing to do with regulated polyadenylation (theme 1).</p></body></sub-article></article>
