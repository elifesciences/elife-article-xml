(NBDs), but pore-domain mutations may also impair gating. ATP-bound NBDs dimerize occluding two nucleotides at interfacial binding sites; one site hydrolyzes ATP, the other is inactive. The pore opens upon tightening, and closes upon disengagement, of the catalytic site following ATP hydrolysis. Extent, timing, and role of non-catalytic-site movements are unknown. Here we exploit equilibrium gating of a hydrolysis-deficient mutant and apply Φ value analysis to compare timing of opening-associated movements at multiple locations, from the cytoplasmic ATP sites to the extracellular surface. Marked asynchrony of motion in the two ATP sites reveals their distinct roles in channel gating. The results clarify the molecular mechanisms of functional cross-talk between canonical and degenerate ATP sites in asymmetric ABC proteins, and of the gating defects caused by two common CF mutations.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cystic fibrosis</kwd><kwd>asymmetric ABC protein</kwd><kwd>REFER</kwd><kwd>R117H</kwd><kwd>deltaF508</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>Xenopus</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>International Early Career Scientist Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Csanády</surname><given-names>László</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000897</institution-id><institution>Cystic Fibrosis Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Research Grant CSANAD17G0</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Csanády</surname><given-names>László</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003825</institution-id><institution>Magyar Tudományos Akadémia</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Lendület grant LP2017-14/2017</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Csanády</surname><given-names>László</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003825</institution-id><institution>Magyar Tudományos Akadémia</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Lendület grant LP2012-39/2012</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Csanády</surname><given-names>László</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>In the CFTR chloride channel, ATP bound in the catalytic site promotes pore opening, whereas ATP bound in the non-catalytic site supports unidirectional conformational cycling by preventing pore closure without ATP hydrolysis in the catalytic site.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is an incurable, devastating inherited disease caused by mutations in the CF Transmembrane Conductance regulator (CFTR) chloride ion channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Riordan et al., 1989</xref>). A large number of mutations identified in CF patients scatter throughout the entire protein sequence and cause defects in protein synthesis, maturation, stability, channel gating, and/or anion permeation through the open channel pore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">O'Sullivan and Freedman, 2009</xref>). In recent clinical trials small molecule drugs that target the CFTR protein and rectify either processing (‘correctors’) or gating defects (‘potentiators’) have proven beneficial for some CF patients carrying specific mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ramsey et al., 2011</xref>), underscoring the importance of understanding the structure and mechanism of this disease-associated protein at a molecular level.</p><p>CFTR belongs to the large family of ATP-Binding Cassette (ABC) proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Riordan et al., 1989</xref>), most of which function as active transporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dean and Annilo, 2005</xref>). A conserved molecular mechanism that involves ATP binding and hydrolysis drives opening and closing (gating) of the CFTR pore and substrate translocation through other ABC proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Li et al., 1996</xref>). The exceptional resolution of single-channel patch-clamp recordings makes CFTR a model ABC protein eminently suitable for molecular-level biophysical studies.</p><p>ABC proteins are built from two homologous halves each containing a transmembrane domain (TMD) and a cytosolic nucleotide binding domain (NBD). In CFTR these two canonical halves are linked by the unique regulatory (R) domain which must be either phosphorylated by cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anderson et al., 1991</xref>), or deleted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Csanády et al., 2000</xref>) to allow channel gating. The highly conserved NBD fold comprises an alpha/beta ‘head’ subdomain harboring the Walker A and B motifs, and an alpha-helical ‘tail’ subdomain which contains the ABC-specific ‘signature’ sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hung et al., 1998</xref>). Binding of ATP to the Walker motifs in each of the two NBDs promotes their association into a tight head-to-tail dimer that occludes the two bound ATP molecules at interfacial binding sites formed by the Walker motifs of one NBD and the signature motif of the other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Smith et al., 2002</xref>). Such NBD dimers are extremely stable but dissociate following ATP hydrolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Moody et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Smith et al., 2002</xref>). Formation/disruption of the NBD dimer, communicated to the TMDs through an interface formed by four short coupling helices (CH1-4, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <italic>violet loops</italic>), drives the major conformational rearrangements of the substrate translocation pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Locher, 2009</xref>). Upon formation of the NBD dimer, the CFTR anion pore opens to a ‘burst’ state interrupted by brief (~10 ms) ‘flickery’ closures, and upon dimer disruption following ATP hydrolysis at the consensus site (‘catalytic site 2’, formed by NBD2 Walker motifs and NBD1 signature sequence) the channel returns to a long-lived (~1 s) ‘interburst’ closed state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Vergani et al., 2005</xref>]). The closed-pore CFTR structure is inward facing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zhang and Chen, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Liu et al., 2017</xref>), whereas the open-pore structure, with dimerized NBDs, likely resembles the outward-facing TMD conformation of ABC proteins. In a subset of ABC transporters, including CFTR, only one of the two composite sites is catalytically active, whereas the other contains non-canonical substitutions at several key residues that impair ATPase activity. In CFTR that degenerate ATP site (‘non-catalytic site 1’, formed by NBD1 Walker motifs and NBD2 signature sequence), keeps ATP bound but unhydrolyzed throughout several gating cycles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aleksandrov et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Basso et al., 2003</xref>).

In particular, the structural organization of the transition (T) state for channel opening may shed light on the sources of molecular strain that underly the large Gibbs energy of this highest-energy intermediate conformation, which rate limits the overall transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Csanády et al., 2006</xref>). Such T-state structures cannot be studied by standard structural approaches, as their life times fall into the sub-microsecond range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chakrapani and Auerbach, 2005</xref>). However, relative timing of motions of a given channel position is reported by its Φ value, the slope of a log-log plot of the opening rate constant (<italic>k</italic><sub>CO</sub>) as a function of the closed-open equilibrium constant (<italic>K</italic><sub>eq</sub> = <italic>k</italic><sub>CO</sub>/<italic>k</italic><sub>OC</sub>) for a series of point substitutions (Brønsted plot). For the opening step of a simple idealized two-state channel with a single intervening T state, Φ is a measure of how far the conformation of the position has progressed along the reaction coordinate in the T state (0≤Φ ≤1). For a position that moves very early, and has therefore reached its open-like conformation in the T state (Φ = 1), perturbations affect T-state and open-state stabilities to similar extents, and thus impact only opening but not closing rate. At the other extreme, for a position that moves very late, and is still in its closed-like conformation in the T-state (Φ = 0), perturbations affect closing but not opening rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Auerbach, 2007</xref>). In reality, the overall closed-to-open conformational change of large ion-channel proteins is best described by a sequence of conformational steps across a chain of high-energy intermediary states (the ‘transition-state ensemble’), and the Φ value of a position reports whether its perturbations affect early (large Φ) or late (small Φ) steps within that chain of events. However, on the plausible assumption that perturbation of a position affects the microscopic step during which the position undergoes a rearrangement, but not steps during which it remains static, the Φ value is reasonably interpreted to reflect relative timing of movements even in such cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zhou et al., 2005</xref>). The terms ‘early’ and ‘late’ will be used here to reflect sequentiality of movements based on this interpretation.</p><p>Because Φ value analysis requires equilibrium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Csanády, 2009</xref>), it can be applied to CFTR pore opening only in the presence of a background mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–B</xref>, <italic>red star</italic>) that disrupts ATP hydrolysis at catalytic site 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <italic>red cross</italic>), thus reducing gating in saturating ATP to a simple closed-open equilibrium (C<sub>1</sub>↔O<sub>1</sub>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <italic>red box</italic>). These conditions are satisfied in a background construct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sorum et al., 2015</xref>) in which mutation of the NBD2 Walker B aspartate disrupts ATP hydrolysis and removal of the R domain obviates the need for prior phosphorylation (cut-ΔR(D1370N); <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In this background, Φ value analysis detected a clear temporal gradient in opening-related movements which spreads along the longitudinal, cytoplasmic to extracellular, protein axis from catalytic site 2 towards the pore (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>): in the T state catalytic site 2 is already dimerized (Φ ~ 1 for position 1246), the NBD-TMD interface is on the move (Φ ~ 0.5 for position 275), whereas the pore is still shut (Φ ~ 0.2 for position 348), suggesting strain in the region of the main CF locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sorum et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Here we exploit the same background construct to compare the roles of the two ATP binding sites in pore opening, and find markedly asynchronous movements. An outline of the transition-state structure based on Φ values of eleven positions at four different levels along the longitudinal protein axis, from the two ATP binding sites to the extracellular surface, suggests distinctly different energetic roles for the two sites in supporting channel gating. This provides the first mechanistic clues for understanding the division of tasks and functional cross-talk between the catalytic and the non-catalytic ATP binding site in asymmetric ABC proteins. The findings also clarify the molecular mechanisms of the CFTR channel gating defects caused by two common CF causing mutations.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Longitudinal Φ-gradient extends from the catalytic ATP binding site to the extracellular surface</title><p>Early movement within catalytic site 2 was suggested by the large Φ value for position 1246 in the Walker A motif of NBD2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sorum et al., 2015</xref>). To test timing of movements at the opposing NBD1 surface of catalytic site 2, we targeted position 555 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,C–D</xref>, <italic>red</italic>) near the NBD1 signature sequence: the R555 and T1246 side chains span the site 2 interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <italic>lower dotted ellipse</italic>) to form a hydrogen bond in open CFTR channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Vergani et al., 2005</xref>). Three tested arbitrary substitutions (see Materials and methods) of the native arginine at position 555 of our background construct (glutamine, alanine, cysteine) all dramatically lowered channel activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>): open probability (P<sub>o</sub>) in saturating (10 mM) ATP was reduced by up to 10-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). This graded reduction in the closed-open equilibrium constant (<italic>K</italic><sub>eq</sub>) was caused predominantly by mutational effects on mean interburst durations (τ<sub>ib</sub>) which were prolonged by up to 10-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), reporting large reductions in channel opening rate (<italic>k</italic><sub>CO</sub> = 1/τ<sub>ib</sub>). Importantly, since 10 mM ATP remained saturating for all of the mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>, <italic>red bars</italic>), this reduced rate <italic>k</italic><sub>CO</sub> indeed reflects slowing of the C<sub>1</sub>→O<sub>1</sub> step (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).

Here we show that position 508 is indeed just on the move in the T state, together with spatially adjacent CH4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zhang and Chen, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Liu et al., 2017</xref>), as reported by their intermediate, essentially indistinguishable Φ values of ~0.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4O</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5E</xref>). Because all tested perturbations of the F508 side chain reduce opening and accelerate non-hydrolytic closing rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B–C</xref>), the simplest interpretation is that the native phenylalanine side chain is involved in stabilizing interactions that become stronger as the closed channel reaches the T state, and even stronger when it relaxes to the open state. Loss (or weakening) of these interactions by 508-position perturbations destabilizes the T state relative to the closed state (reducing opening rate, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Miki et al., 2010</xref>]), and further destabilizes the open state relative to the T state (enhancing non-hydrolytic closing rate, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jih et al., 2011</xref>]). The alternative explanation that the native phenylalanine side chain forms destabilizing interaction(s) in the closed state seems unlikely, as mutations here dramatically reduce protein stability, suggesting an overall stabilizing role for residue F508 in its native environment. Of note, because in wild-type (WT) CFTR the hydrolytic pathway for channel closure is much faster than the non-hydrolytic pathway, the strong acceleration of non-hydrolytic closing rate by deletion or substitutions of residue F508 is not apparent when studied in a WT (hydrolytic) background (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Miki et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kopeikin et al., 2014</xref>), a fact that has led to previous misassignment of a Φ value close to 1 for position 508 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aleksandrov et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Mutation R117H is associated with a mild form of CF and causes, beside a moderate reduction in single channel chloride conductance, a strong channel gating defect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sheppard et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Yu et al., 2016</xref>), suggesting that this position is involved in interactions that change in a gating-state dependent manner. Indeed, all substitutions at position 117 dramatically reduced open probability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>) by accelerating closure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>) while leaving opening unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>). Because in closed-state structures of CFTR the native R117 side chain is not seen to form strong interactions with other residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zhang and Chen, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Liu et al., 2017</xref>), the implication is that it forms a stabilizing interaction (or interactions) in the open state, that is (are) lost when the arginine at position 117 is replaced. Furthermore, the stabilizing interaction is not yet formed in the T state: its appearance is among the last movements associated with pore opening (Φ ~ 0). Thus, R117 substitutions selectively destabilize the open state, but not the transition state, relative to the closed state, as indicated by the unaltered opening rate.</p><p>In striking contrast to the large Φ values of positions on both sides of the dimer interface in catalytic site 2, positions flanking non-catalytic site 1 display low-to-intermediate Φ values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, <italic>orange</italic> vs. <italic>red residues</italic> (<italic>left</italic>) and <italic>numbers</italic> (<italic>right</italic>)). Thus, unlike catalytic site 2 which has already adopted its open-like conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, <italic>right</italic>, <italic>red residues</italic>) in the T state, non-catalytic site 1 is still on the move between its closed- and open-like conformations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, <italic>left</italic> and <italic>right</italic>, <italic>orange residues</italic>). Interestingly, such pronounced asymmetry in the timing of motions at one end of the dimer interface compared to the other cannot be detected at the level of the four coupling helices, which are all characterized by Φ values of 0.5–0.6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, <italic>violet residues</italic> (<italic>left</italic>) and <italic>numbers</italic> (<italic>right</italic>)). Thus, the movements that take place in non-catalytic site 1 between the T state and the open state likely remain confined to the site-1 interface.</p><p>ATP bound at the two composite sites acts as molecular glue that stabilizes the open-pore conformation by bonding the NBD interfaces together (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Moody et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Smith et al., 2002</xref>). Our data suggest a division of labor in the bonding activities of the two sites. Phosphorylated WT CFTR channels open infrequently even in the absence of ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, <italic>top current trace</italic>), and such ‘spontaneous’ openings reflect occasional dimerization of empty, unliganded NBDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mihályi et al., 2016</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, <italic>top cartoon</italic>).

Thus, bound ATP reduces the energetic barrier for opening, but increases the barrier for non-hydrolytic closure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, <italic>black</italic> vs. <italic>orange</italic> standard Gibbs energy profiles).</p><p>Which of the two bound ATP molecules affects opening rate?

Whether stably bound ATP in non-catalytic site 1 might also contribute to speeding opening, by maintaining some contact across the site-1 interface even in the closed state and hence preventing complete NBD disengagement, is still unsettled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tsai et al., 2010b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Szollosi et al., 2011</xref>), but, cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chaves and Gadsby, 2015</xref>).</p><p>Which of the two bound ATP molecules affects non-hydrolytic closing rate? Because it is bonded both in the T and O<sub>1</sub> states, the site-2 glue cannot affect the height of the barrier for non-hydrolytic closure. On the other hand, the low Φ value of non-catalytic site 1 indicates localized movements between the T state and the open state, which we propose reflects tight bonding of the site-1 glue (i.e., tightening of the site-1 interface; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, <italic>bottom cartoon</italic>, <italic>upper site; red semi-circle</italic> only in state O<sub>1</sub>).

In asymmetric ABC proteins flipping to the outward-facing, NBD-dimerized conformation is followed by a step in which the consensus site becomes committed to ATP hydrolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Timachi et al., 2017</xref>): that step might involve bonding of the glue in the non-catalytic site.

Although functionally involved in Mg<sup>2+</sup> coordination in catalytic site 2 (cf., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zaitseva et al., 2005</xref>), aspartate 1370 is physically located in between the two ATP sites, in the center of the NBD interface, at the boundary between core and α-helical subdomains of NBD2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>, <italic>salmon</italic>). Moreover, it is in contact with the conserved Q-loop glutamine Q1291 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>, <italic>yellow</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Liu et al., 2017</xref>) which acts as a γ-phosphate sensor to induce an ~15<sup>o</sup> rotation of the α-helical subdomain towards the core subdomain upon ATP binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Karpowich et al., 2001</xref>). Thus, residue D1370 might also be involved in subdomain closure, essential for stable NBD dimerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Smith et al., 2002</xref>). Whether in CFTR that subdomain closure already happens in closed channels upon ATP binding (state C<sub>1</sub>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), or is completed only in the tight-dimer open-channel state as in the maltose transporter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Orelle et al., 2010</xref>), might be clarified by establishing a different non-hydrolytic background construct which allows targeting positions at the intra-NBD subdomain interface for Φ value analysis.</p><p>In conclusion, the Φ value map obtained here supports distinct roles for the two composite ATP sites in CFTR channel gating and reveal the molecular mechanism of the gating defects caused by two common CF mutations.

MgATP (3 or 10 mM) and 2'-deoxy-ATP sodium salt (dATP, 5 mM) (Sigma) were added from 400 mM and 100 mM aqueous stock solutions, respectively (pH = 7.1 with NMDG); dATP was supplemented with equimolar MgCl<sub>2</sub>. 25–50 μM 2'-deoxy-N<sup>6</sup>-(2-phenylethyl)-ATP sodium salt (P-dATP; Biolog LSI, Germany) was added from a 10 mM aqueous stock solution. Unitary CFTR currents in 10 mM MgATP were recorded at −80 mV (−100 mV for position 117 mutants) (Axopatch 200B, Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) digitized at 1 kHz (Digidata 1322A, Pclamp9 [RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_011323">SCR_011323</ext-link>], Molecular Devices), and lowpass-filtered at 50 Hz using a Gaussian filter. Single-channel patches were identified as very long (typically 15 min - 1 hr) recordings without superimposed channel openings. For the low-P<sub>o</sub> mutants targeting positions 117, 508, and 555 strong stimulation by dATP or P-dATP at the end of each experiment was used to facilitate correct estimation of the number of active channels in the patch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Macroscopic or quasi-macroscopic current ratios between 3 and 10 mM ATP were used to verify saturation by 10 mM ATP for each of the tested mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). For display purposes figure panels show channel currents filtered at 20 Hz (50 Hz for R117 mutants).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Data analysis</title><p>Bursts and interbursts were reconstructed as described earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sorum et al., 2015</xref>).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Richard Aldrich (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Kenton J Swartz (Reviewer #1), is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Roderick MacKinnon (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This interesting manuscript from the Csanady lab presents new results continuing work started in a previous paper analyzing the open/closed transition state of the CFTR chloride channel. This channel, related to the ABC transporter family, undergoes a highly complex gating process which requires channel phosphorylation in the R domain as well as ATP binding and hydrolysis at the NBDs to drive irreversible gating. Though much progress has occurred in understanding these processes, key questions remain open. Here the authors dissect the final gating step by using transition state analysis of a mutant that is claimed to introduce a simple, two-state open closed reaction for the opening of the channel. Such a two-state system is required for the analysis to be valid. The authors analyze the effects of mutations at a series of positions on the open/closed equilibrium that complement the previous set, focusing now on areas around the ATP1 binding site and the outside of the pore. They find that the timing of the opening wave reveals propagation from ATP2 to ATP1, which is roughly simultaneous with movement of the interfacial coupling helices. A position at the outside end of the pore moves only very late in the reaction. Notably, the timing differences between the ATP binding sites seem not to persist through the interfacial helices, which all seem to move nearly simultaneously. The work reported here is careful and thorough, and the single channel recordings are really nice. The presentation is also excellent, very clearly discussing a difficult topic. This kind of work is highly complementary to the spate of emerging structures and provides information that will be difficult to obtain using other methods. We do have several concerns that the authors should address before we are fully convinced by their arguments. The authors should be aware that the reviewers have somewhat divergent opinions about the most interesting new conclusions in this manuscript.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The single-step assumption. Critical to the argument presented here is that the equilibrium is a single step reaction, and that the transitions we observe are between two discrete states. However, our impression is that the gating reflects the binding of ATP (at least to site 2), dimerization of the NBDs, and the channel conformational change. From the collective Phi's measured in this and the previous paper, and their apparently smooth gradation from slopes of near zero to near 1, we could be convinced that this is a single reaction, but we think the burden is on the authors to substantiate this a bit more. How single exponential are the results? Are <italic>all</italic> the mutants equally well fit by a single tau each? The reported tau values are said to be from single exponential fits, but I think it would be worthwhile to establish this formally. Perhaps the authors could show the dwell time histograms (or at least examples) and fits in a supplemental figure.</p><p>2) We are unclear of the data in the second part of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and its associated discussion (paragraph beginning &quot;To target the opposing…&quot;). Please explain with greater care what you have done. Specifically, we would rather not see pooled data sets (from 460 and 464). Since the most important result in this paper is the discovery of different Phi values for catalytic and non-catalytic sites, we would be more confident in seeing what the Phi values are for multiple positions within each site (the theory that Phi values are related to a wave of conformational change across the protein, we should expect to see multiple similar Phi values in a given region.) Further, we are puzzled by the minimal discussion of the complexity of the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G-3J</xref>. Because the different Phi values between the two sites is the main result of this paper, we need to be more convinced of the data.</p><p>3) We think the authors should be more circumspect in their interpretation about how Phi analysis relates to timing of movements. The analysis speaks to where in the transition mutants at specific sites cause a perturbation. It may be reasonable to infer from this that this result is because those regions undergo dynamic rearrangements at different times in the transition, but it would seem more appropriate to separate the specific conclusion from the inference.</p><p>4) We were somewhat confused by the cartoon in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref> and its implications for the gating model. Our understanding is that ATP1 binds stably and rarely exchanges, where ATP2 binding and hydrolysis drives the reaction. In this light, isn't it surprising that the movements at ATP1 occur <italic>after</italic> those of ATP1? I guess the model in our head is that the NBDs are partially 'glued' by ATP1 and ready to close upon ATP2 binding. Is this incorrect? If not, what is happening to ATP1 that makes the movements around it happen later?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29013.021</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The single-step assumption.

For those positions at which different substitutions caused bi-directional changes in P<sub>o</sub> (1348, 172, 961, 1068) the chosen examples represent the mutants at the two extreme ends of the REFER plot.</p><p>Panels B (G) and C (H) show distributions of simple closed and open times, and the choice of the burst delimiter (t<sub>crit</sub>) according to the algorithm of Magleby and Pallotta (1983). Panels D (I) and E (J) display the distributions of the durations of <italic>reconstructed</italic> bursts and interbursts, resulting from suppression of brief &quot;flickery&quot; closures, and reasonable fits of the distributions of <italic>reconstructed</italic> bursts by single-exponential probability density functions. We note, however, that the distributions of <italic>reconstructed</italic> interburst durations will never be truly single-exponential: first, the left tail of the <italic>true</italic> interburst distribution is truncated, and second, the right tail of the distribution of flickery closures will survive – this is particularly apparent for the high-P<sub>o</sub> mutants for which the two closed-time components overlap substantially (e.g., H1348A, L172E, M961E, F1068L). However, the choice of t<sub>crit</sub> assures that the mean duration of <italic>reconstructed</italic> interburst events matches that of the <italic>true</italic> interburst events (and therefore the estimation of mean burst durations is also unbiased). We would like to point out that the values of τ<sub>b</sub> and τ<sub>ib</sub> were not derived from single-exponential fits (the <italic>reconstructed</italic> interburst distributions are not single-exponential), but reflect simple arithmetic averages of burst and interburst dwell-time durations (see Materials and methods). All this is explained in the legend of the first histogram figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2—figure supplement3</xref>).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) We are unclear of the data in the second part of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and its associated discussion (paragraph beginning &quot;To target the opposing…&quot;). Please explain with greater care what you have done.</p></disp-quote><p>Our original aim was to characterize Φ for position 464, which has been extensively studied by several groups in the past. However, unfortunately most of the mutants we generated failed to form functional channels, with the exception of K464C and K464R for which we did manage to obtain a few recordings. On the assumption that Φ values for nearby positions will be similar, we therefore sought to solidify the K464 data by combining them with data obtained from two mutants of nearby position 460 (the position analogous to 1246 in site 2). We acknowledge that this approach depends on the above assumption.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Specifically, we would rather not see pooled data sets (from 460 and 464).

Because we were unable to obtain a reliable Φ value for position 464, we have omitted the 464 data altogether. Instead, we have generated and functionally characterized three additional 460-position mutants, and now provide a clean REFER plot for position 460. The obtained Φ value of 0.36 ± 0.07 for position 460 is only slightly different from the Φ obtained earlier for the pooled 460-464 data (0.26 ± 0.06), and is quite similar to that of position 1348 located at the opposing surface of site 1 (0.42 ± 0.04). Thus, our conclusions are now based on the Φ values of two positions within each of the two ATP sites.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Further, we are puzzled by the minimal discussion of the complexity of the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G-3J</xref>.

[…] The terms &quot;early&quot; and &quot;late&quot; will be used here to reflect sequentiality of movements based on this interpretation.&quot;</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) We were somewhat confused by the cartoon in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref> and its implications for the gating model. Our understanding is that ATP1 binds stably and rarely exchanges, where ATP2 binding and hydrolysis drives the reaction. In this light, isn't it surprising that the movements at ATP1 occur after those of ATP1?</p></disp-quote><p>We do not think that there is anything surprising about this finding. It is clear that opening is initiated by ATP binding to site 2, because channels immediately cease to reopen once ATP is removed from the bath solution, even though site 1 likely keeps ATP bound for some tens of seconds (Tsai et al., 2010). The mere fact that opening is <italic>initiated</italic> by site 2 necessarily means that site 2 must undergo some movement first, before site 1 also reacts: causality must imply sequentiality, otherwise site 1 would have to be able to &quot;look into the future&quot;, to anticipate ATP binding-induced rearrangements in site 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I guess the model in our head is that the NBDs are partially 'glued' by ATP1 and ready to close upon ATP2 binding. Is this incorrect?</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, data from the Hwang laboratory (Tsai et al., 2010) and from our group (Szollosi et al., 2011) have provided evidence for some interaction across site 1 which is maintained even in the closed state (&quot;partially glued NBDs&quot;). If true, then this effect might also contribute to speeding opening (relative to unliganded gating) by preventing the NBDs from distancing themselves from each other as far as seen in unliganded cryo-EM structures (Zhang et al., 2016; Liu et al., 2017). However, this issue is still unsettled, as work from the Gadsby laboratory (Chaves and Gadsby, 2015) suggested complete separation of both ATP sites during each channel closing event.</p><p>We have now added a sentence to the Discussion to briefly expose this controversial topic: &quot;Whether stably bound ATP in non-catalytic site 1 might also contribute to speeding opening, by maintaining some contact across the site-1 interface even in the closed state and hence preventing complete NBD disengagement, is still unsettled (Tsai et al., 2010b; Szollosi et al., 2011, but, cf. Chaves and Gadsby, 2015).&quot;</p><p>Furthermore, we would like to point out that it is not &quot;ATP2 <italic>binding</italic>&quot; that initiates opening: in the closed channel ATP binding/unbinding to site 2 is a rapid equilibrium process, whereas opening rate is extremely slow (~1 s<sup>-1</sup>) even in saturating ATP. Thus, the movement at site 2 which initiates opening must occur <italic>after</italic> ATP2 binding, and has been shown to reflect closure of the site-2 NBD interface (Vergani et al., 2003; Vergani et al., 2005).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>If not, what is happening to ATP1 that makes the movements around it happen later?</p></disp-quote><p>Regardless of whether site 1 separation is complete or incomplete in the closed state, the causality argument discussed above does not leave much room for any alternative explanation. The exact nature of these movements is obviously beyond the scope of our study.</p></body></sub-article></article>
