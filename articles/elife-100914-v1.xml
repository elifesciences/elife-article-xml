Bacteria can cope with copper stress by increasing copper resistance and initiating chemorepellent response. However, it remains unclear how bacteria coordinate chemotaxis and resistance to copper. By screening proteins that interacted with the chemotaxis kinase CheA, we identified a copper-binding repressor CsoR that interacted with CheA in <italic>Pseudomonas putida</italic>. CsoR interacted with the HPT (P1), Dimer (P3), and HATPase_c (P4) domains of CheA and inhibited CheA autophosphorylation, resulting in decreased chemotaxis. The copper-binding of CsoR weakened its interaction with CheA, which relieved the inhibition of chemotaxis by CsoR. In addition, CsoR bound to the promoter of copper-resistance genes to inhibit gene expression, and copper-binding released CsoR from the promoter, leading to increased gene expression and copper resistance. <italic>P. putida</italic> cells exhibited a chemorepellent response to copper in a CheA-dependent manner, and CsoR inhibited the chemorepellent response to copper. Besides, the CheA-CsoR interaction also existed in proteins from several other bacterial species. Our results revealed a mechanism by which bacteria coordinately regulated chemotaxis and resistance to copper by CsoR.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Pseudomonas putida</kwd><kwd>chemotaxis</kwd><kwd>copper resistance</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100012166</institution-id><institution>National Key Research and Development Program of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2020YFC1806803</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Huang</surname><given-names>Qiaoyun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Hubei Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2024AFB691</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xiao</surname><given-names>Yujie</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31900054</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xiao</surname><given-names>Yujie</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100012226</institution-id><institution>Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2662022SKQD002</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xiao</surname><given-names>Yujie</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value><italic>Pseudomonas putida</italic> coordinates chemotaxis and resistance to copper through the interaction between CheA and CsoR.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Chemotaxis is a widespread ability of motile bacteria to direct their movement towards higher concentrations of beneficial chemicals or lower concentrations of toxic chemicals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Keegstra et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wadhams and Armitage, 2004</xref>). Chemotaxis plays a vital role in bacterial exploration and adaptation to complex environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zboralski and Filion, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boin et al., 2004</xref>). The chemotaxis signaling pathway is extensively studied in the enteric bacteria <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> serovar Typhimurium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wadhams and Armitage, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Porter et al., 2011</xref>). In <italic>E. coli</italic>, the chemotaxis system consists of five methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins (MCPs) and six core components (the kinase CheA, the response regulator CheY, the coupling protein CheW, the methylesterase CheB, the phosphatase CheZ, and the methyltransferase CheR). In response to decreased attractant or increased repellent, methylated MCPs and the coupling protein CheW activate CheA autophosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Parkinson et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ortega et al., 2017</xref>). The phosphorylated CheA (CheA-P) is a phosphodonor for the response regulator CheY and the methylesterase CheB. After CheY accepts the phosphate group from CheA, it binds FliM and FliN of the motor-switch complex, resulting in a switch in the flagellar rotational direction and bacteria tumbling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Welch et al., 1993</xref>). Meanwhile, on a slower timescale, phosphorylated CheB demethylates the active MCPs, thus reducing their ability to activate CheA, leading to decreased levels of phosphorylated CheY and less tumbling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Stewart, 1993</xref>). The phosphatase CheZ contributes to signal termination by removing the phosphoryl group from phosphorylated CheY, and the methyltransferase CheR contributes to signal adaptation by catalyzing the methylation of MCPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wadhams and Armitage, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Porter et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Among the bacterial chemotaxis system components, the kinase CheA is a five-domain enzyme central to the chemotaxis signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bilwes et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Muok et al., 2020</xref>). The five domains (P1-P5) of CheA each have distinct functions. The P1 domain (HPT domain) contains the phosphoryl-accepting histidine that becomes phosphorylated, the P2 domain (CheY-binding domain) docks the response regulator proteins CheY and CheB, the P3 domain (Dimer domain) dimerizes the CheA protein, the P4 domain (HATPase_c domain) binds ATP and catalyzes phosphoryl transfer to the histidine residue on P1, and the P5 domain (CheW-binding domain) couples CheA to other chemotaxis components by binding both CheW and the chemoreceptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bilwes et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Muok et al., 2020</xref>). Except for interacting with the components in chemotaxis system, CheA is reported to interact with proteins from other systems. For example, in the plant pathogen <italic>Xanthomonas oryzae</italic> pv. <italic>oryzicola</italic>, CheA interacts with and phosphorylates the response regulator VemR to regulate bacterial virulence, motility, and EPS production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cai et al., 2022</xref>). In <italic>Vibrio parahaemolyticus</italic>, a polarly localized protein ParP interacts with CheA and prevents its dissociation from chemotaxis signaling arrays, facilitating proper chemotaxis and accurate inheritance of these macromolecular chemotactic machines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ringgaard et al., 2014</xref>). In <italic>Comamonas testosteroni</italic>, CheA interacts with and phosphorylates the response regulator FlmD, resulting in decreased biofilm formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Huang et al., 2019</xref>). In <italic>Azospirillum brasilense</italic> with two chemotaxis signaling systems, the kinase CheA from each chemotaxis signaling system physically interacts with the CheY response regulator of another system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">OâNeal et al., 2019</xref>). In <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>, CheA interacts with the phosphodiesterase DipA to regulate its subcellular localization and activity, leading to individual cell heterogeneity and motility behavior diversity in bacterial populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kulasekara et al., 2013</xref>). These studies suggest that the CheA-mediated crosstalk between chemotaxis and other systems coordinates complex behaviors in diverse bacteria.</p><p>In most living organisms, copper is an essential cofactor for enzymes involved in fundamental processes such as respiration and photosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kim et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tsang et al., 2021</xref>). However, copper also has toxic effects on cells, and bacteria have several strategies to increase their resistance to copper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Giachino and Waldron, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andrei et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hyre et al., 2021</xref>). The direct bacterial response associated with copper resistance is highly conserved and generally involves (a) sensing of the increased copper concentration by sensors, (b) activation of bespoke transcriptional networks, (c) overproduction of copper efflux pumps that secrete copper out of the cells, and (d) recruitment of copper-binding and copper-oxidizing proteins that prevent copper from interacting with cellular components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Novoa-Aponte et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">ÃztÃ¼rk et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Roy et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zuily et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dennison et al., 2018</xref>). The genome of <italic>Pseudomonas putida</italic> was predicated to encode a dozen of proteins involved in copper resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">CÃ¡novas et al., 2003</xref>), including copper sensor proteins (CopS-I, CopS-II), P-type ATPases for copper efflux (CueA, CopA-I, CopA-II, CopB-I, and CopB-II), heavy-metal efflux complex components (CusA, CusB, CusC, and CusF). Expression of these proteins were regulated by copper-responsive positive regulatory proteins (CopR-I, CopR-II, CueR; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adaikkalam and Swarup, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hofmann et al., 2021</xref>). CueR regulated the expression of genes implicated in cytoplasmic copper homeostasis, whereas CopR controlled the expression of genes involved in maintaining periplasmic metal level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Quintana et al., 2017</xref>). Meanwhile, some proteins/systems appeared to be duplicated, and some were proved to be functionally redundant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adaikkalam and Swarup, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Quintana et al., 2017</xref>). Besides, extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) in <italic>P. putida</italic> biofilms showed high affinity for most heavy metals, including copper, thereby providing a protective barrier under copper stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lin et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lin et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>In addition to the above copper resistance strategies, bacteria can avoid copper stress through chemotaxis. For example, in <italic>Caulobacter crescentus</italic>, the reactive oxygen species derived from cytoplasmic copper ions mediate the bacterial chemotaxis to copper, and a potential cytoplasmic MCP McpR regulates bacterial chemotaxis in response to cellular copper content, enabling bacteria to escape from copper-rich environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">LawarÃ©e et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Louis et al., 2023</xref>). However, unlike the widely reported mechanisms of copper resistance in diverse bacterial species, the mechanism(s) of bacterial chemotaxis to copper is poorly studied. Besides, it remains unclear how bacteria coordinate chemotaxis and resistance to copper.</p><p>Since the kinase CheA plays a central role in chemotaxis signaling, identifying CheA-interacting proteins would extend the knowledge of chemotaxis regulation. In this study, by screening proteins that interacted with CheA in <italic>Pseudomonas putida</italic>, we obtained 16 novel CheA-interacting proteins. Among the 16 proteins, CsoR, a copper-binding transcription regulator, inhibited the autophosphorylation of CheA, leading to decreased chemotaxis. Meanwhile, CsoR functioned as a DNA-binding repressor to inhibit the expression of copper-resistance genes. Copper-binding of CsoR relieved its inhibition of gene expression and chemotaxis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Identification of new CheA-interacting proteins in <italic>P. putida</italic></title><p>We performed a pull-down assay to identify protein(s) interacting with CheA.

To test whether phosphate transfer existed between CheA and the 16 proteins, we performed a phosphate transfer assay using purified proteins and [<sup>32</sup>P]ATP[Î³P]. We successfully purified 14 out of the 16 proteins but failed to purify two proteins (GlpR and PP_3177) after several attempts. Thus, the two proteins were not included in the phosphate transfer assay. The results showed that CheA exhibited a strong autophosphorylation signal after incubation with [<sup>32</sup>P]ATP[Î³P] for 45 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2a</xref>). Then, each of the 14 proteins or CheY (positive control) was added to phosphorylated CheA to investigate the phosphate transfer. The addition of CheY to phosphorylated CheA led to a labeling of CheY and a reduction in the phospholabeling of CheA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2a</xref>), indicating a phosphate transfer happened between CheA and CheY.

To answer this question, we mixed CheA with each of the 14 proteins before adding the substrate [<sup>32</sup>P]ATP[Î³P]. The mixture containing CheA and bovine serum albumin (BSA) was used as a negative control. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>, CsoR/PhaD significantly decreased the phospholabeling of CheA. In contrast, the other 12 proteins and BSA had no apparent influence on the phospholabeling of CheA. We further tested the impact of CsoR/PhaD on CheA autophosphorylation with a more detailed assay, in which CheA was mixed with an increased amount of CsoR/PhaD. The results showed that CheA phospholabeling decreased as CsoR/PhaD increased. In contrast, the increase of BSA had no obvious influence on CheA phospholabeling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c and d</xref>). These results indicated that CsoR and PhaD inhibited CheA autophosphorylation. It was also possible that CsoR and PhaD degraded the substrate [<sup>32</sup>P]ATP[Î³P] in the reaction mixture, resulting in decreased CheA autophosphorylation. To test this possibility, we examined whether CsoR and PhaD had ATPase activity. The known ATPase FleQ was used as a positive control, and BSA was used as a negative control. The results showed that adding FleQ into the reaction mixture caused a decrease in ATP level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2</xref>), indicating the existence of ATPase activity.

The results revealed that three truncated CheAs (CheA<sub>ÎHPT</sub>, CheA<sub>ÎDim</sub>, and CheA<sub>ÎHATPase</sub>) showed no interaction with CsoR and PhaD.

To further test this result, we cloned each of the five domains into a BTH vector and tested the interaction between CsoR/PhaD and each of the five domains. The result showed that the Dimer domain (Dim<sub>CheA</sub>) interacted with CsoR and PhaD like the whole-length CheA did (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b and c</xref>).

Moreover, in another unpublished result, we found that CheA interacted with eight c-di-GMP-metabolizing proteins, and CheA transferred the phosphate group to one of them. Together, it seemed that CheA could interact with at least 27 proteins. With such a heterogeneous pool of CheA-complexes, performing a specific response seemed difficult. However, several previous studies have reported the example of one protein interacting with dozens of proteins.

In contrast, deletion of <italic>csoR</italic> in <italic>P. putida</italic> led to a slight but reproducible increase (about 1.3-fold) in gene expression in the absence of copper (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>). This difference might be attributed to the existence of several key regulators that activated the expression of copper-resistance genes in response to copper in <italic>P. putida</italic>, such as CueR and CopR. CueR positively regulated the expression of <italic>cueA</italic>, encoding a copper-transporting P1-type ATPase that played a crucial role in copper resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adaikkalam and Swarup, 2002</xref>). CopR was essential for expressing several genes implicated in cytoplasmic copper homeostasis, such as <italic>copA-II</italic>, <italic>copB-II</italic>, and <italic>cusA</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Quintana et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Quaranta et al., 2009</xref>). The existence of these positive regulators makes the function of CosR a secondary or even dispensable insurance in the expression of copper-resistance genes. Consistent with this, there is no CosR homolog in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, and copper homeostasis in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> is mainly controlled by CueR and CopR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hofmann et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Quintana et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Through pull-down, BTH, and BiFC assays, we obtained 16 new CheA-interacting proteins involved in different physiological processes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1a</xref>). Among the 16 proteins, 5 proteins (CsoR, IspG, NfuA, PhaD, and PP_1644) inhibited bacterial chemotaxis on semisolid plates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). Our study here focused on the physiological role of CsoR-CheA interaction. Still, the function of other interactions remained unclear. PhaD is a TetR family transcriptional regulator that behaves as a carbon source-dependent activator of the <italic>pha</italic> cluster related to polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">de Eugenio et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tarazona et al., 2020</xref>). Bacterial PHAs are isotactic polymers synthesized under unfavorable growth conditions in the presence of excess carbon sources. PHAs are critical in central metabolism, acting as dynamic carbon reservoirs and reducing equivalents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gregory et al., 2022</xref>). The interaction between PhaD and CheA leads one to speculate that there might be some connection between PHA synthesis and bacterial chemotaxis. Another CheA-interacting protein, PP_1644, also attracts our interest. PP_1644 is annotated as a NAD(P)H dehydrogenase involved in cyclic electron transport and respiration processes. Exploring the physiological role of the interaction between CheA and these proteins in the future helps to reveal the association between the chemotaxis process and other physiological metabolisms.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Bacterial strains and growth conditions</title><p>All strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1b</xref>.

Broadly, this area is of interest because it could provide insight into how soil microbes mitigate metal stress. Additionally, copper has some historical agricultural use as an antimicrobial, thus can accumulate in soil. The manuscript bases its conclusions on an <italic>in vitro</italic> screen to identify interacting partners of CheA, an essential kinase in the P. putida chemotaxis-signaling pathway. Much of the subsequent analysis focuses on a regulator of the CsoR/RcnR family (PP_2969).</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The data presented in this work does not support the model (Figure 8). In particular, PP_2969 is linked to Ni/Co resistance not Cu resistance. Further, it is not clear how the putative new interactions with CheA would be integrated into diverse responses to various chemoattract/repellents. These two comments are justified below.</p><p>PP_2969</p><p>â¢ The authors present a sequence alignment (Figure S5) that is the sole based for their initial assignment of this ORF as a CsoR protein. There is conservation of the primary coordinating ligands (highlighted with asterisks) known to be involved in Cu(I) binding to CsoR (ref 31). There are some key differences, though, in residues immediately adjacent to the conserved Cys (the preceding Ala, which is Tyr in the other sequences). The effect of these change may be significant in a physiological context.</p><p>â¢ The gene immediately downstream of PP_2969 is homologous to <italic>E. coli</italic> RcnA, a demonstrated Ni/Co efflux protein, suggesting that P2969 may be Ni or Co responsive. Indeed PP_2970 has previously been reported as Ni/Co responsive (J. Bact 2009 doi:10.1128/JB.00465-09). The host cytosol plays a critical role in determining metal-response, in addition to the protein, which can explain the divergence from the metal response expected from the alignment.</p><p>â¢ The previous JBact study also explains the lack of an effect (Figure 5b) of deleting PP_2969 on copper-efflux gene expression (copA-I, copA-II, and copB-II) as these are regulated by CueR not PP_2969 consistent with the previous report. Deletion of CsoR/RcnR family regulator will result in constitutive expression of the relevant efflux/detoxification gene, at a level generally equivalent to the de-repression observed in the presence of the signal.</p><p>â¢ Further, CsoR proteins are Cu(I) responsive so measuring Cu(II) binding affinity is not physiologically relevant (Figures 5a and S5b). The affinities of demonstrated CsoR proteins are 10-18 M and these values are determined by competition assay. The MTS assay and resulting affinities are not physiologically relevant.</p><p>â¢ The DNA-binding assays are carried out at protein concentrations well above physiological ranges (Figs 5c and d, and S5c, d). The weak binding will in part result from using DNA-sequences upstream of the copA genes and not from from PP_2970.</p><p>CheA interactions</p><p>There is no consideration given to the likely physiological relevance of the new interacting partners for CheA.</p><p>â¢ How much CheA is present in the cell (copies) and how many copies of other proteins are present? How would specific responses involving individual interacting partners be possible with such a heterogenous pool of putative CheA-complexes in a cell. For PP_2969, the affinity reported (Figure 5A) may lay at the upper end of the CsoR concentration range (for example, CueR in <italic>Salmonella</italic> is present at ~40 nM).</p><p>â¢ The two-hybrid system experiment uses a long growth time (60 h) before analysis. Even low LacZ activity levels will generate a blue colour, depending upon growth medium (see doi: 10.1016/0076-6879(91)04011-c). It is also not clear how Miller units can be accurately or precisely determined from a solid plate assay (the reference cited describes a protocol for liquid culture).</p><p>Comments on revised version:</p><p>The authors have replied in detail to the various comments about the original manuscripts. However, the responses are generally lengthy rationalisations of the original interpretation of the data and do not fundamentally address critical concerns raised about the physiological relevance of the results. The response appears to rest on the assumption that the numerous interacting partners obtained from the initial screen are all true positives and that all subsequent experimental results are interpreted to justify that assumption. In the case of CsoR, the experimental results and interpretation are inconsistent with previously published studies of the metal and DNA-binding properties of CsoR proteins. The following points reiterate comments from the previous review, in the hopes that the authors will, at the very least, consider the likelihood that the &quot;CsoR&quot; protein they have identified is in fact responsive to a different metal. Further, that the authors consider multiple possible interpretations of the data, particularly those that are inconsistent with the model/hypothesis and take this into account in their experimental design.</p><p>â¢ (Figure 4) Almost all purified proteins will bind Cu(II) most tightly in vitro, followed by Zn(II) and Ni(II). This behaviour is a consequence of the Irving-Williams affinity series (doi.org/10.1038/162746a0 and doi.org/10.1039/JR9530003192, especially Figure 4) and is not considered an indicator of physiological metal preference. Biomolecules will exhibit the same behaviour as small organic ligands towards first row transition ions because of the flexibility of their structures. Thus, the results obtained are unsurprising and, because of the method used, have no physiological relevance.</p><p>â¢ The authors cite other in vivo work as evidence for varied metal-response by regulator proteins. However, experiments in these citations are of limited relevance because some focus on other structural classes of metalloregulator proteins (so not relevant here) while others focus on changes in metal accumulation by overexpression of the regulator protein, with no examination of the metal-specificity of the efflux protein the key determinant of the physiological response of the regulator protein - why turn on expression of an efflux protein that can't pump out a particular metal? Finally, adding equivalent concentrations of metals to growing cells is not a good comparison as metals are toxic at different concentrations. The regulators will only have evolved to be just good enough, not perfect, with respect to selectivity. Laboratory experimental conditions often explore non-physiological conditions.</p><p>â¢ It is also important to re-emphasise the authors' own statements on lines 90-93 that P. putida has a CueR protein. This is consistent with the phylogenetic distribution of CueR proteins in gram-negative bacteria. The CsoR proteins, in contrast, are found only in gram-positive bacteria. This inconsistency is ignored by the authors.</p><p>â¢ The implications of the Irving-Williams series on metal-specific responses of bacterial metalloregulator proteins are described in the following references: 10.1016/j.cbpa.2021.102095, 10.1074/jbc.R114.588145, and 10.1038/s41589-018-0211-4. The last reference of this set provides an experimental basis for why metalloregulator affinities for Cu (and Zn and Ni) are so tight (and why the values obtained in Figure 4 in this manuscript are not relevant).</p><p>â¢ Similarly, the previous experimental studies of CsoR proteins not cited by the authors (10.1021/ja908372b 10.1021/bi900115w) provide rigourous experimental approaches for measuring metal and DNA-binding affinities and further highlight the weakness of the experimental design in this manuscript.</p><p>â¢ The DNA-binding assays are not physiologically relevant because they do not use DNA from the operator regulated by the candidate protein (why this was not explored in the revision is difficult to understand). The mobility shift observed at these high protein concentrations will result from non-specific binding. It is unsurprising that Cu(II) has an effect on DNA binding as it is added at such high concentrations relative to both protein and DNA so as to compete for DNA-binding with the protein (which binds weakly because there is no specific recognition site). The 10:1 ratio of Cu:CsoR is 10-times higher than needed as this class of proteins will show decreases in DNA-affinity in the presence of the correct metal at 1:1 stoichiometry. As indicated above, the authors need to consider alternative interpretations for their results rather than try to rationalise the results to fit the model.</p><p>The points raised above readily address the authors' own comments in the response as to their surprise at some of the results and their inconsistency with the model.</p><p>Even if the authors were to identify the correct metal to which the protein responds, there are still fundamental issues with experimental design and interpretation that would need to be addressed to indicate any link between the protein and chemotaxis.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.100914.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>He</surname><given-names>Meina</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Huazhong Agricultural University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Wuhan</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Tao</surname><given-names>Yongxin</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Huazhong Agricultural University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Wuhan</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Mu</surname><given-names>Kexin</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Huazhong Agricultural University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Wuhan</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Feng</surname><given-names>Haoqi</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Huazhong Agricultural University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Wuhan</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Fan</surname><given-names>Ying</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Huazhong Agricultural University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Wuhan</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Tong</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Huazhong Agricultural University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Wuhan</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Huang</surname><given-names>Qiaoyun</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Huazhong Agricultural University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Wuhan</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Xiao</surname><given-names>Yujie</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Huazhong Agricultural University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Wuhan</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Wenli</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Huazhong Agricultural University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Wuhan</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authorsâ response to the original reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>This report contains two parts. In the first part, several experiments were carried out to show that CsoR binds to CheA, inhibits CheA phosphorylation, and impairs P. putida chemotaxis. The second part provides some evidence that CsoR is a copper-binding protein, binds to CheA in a copper-dependent manner, and regulates P. putida response to copper, a chemorepellent. Based on these results, a working model is proposed to describe how CsoR coordinates chemotaxis and resistance to copper in P. putida. While the second part of the study is relatively solid, there are some major concerns about the first part.</p><p>Critiques:</p><p>(1) The rigor from prior research is not clear. In addition to talking about other bacterial chemotaxis, the Introduction should briefly summarize previous work on P. putida chemotaxis and copper resistance.</p></disp-quote><p>We summarized previous results on <italic>P. putida</italic> copper resistance and added those results to the introduction section of the revised manuscript. As for chemotaxis, most studies in <italic>P. putida</italic> focused on the sensing/responding of the bacteria to different chemical compounds and the methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins (MCPs) involved in the sensing, which is not relevant to the main content of this study. The component of the chemotaxis system in <italic>P. putida</italic> is similar to that in <italic>E. coli</italic>, and the signaling mechanism is presumably similar.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The rationale for identifying those CheA-binding proteins is vague. CheA has been extensively studied and its functional domains (P1 to P5) have been well characterized. Compared to its counterparts from other bacteria, does P. putida CheA contain a unique motif or domain? Does CsoR bind to other bacterial CheAs or only to P. putida CheA?</p></disp-quote><p>The original purpose of the pull-down assay was to detect the interaction between CheA and c-di-GMP metabolizing enzymes, which was another project. However, we ignored that most c-di-GMP metabolizing enzymes were membrane proteins, and we made a mistake by using whole-cell lysate in the pull-down experiment. Thus, we failed to identify c-di-GMP metabolizing enzymes in âtargetâ proteins of the pull-down assay. However, we found several novel âtargetâ proteins in the pull-down assay. We wondered about the function of these proteins and the physiological roles of the interaction between CheA and these proteins, which was the primary purpose of this study. Although the function of CheA has been well characterized, most previous results focused on the role of CheA in chemotaxis, and its role in other bacterial processes was poorly studied. To extend our knowledge about CheA, we analyzed the results of the pull-down assay and decided to test the interaction between CheA and identified proteins, as well as the physiological roles of the interaction.</p><p>BLAST results showed that the CheA of <italic>P. putida</italic> shared 41.12% sequence similarity with the CheA of <italic>E. coli</italic>, and the CheA of <italic>P. putida</italic> had a similar domain pattern to those CheAs from other bacteria. To test whether CsoR<sub>P. putida</sub> interacted with CheA from other bacteria, we performed a BTH assay to investigate the interaction between CsoR<sub>P. putida</sub> and eight CheAs, including CheA from <italic>E. coli</italic>, CheA from <italic>A. caldus</italic>, CheA from <italic>B. diazoefficiens</italic>, CheA from <italic>B. subtilis</italic>, CheA from <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic>, CheA from <italic>P. fluorescens</italic>, CheA from <italic>P. syringae</italic>, and CheA from <italic>P. stutzeri</italic>. As shown in the following Fig. 1, CsoR<sub>P. putida</sub> could interact with CheA from <italic>A. caldus</italic>, <italic>B. subtilis</italic>, <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic>, <italic>P. fluorescens</italic>, <italic>P. syringae</italic>, and <italic>P. stutzeri</italic>.

We previously tested the interaction of the two proteins from these bacterial species. The results showed that the CheA-CsoR interaction existed between proteins from <italic>A. caldus</italic>, <italic>B. subtilis</italic>, <italic>P. syringae</italic>, and <italic>P. stutzeri</italic> (Fig. 7 in the manuscript). However, CheA and CsoR from <italic>B. diazoefficiens</italic>, <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic>, and <italic>P. fluorescens</italic> showed no apparent interaction (Fig. 7 in the manuscript). These results suggested that unique amino acid sequences in the two proteins might be required to achieve interaction.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Line 133-136, &quot;Collectively, using pull-down, BTH, and BiFC assays, we identified 16 new CheA-interacting proteins in P. putida.&quot; It is surprising that so many proteins were identified but none of them were chemotaxis proteins, in particular those known to interact with CheA, such as CheW, CheY and CheZ, which raises a concern about the specificity of these methods.

In the cited reference (reference 29), bacterial response to phenol was measured using a response index (RI).</p></disp-quote><p>Except for CsoR, the rest of the CheA-interacting proteins had no direct connection with copper and were involved in different processes (Table S1). A reasonable speculation is that these proteins involved in different processes can integrate signals from specific processes into chemotaxis by regulating CheA autophosphorylation, leading to better regulation of chemotaxis according to intracellular physiological state. We used semisolid nutrient agar plates to test and compare bacterial chemotaxis ability. In a fixed attractant/repellent gradient, chemokine, such as copper, can lead to two subpopulations traveling at different speeds, with the slower one being held back by the chemokinetic drift. In the case of semisolid plate migration, bacteria with chemotaxis ability formed large colonies by generating their gradient by consuming nutrients/producing toxic metabolic waste and following attractant/repellent gradients leading outward from the colony origin (Cremer et al., 2019. Nature 575:658â663). The observation of successive sharp circular bands (rings) progressing outward from the inoculation point was taken to confirm the chemotaxis genotype, and mutants without chemotaxis spread out uniformly and formed a small colony (Wolfe and Berg, PNAS. 1989, 86:6973-6977). In our experiment, we were unsure about the signals/chemokines of each target protein, so we could not design a fixed attractant/repellent gradient. Besides, all target proteins interacted with CheA, which is a crucial factor in chemotaxis, and we assume that these proteins would affect chemotaxis under overexpression conditions. Thus, we used semisolid nutrient plates to test and compare bacterial chemotaxis ability.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) Figures 2 and 3 show both CsoR and PhaD bind to CheA and inhibit CheA autophosphorylation. Do these two proteins share any sequence or structural similarity? Does PhaD also bind to copper? Otherwise, it is difficult to understand these results.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks a lot. This is an enlightening comment. CsoR is a protein with a size of 10.8 kDa, and PhaD is 23.1 kDa. Because of the difference in size, we took it for granted that the two proteins were not similar. We recently compared their sequence on NCBI BLAST. Although both CsoR and PhaD are transcriptional regulators and interact with CheA, they have no significant sequence similarity. In terms of protein structure, we predicted their structures using AlphaFold. The results showed that CsoR consisted of three Î±-helixes and PhaD consisted of nine Î±-helixes (new Fig. S5a and S5b in the manuscript). We further compared their structure using Pymol but found no significant similarity between the two proteins (new Fig. S5c in the manuscript).</p><p>PhaD is a TetR family transcriptional regulator located adjacent to the genes involved in PHA biosynthesis, and it behaves as a carbon source-dependent activator of the <italic>pha</italic> cluster related to polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) biosynthesis (de Eugenio et al., Environ Microbiol. 2010, 12:1591-1603; Tarazona et al., Environ Microbiol. 2020, 22:3922-3936). Bacterial PHAs are isotactic polymers synthesized under unfavorable growth conditions in the presence of excess carbon sources. PHAs are critical in central metabolism, acting as dynamic carbon reservoirs and reducing equivalents (Gregory et al., Trends Mol Med. 2022, 28:331-342). The interaction between PhaD and CheA leads us to speculate that there might be some connection between PHA synthesis and bacterial chemotaxis. For example, chemotaxis helps bacteria move towards specific carbon sources that favor PHA synthesis, and the interaction between PhaD and CheA weakens chemotaxis, causing bacteria to linger in areas rich in these carbon sources. This is an interesting hypothesis worth testing in the future.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) Line 195-196, &quot;CsoR/PhaD had no apparent influence on the phosphate transfer between CheA and CheY&quot;.

Thus, the effect of CsoR/PhaD on CheA autophosphorylation happened through the assay, and a significant inhibition effect was observed in the final result. Regarding transphosphorylation, CheA was mixed with ATP and incubated for about 30 min, at which time the autophosphorylation of CheA happened. Then, CsoR/PhaD and CheY were added to the phosphorylated CheA to investigate transphosphorylation. CsoR and PhaD affected chemotaxis via inhibiting CheA autophosphorylation, which was a crucial step in chemotaxis signaling, and the decrease in CheA autophosphorylation caused decreased chemotaxis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) Figure 3 shows that CsoR/PhaD bind to CheA through P1, P3, and P4. This result is intriguing. All CheA proteins contain these three domains. If this is true, CsoR/PhaD should bind to other bacterial CheAs too. That said, this experiment is premature and needs to be confirmed by other approaches.</p></disp-quote><p>As replied to comment (2) above, we performed a BTH assay to investigate whether CsoR<sub>P. putida</sub> interacts with CheA from other bacterial species.

This result suggested that CheA-CsoR interaction required specific/unique amino acid sequence patterns in the two proteins, and similar domain composition alone was insufficient.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(8) Figure 5, does PhaD contain these three residues (C40, H65, and C69)?

The size of the two proteins is also quite different (CsoR 10.8 kDa, PhaD 23.1 kDa). The structure alignment also revealed no apparent similarity between the predicted structures of PhaD and CsoR (new Fig. S5c in the manuscript). Nevertheless, CsoR and PhaD interacted with CheA through its P1, P3, and P4 domains. It is interesting how the two proteins interacted with CheA, but we currently have no answer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(9) Does deletion of cosR or cheA have any impact on P. putida resistance to high concentrations of copper?</p></disp-quote><p>No, deletion of <italic>cosR</italic>/<italic>cheA</italic> had no noticeable impact on <italic>P. putida</italic>'s resistance to high concentrations of copper. We performed a growth assay to test the effect of CsoR and CheA on copper resistance under both liquid and solid medium conditions. The copper concentration was set at 0, 200, 500, 1000 Î¼M. With the increase of copper concentration, the growth of bacteria was gradually inhibited, but the growth trends of <italic>csoR</italic> mutant, <italic>cheA</italic> mutant, and complementary strains were similar to that of the wild-type strain (new Fig. S6b and S6c in the manuscript). We speculated that this might be attributed to CsoR being a repressor and inhibiting gene expression in the absence of copper. When copper existed, the inhibitory effect of CsoR was relieved, which is the same as that in the <italic>csoR</italic> mutant. Besides, although deletion of <italic>cosR</italic> led to a slight increase (about 1.3-fold) in the expression of copper resistance genes (Fig. 4b in the manuscript), its effect on gene expression was much weaker than its homologous protein in other bacterial species. In <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>, <italic>B. subtilis</italic>, <italic>C. glutamicum</italic>, <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic>, and <italic>S. aureus</italic>, deletion of <italic>csoR</italic> resulted in an about 10-fold increase in the expression of target genes in the absence of copper. This difference might be attributed to several vital regulators that activated the expression of copper-resistance genes in response to copper in <italic>P. putida</italic>, such as CueR and CopR (Adaikkalam and Swarup, Microbiology. 2002, 148:2857-2867; Hofmann et al., Int J Mol Sci, 2021, 22:2050; Quintana et al., J Biol Chem, 2017, 292:15691-15704). CueR positively regulated the expression of <italic>cueA</italic>, encoding a copper-transporting P1-type ATPase that played a crucial role in copper resistance. CopR was essential for expressing several genes implicated in cytoplasmic copper homeostasis, such as <italic>copA-II</italic>, <italic>copB-II</italic>, and <italic>cusA</italic>. The existence of these positive regulators makes the function of CosR a secondary or even dispensable insurance in the expression of copper-resistance genes. Consistent with this, there is no CosR homolog in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, and copper homeostasis is mainly controlled by CueR and CopR.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>This manuscript focuses on the apparent involvement of a proposed copper-responsive regulator in the chemotactic response of Pseudomonas putida to Cu(II), a chemorepellent. Broadly, this area is of interest because it could provide insight into how soil microbes mitigate metal stress. Additionally, copper has some historical agricultural use as an antimicrobial, thus can accumulate in soil. The manuscript bases its conclusions on an in vitro screen to identify interacting partners of CheA, an essential kinase in the P. putida chemotaxis-signaling pathway. Much of the subsequent analysis focuses on a regulator of the CsoR/RcnR family (PP_2969).</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The data presented in this work does not support the model (Figure 8). In particular, PP_2969 is linked to Ni/Co resistance, not Cu resistance. Further, it is not clear how the putative new interactions with CheA would be integrated into diverse responses to various chemoattract/repellents. These two comments are justified below.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks a lot for all these comments. Before designing experiments to explore the function of PP_2969, we found three clues: (i) its sequence showed 38% similarity to the copper-responsive regulator CsoR of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>, and the three conserved amino acids essential for copper-binding were conserved in PP_2969; (ii) it located next to a Ni<sup>2+</sup>/Co<sup>2+</sup> transporter (PP_2968) on the genome; (iii) a previous report revealed that PP_2969 (also named MreA) expression increased during metal stress, and overexpression of PP_2969 in <italic>P. putida</italic> and <italic>E. coli</italic> led to metal accumulation (Zn, Cd, and Cr) (Lunavat et al., Curr Microbiol. 2022, 79:142). These clues indicate that the function of PP_2969 is related to metal-binding, but it remains to be explored which metal(s) PP_2969 binds to. Thus, we played MST assay to test the interaction between PP_2969 and metals, including copper (Cu<sup>2+</sup>), zinc (Zn<sup>2+</sup>), nickel (Ni<sup>2+</sup>), cobalt (Co<sup>2+</sup>), cadmium (Cd<sup>2+</sup>), and magnesium (Mg<sup>2+</sup>). The result showed that PP_2969 was bound to three metal ions (Cu<sup>2+</sup>, Zn<sup>2+</sup>, Ni<sup>2+</sup>), and the binding to Cu<sup>2+</sup> was the strongest. Besides, the EMSA assay revealed that Cu<sup>2+</sup>/Ni<sup>2+</sup>/Zn<sup>2+</sup> inhibited the interaction between PP_2969 and promoter DNA, and Cu<sup>2+</sup> showed the most substantial inhibitory effect at the same concentration. These results suggested that PP_2969 was mainly bound to Cu<sup>2+</sup>, followed by Zn<sup>2+</sup> and Ni<sup>2+</sup>. To further test whether PP_2969 functioned as a metal-responsive repressor and which metal resistance was related to its target gene, we constructed a <italic>PP_2969</italic> deletion mutant and complementary strain and performed a qPCR assay to compare the expression of metal resistance-related genes. 14 metal-resistant-related genes were chosen as targets. The results showed that <italic>PP_2969</italic> deletion led to a weak but significant increase (about 1.3-fold) in expression of 10 genes, including three copper-resistance genes (<italic>copA-I</italic>, <italic>copA-II,</italic> and <italic>copB-II</italic>), one nickel-resistance gene (<italic>nikB</italic>), two cadmium-resistance genes (<italic>cadA-I</italic> and <italic>cadA-III</italic>), one cobalt-resistance gene (<italic>cbtA</italic>), and three multiple metal-resistance genes (<italic>czcC-I</italic>, <italic>czcB-II</italic>, and <italic>PP_0026</italic>) (Fig. 4b, Fig. S5a in the manuscript). Meanwhile, complementation with a multicopy plasmid containing the <italic>PP_2969</italic> gene decreased the gene expression in Î<italic>PP_2969</italic>. Although PP_2969 regulated the expression of multiple metal resistance genes, it showed the most robust binding to Cu<sup>2+</sup>. Thus, we considered its primary function as a Cu<sup>2+</sup>-responsive regulator.</p><p>As for the second comment, âHow would the putative new interactions with CheA be integrated into diverse responses to various chemoattract/repellents?â, We have some speculations based on our results and previous reports. For example, PP_2969 interacted with CheA and decreased its autophosphorylation activity, and copper inhibited the interaction between CheA and PP_2969. In the absence of copper, PP_2969 binds to promoters to inhibit the expression of copper resistance genes, and it also binds to CheA to inhibit its autophosphorylation, resulting in lower chemotaxis. When the bacteria move to an area of high copper concentration, PP_2969 binds to copper and falls off the DNA promoter, leading to higher expression of copper resistance genes. Meanwhile, copper-binding of PP_2969 decreases its interaction with CheA, increasing CheA autophosphorylation promoting chemotaxis, and bacteria swim away from the high copper concentration. Another attractive target protein is PhaD, a TetR family transcriptional regulator located adjacent to the genes involved in PHA biosynthesis, and it behaves as a carbon source-dependent activator of the <italic>pha</italic> cluster related to polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) biosynthesis (de Eugenio et al., Environ Microbiol. 2010, 12:1591-1603; Tarazona et al., Environ Microbiol. 2020, 22:3922-3936). Bacterial PHAs are isotactic polymers synthesized under unfavorable growth conditions in the presence of excess carbon sources. PHAs are critical in central metabolism, acting as dynamic carbon reservoirs and reducing equivalents (Gregory et al., Trends Mol Med. 2022, 28:331-342). The interaction between PhaD and CheA leads us to speculate that there might be some connection between PHA synthesis and bacterial chemotaxis. For example, chemotaxis helps bacteria move towards particular carbon sources that favor PHA synthesis; the regulator PhaD activates the genes related to PHA synthesis. Meanwhile, the interaction between PhaD and CheA weakens chemotaxis, causing bacteria to linger in areas rich in these carbon sources. Collectively, we speculate that by interacting with CheA and modulating its autophosphorylation, target proteins such as CsoR/PhaD integrate signals from their original process pathway into chemotaxis signaling.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>PP_2969</p><p>(1) The authors present a sequence alignment (Figure S5) that is the sole basis for their initial assignment of this ORF as a CsoR protein.

The previous JBact study (J. Bact 2009 doi:10.1128/JB.00465-09) named PP_2968 as MrdH, and <italic>mrdH</italic> disruption led to sensitivity to cadmium, zinc, nickel, and cobalt, but not copper. Their results also revealed that MrdH was a broad-spectrum metal efflux transporter with a substrate range including Cd<sup>2+</sup>, Zn<sup>2+</sup>, and Ni<sup>2+</sup>. However, the role of MrdH in Cu<sup>2+</sup> efflux was not tested. Commonly, metal efflux transporter has a broad substrate spectrum, allowing transporters to influence bacterial resistance to a variety of metals (Munkelt et al., J Bacteriol. 2004, 186:8036-8043; Grass et al., J Bacteriol. 2005, 187:1604-1611; Nies et al., J Ind Microbiol. 1995, 14:186-199; Kelley et al., Metallomics. 2021, 13:mfaa002).

We were confused about these results. Why was the effect of PP_2969 on gene expression so weak? Did we pick the wrong target genes? In other bacteria, deletion of <italic>csoR</italic> led to an about ten-fold increase in gene expression, generally equivalent to the de-repression observed in the presence of metal. Thus, to further identify target genes, we performed RNA-seq to compare the gene expression in WT and Î<italic>PP_2969</italic> without copper. The result surprised us because no gene expression levels changed more than two-fold (data not shown). This result might be attributed to several vital regulators that activated the expression of metal-resistance genes in response to metal in <italic>P. putida</italic>, such as CueR and CopR (Adaikkalam and Swarup, Microbiology. 2002, 148:2857-2867; Hofmann et al., Int J Mol Sci, 2021, 22:2050; Quintana et al., J Biol Chem, 2017, 292:15691-15704).

The MTS assay and resulting affinities are not physiologically relevant.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this enlightening comment. This question also confused us during our experiment. The first study on CsoR from <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> showed that CsoR bound a single-monomer mole equivalent of Cu(I) to form a trigonally coordinated complex, and that was a convincing result from protein structure analysis (Liu et al., Nat Chem Biol. 2007, 3:60-68). They further revealed that the presence of Cu(I) in the EMSA assay abolished the DNA-binding ability of CsoR, but the impact of Cu(II) was not tested. Besides, their results also showed that adding CuCl<sub>2</sub> in the medium induced the expression of the <italic>cso</italic> operon involved in copper resistance. Perhaps Cu(II) converted to Cu(I) and then bound to CsoR in bacterial cells. Later studies in diverse bacterial species (including <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic>, <italic>Corynebacterium glutamicum</italic>, <italic>Deinococcus radiodurans</italic>, and <italic>Thermus thermophilus</italic>) showed that <italic>in vitro</italic> assays with Cu(II) abolished the DNA-binding ability of CsoR, indicating that CsoR bound to both Cu (I) and Cu(II) (Corbett et al., Mol Microbiol. 2011, 81:457-472; Teramoto et al., Biosci Biotechnol Biochem. 2012, 76:1952-1958; Zhao et al., Mol Biosyst. 2014, 10:2607-2616; Sakamoto et al., Microbiology. 2010, 156:1993-2005). Here, our results from <italic>in vitro</italic> assays (MST and EMSA) showed that CsoR bound to Cu(II) and Cu(II) affected the interaction between CsoR and promoter DNA. Compounds containing Cu(I) are poorly soluble in water and easily oxidized by Cu(II). DTT can reduce Cu(II) to Cu(I) (Krzel et al., J Inorg Biochem. 2001, 84:77-88). To test whether Cu(I) bound to CsoR and affected its DNA-binding ability, we recently performed an EMSA assay with the addition of CuCl<sub>2</sub>/DTT/CuCl<sub>2</sub>+DTT. As shown in Fig. 4d, the addition of DTT (0.1 and 1 mM) decreased CsoR-DNA interaction in the presence of 0.2 mM CuCl<sub>2</sub>, while the addition of DTT alone had no apparent influence on CsoR-DNA interaction, indicating that DTT enhanced the inhibition of CuCl<sub>2</sub> on CsoR-DNA interaction, and the Cu(I) converted from Cu(II) by DTT had stronger inhibitory effect than Cu(II) on CsoR-DNA interaction. Together, these results suggested that CsoR bound to Cu(I) more strongly than it bound to Cu(II). We have added these results to the new version of manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) The DNA-binding assays are carried out at protein concentrations well above physiological ranges (Figures 5c and d, and S5c, d).

We considered that the <italic>in vitro</italic> DNA-binding assay was only a mimic of the <italic>in vivo</italic> process, and the extracellular physiological conditions in EMSA might restrict the activity of CsoR. Besides, we recently performed EMSA to investigate the interaction between CsoR and its own promoter (<italic>csoR</italic>pro).

The initial purpose of this research was to identify new CheA-interacting proteins to broaden our knowledge of CheA and bacterial chemotaxis. Thus, we are currently focusing on the effect of the interaction on CheA and chemotaxis and trying to find the link between different processes and bacterial chemotaxis. We infer that the interaction between these new interacting partners and CheA can integrate signals from different pathways into the chemotaxis signaling pathway so that bacteria can better sense and adapt to different environments. Besides, the other role of the interaction, which is the influence of CheA on these new interacting partners, is also an exciting question that remains to be answered. Among the 16 new CheA-interacting proteins, five showed significant influence on chemotaxis, and the remaining 11 proteins had no obvious impact on chemotaxis (Fig. 2a in the manuscript). CsoR and PhaD inhibited CheA autophosphorylation, and here we focused on the effect of CsoR on chemotaxis. We also investigated the impact of CheA on CsoR, such as gene regulation and copper resistance. However, the results showed that CheA had no obvious influence on these functions of CsoR. The interactions between CheA and these proteins may be physiologically biased, with some interactions affecting the function of CheA and others mainly affecting the function of partners. Future studies on the function of these new CheA-interacting proteins and the role of CheA in regulating their functions would further expand our knowledge of CheA.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) How much CheA is present in the cell (copies) and how many copies of other proteins are present? How would specific responses involving individual interacting partners be possible with such a heterogenous pool of putative CheA-complexes in a cell? For PP_2969, the affinity reported (Figure 5A) may lay at the upper end of the CsoR concentration range (for example, CueR in <italic>Salmonella</italic> is present at ~40 nM).</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this insightful comment. We donât know the copy number of CheA and other proteins in the cell. We were also initially surprised and felt skeptical about the reliability of CheA interaction with so many proteins. CheA interacts with CheY, CheW, and CheB in the classical chemotaxis pathway. This study found 16 new CheA-interacting proteins using pull-down assay and subsequent analysis. Moreover, in another unpublished result, we found that CheA interacted with eight c-di-GMP-metabolizing proteins, and CheA transferred the phosphate group to one of them. Together, it seemed that CheA could interact with at least 27 proteins. With such a heterogeneous pool of CheA-complexes, performing a specific response seemed difficult. However, several previous studies have reported the example of one protein interacting with dozens of proteins. For example, the c-di-GMP effector LapD in <italic>Pseudomonas fluorescens</italic> and <italic>Pseudomonas putida</italic> can interact with a dozen different c-di-GMP-metabolizing proteins (Giacalone et al., mBio. 2018, 9:e01254-18; Nie et al., Mol Microbiol. 2024, 121:1-17.) In <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, a subset of DGCs and PDEs operated as central interaction hubs in a larger âsupermoduleâ by interacting with dozens of proteins (Sarenko et al., mBio. 2017, 8:e01639-17). We infer that the expression of different CheA-interacting proteins might happen at different growth stages or under different conditions, and their interaction with CheA under that stage/condition changed bacterial chemotaxis or the process in which the target protein was involved.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) The two-hybrid system experiment uses a long growth time (60 h) before analysis. Even low LacZ activity levels will generate a blue color, depending upon growth medium (see doi: 10.1016/0076-6879(91)04011-c).

The BTH experiment was described as follows: After transforming the two plasmids into <italic>E. coli</italic> BTH101 cells, the plates containing transformants were placed at 28Â° for 48 h, at which time the colonies of the transformants were big enough to be picked up and incubated in a liquid medium for 24 h at 28Â°. Then, 5 Î¼L of the culture was spotted onto an LB agar plate supplemented with antibiotics, X-gal, and IPTG and incubated for 60 h at 28Â° before taking the photos. After the photos were taken, the bacteria on the plate were scraped off and resuspended with buffer, and then the LacZ activity of the bacteria was tested. According to our experience, culture at 28Â°(lower than 30Â°) is a critical condition, and we have not observed false positives in BTH assays under this condition.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>In addition to genetic and biochemical approaches, structural studies should be conducted to elucidate the molecular interaction between CheA and CsoR with/without copper.</p><p>It would be more logical to first establish the role of CsoR in copper regulation and chemotaxis (the second part of this report) and then investigate its underpinning mechanism (the first part).</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for these recommendations. Structural analysis can reveal more details about the molecular mechanism of CheA-CsoR interaction, but we currently donât have sufficient experimental conditions for such structural analysis.</p><p>As for the presentation logic of the results, we wrote the manuscript following the sequence of experiments. Firstly, screening of CheA interacting proteins (pull-down assay) was conducted, and then the influence of interacting proteins on the chemotaxis of strains and CheA autophosphorylation activity was detected. Based on these results, we obtained two proteins, CsoR and PhaD, and decided to go deeper into the function of CsoR and its effect on chemotaxis. We considered that this writing logic reflected our research design better and could also lay a foundation for future exploration of the functions of other interacting proteins and the physiological significance of interactions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>A huge amount of effort has gone into this work.</p><p>It would be good to see at least one of the newly identified interactions turn out to be physiologically relevant.</p><p>The experimental tools appear to be available to do this, but it is critical to consider how these tools can lead to attempts to prove rather than test and possibly refute a model or hypothesis.

Our study aimed to screen new interacting proteins of CheA and explore how new interacting proteins affect CheA activity and bacterial chemotaxis, thereby broadening our understanding of chemotaxis. However, the impact of each protein-protein interaction has two sides: the influence of A to B and B to A. During experimental design, we focused more on the influence of identified interacting proteins on CheA function and chemotaxis but paid less attention to the function of interacting proteins and the influence of the interaction on their function. Moreover, our study found that the influence of protein-protein interaction was biased. In the interaction between CsoR and CheA, CsoR mainly affected the function of CheA and then affected the chemotaxis, while CheA had no significant effect on the function of CsoR. This might be attributed to the weak effect of CsoR in regulating metal resistance in <italic>P. putida</italic>, and we speculated that this interaction was more about favoring the sensing and avoiding metal stress. In addition, we planned to explore the interaction between CheA and another interacting protein (PhaD) in the future, reveal the effect of the interaction on PhaD function (regulation of PHAS synthesis in bacteria), and explore the effect of the interaction on CheA function and chemotaxis, to find out whether the association existed between PHAS anabolism and bacterial chemotaxis. Besides, for those proteins that did not have significant effects on CheA autophosphorylation and bacterial chemotaxis, we speculated that CheA might affect their function/activity through interactions, which meant that the physiological effects of the interaction mainly reflected through the interacting protein rather than CheA. These are speculations that need to be tested by experiments.</p></body></sub-article></article>
