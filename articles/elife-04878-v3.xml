objects. The neural mechanism used to recognize objects as prey remains largely unknown. We devised a machine learning behavior classification system to quantify hunting kinematics in semi-restrained animals exposed to a range of virtual stimuli. Two-photon calcium imaging revealed a small visual area, AF7, that was activated specifically by the optimal prey stimulus. This pretectal region is innervated by two types of retinal ganglion cells, which also send collaterals to the optic tectum. Laser ablation of AF7 markedly reduced prey capture behavior. We identified neurons with arbors in AF7 and found that they projected to multiple sensory and premotor areas: the optic tectum, the nucleus of the medial longitudinal fasciculus (nMLF) and the hindbrain. These findings indicate that computations in the retina give rise to a visual stream which transforms sensory information into a directed prey capture response.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.04878.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04878.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04878.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Our ability to recognize objects, and to respond instinctively to them, is something that is not fully understood. For example, seeing your favorite dessert could trigger an irresistible urge to eat it. Yet precisely how the image of the dessert could trigger an inner desire to indulge is a question that has so far eluded scientists. This compelling question also applies to the animal kingdom. Predators often demonstrate a typical hunting behavior upon seeing their prey from a distance. But just how the image of the prey triggers this hunting behavior is not known.</p><p>Semmelhack et al. have now investigated this question by looking at the hunting behavior of zebrafish larvae. The larvae's prey is a tiny microbe that resembles a small moving dot. When the larvae encounter something that looks like their prey, they demonstrate a hardwired hunting response towards it. The hunting behavior consists of a series of swimming maneuvers to help the larvae successfully capture their prey.</p><p>Semmelhack et al. used prey decoys to lure the zebrafish larvae, and video recordings to monitor the larvae's response. During the recordings, the larvae were embedded in a bed of jelly with only their tails free to move. The larvae's tail movements were recorded, and because the larvae are completely transparent, their brain activity could be visually monitored at the same time using calcium dyes.</p><p>Using this approach, Semmelhack et al. identified a specific area of the brain that is responsible for triggering the larvae's hunting behavior. It turns out that this brain region forms a circuit that directly connects the retina at the back of the eye to nerve centers that control hunting maneuvers. So when the larva sees its prey, this circuit could directly trigger the larva's hunting behavior. When the circuit was specifically destroyed with a laser, this instinctive hunting response was impaired.</p><p>These findings suggest that predators have a distinct brain circuit that hardwires their hunting response to images of their prey. Future studies would involve understanding precisely how this circuit coordinates the larvae's complex hunting behavior.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.04878.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04878.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>visual system</kwd><kwd>behavior</kwd><kwd>retinal ganglion cell</kwd><kwd>pretectum</kwd><kwd>optic tectum</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004189</institution-id><institution>Max-Planck-Gesellschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Baier</surname><given-names>Herwig</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000053</institution-id><institution>National Eye Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EY12406 &amp; EY13855</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Baier</surname><given-names>Herwig</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005237</institution-id><institution>Helen Hay Whitney Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Semmelhack</surname><given-names>Julia L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A subset of retinal ganglion cells respond specifically to small moving objects and project to a visual area that plays a key role in prey capture behavior.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The visual systems of many species have an innate capacity to respond to features that denote either prey or predators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Olberg et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ewert et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Simmons et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Yilmaz and Meister, 2013</xref>). However, the circuits underlying these responses are mostly unknown. Zebrafish larvae have an instinctive ability to hunt small moving prey objects, such as paramecia, as soon as they start to swim at five days post fertilization (5 dpf). Before initiating a prey capture swim, a larva must select the target from its surroundings, calculate its location, and make a decision as to whether the target is worth pursuing. It then initiates a multi-step motor routine involving bouts of turning and swimming toward the prey, culminating in a consummatory strike (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Budick and O'Malley, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Borla et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gahtan et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">McElligott and O'Malley, 2005</xref>). Precise maneuvers are required, and so prey capture tail movements are quite different from those observed during routine swims or escapes. To orient towards a paramecium on the left or right, larvae perform j-turns—unilateral bends where the tail is held in a J shape. If the prey is directly ahead, they slowly swim toward it, with back and forth undulations of the tail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Patterson et al., 2013</xref>). These movements appear to be triggered by small moving objects, but it is unclear how or where in the brain these objects are identified as prey.</p><p>Under the appropriate conditions, larvae can be induced to perform hunting swims when they are partially restrained in agarose. A head-fixed preparation facilitates automated tracking of tail movements, stimulus control, and functional imaging. Two recent studies have shown that a moving dot can evoke eye convergence and approach swims in head-fixed larvae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bianco et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Trivedi and Bollmann, 2013</xref>). However, these studies did not investigate the specific tail kinematics evoked by prey stimuli, or seek to categorize the tail movements as distinct from other types of swims. Here, we identified the distinctive features of prey capture swims in head fixed larvae, and developed a machine learning algorithm to quantify and distinguish these swims from other types of behavior. This allowed us to quantify the tail movements produced in response to a range of artificial prey stimuli, and determine the ideal stimulus to evoke the prey capture response.</p><p>To begin to identify the neural circuits for prey identification, we focused on the retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), the output neurons of the retina. There is a precedent for RGCs acting as prey detectors—a classic study in the frog found RGCs that responded to small (1–3°) objects moving through the visual field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lettvin et al., 1959</xref>). In the mammalian visual system, certain RGC types act as feature detectors for one aspect of the visual scene, and the axons of these RGCs project to visual nuclei that mediate the response to that feature. For example, intrinsically photosensitive RGCs project to nuclei that control circadian rhythms and the pupillary light reflex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2011</xref>), and RGCs that respond to whole field motion innervate nuclei that drive compensatory eye movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Simpson, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dhande et al., 2013</xref>). In zebrafish, RGC axons terminate in ten retinorecipient areas called arborization fields (AFs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Burrill and Easter, 1994</xref>), most of which have not been functionally characterized. We hypothesized that there could be a class of RGCs that respond specifically to prey-like visual stimuli and project to one or more of these AFs.</p><p>By imaging RGC axons in the AFs, we identified one visual area, AF7, which responds specifically to the optimal artificial prey stimulus, as well as to actual paramecia. Targeted laser ablation showed that this area is important for the behavior. Finally, we found that neurons with arbors in the AF7 neuropil innervate multiple areas known to be involved in prey capture behavior and locomotion in general—the optic tectum, nMLF, and hindbrain. These results identify AF7 as vital part of the prey capture pathway, and link a dedicated retinal output to an ecologically relevant behavior.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Analysis and classification of prey capture swims</title><p>To investigate how prey objects are identified, we developed a head-fixed prey capture assay and automated behavioral classification system. Larvae were embedded in agarose at 6 dpf, and their tails were freed so that swimming movements could be recorded with a high-speed camera. Visual stimulation was provided by a small OLED screen in front of the larva. In preliminary experiments, we found that a small (∼3° of the visual field) white dot moving horizontally across a black screen was effective in evoking behavior. Larvae performed two types of behavior in response to this virtual prey: forward swims, which consisted of low amplitude oscillations of the tail, and j-turns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">McElligott and O'Malley, 2005</xref>). These swims were accompanied by eye convergence, which is another kinematic feature of prey capture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bianco et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Patterson et al., 2013</xref>). Larvae also performed spontaneous swims in the absence of visual stimuli. To analyze tail movements, we digitized the tail, using a custom algorithm to assign ∼40 points along its length in each frame (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Plotting the position of the tip of the tail during prey capture and spontaneous swims over time revealed several kinematic differences between the behaviors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Prey capture forward swims and spontaneous swims both consist of back and forth movements of the tail, but the amplitude of the prey capture swim is much lower. In contrast, during a j-turn the tail is deflected to one side, often for hundreds of milliseconds.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04878.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Head-fixed larvae respond to virtual prey with distinctive swimming movements.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Overlay of 50 frames (167 ms) of high-speed video showing examples of behavior in head fixed larvae.

The average amplitude of the tail movements for prey capture bouts was 17% of tail length, while for spontaneous swims it was 48% of tail length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). We also observed the sustained tail deflections characteristic of j-turns. Plotting the duration of the longest tail deflection for each bout reveals a single peak at 27 ms for the spontaneous swims (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). For prey capture swims, we also see a peak at this duration, representing the back and forth motion during forward swims, but in addition we see a long shoulder of turns of much longer duration, which consists of j-turns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). These stark differences suggest that prey detection triggers a specialized motor program.</p><p>In order to characterize the stimuli that evoke prey capture, we needed an objective method to quantify the behavior and distinguish it from spontaneous swims. We used a support vector machine (SVM), a supervised learning algorithm that allows for multi-dimensional classification, to train a classifier, which could then categorize new data. For this classification, prey capture forward swims and j-turns were not distinguished; both were included within the category of prey capture.</p><p>We trained the SVM on a set of 369 expert-labeled and digitized videos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Bouts of swimming within the videos were identified using a thresholding operation on the smoothed derivative of the tail bend angle. For the dimensions of the SVM, we choose relatively simple parameters that allowed us to collapse a feature of the bout (e.g. tail curvature) into a single number. During training, each bout was assigned a position in 5-dimensional space corresponding to its values for the 5 parameters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), and decision boundaries were drawn in multidimensional space to separate the two types of behavior. The trained SVM could then be used to classify new videos. Using this approach, we were able to achieve a cross-validated accuracy of 96% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Identifying the ideal prey stimulus</title><p>We next used the virtual prey assay and the SVM classifier to determine the ideal stimulus for evoking prey capture behavior. We presented head-fixed larvae with white dots ranging in size from 0.5–30° in diameter, while recording tail movements. To quantify the behavior, we used the trained SVM to identify swim bouts as prey capture or spontaneous swims. We calculated a prey capture score based on the percentage of time during each trial that the larva performed prey capture bouts. We found that a 3° dot was the optimal size to trigger prey capture (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>), and that the behavior was strikingly reduced when we increased the size to 10° (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), which is consistent with data from free swimming and head-fixed larvae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bianco et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Trivedi and Bollmann, 2013</xref>). We also tested the response to dots traveling at a wide range of speeds, and found that 90°/s is the ideal speed for prey stimuli, and that larvae respond minimally to stimuli moving slower than 12°/s or faster than 360°/s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).<media content-type="glencoe play-in-place height-250 width-310" id="media1" mime-subtype="avi" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-04878-media1.avi"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04878.005</object-id><label>Video 1.</label><caption><title>Prey capture in response to virtual prey.</title><p>A head-fixed larva responds to a 3° dot moving at 90°/s.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.04878.005">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04878.005</ext-link></p></caption></media><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04878.006</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Prey capture behavior is triggered by dots of a particular size and speed.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Larvae were shown white dots of various sizes moving at 90°/s.

In that case, there should be a population of RGCs that responds specifically to prey. A recent functional imaging study reported responses to prey in the largest AF, the optic tectum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Muto et al., 2013</xref>). However, the tectum receives input from many different types of RGCs, and responds to a wide variety of stimuli other than prey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gabriel et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Nikolaou et al., 2012</xref>), which makes it difficult to determine whether the tectal RGCs are responding selectively to prey. We thus focused our imaging experiments on AFs 1–9. We performed two-photon imaging of RGC axons in larvae with the calcium indicator GCaMP6 driven by an RGC-specific promoter. In these larvae, the ten AFs can be identified as distinct regions of fluorescent neuropil (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,C</xref>). We asked whether the axons in any of these regions would respond to the ideal prey stimulus identified in our behavioral assay (3°, 90°/s). In our preparation, we could image all but the most ventral arborization field, AF1. We stimulated larvae with the prey stimulus while imaging RGC axons in AFs 2–9, and found one area, AF7, whose RGC axons responded robustly to the stimulus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), while seven other AFs did not respond to virtual prey. Some RGC axons in the optic tectum responded to the 3° stimulus, but the tectum response was much larger for stimuli of &gt;10° (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). We next varied the size of the stimulus while imaging in the AF7 plane, and found that AF7 RGC axons responded maximally to dots 2–3° in diameter, and much less to stimuli larger than 6° in diameter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C–I</xref>). Interestingly, AF9, another AF in the same plane, did not respond to small dots but began to respond as the stimulus size was increased above 6° in diameter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C–F</xref>). We also measured the response of AF7 to stimuli of varying speeds, and found that the optimal speed was 90°/s, and stimuli slower than 12°/s or faster than 360°/s evoked a much smaller response in these axons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). These tuning curves are strikingly similar to the behavioral tuning curves for size and speed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>, grey trace in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F,G</xref>). At speeds above 360°/s the strong correlation between behavioral tuning and AF7 response degrades, since the behavioral response to extremely fast speeds is quite low.This could be caused by a threshold or non-linearity in the neural circuit, such as the weak activation of the AF7 RGC axons being insufficient to drive the downstream neurons. We next tested the direction selectivity of the axons in AF7, and found that the area as a whole responded to prey stimuli moving in all four cardinal directions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>), although the response was more robust to stimuli moving horizontally (p &lt; 0.001, <italic>t</italic>-test).<fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04878.007</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Prey stimuli activate RGC axons that project to AF7.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic frontal view of the brain showing AFs.

A subpopulation of RGCs has been previously shown to innervate AF7 and the <italic>stratum opticum</italic> (SO), the most superficial layer of the tectum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Xiao and Baier, 2007</xref>). However, little is known about their dendritic morphology, and it is unclear if these are the only inputs to AF7. We set out to characterize the anatomy of the AF7-targeting RGCs using BGUG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Xiao and Baier, 2007</xref>), a highly variegated <italic>UAS:mGFP</italic> reporter that allows the visualization of individual neurons within a Gal4 line. By expressing mCherry and BGUG in RGCs, we labeled most RGCs red and &lt;1% of them green. We could thus identify single RGCs with arbors in AF7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>) and trace the axon back to the retina to observe the cell’s dendritic morphology. We identified 19 larvae with an arbor in AF7. All 19 RGCs exhibited the same axonal morphology, projecting to AF7 and the SO, but not to any other AFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,B</xref>). Thus, a prey-specific information channel is routed to two distinct visual areas by each axon. Examining the dendritic morphology of these AF7-targeting RGCs revealed that AF7 receives inputs from two distinct RGC types. Thirteen cells (out of 19) had bistratified arbors with branches in ON and OFF layers of the inner plexiform layer (IPL) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>), and the other six formed diffuse arbors spanning the entire IPL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). These dendritic morphologies correspond to two of the 14 RGC classes previously described in the zebrafish retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Robles et al., 2014</xref>), known as B2 and D1 These two types also project to other AFs, in much smaller numbers. However, the B2 and D1 neurons that project to AF7 only arborize in AF7 and the tectum.

We found that, consistent with previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Roeser and Baier, 2003</xref>) the OMR was not impaired in AF7-ablated larvae, but was reduced in AF9-ablated larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>).

Our finding that a subset of RGC axons is tuned to prey stimuli suggests that the selectivity is generated early in the visual pathway, by circuits in the retina. There are examples of retinal circuits that generate a similar degree of stimulus selectivity. Experiments in the rabbit have identified local edge detectors—RGCs that respond only to slowly moving targets less than 1° in diameter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Levick, 1967</xref>), and a similar type has been found in the mouse retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>). The unusually strong surround suppression in these cells is thought to be a consequence of amacrine cells acting presynaptically to inhibit bipolar cells as well as RGCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">van Wyk et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Russell and Werblin, 2010</xref>). A similar mechanism could account for the size tuning of AF7-projecting RGCs.</p><p>In many cases, RGCs detect features that have a clear survival value for the animal. For example, <italic>fast-OFF</italic> RGCs in the salamander anticipate the location of a moving object (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Berry et al., 1999</xref>), a feature that could be used to predict the location of moving prey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Leonardo and Meister, 2013</xref>). A classic study in the frog found RGCs that responded to small (1–3°) objects moving though the visual field; these cells were hypothesized to act as ‘bug detectors’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lettvin et al., 1959</xref>). These examples show that the retina can perform computations to detect ecologically important objects, allowing RGCs to transmit pre-processed information to the brain to coordinate behavior. Our data support a model in which retinal circuitry confers prey selectivity on a subset of RGCs, which transmit this information to two visual areas in the midbrain: AF7 and the SO layer of the optic tectum.</p><p>Based on the axonal branching pattern of its RGCs, we can identify AF7 as the parvocellular superficial pretectal nucleus (PSp). The PSp is a retinorecipient brain area innervated by RGC axons that also form an arbor in the most superficial retinorecipient layer of the tectum in goldfish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Springer and Mednick, 1985</xref>). PSp was one of the two possible adult brain areas suggested for AF7 based on its location in classical dye tracing work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Burrill and Easter, 1994</xref>). This nucleus was originally identified as the homologue of the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) in the mammalian thalamus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Schnitzlein, 1962</xref>), although this is controversial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Northcutt and Butler, 1976</xref>). PSp has been anatomically described in several fish species, and is known to receive topographically organized retinal input (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Springer and Mednick, 1985</xref>), although little functional information is available. Our group has recently demonstrated that AF7/PSp contains a retinotopic map. Most of the RGCs that project to this area reside in the temporal retina, creating a high-resolution representation of the anterior visual field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Robles et al., 2014</xref>). This is the part of the visual environment in which the prey is usually located during prey capture behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Patterson et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Why might it be advantageous to route prey-responsive RGCs to both AF7 and the tectum? One possibility is that tectal neurons are responsible for directing the orienting movements towards a particular point in visual space, while AF7 neurons modulate or gate the tectal output, based on behavioral state (e.g. hunger, arousal). The tectum and its mammalian homologue, the superior colliculus, have been shown to be involved in the transformation of sensory information encoded in terms of visual space into the appropriate motor command (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bergeron et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">du Lac and Knudsen, 1990</xref>). The tectum has also been implicated in zebrafish prey capture in several recent studies. Ablation experiments have shown that the tectal neuropil and, more specifically, inhibitory tectal neurons in the most superficial layer play a role in prey capture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gahtan et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Del Bene et al., 2010</xref>), and functional imaging experiments have found that tectal neurons are activated by moving paramecia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Muto et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, the tectal circuits could translate a prey object’s precise location in visual space into a swimming movement that results in pursuit of the prey.</p><p>We have identified a class of pretectal neurons that have dendrites in the AF7 neuropil and also project to the most rostral fifth of the tectum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A–C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>) which corresponds to the anterior visual field. If the motor map is roughly faithful to the visual map, tectal output neurons in this region could trigger prey capture forward swims. Within the pretectum, the AF7/tectum neurons also have processes in the non-retinorecipient neuropil next to AF7, which most likely corresponds to the magnocellular superficial pretectal nucleus (PSm). We hypothesize that these neurons could be integrating the retinal response to prey with information on behavioral state, and then providing excitatory input to the tectum when appropriate. These AF7 neurons project to a layer of the tectum just ventral to SO, the tectal layer that receives prey-responsive RGC axons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Tectal neurons with dendrites in these superficial layers could thus receive positional information from the raw retinal input in the SO, and excitatory input from the AF7 neurons that would release prey capture behavior only under certain conditions. However, at this point we do not know the response properties or type of neurotransmitter released by these neurons, so we can only speculate as to the input they provide to the tectum.<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04878.016</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Model for prey capture circuitry.</title><p>A prey stimulus on the left activates RGCs in the left eye (blue) which project to AF7 and the SO layer of the right tectum. Pretectal neurons (red) arborize in AF7 and send projections to the tectum or the nMLF and hindbrain. Activation of this circuitry produces a j-turn to the left, turning the larva in the direction of the prey. Previous studies have demonstrated connections between the tectum and nMLF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gahtan et al., 2005</xref>) and between the tectum and hindbrain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Robles et al., 2011</xref>) (gray arrows).</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.04878.016">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04878.016</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-04878-fig8-v3.tif"/></fig></p><p>Modulation of the tectum by other visual areas is a common motif in vertebrate systems, and in many cases suppression or facilitation of tectal activity determines whether a behavioral response will occur. For example, a GABAergic projection from the basal ganglia to the superior colliculus is thought to act as a gate for the saccade-generating neurons of the superior colliculus, providing tonic inhibition whose cessation releases saccade movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Shires et al., 2010</xref>). Another example of tectal modulation is the local cholinergic and global GABAergic feedback to the tectum provided by the isthmic nuclei in birds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Knudsen, 2011</xref>). The focal enhancement by cholinergic input has been shown to be necessary for the transmission of visual information to the area downstream of the tectum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Marín et al., 2007</xref>). Finally, studies of prey capture in toads have identified a pretectal area that provides inhibitory input to the tectum, resulting in the preference for worm-like prey stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ewert et al., 2001</xref>). The sign of this modulation is opposite to that described in our model, but this might be explained by the different types of stimuli being selected by the two systems (i.e., elongated objects moving in the direction of their long axis, vs small moving circles).</p><p>In addition to the class of AF7-innervating neurons that project to the tectum, we found another class which projects bilaterally to the nMLF and contralaterally to the caudal hindbrain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D–F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). The nMLF is a cluster of reticulospinal neurons that are involved in controlling swim orientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Thiele et al., 2014</xref>), as well as speed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Severi et al., 2014</xref>). Two of the identified nMLF cells, MeLr and MeLc, have also been shown to be necessary for successful prey capture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gahtan et al., 2005</xref>). Projections from AF7 to the nMLF could therefore be involved in generating prey capture tail movements. The hindbrain also plays an important role in locomotion. Neurons in the hindbrain project to the spinal cord, and activation of the caudal hindbrain has been shown to drive swimming behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arrenberg et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kimura et al., 2013</xref>). Thus far, the tectum has been considered the main output pathway to premotor centers in zebrafish. However, in other systems, multiple areas project to the premotor nuclei and may drive behavior independently or direct different aspects of a behavior; for example, in primates, both the frontal eye fields and the superior colliculus provide input to the brainstem regions controlling eye movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Scudder et al., 2002</xref>). It remains to be seen what role the neurons projecting from AF7 to the nMLF and hindbrain might play in the various components of prey capture behavior.</p><p>Our results identify a specific pretectal, retinorecipient region as a key component of the prey detection circuit. They also point toward a series of parallel and interconnected pathways between multiple areas involved in this elementary form of object recognition. Finally, they identify potential anatomical links of the visual network to midbrain and hindbrain areas that serve to coordinate the locomotor maneuvers involved in capturing prey. Further studies should shed light on what role each area plays in the behavior and how they interact.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Fish</title><p>Embryos were raised in Danieau's solution (17 mM NaCl, 2 mM KCl, 0.12 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 1.8 mM Ca(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>, 1.5 mM HEPES) at 27.5°C on a 14/10 light/dark cycle.

At 6 dpf, the larvae were embedded in 2.5% low melting point agarose (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, California) in Danieau's solution and positioned 3 mm from the edge of a 35 mm Petri dish lid. After the agarose had set, the dish was filled with Danieau's solution and some of the agarose was cut away, leaving the tail caudal to the swim bladder free to move. After embedding, larvae were kept at 27.5°C for 48 hr. Behavioral experiments were conducted at 8 dpf in a 27.5°C chamber. For virtual prey experiments, larvae with a prey capture score (percent of the trial spent in prey capture bouts) of less than 30% for the 3° stimulus were excluded from the analysis.</p><p>Visual stimuli were designed using a custom program in the Python-based Vision Egg software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Straw, 2008</xref>). The stimulus was a white dot on a black background, moving horizontally from left to right. Stimuli were presented on a 12 × 9 mm OLED Microdisplay (Emagin, Bellevue, WA) covered with three magenta Wratten filters (Edmund Optics, Barrington, NJ) and positioned 1 cm from the larva. Larvae were illuminated from below with an IR light source. We used a high-speed camera (Photonfocus, Switzerland) to record tail movements at 300 frames/second (f/s), with a resolution of 300 × 300 pixels.</p><p>For behavioral experiments with paramecia, we embedded 6 dpf larvae in the center of a 35 mm Petri dish and cut away some of the agarose in front of the eyes by making an incision perpendicular to the body axis 1 mm from the head. The tail below the swim bladder was also freed. As we did for the virtual prey experiments, we waited 48 hr after embedding to test behavior. We added a few drops of paramecia (<italic>Paramecium multimicronucleatum</italic>, Carolina Biological Supply Company, Burlington, NC) to the dish and recorded at 300 f/s for 5 min. The procedure was repeated a few hours after laser ablations. For post-ablation behavioral experiments, the experimenter was blinded as to whether the animal was in the AF7 or AF9 ablation group.</p><p>To test the OMR, each embedded larva was positioned in an arena surrounded by three LED screens (5.5 × 7.5 cm). Gratings moving leftward at 20°/s were displayed on all three screens to produce turns. Stimulus presentation was controlled with a custom LabVIEW script, and tail movements were recorded at 250 f/s. The same procedure was repeated a few hours after laser ablations. To measure the number of swims, we digitized the tail as described below and used a thresholding operation on the smoothed derivative of the tail bend angle to identify swim bouts.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Tail digitization</title><p>We developed a custom Python program that quantifies the tail position in each frame as a series of points, with approximately 40 points covering the tail. The program uses the OpenCV library to load videos. At the start of each video, the user is queried to select the base of the tail. From that point, the program iterates through the tail in each frame, taking a slice through the image where the next tail midpoint is expected to be. This slice is smoothed, convolved with a tail-like kernel, and the maximum is taken to determine the midpoint of the tail. This sequence is repeated until the end of the tail, which is detected using a threshold for change in luminance across the slice. To improve accuracy, the width and contrast of the tail in the first frame of video are characterized and used to refine the tracking for the rest of video.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Support vector machine (SVM)</title><p>The SVM code was written in Python.

To avoid testing and training on the same dataset, we used fivefold stratified cross-validation for training (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kohavi, 1995</xref>). For this validation, data are split into five groups of approximately equal mean. One group is reserved for testing while the others are used for training, and this procedure is repeated five times before the results are combined. We quantified 16 parameters for each bout. A radial basis function (RBF) kernel shape was used to draw the decision boundaries. A subset of the 16 parameters was selected by plotting the accuracy vs number of parameters. The point that maximized performance while minimizing the number of parameters was selected.

Imaging was performed on a movable objective microscope (Sutter, Novato, CA) using a 40× objective (Olympus, Japan). Excitation light was generated by a Ti: Sapphire laser (Coherent, Santa Clara, CA) tuned to 920 nm. Time series were recorded at 3.6 Hz with a resolution of 128 × 128 pixels. We used a red LED to provide some ambient light to the larva during imaging, and we heated the microscope box to 27°C.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Confocal imaging</title><p>In order to record the response to paramecia in RGC axons, we embedded larvae in the center of a dish as for the paramecium behavior experiments and again cut away the agarose in front of the eyes and below the swim bladder. Since bright ambient light was required to allow the larvae to see the paramecia, we performed these imaging experiments on a confocal microscope (Zeiss 780) rather than a two-photon. Time series were acquired at a rate of 3.3 Hz and a resolution of 128 × 128 pixels. Experiments were performed with overhead lights on and a white LED illuminating the dish to enhance the visibility of the prey. Temporal series of the same field of view with and without paramecia were joined together. The resulting stack was registered with StackReg in Fiji to reduce motion artifacts and pixel misalignment between the two acquisitions. From the raw data, ΔF/F was computed pixel-wise by a custom Matlab routine. Because we did not know when a paramecium was within the field of view, we calculated the baseline F for each pixel as the value of that pixel during a period of low activity. This was defined as the eighth percentile of the pixel's fluorescence over a sliding window of 25 frames. Maximum intensity projections of ΔF/F, computed independently for the two segments of the stack (before and after addition of paramecia), were divided to give the ΔF/F ratio between the two conditions for the pseudocolor image shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>. From the ΔF/F maximum intensity projections, the average values over regions of interest corresponding to AF7 and AF9 were computed to compare the activity between the two arborization fields. During the 30 s windows we imaged over, occasional responses were observed in AF7 and AF9 in the absence of paramecia added to the bath. This could be the result of spontaneous activity, or small objects, for example bubbles or debris, floating in the solution.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>RGC anatomy</title><p><italic>UAS:mCherry, BGUG, Islet2b:Gal4</italic> (or <italic>Ath5:Gal4</italic>) larvae were treated with 0.2 mM 1-phenyl-2-thiocarbamide (PTU) from 1 dpf to reduce pigmentation of the retina.

A Z stack of the area was taken 24 hr later to assess completeness of the ablation, and larvae with less than 80% of the volume ablated bilaterally were not used for the analysis.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Eve Marder (Senior editor) and 3 reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Semmelhack and colleagues, in their study in embryonic zebrafish establish that there is a retinal to pretectal connection that seems to convey sensory information from a small subset of retinal ganglion cells about prey items. Elimination of ganglion cell input to this pretectal area, AF7, strongly reduces prey capture behavior. These observations point to an initial sensory pathway that is focused on stimuli that represent prey and convey visual signals to AF7. The authors also attempt to anatomically link the sensory AF7 pathway with brainstem motor command systems. Altogether the authors suggest that they have identified a dedicated sensorimotor pathway for prey detection and capture in larval zebrafish.</p><p>In general the work is interesting. The strong and convincing part of the study is the characterizations of the initial sensory pathway in the prey capture behavior. The importance of study is that it appears to be the first time that feature selective ganglion cells activity has been linked to prey capture behavior outside the tectum. The less convincing part of the study is the link to motor output pathways. Moreover, the results appear to be oversold in places with too strong conclusions based on the available data. It is recommended that the authors' focus on what can clearly be said based on strong evidence and tone down strong statements and discussions based on weak evidence. The details are outlined below in addition to other points for improvements of the manuscript.</p><p>1) The title is: “A dedicated sensorimotor pathway for prey detection and capture in larval zebrafish.” The title is a statement that goes beyond the evidence. The sensory side seems fairly dedicated (although role of tectum needs to be considered), but the evidence for the motor end is weak.</p><p>2) It cannot be concluded, as in the Introduction—“(…) targeted laser ablation showed that this area is necessary for the behavior”— and otherwise, that AF7 is necessary for the behavior. As shown in the Results section, deletion of input to AF7 only reduces the prey capture behavior. Hence, it is not necessary. If the animals can do the prey capture behavior at all without the region then it is cannot be said to be “required”. A balanced discussion for the lack of necessity is required.</p><p>3) Please comment about the mismatch between behavioral response and AF7 at high speeds shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>.</p><p>4) Please clarify if AF7 is only activated in prey capture behavior. For example, are escape responses observed and if so how do they relate to the parameters presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>? Moreover, it seems that there are bigger AF7 responses when paramecia are present, but still there are responses even without paramecia. This would seem to refute the notion that the area is dedicated to prey responses, which is a basic conclusion of the work. If the area is responding when no prey stimuli are there, then the paper should make that clear.</p><p>5) How is the tectum responding to the optimal stimulus? (Please show traces and selectivity, as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F–G</xref>).</p><p>6) There are some ambiguities whether the two ganglion cells that are said to project exclusively to AF7 only project there (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) or if they also project to other AFs. Based on the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> in the authors Current Biology paper (2014), it appears that the two ganglion cell types that project to AF7 also project to other AFs. Please clarify this point.</p><p>7) The link between an anatomical class of ganglion cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) and the prey capture behavior is indirect. In a strict sense the authors have only shown that some ganglion cells activate the AF7 but not the type shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>. This should be clear in the text.</p><p>8) The evidence for output pathways from the pretectal area consists of fills of a few neurons in the vicinity of the pretectal arborization region. It is not known whether the neurons are driven by the stimulus or whether they actually get inputs from the retina or have connections in their projection area. All of the output part, including several paragraphs of the Discussion section, are based on these findings. This is too weak a foundation for the speculations that a dedicated motor output pathway has been identified. Please adjust the text accordingly.</p><p>9) It is too strong to say “pinpoint the anatomical links of the visual network…”, since not all pieces have been found.</p><p>10) The statement “We identified a class of pretectal neurons that could function as a gate for tectal output” is highly speculative. This strong statement cannot be accepted as long as the authors do not provide any indication about the molecular identity of the found AF7-OT connection and the following discussion can be left out.</p><p>Other points for improvements of the manuscript:</p><p>1) Ewert's classic work addressed the innate capacity to respond to prey although in frogs/toads. Please cite his work in the initial opening sentences.</p><p>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> would be stronger by showing some real traces of responses from AF7.</p><p>3) Please comment about the mismatch between behavioral response and AF7 at high speeds shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>.</p><p>4) What is the average size and the swimming speed of paramecia? It would be nice seeing it compared to the optimal behavioral parameters found.</p><p>5) Some more information should be provided about BGUG in the Results section in order to make the anatomy part more easily understandable for the lay reader.</p><p>6) The enlarged LGN in mammals can depend on a number of different causes and it might not be justified to stress the possible homology with the mammalian LGN in the Discussion.</p><p>7) From the sentences “From the raw data, ΔF/F was computed pixel-wise by a custom Matlab routine with F resulting from the eighth percentile of the sample distribution over a sliding window of 25 frames. Maximum intensity projections of ΔF/F, computed independently for the two segments of the stack, were divided to give the ΔF/F ratio between the two conditions” (Materials and methods section), it was hard to understand how exactly the data analysis was done. This needs to be more clearly explained.

Our functional imaging data show that stimuli larger than 10° do not activate AF7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>), which strongly suggests that AF7 is not involved in escape.</p><p><italic>Moreover, it seems that there are bigger AF7 responses when paramecia are present, but still there are responses even without paramecia.

Therefore, we imaged over a relatively long time window (30 s), which ensured that paramecia would appear in the field of view. We then compared the time window with paramecia present to that without. When imaging with GCaMP6s over a long window, spontaneous responses are observed in many brain areas. It is also possible that small items floating in the solution (bubbles, debris) could occasionally activate AF7. We have added text to the Methods section to explain the presence of this activity.</p><p><italic>5) How is the tectum responding to the optimal stimulus?

Please clarify this point</italic>.</p><p>The two types of RGCs (B2 and D1, as classified by dendritic morphology) that project to AF7 also project to other AFs. However, the axonal type that projects to AF7 only innervates AF7 and the SO layer of the tectum. We now clarify these points in the Results section.</p><p><italic>7) The link between an anatomical class of ganglion cells (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"><italic>Figure 5</italic></xref><italic>) and the prey capture behavior is indirect.

This should be clear in the text</italic>.</p><p>It is true that we cannot distinguish whether one or both RGC types projecting to AF7, and shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, are responding to prey, since our Gal4 line labels both types of AF7 RGCs. We have clarified this in the Results.</p><p><italic>8) The evidence for output pathways from the pretectal area consists of fills of a few neurons in the vicinity of the pretectal arborization region.

This is too weak a foundation for the speculations that a dedicated motor output pathway has been identified. Please adjust the text accordingly</italic>.</p><p>The filled neurons we show do have projections to the AF7 neuropil and overlap with the RGC axons of AF7 (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> A, C and D). We currently cannot determine if these neurons are indeed driven by the prey stimulus. We have therefore qualified our statements concerning the dedicated nature of the motor pathway that originates in AF7.

It would be nice seeing it compared to the optimal behavioral parameters found</italic>.</p><p>An accurate calculation of the size and speed of paramecia relative to the larva during prey capture would require careful observation and tracking of both free-swimming larvae and paramecia, and we would argue that this is beyond the scope of the paper. A recent paper from David McLean’s lab described the 2D location of larvae and prey before prey capture bouts, and found that paramecia were roughly 1-3 mm away when detected. Assuming that paramecia are about 150 µm long, that range would be 2-8° of the visual field along the paramecium’s long axis, which fits fairly well with our data.</p><p><italic>5) Some more information should be provided about BGUG in the Results section in order to make the anatomy part more easily understandable for the lay reader</italic>.</p><p>We have added information about BGUG.</p><p><italic>6) The enlarged LGN in mammals</italic> can <italic>depend on a number of different causes and it might not be justified to stress the possible homology with the mammalian LGN in the Discussion</italic>.</p><p>This sentence has been deleted.</p><p><italic>7) From the sentences “From the raw data, ΔF/F was computed pixel-wise by a custom Matlab routine with F resulting from the eighth percentile of the sample distribution over a sliding window of 25 frames.
