While persistently infected, this deermouse is without apparent disability or diminished fitness. For a model for inflammation elicited by various pathogens, the endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was used to compare genome-wide transcription in blood by <italic>P. leucopus</italic>, <italic>Mus musculus,</italic> and <italic>Rattus norvegicus</italic> and adjusted for white cell concentrations. Deermice were distinguished from the mice and rats by LPS response profiles consistent with non-classical monocytes and alternatively-activated macrophages. LPS-treated <italic>P. leucopus</italic>, in contrast to mice and rats, also displayed little transcription of interferon-gamma and lower magnitude fold-changes in type 1 interferon-stimulated genes. These characteristics of <italic>P. leucopus</italic> were also noted in a <italic>Borrelia hermsii</italic> infection model. The phenomenon was associated with comparatively reduced transcription of endogenous retrovirus sequences and cytoplasmic pattern recognition receptors in the deermice. The results reveal a mechanism for infection tolerance in this species and perhaps other animal reservoirs for agents of human disease.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Lyme disease is an illness caused by bacteria that spread from infected animals to humans through tick bites. While most people fully recover after a week or two of antibiotic treatments, some will continue to experience debilitating symptoms due, potentially, to the way their immune system responded to the infection.</p><p>In North America, the white-footed deermouse is one of the most common hosts of the Lyme disease bacteria. Despite its name, this rodent is more closely related to hamsters than to the mice or rats most often used in laboratory studies. Unlike mice and humans, however, deermice carrying Lyme disease bacteria do not get sick; in fact, most deermice living in a Lyme disease region will acquire the infection during their lifetimes, but it has little apparent effect on population numbers. These animals can also better tolerate infection from other microbes.</p><p>To investigate why this is the case, Milovic et al. exposed mice, rats and deermice to a bacterial toxin that triggers inflammation common to encounters with many kinds of microbes. While all species exhibited physical symptoms as a result, blood samples revealed that mice and rats, but not deermice, reacted as if they were infected with viruses as well as bacteria. This was particularly the case for interferons, a group of hormone-like proteins that protect against viruses but can also lead to harmful long-term inflammatory effects. The deermice controlled their interferon responses to the bacterial substance in a way that mice and rats could not.</p><p>Milovic et al. also checked which genes each species switched on after exposure to the toxin. This revealed that, unlike deer mice, rats and mice turned on some DNA sequences called endogenous retroviruses, which have no role in fighting infection from bacteria but can lead to harmful persistent inflammation.</p><p>These results provide elements to better understand why recovery from Lyme disease may differ between people, with some patients retaining symptoms long after their infection has abated. They could also help to better grasp why other diseases, such as COVID-19, can be followed by fatigue and other symptoms of ongoing inflammation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Peromyscus</kwd><kwd>Lyme disease</kwd><kwd>lipopolysaccharide</kwd><kwd>interferons</kwd><kwd>inflammation</kwd><kwd>endogenous retrovirus</kwd><kwd>Borrelia</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AI157513</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Barbour</surname><given-names>Alan G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AI136523</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Barbour</surname><given-names>Alan G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Comparing the white-footed deermouse with mice and rats in an inflammation model reveals a means for the observed infection tolerance in this key animal reservoir for several human diseases.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>How does the white-footed deermouse <italic>Peromyscus leucopus</italic> continue to thrive while sustaining infections with disease agents it serves as reservoir for (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barbour, 2017</xref>) ?

A disadvantage for the study of any <italic>Peromyscus</italic> species is the limited reagents and genetic tools of the sorts that are applied for mouse studies. As an alternative, we study <italic>P. leucopus</italic> with a non-reductionist approach that is comparative in design and agnostic in assumptions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Balderrama-Gutierrez et al., 2021</xref>). The genome-wide expression comparison for <italic>P. leucopus</italic> is with <italic>M. musculus</italic> and, added here, the brown rat <italic>Rattus norvegicus</italic>. Given the wide range of pathogenic microbes that deermice tolerate, we use the bacterial endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS) as the primary experimental treatment because the inflammation it elicits within a few hours has features common to different kinds of serious infections, not to mention severe burns and critical injuries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Xiao et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>We previously reported that a few hours after injection of LPS, <italic>P. leucopus</italic> and <italic>M. musculus</italic> had distinguishing profiles of differentially expressed genes (DEG) in the blood, spleen, and liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Balderrama-Gutierrez et al., 2021</xref>). In brief, the inflammation phenotype of deermice was consistent with an ‘alternatively activated’ or M2-type macrophage polarization phenotype instead of the expected ‘classically activated’ or M1-type polarization phenotype that was observed for <italic>M. musculus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Murray et al., 2014</xref>). The deermice also differed from mice in displaying evidence of greater neutrophil activation and degranulation after LPS exposure. The potentially damaging action from neutrophil proteases and reactive oxygen species appeared to be mitigated in part in <italic>P. leucopu</italic>s by proteins like secretory leukocyte peptidase inhibitor, encoded by <italic>Slpi</italic>, and superoxide dismutase 2, encoded by <italic>Sod2</italic>.</p><p>Here, we first address whether the heightened transcription of neutrophil-associated genes in <italic>P. leucopus</italic> is attributable to differences in numbers of white cells in the blood. To better match for genetic diversity, we substituted outbred <italic>M. musculus</italic> for the inbred BALB/c mouse of the previous study. We retained the experimental protocol of short-term responses to LPS. This main experiment was supplemented by a study of rats under the similar conditions, by an investigation of a different dose of LPS and duration of exposure in another group of deermice, and by analysis of deermice infected with a bacterium lacking LPS. The focus was on the blood of these animals, not only because the distinctions between species in their transcriptional profiles were nearly as numerous for this specimen as for spleen and liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Balderrama-Gutierrez et al., 2021</xref>), but also because for ecological and immunological studies of natural populations of <italic>Peromyscus</italic> species blood is obtainable from captured-released animals without their sacrifice.</p><p>The results inform future studies of <italic>Peromyscus</italic> species, not only with respect to microbial infections and innate immunity, but conceivably also determinants of longevity and resilience in the face of other stressors, such as toxic substances in the environment. The findings pertain as well to the phenomenon of infection tolerance broadly documented in other reservoirs for human disease agents, such as betacoronaviruses and bats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Mandl et al., 2018</xref>). Less directly, the results provide for insights about maladaptive responses among humans to microbes, from systemic inflammatory response syndrome to post-infection fatigue syndromes.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>LPS experiment and hematology studies</title><p>Twenty adult animals each for <italic>P. leucopus</italic> and <italic>M. musculus</italic> and equally divided between sexes received by intraperitoneal injection either purified <italic>E. coli</italic> LPS at a dose of 10 µg per g body mass or saline alone (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>).

One possible explanation for the difference was an incomplete annotation of the <italic>P. leucopus</italic> genome. We took three approaches to rectify this. The first was to examine the DEGs for <italic>P. leucopus</italic> that encoded a polypeptide ≥200 amino acids and was annotated for the genome as ‘uncharacterized’. A search of both the virus and rodent proteins databases with these candidates identified two that were homologous with <italic>gag</italic> and <italic>pol</italic> genes of mammalian ERVs.</p><p>For a second approach, we carried out a de novo transcript assembly of mRNA reads from blood of LPS-treated and control <italic>P. leucopus</italic> and used the resultant contigs as the reference set for RNA-seq analysis. This identified two contigs that were measurably transcribed in the blood, differentially expressed between conditions, and homologous to ERV sequences. One would encode an Env protein that was identical to a <italic>P. leucopus</italic> coding sequence (XM_037209467) for a protein annotated as ‘MLV-related proviral Env protein’. The second was a <italic>gag-pol</italic> sequence that was near-identical to a <italic>gag-pol</italic> transcript (XM_037208848) identified by the first approach.</p><p>The third approach was to scan the <italic>P. leucopus</italic> genome for nonredundant sequences, defined as &lt;95% identity, that were homologous with ERV <italic>gag-pol</italic> sequences, which are not typically annotated because of masking for repetitive sequences. This analysis yielded 615 unique sequences. These were used in turn as a reference set for RNA-seq. There were four sequences that met the criterion of FDR -value &lt;0.01. Three were transcribed at 5- to 40-fold higher levels in LPS-treated deermice than in controls. But all three, as well as the fourth, a down-regulated DEG, were ERV relics with truncations, frame shifts, and in-frame stop codons. These were assessed as non-coding RNAs and not further pursued in this study.</p><p>To represent <italic>P. leucopus</italic> in a targeted RNA-seq comparison with mice and rats, we settled on the above-referenced <italic>env</italic> and <italic>gag-pol</italic> coding sequences in blood mRNA. Representing <italic>M. musculus</italic> were ERV <italic>env</italic> transcript XM_036160206 and <italic>gag-pol</italic> transcript XM_036154935. For rats, we chose <italic>env</italic> and <italic>gag-pol</italic> transcripts that were second and third ranked DEGs in the genome-wide RNA-seq as noted above. Because of length differences for the coding sequences, the unit used for cross-species analysis was reads per kilobase before normalization for <italic>Ptprc</italic> transcription.</p><p>The left panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12</xref> shows the striking transcriptional fold-change in LPS-treated rats of these <italic>env</italic> and <italic>gag-pol</italic> transcripts over controls. Of lesser magnitude but no less significant was the fold-change observed <italic>M. musculus</italic> for both <italic>env</italic> and <italic>gag-pol</italic> sequences. In both mice and rats, <italic>env</italic> and <italic>gag-pol</italic> read values were highly correlated across conditions. In contrast, in <italic>P. leucopus</italic> the magnitudes of fold-change upwards for <italic>gag-pol</italic> was less than in mice or rats, and transcription of the <italic>env</italic> sequence was actually lower in LPS-treated animals than in controls. While there was a tight association between <italic>env</italic> and <italic>Rigi</italic> transcription in the <italic>M. musculus</italic>, this was not observed in <italic>P. leucopus. Rigi</italic> transcription was moderately higher at the time that the <italic>env</italic>’s transcription was lower in the LPS group.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig12" position="float"><label>Figure 12.</label><caption><title>Scatter plots of endogenous retrovirus (ERV) <italic>env</italic> and <italic>gag-pol</italic> transcripts (left) and association of ERV <italic>env</italic> with <italic>Rigi</italic> transcription (right) in the blood of <italic>Peromyscus</italic> <italic>leucopus</italic> (<italic>Pero</italic>.; P), <italic>M musculus</italic> (<italic>Mus</italic>; M), or <italic>R. norvegicus</italic> (<italic>Rattus</italic>) with (L) or without (control; C) treatment with LPS.</title><p>In right panel, the linear regression curve and coefficients of determination (R<sup>2</sup>) for <italic>P. leucopus</italic> and <italic>M. musculus</italic> are shown.

For the same reason differences between sexes of a species in their responses might have been undetected. The interpretations applied to mixed-sex groups of deermice and mice. Expression strongly associated with female or male sex could have yielded an average fold change for the whole group that fell below the screen’s threshold.</p><p>The parameters for the experiment of LPS dose, the route, and duration of experiment each might have had different values under another design. Those particular choices were based on past studies of deermice and mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Balderrama-Gutierrez et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Langeroudi et al., 2014</xref>). In another experiment, we found that with doses twice or half those given the deermice the responses by rats to the different doses were indistinguishable by hematology, cytokine assays, and RNA-seq. Thus, there seems to be some latitude in the dose and still achieving replication. We obtained similar results for <italic>P. leucopus</italic> when we looked at a replicate of the experiment with the same conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Balderrama-Gutierrez et al., 2021</xref>), or when the dose was lower and duration lengthened to 12 hr (this study). The analysis here of the <italic>B. hermsii</italic> infection experiment also indicated that the phenomenon observed in <italic>P. leucopus</italic> was not limited to a TLR4 agonist.</p><p>While the rodents in these experiments were housed in the same facility and ate the same diet, we cannot exclude inherent differences in gastrointestinal microbiota between species and individual outbred animals as co-variables for the experimental outcomes. We reported differences between the LL stock <italic>P. leucopus</italic> and BALB/c <italic>M. musculus</italic> of the same age and diet in their microbiomes by metagenomic analysis and microbiologic means (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Milovic et al., 2020</xref>). This included a commensal <italic>Tritrichomonas</italic> sp. in <italic>P. leucopus</italic> but not in the <italic>M. musculus</italic> in the study. The presence of these protozoa affects innate and adaptive immune responses in the gastrointestinal tract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Chiaranunt et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Escalante et al., 2016</xref>), but it is not clear whether there are systemic consequences of colonization by this flagellate.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>LPS, ERVs, and interferons</title><p>The results confirm previous reports of heightened transcription of ERV sequences in mice or mouse cells after exposure to LPS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hara et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Jongstra and Moroni, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Stoye and Moroni, 1983</xref>). Here we add the example of the rat. The LPS was administered in solution and not by means of membrane vesicles. The sensing PRR presumably was surface-displayed, membrane-anchored TLR4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Mazgaeen and Gurung, 2020</xref>). It follows that a second, indirect of LPS on the mouse is through its provocation of increased ERV transcription intracellularly. ERV-origin RNA, cDNA and/or protein would then be recognized by a cytoplasmic PRR. RIG-I was one associated with ERV transcription in this study. Kong et al. reported that LPS stimulated expression of <italic>Rigi</italic> in a mouse macrophages but did not investigate ERVs for an intermediary function in this phenomenon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kong et al., 2009</xref>). As was demonstrated for LINE type retrotransposons in human fibroblasts, intracellular PRR signaling can trigger a type 1 interferon response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">De Cecco et al., 2019</xref>). The combination of these two signaling events, that is one through surface TLR4 by LPS itself and another through intracellular PPR(s) by to-be-defined ERV products, manifested in mice and rats as a response profile that had features of both a response to a virus with type 1 interferon and ISGs and a response to a bacterial PAMP like LPS with acute phase reactants such as calprotectin and serum amyloid.</p><p>This or a similar phenomenon has been observed under other circumstances. In humans, there was heightened transcription of retrotransposons in patients with septic shock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Mommert et al., 2020</xref>), as well as in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from human subjects experimentally injected with LPS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Pisano et al., 2020</xref>). Bacteria like <italic>Staphylococcus epidermidis</italic> that express TLR2 agonists, such as lipoteichoic acid, promoted expression of ERVs, which in turn modulated host immune responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lima-Junior et al., 2021</xref>). A synthetic analog of a <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> lipoprotein activated human monocytic cells and promoted replication of the latent HIV virus in cells that were persistently infected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Norgard et al., 1996</xref>).</p><p><italic>P. leucopus</italic> does not fit well with this model. Instead of the prominent interferon-gamma response observed in mice and rats, there were prominent responses of interleukin-1 beta and genes associated with neutrophil activation. Instead of the much heightened expression of ISGs, like <italic>Mx2</italic> and I<italic>sg15</italic>, in mice treated with LPS, the deermice under the same condition had a more subdued ISG transcription profile. Instead of increased expression of ERV Env protein sequences in blood of mice and rats treated with LPS, there was decreased transcription of the homologous ERV <italic>env</italic> in like-treated <italic>P. leucopus</italic>.</p><p>This suppression in the deermice may be attributable to defensive adaptations of <italic>Peromyscus</italic> to repeated invasions of endogenous retroviruses, as Gozashti et al. has proposed for <italic>P. maniculatus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gozashti et al., 2023</xref>). This includes expanding the repertoire of silencing mechanisms, such as Kruppel-associated box (KRAB) domain-containing zinc finger proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Yang et al., 2017</xref>). Like <italic>P. maniculatus</italic>, <italic>P. leucopus</italic> has an abundance of Long Terminal Repeat retrotransposons, several named for their endogenous retrovirus heritages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Long et al., 2019</xref>). Our initial analysis of the <italic>P. leucopus</italic> genome reported a depletion of KRAB domains compared to Muridae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Long et al., 2019</xref>). But a subsequent annotation round identified several genes for KRAB domain zinc finger proteins in <italic>P. leucopus</italic>, including Zfp809 (XP_006982432), which initiates ERV silencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Wolf et al., 2015</xref>), and Zfp997 (XP_037067826), which suppresses ERV expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Treger et al., 2019</xref>). Another possible adaptation in <italic>P. leucopus</italic> is the higher baseline expression of some ISGs as noted here (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11s1">Figure 11—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Reducing differences between <italic>P. leucopus</italic> and murids <italic>M. musculus</italic> and <italic>R. norvegicus</italic> to a single attribute, such as the inactivation of <italic>Fcgr1</italic> in <italic>P. leucopus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Barbour et al., 2023</xref>), may be fruitless. But the feature that may best distinguish the deermouse from the mouse and rat is its predominantly anti-inflammatory quality. This characteristic likely has a complex, polygenic basis, with environmental (including microbiota) and epigenetic influences. An individual’s placement is on a spectrum or, more likely, a landscape rather than in one or another binary or Mendelian category.</p><p>One argument against a purely anti-inflammatory characterization is the greater neutrophil numbers and activity in <italic>P. leucopus</italic> compared to <italic>M. musculus</italic> in the LPS experiment. The neutrophil activation, migration, and phagocytosis would be appropriate early defenses against a pyogenic pathogen. But if not contained, they bring local and systemic risks for the host. This damage would not likely be from nitric oxide and reactive nitrogen species, given the minimal <italic>Nos2</italic> transcription. But deermice showed heightened expression of genes for proteases, such as <italic>Mmp8</italic>, enzymes for reactive oxygen species, such as NADPH oxidase 1 (<italic>Nox1</italic>), and facilitators of neutrophil extracellular traps, such as PAD4 (<italic>Padi4</italic>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> ). We had previously identified possible mitigators, such as secretory leuckocyte peptidase inhibitor and superoxide dismutase 2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Balderrama-Gutierrez et al., 2021</xref>). These findings were replicated here. The topic of neutrophil activation and these and other possible counters is considered in more detail elsewhere.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>An anti-inflammatory disposition but at what cost?</title><p>An assignment of infection tolerance to a host and pathogen pairing assumes sufficient immunity against the microbe to keep it in check if elimination fails. <italic>P. leucopus</italic> and <italic>P. maniculatus</italic>, are in this sense ‘immunocompetent’ with respect to the microbes they host and with which they may share a long history (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hoen et al., 2009</xref>). Yet, has this balance of resistance and tolerance for certain host-associated microbes been achieved in a trade-off that entails vulnerabilities to other types of agents?</p><p>The selection of LPS as the experimental model was meant to cover this contingency, at least for the common denominator of acute inflammation many types of infections elicit. But LPS studies revealed potential weaknesses that some pathogens might exploit. One of these is the low expression of inducible nitric oxide. Although <italic>Nos2</italic> gene knockouts in <italic>M. musculus</italic> had lower LPS-induced mortality than their wild-type counterparts, the mutants were more susceptible to the protozoan <italic>Leishmania major</italic> and the facultative intracellular bacterium <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">MacMicking et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Wei et al., 1995</xref>). While there are no known studies of either of these pathogens in <italic>P. leucopus</italic>, the related species <italic>P. yucatanicus</italic> is the main reservoir for <italic>Leishmania mexicana</italic> in Mexico (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chable-Santos et al., 1995</xref>). Compared with <italic>M. musculus</italic>, which suffer a high fatality rate from experimental infections with <italic>L. mexicana</italic>, <italic>P. yucatanicus</italic> infections are commonly asymptomatic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Loría-Cervera et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Given the restrained interferon and ISG response shown by <italic>P. leucopus</italic>, another plausible vulnerability would be viral infections. But other studies suggest that neither RNA nor DNA viruses pose an inordinately high risk for <italic>Peromyscus</italic>. Both tolerance of and resistance to the tickborne encephalitis flavivirus Powassan virus by <italic>P. leucopus</italic> were demonstrated in an experimental model in which mice, by contrast, were severely affected <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Mlera et al., 2017</xref>. <italic>P. maniculatus</italic> has been successfully infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus by the respiratory route, but the infected animals displayed only mild pathology, manifested little if any disability, and recovered within a few days <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Fagre et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Griffin et al., 2021</xref>.

While deermice may not be in the same longevity league as the naked mole-rat (<italic>Heterocephalus glaber</italic>), which can live for over 30 years <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Oka et al., 2023</xref>, some features of naked mole-rat immunology are intriguingly similar to what we have observed for <italic>P. leucopus</italic>.

This was a Lyme disease endemic area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Brinkerhoff et al., 2012</xref>), where residents frequently presented for medical care for a variety of clinical manifestations, from mild to serious, of <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Steere et al., 1986</xref>). Subclinical infections in humans occur, but most of those who become infected have a definable illness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Steere et al., 1998</xref>). The localized or systemic presence of the microbe is a necessary condition for Lyme disease, but the majority of the symptoms and signs are attributable to inflammation elicited by the organism’s presence and not from virulence properties per se or the hijacking of host cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Coburn et al., 2022</xref>). Since humans are transmission dead-ends for <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> and many other zoonotic agents in their life cycles, it is not surprising that human infections are generally more debilitating if not fatal than what adapted natural hosts experience.</p><p>It is in the space between the asymptomatic natural host and symptomatic inadvertent host where there may be insights with basic and translational application. With this goal, we consider the ways the results inform studies of the pathogenesis of Lyme disease, where ‘disease’ includes lingering disorders akin to ‘long Covid’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Nathan, 2022</xref>), and where ‘pathogenesis’ includes both microbial and host contributions. Plausibly germane deermouse-mouse differences identified in our studies are summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Figure 13</xref>. Two are highlighted here.</p><fig id="fig13" position="float"><label>Figure 13.</label><caption><title>Summary of distinguishing features of transcriptional responses in the blood between <italic>Peromyscus</italic> <italic>leucopus</italic> and <italic>Mus musculus</italic> 4 hr after treatment with LPS.</title><p>There is semi-quantitative representation of relative transcription of selected coding sequences or ratios of transcription for selected pairs of genes in the blood.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-90135-fig13-v1.tif"/></fig><p>The first is macrophage polarization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Murray, 2017</xref>). By the criteria summarized above, the response to LPS by <italic>P. leucopus</italic> is consistent with the alternatively-activated or M2 type, rather than the expected classical or M1 type. But it was not only LPS-treated deermice that had this attribute, the blood of untreated animals also displayed M2 type polarization features. This included a comparatively high <italic>Arg1</italic> expression level and a <italic>Akt1/Akt2</italic> transcription ratio of more than 1 at baseline. This suggests that studies of other mammals, including humans, need not administer LPS or other TLR agonist to assess disposition toward M1 or M2-type polarization. This reading could serve as a prognostic indicator of the inflammatory response to infection with <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> or other pathogen and the long-term outcome.</p><p>The second difference we highlight is the activation of ERV transcription that was prominent in the LPS-treated mice and rats but not in similarly-treated deermice. A paradoxical enlistment of antiviral defenses, including type 1 and type 2 interferons, for an infection with an extracellular bacterium, like <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic>, may bring about more harm than benefit, especially if the resultant inflammation persists after antibiotic therapy. There are various ways to assess ERV activation in the blood, including assays for RNA, protein, and reverse transcriptase activity. A xenotropic MLV-related retrovirus has been discounted as a cause of chronic fatigue syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">McClure and Kaye, 2010</xref>). However, production of whole virions need not occur for there to be PRR signaling in response to cytoplasmic Env protein, single stranded RNA, or cDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Russ and

Our responses to each of the comments are detailed below. In brief, the modifications or additional materials for the revision each specifically address a reviewer comment. These modifcations or materials include the following….</p><p>• a more in-depth consideration of sample sizes</p><p>• a better explanation of what p values signify for a GO term analysis</p><p>• a more detailed account of the selection of the normalization procedure for cross-species targeted RNA-seq (including a new supplemental figure)</p><p>• several more box plots in supplementary materials to complement the scatterplots and linear regressions of the figures of the primary text</p><p>• provision in a public access repository of the complete data for the RNA-seq analyses as well as primary data for figures and tables as new supplementary tables</p><p>• the expansion of description of the analysis done for the revision of Borrelia hermsii infection of P. leucopus. This included a new table (Table 10 of the revision) • development of the possible relevance of finding for longevity studies by citing similarities of the findings in P. leucopus with those in the naked mole-rat</p><p>• what we think is a better assessment of differences between female and male P. leucopus for this particular study, while still keeping focus on DEGs in common for females and males. This included a new figure (Figure 4 of the revision).</p><p>• removal of reference to a “inverse” relationship between Nos2 and Arg1 while still retaining ratios of informative value</p><p>We note that in the interval between uploading the original bioRxiv preprint and now we learned of the paper of Gozashti, Feschotte, and Hoekstra (reference 32), which supports our conception of the important place of endogenous retroviruses in the biology and ecology of deermice. This is the only addition or modification that was not a direct response to a reviewer comment or question, but it was germane to one of Reviewer #1’s comments (“Regarding..”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1:</bold></p><p>Supplemental Table 1 only lists genes that passed the authors statistical thresholds. The full list of genes detected in their analysis should be included with read counts, statistics, etc. as supplemental information.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that provision of the entire lists of reference transcripts and the RNA-seq results for each of the 40 animals is merited. These datasets are too large for what the journal’s supplementary materials resource was intended for, so we have deposited them at the Dryad public access repository.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>While P. leucopus is a critical reservoir for B. burgdorferi, caution should be taken in directly connecting the data presented here and the Lyme disease spirochete. While it's possible that P. leucopus have a universal mechanism for limiting inflammation in response to PAMPs, B. burgdorferi lack LPS and so it is also possible the mechanisms that enable LPS tolerance and B. burgdorferi tolerance may be highly divergent.</p></disp-quote><p>The impetus for the study was the phenomenon of tolerance of infection of P. leucopus by a number of different kinds of pathogens, not just B. burgdorferi. We take the reviewer’s point, though. Certainly, the white-footed deermouse is probably most notable at-large for its role as a reservoir for the Lyme disease agent. We doubt that the species responses to LPS and to the principal agonists of B. burgdorferi are “highly divergent”, though. Other than the TLR itself-TLR4 for LPS vs the heterodimer TLR2/TLR1 for the lipoproteins of these spirochetes--the downstream signaling is generally similar for amounts comparable in their agonist potency.</p><p>We had thought that we had addressed this distinction for B. burgdorferi and otherBorreliaceae members by referring to the earlier study. But we agree with the reviewer that what was provided on this point was insufficient in the context of the present work. Accordingly, for the revision we have added a new analysis of the data on experimental infection of P. leucopus with Borrelia hermsii, which lacks LPS and for which the TLR agonists eliciting inflammation are lipoproteins. We do this in a format (new Table 6) that aids comparison with the LPS experimental data elsewhere in the article. As the manuscript references, B. burgdorferi infection of P. leucopus elicits comparatively little inflammation in blood even at the height of infection. While this phenomenon with the Lyme disease agent was part of the rationale driving these studies, the better comparison with LPS was 5 days into B. hermsii infection when the animals are spirochetemic.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Statistical significance is binary and p-values should not be used as the primary comparator of groups (e.g. once a p-value crosses the deigned threshold for significance, the magnitude of that p-value no longer provides biological information). For instance, in comparing GO-terms, the reason for using of high p-value cutoffs (&quot;None of these were up-regulated gene GO terms with p values &lt; 1011 for <italic>M. musculus</italic>.&quot;) to compare species is unclear. If the authors wish to compare effect sizes, comparing enrichment between terms that pass a cutoff would likely be the better choice. Similarly, comparing DEG expression by p-value cutoff and effect size is more meaningful than analyses based on exclusively on p-value: &quot;Of the top 100 DEGs for each species by ascending FDR p value.&quot; Description in later figures (e.g. Figure 4) is favored.</p></disp-quote><p>Effect sizes--in this case, fold-changes--were taken into account for GO term analysis and were specified in the settings that are described. So, any gene that was “counted” for consideration for a particular GO term would have passed that threshold and with a falsediscovery corrected p value of a specified minimum. There is no further scoring of the “hit” based upon the magnitude of the p value beyond that point. It is, as the reviewer writes, binary at that point. We are in agreement on those principles.</p><p>As we understand the comment above, though, the p-values referred to are in regard to the GO term analysis itself. The objective was discovery followed by inference. The situation was more like a genome-wide association study (GWAS) study. This is not strictly speaking a hypothesis test, because there was no stated hypothesis ahead of time or one driving the design. The “p value” for something like GO term analysis or GWAS provides an estimate of the strength of the association. It is not binary in that sense. The lower the p value, the greater confidence about the association. In a GWAS of a human population an association of a trait with a particular SNP or indel is usually not taken seriously unless the p value is less than 10^-7 or 10^-8. In the case of GO terms, the p value approximates (but is not equivalent to) the number of genes that are differentially expressed that belong to a GO cluster out of the total number of genes that define that cluster. The higher the proportion of the genes in the cluster that are associated with a treatment (LPS vs. saline), the lower the p value. Thus, it provides information beyond the point at which it would be rightly deemed of little additional value in many hypothesis testing circumstances.</p><p>That said, we agree that the original manuscript could have been clearer on this point and have for the revision expanded the description of the GO term analysis in the Methods, including some explanation for a reader on what the p value signifies here. We also refrain from specifying a certain p value for special attention and merely list 20 by ascending p value.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The ability to use of CD45 to normalize data is unclear. Authors should elaborate both on the use of the method and provide some data how the data change when they are normalized. For instance, do correlations between untreated Mus and Peromyscus gene expression improve? The authors seem to imply this should be a standard for interspecies comparison and so it would be helpful to either provide data to support that or, if applicable, use of the technique in literature should be referenced.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer brings up an important point that we considered addressing in more depth for the original manuscript but in the end deferred to considerations about length and left it out.</p><p>But we are glad to address this here, as well as in the revised manuscript.</p><p>We did not intend to imply either that this particular normalization approach had been done before by others or that it “should” be a standard. We are not aware of another report on this, and it would be up to others whether it would be useful or not for them. We made no claim about its utility in another model or circumstance. The challenge before us was to do a comparative analysis of transcription in the blood not just for animals of one species under different conditions but animals of two different genera under different conditions. A notable difference between the animals was in their white blood cell counts, as this study documents. White cells would be the source of a majority of transcripts of potential relevance here, but there would also be mRNA for globins, from reticulocytes, from megakaryocytes, and likely cell-free RNA with origins in various tissues. If the white cell numbers differed, but the non-white cell sources of RNA did not, then there could be unacknowledged biases.</p><p>It would be like comparing two different kinds of tissues and assuming them to be the same in the types and numbers of cells they contained. Four hours after a dose of LPS the liver cells (or brain cells) would differ in their transcriptional profiles from untreated the livers (or brains) of untreated animals for sure, but there would not be much if any change in the numbers of different kinds of cells in the liver (or brain) within 4 hours. The blood can change a lot in composition within that time frame under these same conditions. Some sort of accounting for differing white cell numbers in the blood in different outbred animals of two species seemed to be called for.</p><p>The normalization that was done for the genome-wide analysis was not based on a particular transcript, but instead was based on the total number of reads, the lengths of the reference transcripts, and the distributions of reads matching to the tens of thousands of references for each sample. This was done according to what are standard procedures by now for bulk RNAseq analyses. Because the reference transcript sets for <italic>P. leucopus</italic> and <italic>M. musculus</italic> differed in their numbers and completeness of annotation, we did not attempt any cross-species comparison for the same set of genes at that point. That would not be possible because they were not entirely commensurate.</p><p>The GO term analysis of those results provided the leads for the more targeted approach, which was roughly analogous to RT-qPCR. For a targeted assay of this sort, it is common to have a “housekeeping gene” or some other presumably stably transcribed gene for normalization. A commonly used one is Gapdh, but we had previously found that Gapdh was a DEG itself in the blood in <italic>P. leucopus</italic> and <italic>M. musculus</italic> at the four hour mark after LPS. The aim was to provide for some adjustment so datasets for blood samples differing in white blood cell counts could be compared. Two options were the 12S ribosomal RNA of the mitochondria, which would be in white cells but not mature erythrocytes, and CD45, which has served an approximately similar function for flow cytometry of the blood. As described in what has been added for the revision and the supplementary materials, we compared these different approaches to normalization. Ptprc and 12S rRNA were effectively interchangeable as the denominator with identifying DEGs of <italic>P. leucopus</italic> and <italic>M. musculus</italic> and cross-species comparisons.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Regarding the ISG data-is a possible conclusion not that Peromyscus don't upregulate the antiviral response because it's already so high in untreated rodents? It seems untreated Peromyscus have ISG expression roughly equivalent to the LPS mice for some of the genes. This could be compared more clearly if genes were displayed as bar plots/box and whisker plots rather than in scatter plots. It is unclear why the linear regression is the key point here rather than normalized differences in expression.</p></disp-quote><p>In answer to the question: yes, that is possible. In the interval between uploading of the manuscript and this revision, we became aware of a study by Gozashti and Hoekstra published this year in Molecular Biology and Evolution (reference 32) and reporting on the “massive invasion” of endogenous retroviruses in P. maniculatus and the defenses deployed in response to achieve silencing. We cite this work and discuss it, including related findings for P. leucopus, in the revision.</p><p>We had originally intended to include box plots as well as scatterplots with regressions for the data, but thought it would be too much and possibly considered redundant. But with this encouragement from the reviewer we provide additional box plots in supplementary materials for the revision.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Some sections of the discussion are under supported:</p><p>The claim that low inflammation contributes to increased lifespan is stated both in the introduction and discussion. Is there justification to support this? Do aged pathogen-free mice show more inflammation than aged Peromyscus?</p></disp-quote><p>We respectively point out that there was not a claim of this sort. We stated a fact about P. leucopus’ longevity. We made no statement connecting longevity and inflammation beyond the suggestion in the introduction that the explanation(s) for infection tolerance might have some bearing for studies on determinants of life span.</p><p>But the reviewer’s comment prompted further consideration of this aspect of Peromyscus biology. This led eventually to the literature on the naked mole-rat, which seems to be the rodent with the longest known life span and the subject of considerable study. The discussion section of the revision has an added paragraph on some of the similarities of P. leucopus and the naked mole-rat in terms of neutrophils, expression of nitric oxide synthase 2 in response to LPS, and type 1 interferon responses. While this is far from decisive, it does serve to connect some of the dots and, hopefully, is considered at least partially responsive to the reviewer’s question.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The claim that reduced Peromyscus responsiveness could lead to increased susceptibility to infection is prominently proposed but not supported by any of the literature cited.</p></disp-quote><p>There was not this claim. In fact, it was framed as a question, not a statement.

Was a power analysis conducted?</p></disp-quote><p>A power analysis of any meaning for bulk RNA-seq with tens of thousands of reference transcripts, each with their own variance, and a comparison of animals of two different genera is not straight forward. Furthermore, a specific hypothesis was not being tested. This was a broad, forward screen. But the question about sample sizes is one that deserves more attention than the original manuscript provided. This now provided in added text in two places in Methods ( “RNA-seq” and “Genome-wide different gene expression”) in the revision.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. The authors conducted a cursory evaluation of sex differences of P. leucopus and reported no difference in response except for Il6 and Il10 expression being higher in the males than the females in the exposed group. The data was not presented in the manuscript. Nor was sex considered for the other two species. A further discussion of the role that sex could play and future studies would be appreciated.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the limited analysis of sex differences and the undocumented remark about Il6 and Il10 expression in females and males warranted correction. For the revision we removed that analysis of targeted RNA-seq of P. leucopus from the two different studies. For this study we were looking for differences that applied to both species. This was the reason that there were equal numbers of females and males in the samples. We agree that further investigation of differences between sexes in their responses is of interest but is probably best left for “future studies”.</p><p>But in revision we do not entirely ignore the question of sex of the animal and provide an additional analysis of the bulk RNA-seq for P. leucopus with regard to differences between females and males. This basically demonstarted an overall commensurability between sexes, at least for the purposes of the GO term analysis and subsequent targeted RNA-seq, but did reveal some exceptions that are candidate genes for those future studies.</p><p>In the revision, we also add for the discussion and its “study limitations” section a disclaimer about possibly missing sex associated differences because the groups were mixed sexes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. The ratio of Nos2 and Arg1 copies for LPS treated and control <italic>P. leucopus</italic> and <italic>M. musculus</italic> in Table 3 show that in <italic>P. leucopus</italic> there is not a significant difference but in <italic>M. musculus</italic> there is an increase in Nos2 copies with LPS treatment. The authors then used a targeted RNA-seq analysis to show that in <italic>P. leucopus</italic> the number of Arg1 reads after LPS treatment is significantly higher than the controls. These results are over oversimplified in the text as an inverse relationship for Nos2/Arg1 in the two species.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree. In addition to providing box plots for Arg1 and Nos2, as suggested by Reviewer #1, we also replaced “ratio” in commenting on Arg1 and Nos2, with “differences in Nos2 and Arg1 expresssion” replacing “ratio of Nos2 to Arg1 expression” at one place. At another place we have removed “inverse” with regard to Nos2 and Arg1. But we respectfully decline to remove Nos2/Arg1 from Figure 5 (now Figure 6) or inclusion of Nos2/Arg1 ratios elsewhere. According to our understanding there need not be an inverse relationship for a ratio to have informative value.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations For the Authors</bold></p></disp-quote><p>We thank the two reviewers for their constructive recommendations and suggestions, in some case pointing out errors we totally missed.

All cutoffs are arbitrary but there should be some justification.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and have provided the rationale at that point in the paper (before Figure 3) in R2:&quot;For GO term analysis the absolute fold-change criterion was ≥ 2. Because of the ~3-fold greater number of transcripts for the <italic>M. musculus</italic> reference set than the <italic>P. leucopus</italic> reference set, application of the same false-discovery rate (FDR) threshold for both datasets would favor the labeling of transcripts as DEGs in <italic>P. leucopus</italic>. Accordingly, the FDR p values were arbitrarily set at &lt;5 x 10-5 for P. leucopus and &lt;3 x 10-3 for <italic>M. musculus</italic> to provide approximately the same number of DEGs for <italic>P. leucopus</italic> (1154 DEGs) and <italic>M. musculus</italic> (1266 DEGs) for the GO term comparison.&quot;</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• It would be helpful to include a figure demonstrating the correlation between CD45 and WBC (&quot;Pearson's continuous and Spearman's ranked correlations between log-transformed total white blood cell counts and normalized reads for Ptprc across 40 animals representing both species, sexes, and treatments were 0.40 (p = 0.01) and 0.34 (p = 0.03), respectively.&quot;)</p></disp-quote><p>In both the first version of the revision (R1) and in R2 we provide a fuller explanation of the choice of CD45 (Ptprc) for normalization as detailed in the response to Reviewer #1's public comment.

We did not think another figure was justified after there was additional space devoted to this in both R1 and R2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• Unclear what the following paragraph is referring to-is this from the previous paper?

The top half of the figure is not well explained and it's unclear what species this is. Decreased use of abbreviations would help. Consider marking each R2 value as Mus or Peromyscus (As done in Fig 9). There are some typographical errors in the legend (&quot;gree,&quot;) incomplete sentence missing the words LPS or treatment AND Mus: &quot;Co-variation between transcripts for selected PRRs (yellow) and ISGs (gree) in the blood of P. leucopus (P) or (M) with (L&quot;) or without (C).&quot;</p><p>This is now Figure 9 in both R1 and R2. We revised it for R1 to include references to the box plots in supplementary materials, but agree with Reviewer #1's recommendation to correct the typos and make the legend less confusing. We did not think that further labeling of the R2 values in the scatterplots with the species names was necessary. The data points are not just colors but also different symbols, so it should be fairly easy for readers to distinguish the regression lines by species. For R2 this is the revised legend with additions in response to the recommendation underlined:</p><p>&quot;Figure 9. Co-variation between transcripts for selected PRRs and ISGs in the blood of <italic>P. leucopus</italic> (P) or <italic>M. musculus</italic> (M) with (L) or without (C) LPS treatment.

PRRs are indicated by yellow fill and ISGs by blue fill on horizontal and vertical axes. Shades of green of the matrix cells correspond to R2 values, where cells with values less than 0.30 have white fill and those of 0.90-1.00 have deepest green fill. Bottom panels: scatter plots of log-transformed normalized Mx2 transcripts on Rigi (left), Ifih1 (center), and Gbp4 (right). The linear regression curves are for each species.

Examples listed: o Unclear what effect is described here &quot;The bacterial infection experiment indicated that the observed effect in P. leucopus was not limited to a TLR4 agonist; the lipoproteins of B. hermsii are agonists for TLR2 (Salazar et al. 2009).&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>Both R1 and R2 include the new section on the B. hermsii infection model. This was added in response to Reviewer #1 public comment. So the expanded consideration of this aspect should address the reviewer's recommendation for more clarity and context here.

But from a perspective that also takes in the 2-3x longer life span of the whitefooted deer mouse compared to the house mouse and the capacity of P. leucopus to serve as disease agent reservoir while maintaining if not increasing its distribution (Moscarella et al. 2019), the feature that seems to best distinguish the deer mouse from either the mouse or rat is its predominantly anti-inflammatory quality. The presentation of this trait likely has a complex, polygenic basis, with environmental (including microbiota) and epigenetic influences. An individual's placement is on a spectrum or, more likely, a landscape rather than in one or another binary or Mendelian category.&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that modification, simplication, and clarification was called for.

But the feature that may best distinguish the deermouse from the mouse and rat is its predominantly anti-inflammatory quality. This characteristic likely has a complex, polygenic basis, with environmental (including microbiota) and epigenetic influences. An individual’s placement is on a spectrum or, more likely, a landscape rather than in one or another binary or Mendelian category.&quot;</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor comments:</p><p>• Use of blue and red in figures as the -only- way to easily distinguish between groups is a poor choice-both in terms of how inclusivity of color-blind researchers and enabling grayscale printing. Most detrimental in Figure 2, but also slightly problematic in Figure 1. Use of color and shape (as done in other figures) is a much better alternative.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree. Both figures have been modified to include an additional characteristic for denoting the data point. For Figure 1 it is a black filling, and for Figure 2 it is the size of symbol in additon to the color. This should enable accurate visualization by color blind individuals and printing in gray scale. We have added definitions for the symbols within the graph itself, so there is no need to refer to the legend to interpret what they mean.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• Note the typo where it should read P leucopus: &quot;The differences between <italic>P. musculus</italic> and <italic>M. musculus</italic> in the ratios of Nos2/Arg1 and IL12/IL10 were reported before (BalderramaGutierrez et al. 2021),&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this typo out, which also carried over to R1. It has been corrected for R2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• Optional: Can the relationship between the ratios in figure 5 and macrophage &quot;types&quot; be displayed graphically alongside the graphs? It's a little challenging to go back and forth between the text and the figure to try to understand the biological implication.</p></disp-quote><p>We considered something like this but in the end decided that we were not yet comfortable assigning “types” in this fashion for Peromyscus.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>• Be consistent with nomenclature for your species/treatment groups in the text, figures, and tables.

We think that some alternation in the terms relieves the text of some of its repetitiveness and that readers should not have a problem with equating one with the other. The use of &quot;deermouse&quot; also reinforces for readers that Peromyscus is not a mouse. With regard to the abbreviations for P. leucopus, those were used to accommodate design and space issues of the figures or tables. In all cases, the abbreviations referred to are defined in the legends of the figures. So, we respectfully decline to follow this recommendation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• Often the sentence structure and/or word choice is irregular and makes quick/easy comprehension difficult.

If a reader or other investigator wants to do this for other purposes, e.g. a meta-analysis, the data is provided in public repository for them to do this. We are not sure what the reviewer means by &quot;multiple t-tests&quot; for &quot;all figures&quot;. Where we do 2-tailed t-tests for presentation of data for many genes in a table for the targeted RNA (where individual values cannot shown in the table), there is always correction for multiple testing, as indicated in Methods.

We decline to make the x-axis scale the same for all the panels because the horizontal bars in “transcription down” panels would take up only a small fraction of the space. The x-axes are clearly defined and the colors of the bars also indicate the differences in p-values. We doubt that readers will be misled. Here is the revised legend: “Figure 3.

The scale for the x-axes for the panels was determined by the highest -log10 p values in each of the 4 sets.

We thought that this was necessary before diving deeper into the data of Table 2. We do not think further discriminating between transcripts in the categorical way that the reviewer suggests is warranted at this point. So, we respectfully decline to follow this suggestion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• Results paragraph &quot; Alternatively- activated macrophages....&quot;</p><p>o Include a brief description of Nos2 and Arg1</p></disp-quote><p>We have defined what enzymes these are genes for in R2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>o How do you explain the lack of a difference in P. leucopus Arg1?

For what it’s worth, with regard to the &quot;red&quot; and &quot;pink&quot; issue, according to the figure on our displays the colors of the two symbols appear to be red and purple.
