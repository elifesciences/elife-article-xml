after weight recovery and contributes to the chronic nature of the condition. What remains unknown is whether cognitive inflexibility predisposes individuals to anorexia nervosa, a question that is difficult to address in human studies. Our previous work using the most well-established animal model of anorexia nervosa, known as activity-based anorexia (ABA) identified a neurobiological link between cognitive inflexibility and susceptibility to pathological weight loss in female rats. However, testing flexible learning prior to exposure to ABA in the same animals has been thus far impossible due to the length of training required and the necessity of daily handling, which can itself influence the development of ABA. Here, we describe experiments that validate and optimize the first fully-automated and experimenter-free touchscreen cognitive testing system for rats and use this novel system to examine the reciprocal links between reversal learning (an assay of cognitive flexibility) and weight loss in the ABA model. First, we show substantially reduced testing time and increased throughput compared to conventional touchscreen testing methods because animals engage in test sessions at their own direction and can complete multiple sessions per day without experimenter involvement. We also show that, contrary to expectations, cognitive inflexibility measured by this reversal learning task does not predispose rats to pathological weight loss in ABA. Instead, rats that were predisposed to weight loss in ABA were more quickly able to learn this reversal task prior to ABA exposure. Intriguingly, we show reciprocal links between ABA exposure and cognitive flexibility, with ABA-exposed (but weight-recovered) rats performing much worse than ABA naïve rats on the reversal learning task, an impairment that did not occur to the same extent in rats exposed to food restriction conditions alone. On the other hand, animals that had been trained on reversal learning were better able to resist weight loss upon subsequent exposure to the ABA model. We also uncovered some stable behavioral differences between ABA susceptible versus resistant rats during touchscreen test sessions using machine learning tools that highlight possible predictors of anorectic phenotypes. These findings shed new light on the relationship between cognitive inflexibility and pathological weight loss and provide targets for future studies using the ABA model to investigate potential novel pharmacotherapies for anorexia nervosa.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>activity-based anorexia</kwd><kwd>cognitive flexibility</kwd><kwd>home-cage behavior</kwd><kwd>touchscreen cognition</kwd><kwd>reversal learning</kwd><kwd>animal models</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001061</institution-id><institution>Rebecca L.

Impairments in cognitive flexibility are common to a range of psychiatric illnesses including schizophrenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Floresco et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Thai et al., 2019</xref>), obsessive-compulsive disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gruner and Pittenger, 2017</xref>), and substance use disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Smith and Laiks, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sampedro-Piquero et al., 2019</xref>), which are characterized by stereotypical patterns of rigid behaviors that persist despite negative consequences, ultimately impacting decision-making. Individuals with a current or previous diagnosis of anorexia nervosa also exhibit rigid behaviors, especially surrounding illness-relevant stimuli such as feeding and exercise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Tchanturia et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Tchanturia et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Galimberti et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Roberts et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Steinglass et al., 2006</xref>). While impaired cognitive flexibility is most severe in patients acutely ill with anorexia nervosa and likely contributes to perpetuating the condition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Tchanturia et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Roberts et al., 2010</xref>), the persistence of inflexible behavior following weight recovery and in unaffected sisters of patients with anorexia nervosa suggests that it is involved in the etiology of the disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Roberts et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Steinglass et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Tenconi et al., 2010</xref>). What remains to be determined is whether cognitive inflexibility itself predisposes individuals to develop anorexia nervosa and could be used as a biomarker to predict illness onset or severity in individuals at risk. Moreover, a detailed understanding of the neurobiology underlying an inflexibility that persists after weight recovery in individuals with anorexia nervosa is imperative to develop novel pharmacotherapies that can aid in long-term recovery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Tchanturia et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Duriez et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Errichiello et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>While the premise that cognitive rigidity is a fundamental trait of anorexia nervosa is well-accepted, studies assessing cognitive flexibility in patient populations are prone to inconsistent findings, which are likely amplified by large discrepancies in participant demographics and experimental approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Miles et al., 2020</xref>). It is also difficult to determine from human studies the neurobiological mechanisms that precede the development of anorexia nervosa that could act as targets for early intervention. The question then arises - how can we assess the neural mechanisms of cognitive flexibility in animal models that adequately capture the clinical presentation in anorexia nervosa patients? Rodent models that incorporate key aetiological features, such as the most well-established animal model of anorexia nervosa known as ABA, have been instrumental in identifying the specific neural circuits that contribute to disordered cognitive functioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Milton et al., 2021</xref>). Additionally, the last decade has witnessed an explosion in the availability of innovative tools including optogenetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Tye and Deisseroth, 2012</xref>), chemogenetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Roth, 2016</xref>), and calcium imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lütcke et al., 2010</xref>), to manipulate and record neural activity in freely behaving animals. These approaches give an unprecedented ability to answer questions about the relationship between brain function and behavior relevant to a range of human disorders, including anorexia nervosa. However, the interest in new techniques to modify and record brain function has not been matched with adequate enthusiasm regarding the quantification and analysis of behavioral outputs that are critical for the assessment of these relationships.</p><p>With this in mind, the study of cognition and behavior in rodents has benefited in recent years from advances in technology that have increased the translational capacity of rodent models of human pathologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Keeler and Robbins, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bussey et al., 2008</xref>). A major contribution to improving translation has been the incorporation of touchscreens displaying visual stimuli in rodent test batteries that closely mimic those used for human cognitive testing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bussey et al., 2008</xref>), which improves the standardization and interpretation of data. However, touchscreen testing in rodents has thus far required significant time and experimenter intervention to transfer subjects to and from the testing chamber. Indeed, it is well known that experimenter involvement influences experimental outcomes, particularly so for behavioral studies - including those involving the ABA model, in which the outcomes are known to be influenced by experimenter handling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Carrera et al., 2006</xref>). Along with stress from handling, which varies between experimenters and, therefore, differentially impacts upon task performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Deutsch-Feldman et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sorge et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Meijer et al., 2007</xref>), manual transfer to test chambers at times that suit the experimenter is insensitive to the current motivational state of the animal. Thus, while the wide adoption of touchscreen cognitive testing has already yielded substantial benefits for behavioral neuroscience, the next frontier lies in the automation of the role of the experimenter in gatekeeping touchscreen access (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Rivalan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Winter and Schaefers, 2011</xref>).</p><p>One approach has been to relocate the operant testing modules to inside the home cage for quantification of complex operant and feeding behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Matikainen-Ankney et al., 2021</xref>), or to connect individual operant test chambers to the home cage by way of a short tunnel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bruinsma et al., 2019</xref>) to minimize intervention and provide a higher throughput training-testing framework. However, these both have a requirement for animals to remain socially isolated to ensure that the cognitive performance of each individual can be monitored over time. Considering that social isolation itself can induce cognitive deficits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bianchi et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hemmer et al., 2019</xref>) and depression-like behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ieraci et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fone and Porkess, 2008</xref>), this is a huge confound for the assessment of cognition in rodent models. In contrast, appropriate social interaction can enhance neuroplasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Liang et al., 2019</xref>), emotional and social intelligence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Torquet et al., 2018</xref>) and influence performance on complex cognitive tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Nagy et al., 2020</xref>). Recently, the capacity to monitor and track rodents in social groups has become achievable with radiofrequency identification (RFID) technology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Peleh et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Redfern et al., 2017</xref>) in combination with gating access to test chambers based on a method of automatic animal sorting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Winter and Schaefers, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Caglayan et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kaupert et al., 2017</xref>). The development of a fully automated, experimenter-free method for touchscreen-based cognitive testing in rats has been ongoing since the first prototype was constructed in 2017, allowing the successful adaptation of the trial-unique non-matching to location (TUNL) task in an environment that both eliminates experimenter intervention and allows animals to live in social groups throughout testing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Rivalan et al., 2017</xref>). This study demonstrated that the learning rate of self-motivated and undisturbed rats was much faster when experimenter involvement is removed.</p><p>The potential to more rapidly test cognition in rodents without experimenter intervention and in social groups opens the door to examine whether cognitive inflexibility predisposes individuals to pathological weight loss in ABA – particularly important because the ABA model develops differently in adult compared to adolescent ages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beeler and Burghardt, 2021</xref>). It also allows us to determine the persistence of inflexibility following weight recovery in ABA rats, in order to use this model to screen novel pharmacotherapeutics for anorexia nervosa. In the present study, we used the automated and experimenter-free touchscreen testing system developed from the prototype mentioned above (and now commercially available from PhenoSys, GmbH) to investigate both of these ideas. This automated approach also enables animals to express a more naturalistic behavioral repertoire, a feature ideally suited to comprehensive interrogation with unbiased machine learning approaches to quantify behavioral profiles. Here, we exploited this union with analysis of uninterrupted video recordings of touchscreen sessions using DeepLabCut (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mathis et al., 2018</xref>) and B-SOiD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hsu and Yttri, 2021</xref>) to determine the behavioral drivers of cognitive performance. Moreover, the high-throughput pipeline for video analysis from touchscreen sessions that we have established is available openly and may prove useful for future experiments aimed at identifying the behavioral correlates of cognitive performance in rodent models.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource"

id="s2-1"><title>Animals and housing</title><p>All animals were obtained from the Monash Animal Research Platform, Clayton, VIC, Australia. Initial exploration and optimization of the novel touchscreen testing system were performed in a cohort of female Sprague-Dawley rats (n=20), 6–7 weeks old at the commencement of testing. To assess both ABA and cognitive behavior in the same animals, female Sprague-Dawley rats were 5–6 weeks of age upon arrival in the laboratory. Young female rats were used in these studies because they are particularly vulnerable to developing the ABA phenotype, a feature that is incompletely understood but has translational relevance to the increased prevalence of anorexia nervosa in young women. Animals were group-housed and acclimated to the 12 hr light/dark cycle (lights off at 1100 hr) for 7 days before experiments commenced. To examine whether cognitive flexibility predicted pathological weight loss in ABA, rats (n=30) were tested on the pairwise discrimination and reversal learning task and subsequently exposed to the ABA paradigm. To determine whether exposure to ABA altered cognitive performance on the same task, rats (n=24) were exposed to the ABA paradigm and allowed to recover to ≥100% body weight prior to pairwise discrimination and reversal learning (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> for the timeline of experiments). To control for the effects of prior food restriction on cognitive ability in these tasks, a separate cohort of animals (n=22) were exposed to a period of restricted food access that matched the ABA exposure timeline.

The incision site was sealed by tissue adhesive (Vetbond 3 M; NSW, Australia). Following RFID implantation, rats were group housed (n=6 per group) in separate home cages of the automated touchscreen testing apparatus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>; PhenoSys, Berlin) and allowed to habituate to the home cage with ad libitum food access for 1 day prior to behavioral intervention. Food (standard laboratory rodent chow; Barastoc Feeds, AU) was provided daily prior to the dark phase throughout the duration of the experiment to maintain ~90% of free-feeding body weight. Because of the young age of the animals, this 90% was increased each week by 10% to account for the normal growth curve during development (Charles River Laboratories). The system was housed in a temperature (22–24°C) and humidity (30–50%) controlled room under a reversed 12 hr light/dark cycle (lights off at 1200 hr).</p><p>The custom-designed home cage (26 cm × 34 cm × 55 cm) was placed above an array of twenty RFID readers to track the movement of rats. An automated sorter cage connected the home cage to the testing chamber via two plastic tunnels (8.5 cm in diameter). The automated sorting system consisted of a sorter cage which was positioned directly above a scale for body weight recording, two RFID readers for animal identification, and between two software-controlled gates. Selective passage of a single rat from the home cage to the testing chamber required RFID detection and matching recorded body weight with pre-set weight defined within the PhenoSoft software. The trapezoid testing chamber consisted of two walls, a touchscreen and on the opposing wall a food magazine with an LED light. A test-specific touchscreen mask with windows at the top and bottom that was dependent on the testing/training phase was placed in front of the touchscreen. The touchscreen is illuminated with white light through the windows at the top of the mask to act as a house light to signal incorrect responses. Sucrose pellets (2.5 mm; Homeopathic Supply Company, UK) were used as rewards and delivered from an automated pellet dispenser positioned outside the testing chamber into the food magazine. Touches to the screen and the delivery and collection of food rewards were detected by the breaking of infrared (IR) beams. Conditioned stimuli consisted of a positive (high) tone and the illumination of LED light within the food magazine. Incorrect or omitted responses resulted in a negative (low) tone and the house light mentioned above, followed by a ‘time out’ period.

Rats were required to complete 2 sessions (2 × 30 positive trials) with accuracy &gt;80% within one day to reach the progression criterion to reversal learning, in which the stimulus-reward association was reversed. The progression criterion in reversal learning remained the same as in pairwise discrimination.

Rats were allowed to habituate to the living chamber with ad libitum food access and locked wheels for 3 days, then habituated to the running wheel for seven days to determine baseline running wheel activity. Running activity was recorded by the Scurry Activity Wheel Software (Lafayette Instruments, IN, USA). During ABA, food access was restricted to 90 min per day at the onset of the dark phase (1100–1230 hr). Running activity in the hour before the feeding window (1000–1100 hr) was considered as food anticipatory activity. Time-restricted food access persisted for a maximum of 10 days or until rats reached &lt;80% of baseline body weight (ABA criterion). Food-restricted control rats were individually housed in standard cages for 10 days with ad libitum food access, followed by 10 days of time-limited access to food for the same 90 min period as ABA rats.

In addition, three rats demonstrated abnormal weight loss trajectory due to food hoarding in ABA and were therefore excluded from all ABA analyses, as this behavior confounds the generation of the ABA phenotype. Moreover, one rat failed to recover to &gt;80% baseline body weight following exposure to ABA and one rat failed to learn pre-training to shape reward-based behavior towards the touchscreen after prior exposure to ABA. These two animals were excluded from all data analyses, resulting in a final sample size of n=22 in the assessment of the effect of prior exposure to ABA on cognitive flexibility.

Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 9.1.1 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA). Statistical significance was considered as p&lt;0.05 and analyses including Log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test, two-tailed unpaired t-test, linear regression, correlation, one-way and two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Tukey’s or Bonferroni’s post hoc multiple comparisons were used according to the number of groups and type of data. With respect to performance measures in the touchscreen task, the number of trials to performance criteria together with the trial type are the most informative, because they relate directly to the number of action-outcome associations required for learning. However, the number of sessions required to reach performance criteria is also important for understanding the speed of learning and consolidation.

We demonstrated that the automated system reduces the number of testing days to reach the reversal learning performance criterion by up to 10 times compared to conventional touchscreen testing methods (i.e. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Milton et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). We also confirmed that subsequent reversals were progressively easier to learn than the initial reversal with fewer sessions required to reach the performance criterion (first reversal &gt; second reversal: p=0.0099; first reversal &gt; third reversal: p=0.0070; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Interestingly, the speed of learning serial reversals was driven largely by reduced omissions at the second and third reversals (all ps &lt;0.0309; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D–E</xref>). One plausible contributor to the high number of omitted trials is the time of day, because animals can initiate sessions when they are motivated to perform the task as well as if they are simply exploring the touchscreen chamber. Considering that laboratory rats are well-known to be more active in the dark phase, we compared performance between animals who retained unlimited touchscreen access to those that had access restricted to the dark phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F–K</xref>). Restricting access to the dark phase increased accuracy overall (p=0.0039; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>) and especially in pairwise discrimination (p<italic>=</italic>0<italic>.</italic>0371), which was specific for initial learning, whereby more substantial between-group differences were seen during the first 100 trials (p<italic>=</italic>0.0030; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>). Dark-phase restriction also reduced the number of omitted responses during both pairwise discrimination and reversal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>), however, this was not significantly different overall (p=0.0737; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>) but rather restricted to the initial stages of discrimination and reversal learning (pairwise discrimination p<italic>=</italic>0.0024; reversal p<italic>=</italic>0<italic>.</italic>0332; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K</xref>). The reduced variability in responding within the restricted access group throughout serial reversal learning (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F &amp; I</xref>) is likely to be driven by an increase in motivation that is facilitated by restricted access, and although the time of day did not appear to systematically alter performance in animals with unrestricted access (all trials p=0.2088; trials responded to p=0.1766; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), we adopted this dark phase restricted approach for subsequent experimental cohorts.

Analysis of behavioral profiles during touchscreen testing sessions revealed that during initial discrimination learning, rats that went on to be resistant to ABA spent more time engaged in vertical exploration (rearing; p=0.0336) and locomoting (p=0.0190) compared to susceptible rats, which were significantly more inactive (p&lt;0.0001) during touchscreen testing sessions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3A</xref>). This differential behavioral profile was similar for reversal learning sessions, with increased rearing again evident in rats that would go on to be resistant to ABA (p=0.0384) and increased inactive time for susceptible rats (p&lt;0.0001), suggesting a consistent exploratory difference between groups even prior to ABA exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3B</xref>) that may contribute to variation in susceptibility to weight loss.</p><p>To examine whether prior exposure to ABA conditions elicited a persistent change in cognitive flexibility, we allowed animals to recover their body weight to &gt;100% of pre-exposure levels before testing them in the automated touchscreen system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Here, we show that ABA produced a profound impairment in both discrimination and flexible learning, even after weight recovery, that did not occur to the same extent following a matched period of food restriction alone. Not only were half (50%) of ABA-exposed animals unable to acquire the reversal learning task, compared to 32% of animals exposed to restricted food access and 11% of ABA-naïve animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), task acquisition was significantly slower than ABA-naïve rats. Exposure to ABA conditions increased the number of sessions required to reach performance criteria compared to ABA-naïve animals (ABA exposure p=0.0051; pairwise discrimination p=0.0098; reversal p=0.0205) with a similar trend compared to food restriction-only animals (ABA exposure p=0.0858; pairwise discrimination p=0.0539; reversal p=0.3985; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). In contrast, the ABA-naïve and food restriction-only groups were not different (all ps&gt;0.6758). While there was no overall difference in the number of trials required to reach progression criteria across the entirety of the experiment (p=0.1240; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>), the number of correct (versus ABA-naïve p<italic>=</italic>0.0185; versus food restriction-only p=0.0259), incorrect (versus food restriction-only p=0.0479) and omitted (versus ABA-naïve p=0.0224) trials to the acquisition of initial discrimination were significantly greater in the ABA-exposed group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Importantly, there were no differences in the number of trials to performance criterion required for ABA-naïve and food restricted-only control animals to learn pairwise discrimination (all ps&gt;0.9999; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>).

Video analysis of touchscreen sessions revealed that during pairwise discrimination, ABA-exposed animals spent more time inactive and less time engaged in task-relevant behaviors like rotating, investigating, and magazine interactions than did ABA-naïve animals, whereas behavioral profiles were more similar between groups for reversal sessions (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>). The <italic>specific</italic> impairment in reversal performance in the ABA-exposed animals was reflected by more substantial differences between ‘non-learners’ and ‘learners’ in time spent inactive during reversal compared to pairwise discrimination sessions, and by the specific reduction in task-relevant activities including interactions with the reward magazine and touchscreen images in reversal sessions only (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>).</p><p>Finally, to explore whether cognitive testing changed the development of the ABA phenotype, we compared ABA outcomes for touchscreen-testing naïve animals (Before Reversal Task) to those that occurred following touchscreen-based reversal learning (After Reversal Task; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Significantly more rats that underwent cognitive testing prior to ABA were able to resist the precipitous weight loss that characterizes the model (p&lt;0.0001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>) and demonstrated a slow trajectory of body weight loss that plateaued over consecutive days of ABA exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). When comparing outcomes for both susceptible and resistant animals on key ABA measures, those that had undergone touchscreen testing prior to ABA lost significantly less body weight each day (p&lt;0.0001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>) and ate more food when food was available (p=0.0009; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). As expected, rats that only underwent food restriction without access to a running wheel lost significantly less body weight (p&lt;0.0001) and ate more food in the 90 min window (p=0.0045) than ABA-exposed animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Rats that had undergone touchscreen testing prior to ABA also showed a blunted hyperactive phenotype when ABA conditions commenced that was already evident under baseline conditions (p&lt;0.0001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). Although running activity overall was significantly reduced in animals that had previously undergone cognitive testing both at baseline and during ABA (overall p=0.0002; baseline p=0.0160; ABA p&lt;0.0001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>), these rats showed elevated running specifically in the hour preceding food access, known as food anticipatory activity, which is an adaptive response to scheduled feeding (overall p&lt;0.0001; baseline p=0.0010; ABA p&lt;0.0001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>). While our previous work has shown elevated food anticipatory activity to be consistently associated with resistance to ABA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Milton et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Milton et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Milton et al., 2022</xref>), the increased food anticipatory activity at baseline for these animals suggests that an anticipatory response was carried over from the scheduled feeding conducted during touchscreen testing. Considering that exposure to cognitive training significantly increased the percentage of rats that were resistant to ABA, it was important to also examine the effects of cognitive training on ABA outcomes in only those rats susceptible to weight loss. The concern was that any differences in ABA outcomes may be driven solely by this subpopulation of resistant animals. Neither mean daily weight loss (p=0.1277; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I</xref>) nor food intake (p=0.7794; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J</xref>) were differentially altered by prior cognitive testing in susceptible rats, however, there remained significantly reduced levels of running wheel activity in susceptible rats following discrimination and reversal learning (p=0.0002; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5K</xref>). Again, susceptible rats that had previously undergone cognitive training ran less both at baseline (p=0.0426) and during ABA conditions (p=0.0165; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5L</xref>) whereas food anticipatory activity was specifically increased only during ABA (p=0.0357; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5M</xref>).

Critically, the rate of learning in the automated system was shown to be five times faster (with approximately 10 times higher throughput) than previously reported with conventional touchscreen testing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Milton et al., 2021</xref>). While the full spectrum of possibilities arising from the use of the modular PhenoSys touchscreen system is still being realized, the increased throughput, the requirement for fewer animals, and reduced labor time for experimenters represents a major shift in the way these experiments are conducted and analyzed. Our observation that the number of omitted trials is reduced (i.e. engagement is higher) when touchscreen access was limited to the dark phase is consistent with the well-established increase in activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Milton et al., 2021</xref>) and attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bruinsma et al., 2019</xref>) that rats exhibit during the dark period. Moreover, the ability to rapidly test cognitive flexibility with the automated touchscreen system allowed us, for the first time, to examine the cognitive profiles of animals prior to exposure to the ABA paradigm while ensuring that rats remained young adults for ABA exposure. In addition, we conducted this assay in socially appropriate groups and without experimenter intervention, increasing the reliability of outcomes and removing potential confounds of handling on subsequent ABA phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Carrera et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>Our previous work demonstrated that activity within a specific neural circuit (extending from the medial prefrontal cortex to the nucleus accumbens shell) links pathological weight loss in ABA with cognitive inflexibility on this reversal learning task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Milton et al., 2021</xref>) and suggested that inflexibility might be a biomarker for predicting susceptibility to ABA. The results presented here demonstrate that, contrary to our hypothesis, inflexibility does not predispose animals to the ABA phenotype but instead shows that rats that went on to be resistant to ABA were slower to learn the reversal task (i.e. were less flexible) than ABA-susceptible rats. This raises the intriguing possibility that either inflexibility develops coincident with pathological weight loss in the ABA model or that inflexibility in this instance is protective against ABA-induced weight loss. One finding supporting the latter is that rats that went on to be resistant to ABA were hyper-exploratory in touchscreen testing sessions, evidenced by increased rearing behaviors and decreased time spent inactive during the task. Persistently high exploratory activity may result in more errors during touchscreen test sessions as well as hastened food seeking during the feeding window of ABA. Regarding the former, while we did not examine flexible learning <italic>during</italic> exposure to ABA conditions, the idea that inflexibility and ABA develop in concert fits with the timing of neural circuit manipulation used in our previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Milton et al., 2021</xref>). That is, both pathological weight loss and inflexibility were prevented by suppressing the same ‘cognitive control’ neural circuit, but suppression occurred <italic>during</italic> the development of ABA, not prior to ABA exposure. To this end, future studies should delineate the precise stage during the development of the ABA phenotype where inflexibility becomes apparent, thereby defining a ‘therapeutic window’ in which novel pharmacological treatments could be tested with greater translational relevance.</p><p>It remains the case that the precise mechanisms underlying cognitive inflexibility in individuals with anorexia nervosa are not well understood, and while this reversal learning task may not capture the prodromal inflexibility that might play a role in the pathophysiology of anorexia nervosa, it may still provide important clues to direct us toward the neurobiological underpinnings of aberrant reinforcement learning in patients. For example, if reversal learning is defined as the ability to adapt behavior based on negative feedback (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Robbins et al., 2012</xref>), our demonstration that improved reversal learning is associated with increased susceptibility to ABA fits with the hypothesis that maladaptive behaviors in anorexia nervosa act to alleviate negative affect and are strengthened through heightened negative reinforcement learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Coniglio et al., 2022</xref>). Exposure to ABA conditions, but not food restriction alone, significantly impairs cognitive flexibility, indicating that the excessive exercise component of the ABA model disrupts the integration of new and existing learning that is necessary for performance on the reversal learning task.</p><p>The development of paradoxical hyperactivity when restricted food access is imposed, a major hallmark of the ABA phenotype, may reflect a compulsive behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Miletta et al., 2020</xref>) defined by persistent wheel running (energy output) despite the negative consequences of rapidly declining body weight. And yet the ability to effectively adapt behavior to environmentally imposed change (reversal learning) was improved in rats that demonstrated the highest levels of food restriction-evoked hyperactivity and became susceptible to ABA. This challenges our conceptualization of the so-called ‘compulsive’ wheel running that occurs during ABA and precipitates the rapid weight loss characteristic of the model. Even after decades of experimental use of the ABA model, the causes for this paradoxical hyperactivity remain elusive. A recent study in ABA mice demonstrated that a loss of behavioral flexibility following disrupted cholinergic activity in the dorsal striatum was associated with both facilitated habit formation and increased vulnerability to maladaptive eating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Favier et al., 2020</xref>) but neither the accelerated formation of habits, or inflexible behaviors were associated with changes in hyperactivity. Similarly, although compulsive behavior in individuals with anorexia nervosa has been described to develop under more habitual than goal-directed control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Foerde et al., 2021</xref>) these associations have been restricted to eating behavior rather than exercise. We hypothesize that excessive exercise in ABA rats (and possibly in individuals with anorexia nervosa) represents not a habitual behavior but rather a form of extreme goal-directed control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hogarth, 2020</xref>).</p><p>Compulsions have been defined as the repeated, goal-directed selection of a habit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bradfleld et al., 2017</xref>), and perhaps it is the failure to integrate goal-directed (excessive exercise) and habitual (restrictive feeding) action control that underlies the paradoxical behaviors observed in both human anorexia and the ABA model. Recent evidence suggests that only a subset of patients suffering from anorexia nervosa show enhanced habit formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Favier et al., 2020</xref>), which can be differentiated from a more goal-directed patient subgroup by decreased medial orbitofrontal cortex activation during reward anticipation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Steding et al., 2019</xref>). Together, these data highlight the need to directly examine the reciprocal effects of ABA and goal-directed action; specifically focusing on the ability to adapt action selection after outcome-devaluation. Since the cholinergic function of the dorsal striatum is associated with both maladaptive eating in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Favier et al., 2020</xref>) and the interlacing of new and existing learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bradfield et al., 2013</xref>), the ability to adapt behavior in response to changing outcome values after the reversal of action-outcome pairings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Matamales et al., 2016</xref>) may be of more relevance to ABA than the reversal of stimulus pairings examined in this study. Understanding how goal-directed and habitual control of wheel running might change over the course of ABA exposure could inform modifications to cognitive-behavioral therapy for individuals with anorexia nervosa based on a perspective of eating disorder-relevant goals, particularly in those ~80% of patients that engage in excessive exercise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Davis et al., 1997</xref>). Combining the ABA model with cognitive behavioral assays that contrast habitual with goal-directed behavior, including outcome devaluation tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Watson et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Turner et al., 2022</xref>), and probing the involvement of the dorsal striatum and orbitofrontal cortex could aid substantially in this understanding.</p><p>Our data also suggest that operant training prior to exposure to ABA also alters the subsequent development of anorectic phenotypes, particularly by reducing the maladaptive wheel running that typifies the ABA model. This effect is likely to relate to the procedural aspects of training (i.e. mild food restriction combined with sucrose rewards) rather than to task performance, considering that rats that went onto be susceptible to ABA acquired the reversal task more quickly than rats that went onto be resistant. It should also be noted that the cohort of rats that were experimentally naïve prior to ABA exposure was surprisingly mostly susceptible to weight loss (21/22 rats), a much higher proportion than is normally seen on a cohort-to-cohort basis. This single ‘resistant’ rat was among the fastest ABA-exposed animals to acquire performance criteria in the reversal task (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>), but was not a significant group outlier. While the independent effects of sucrose consumption and scheduled feeding on subsequent weight loss in ABA are yet to be determined, if ABA indeed develops through a failure to effectively adapt to the change in food availability, then our results support the idea that <italic>experience</italic> with reinforcement learning tasks (regardless of the speed of task acquisition) improves this adaptive capacity. Interestingly, this aligns with recent evidence that increased cognitive flexibility mediates improvements in eating disorder symptoms in patients with anorexia nervosa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Duriez et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>While the identification of a behavioral predictor (or biomarker) for pathological weight loss in ABA remains a challenge, the finding that rats exposed to ABA subsequently showed marked impairments in both discrimination and reversal learning, even after body weight recovery, is entirely in line with the clinical presentation of inflexibility in patients with anorexia nervosa long after body weight recovery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Tchanturia et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Friederich and Herzog, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Tchanturia et al., 2004</xref>). The finding that exposure to food restriction, resulting in mild weight loss and a non-significant decrease in learning performance, indicates that the severe cognitive impairment seen in ABA-exposed rats was related to the <italic>speed and extent</italic> of weight loss. Intriguingly, this learning impairment induced by ABA exposure was evident from the first session of each phase of training and even within the first 10 min of initial pairwise discrimination performance (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">Figure 4—figure supplement 5</xref>). This lends weight to the use of the ABA model as an effective tool with which to probe the biological mechanisms underlying cognitive deficits in anorexia nervosa. Our finding is in contrast to the only other published report of flexible learning after exposure to ABA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allen et al., 2017</xref>), in which reversal learning was impaired at low body weight in ABA rats but ameliorated with weight recovery. Although the reasons for this discrepancy remain unclear, the touchscreen testing system used in the present study differs on multiple procedural levels from the attentional set-shifting task previously used to examine flexible learning, and our results suggest that the visual reversal learning task may be preferable for delineating the lasting effects of ABA exposure on cognitive function. That we observed impairments following ABA not only on flexible updating of operant responses but also initial discrimination learning points to a potential motivational deficit induced by ABA. This is in line with our previous work demonstrating a role for the mesolimbic dopamine circuitry in the development and maintenance of the ABA phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Foldi et al., 2017</xref>). Considering that exercise behavior in anorexia nervosa is also linked with dopaminergic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gorrell et al., 2020</xref>), future studies should define the time course over which motivation or reward-based deficits arise during ABA and the specific influence of ABA on dopamine signaling in response to reward anticipation and receipt using in vivo fiber photometric recordings paired with detection of dopamine release (using the GRAB_DA sensor; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sun et al., 2018</xref>) or dopamine binding (using the dLight sensor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Patriarchi et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Not only does the automated touchscreen testing system described here allow us to identify cognitive profiles that more accurately reflect the naturalistic behavior of animals, but the incorporation of behavioral segmentation using machine learning also assisted with reducing experimenter biases that are commonly found with manual behavioral scoring. The application of DeepLabCut and B-SOiD to the prediction of behaviors in the present study has allowed for additional exploration of behaviors that could contribute toward cognitive task performance in rats that will aid in the generation of hypotheses to be tested in future studies. Using these tools also enabled the scoring of very large datasets, such as the 185 hr of footage analyzed here. Incorporating this type of analysis with animal models that mimic specific aspects of human pathologies will take us closer than ever before to the identification of biological predictors of pathological weight loss in ABA that could be used in the early detection of anorexia nervosa in at-risk individuals.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Supervision, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Data curation, Investigation, Writing – original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Supervision, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Supervision, Investigation, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Data curation, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>All experimental procedures were conducted in accordance with the Australian Code for the care and use of animals for scientific purposes and approved by the Monash Animal Resource Platform Ethics Committee (ERM 29143 and 15171).</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media xlink:href="elife-84961-mdarchecklist1-v2.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>Touchscreen parameters.</title><p>Parameters for pretraining and 2VDLR in the novel touchscreen apparatus.</p></caption><media xlink:href="elife-84961-supp1-v2.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>The data generated in this paper can be found at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.21539685">https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.21539685</ext-link>.

These features make it possible to assess cognitive behaviors in conjunction with other neurobehavioral paradigms during adolescence, an important advance in the field. The data are compelling in showing that cognitive flexibility does not promote susceptibility to severe weight loss in the activity-based anorexia (ABA) paradigm and support the claim that the cognitive deficits seen in ABA-exposed rats reflect an important clinical feature of the pathophysiology of anorexia nervosa.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.84961.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Bradfield</surname><given-names>Laura A</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/03f0f6041</institution-id><institution>University of Technology Sydney</institution></institution-wrap><country>Australia</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Bradfield</surname><given-names>Laura A</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/03f0f6041</institution-id><institution>University of Technology Sydney</institution></institution-wrap><country>Australia</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: (i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2022.11.15.516539">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.11.15.516539v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; (ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Laura A Bradfield as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Kate Wassum as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The reviewers agree that the paper is novel and provides a thorough assessment of a new, experimenter-free methodology that can be used to assess cognitive deficits as applied to a potential model of anorexia nervosa. However, some revisions are necessary, in particular, to support the claim that the ABA model can be used to model the cognitive inflexibility that develops in the pathophysiological progress of anorexia nervosa.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) We request the addition of a control group with restricted access to food in order to validate that this model can be used to study anorexia. Even if the data argue against the validity of the ABA model to study cognitive inflexibility in anorexia nervosa, the manuscript would still be valuable a) As a methods paper (that includes a detailed discussion and guidance regarding parameters that are most informative); and b) to demonstrate that the ABA paradigm should not be used to study cognitive deficits in anorexia nervosa. The authors should also discuss whether cognitive deficits were preferentially seen in rats that exhibited severe weight loss in the ABA paradigm. The failure to observe a correlation would undermine the argument that this model can be used to study AN.</p><p>2) Please follow the suggestions of reviewers with regards to using the correct terminology, and making it clearer what exactly was done at what point by including more details in the methods as well as which parameters were most relevant to each analysis.</p><p>3) Please ensure your manuscript complies with the <italic>eLife</italic> policies for statistical reporting: https://reviewer.elifesciences.org/author-guide/full &quot;Report summary statistics (e.g., t, F values) and degrees of freedom, exact p-values, and 95% confidence intervals wherever possible. These should be reported for all key questions and not only when the p-value is less than 0.05.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>With regards to methodological details and the general presentation of results etc in the text, I have a few suggestions:</p><p>1.

Even if the data argue against the validity of the ABA model to study cognitive inflexibility in anorexia nervosa, the manuscript would still be valuable a) As a methods paper (that includes a detailed discussion and guidance regarding parameters that are most informative); and b) to demonstrate that the ABA paradigm should not be used to study cognitive deficits in anorexia nervosa. The authors should also discuss whether cognitive deficits were preferentially seen in rats that exhibited severe weight loss in the ABA paradigm. The failure to observe a correlation would undermine the argument that this model can be used to study AN.</p></disp-quote><p>This missing control group was an oversight on our part and has now been included to show that restricted food access alone does not cause the level of impairment in reversal learning seen following exposure to ABA conditions. These animals received exactly the same food access period as ABA rats, across the same number of days, and exhibited what could be described as “mild” weight loss (see updated Figure 4 and figure supplements). With the considerations about operant task type and the potential role of negative reinforcement driving maladaptive behaviours expressed by ABA rats highlighted in the discussion, we believe that ABA remains a valuable tool to study the biological underpinnings of cognitive deficits seen in anorexia nervosa. With respect to the <italic>severity</italic> of weight loss in ABA rats being correlated with preferential cognitive deficits, the narrow weight loss range in ABA (i.e. 20-24%), necessary for adhering to ethical guidelines, precludes an informative evaluation of this. However, the observation that mild weight loss (average 9.01%) in food-restricted control rats did not impair reversal learning to the same extent suggests that the more severe weight loss exhibited by ABA rats was a key driver of cognitive impairment. This supports the argument that the ABA model can be used to study cognitive deficits in AN.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Please follow the suggestions of reviewers with regards to using the correct terminology, and making it clearer what exactly was done at what point by including more details in the methods as well as which parameters were most relevant to each analysis.</p></disp-quote><p>Terminology has been updated as indicated.

Some explanation for this apparent difference is needed.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this concern and acknowledge the disconnect was not explored sufficiently in the previous submission. There are 2 parts to this explanation that have now been included in the discussion text of the manuscript in the appropriate paragraphs.</p><p>The first part relates to why those rats that were fastest to learn the reversal task went onto be susceptible to weight loss in ABA. What we believe to be the case, although this has not yet been empirically shown, is that food restriction evoked hyperactivity in ABA, one of the critical drivers of susceptibility to weight loss, is reinforced through the alleviation of negative affect (stress, hunger etc). Performance on the reversal task is also driven by negative feedback (i.e. previously learned actions are not rewarded until the animal adapts its behaviour to select the previously unrewarded image). Rats that went onto be susceptible to ABA required less negative feedback to learn the reversal task, therefore it seems plausible that they more quickly learned the reinforcing properties of wheel running during restricted food access, engage in more running behaviour and ultimately become susceptible to ABA.</p><p>Regarding why exposure to cognitive testing produced more resistant rats, seemingly at odds with the above result, we believe this relates to the procedural aspects of training rather than to task performance <italic>per se</italic>. Regardless of task performance, rats that underwent cognitive testing received sucrose rewards over multiple test days and were subject to mild food restriction as per standard operant test protocols. Both of these procedural aspects may have caused the shift toward resistance compared to animals that were experimentally naïve prior to ABA exposure. It should also be noted that the test group that were exposed to ABA first and then tested on the reversal task were surprisingly mostly susceptible (21/22 rats) a much higher proportion than we usually see on a cohort-to-cohort basis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Another issue is whether all the rats in the first experiment entered the ABA at the same age. Older animals, even by a few days, show more resistance to the ABA paradigm. Did the poorer performance in the touch screen tasks result in these animals being older at the time of ABA? Could this explain the difference in susceptibility?</p></disp-quote><p>We understand this reviewers concern regarding the age at which ABA commenced impacting on susceptibility. It is true that animals entered the ABA paradigm once they had learned the reversal task, such that the faster learners would commence ABA exposure some days earlier than slower learners. However, there was no significant difference in the age at which ABA commenced between Susceptible and Resistant subpopulations (see additional resource for Figure 3 —figure supplement 2), indicating that age was not a contributing factor to the difference in susceptibility. Text in methods has been edited for clarity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Please provide a reference to the statement on line 77 that manual transfer to a test chamber affects social behavior.</p></disp-quote><p>Our intention with this statement was more a comment on a typical housing situation in which animals are pair-housed during operant testing and when transferred manually to conventional test chambers, the home-cage social dynamics are disrupted. We appreciate that this is somewhat outside of the scope of the statement and has not been empirically tested, so we have removed this statement for clarity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In the experiment examining the effects of prior ABA exposure, were both susceptible and resistant rats tested for cognitive flexibility? Were there differences?</p></disp-quote><p>As noted in Figure 5B, there was only 1 animal resistant to ABA in the prior exposure group, therefore data from all animals was pooled. In terms of where this animal sits in reversal learning rate, we have prepared bar graphs of performance measures with the resistant animal highlighted in red to show that while this resistant rat was among the fastest of the ABA exposed animals to acquire the task, it was not a statistical outlier (Figure 4—figure supplement 2).

However, a minimum number of both trials and sessions are required to be met for progression criteria, a factor that necessitates the presentation of both parameters. We also believe that the number of sessions animals required to reach criterion is also important for describing the learning rate and complements the trials measures, because it incorporates consolidation as well as allows for comparison with traditional methods of touchscreen operant testing. We agree that the number of days to criterion is largely superfluous for understanding cognitive performance, particularly because the number of sessions allowed per day is determined by the experimenter. Thus, while we have retained the “days to criterion” measure in the validation of the novel system and method figure (Figure 2), we have removed these data from other figures. We have also removed the ratio of correct/non-correct graph from Figure 3 as it in essence recapitulates the correct and non-correct trials in their raw data form.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5.

We have prepared a subset of graphs from this figure panel in which the resistant animal is highlighted in red (Figure 4—figure supplement 2) to demonstrate this animal did not perform differently to susceptible animals, but rather the exposure to ABA conditions independent of amount of weight loss, was the driver of poor performance.
