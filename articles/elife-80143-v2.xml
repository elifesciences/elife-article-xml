In the sibling comparison, we observed an increased risk of psychiatric disorder during the first year after CVD diagnosis (hazard ratio [HR], 2.74; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.62–2.87) and thereafter (1.45; 95% CI, 1.42–1.48). Increased risks were observed for all types of psychiatric disorders and among all diagnoses of CVD. We observed similar associations in the population comparison.

It is for instance demonstrated that a cancer diagnosis is associated with subsequent risk of psychiatric disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lu et al., 2016</xref>) and self-inflicted injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Shen et al., 2016</xref>), which in turn might be associated with a compromised cancer survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Zhu et al., 2017</xref>). Psychiatric comorbidities have also been reported among patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD), for example, stroke (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lindén et al., 2007</xref>), heart failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Rutledge et al., 2006</xref>), and myocardial infarction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Thombs et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Shemesh et al., 2004</xref>), with indications of elevated risk of overall mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Doering et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wrenn et al., 2013</xref>). Yet, evidence on the association between CVD and subsequent development of psychiatric disorders is still limited as previous research has mainly relied on selected patient populations instead of complete follow-up of general population as well as limited control of reverse causality and important confounding factors, for example, familial factors and comorbidities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Lincoln et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Morrison et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Romanelli et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>We thoroughly searched the existing literature on the association between CVD and clinically confirmed psychiatric disorders or psychiatric symptoms. After excluding most studies with either cross-sectional or retrospective designs, we only found 12 prospective cohort studies investigating the risk of selected psychiatric disorders following a diagnosis of CVD (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1a</xref>). While these prospective studies suggest a positive association of hypertension, heart disease, and stroke with depressive symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Morrison et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Wium-Andersen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Baccaro et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Pohjasvaara et al., 2001</xref>) and stress-related disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chang et al., 2017</xref>), they were limited to elderly populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Petersson et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>), and used self-reported ascertainment of psychiatric outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Petersson et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>) Only few of these studies addressed incident or first diagnosed psychiatric disorders among patients with CVD, for example, excluding patients with history of psychiatric disorders, and no study addressed the issue of familial confounding. Indeed, genetic correlation has recently been document between these two complex disease groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barnett and Smoller, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Kathiresan and Srivastava, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Rødevand et al., 2021</xref>) as well as the importance of early life environment for the development of both CVD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kelishadi and Poursafa, 2014</xref>) and psychiatric disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Rokita et al., 2018</xref>). It is therefore unknown to what extent the reported association between CVD and psychiatric disorder can be explained by unmeasured confounding shared within families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barnett and Smoller, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Kathiresan and Srivastava, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Rødevand et al., 2021</xref>). Thus, a comprehensive evaluation of the association between all CVDs and risk of any incident psychiatric disorder, addressing the abovementioned shortcomings, is warranted.</p><p>With up to 30 years of follow-up and with nationwide complete information on family links in Sweden, we aimed to investigate the association between CVD diagnosed in specialist care and subsequent risk of incident psychiatric disorders while accounting for familial factors through a sibling comparison. We further aimed to estimate the potential role of psychiatric comorbidity in cardiovascular mortality among patients with CVD.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Study design</title><p>The Swedish Patient Register contains national information on inpatient care with complete coverage since 1987 and outpatient specialized care since 2001 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ludvigsson et al., 2011</xref>). The Swedish Multi-Generation Register includes nearly complete familial information for Swedish residents born since 1932 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ekbom, 2011</xref>). Using personal identification numbers assigned to all Swedish residents, we identified all individuals born in Sweden after 1932 who received a first diagnosis of any CVD and attended inpatient or outpatient specialized care between January 1, 1987 and December 31, 2016 (<italic>N</italic> = 986,726). Patients diagnosed with CVD before age 5 (<italic>N</italic> = 6091, probable congenital heart disease) or with a history of any psychiatric disorder before the diagnosis of CVD (<italic>N</italic> = 111,579) were excluded, leaving 869,056 patients in the analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>).

Through the Multi-Generation Register, we identified all full siblings of patients with CVD (58.6% of all CVD patients) who were alive and free of CVD and psychiatric disorder at the time when their affected sibling was diagnosed (<italic>N</italic> = 910,178). In addition, for each patient with CVD, we randomly selected 10 age- and sex-matched individuals from the general population who were free of CVD or psychiatric disorder when the index patient was diagnosed (<italic>N</italic> = 8,690,560). The date of CVD diagnosis for the index patient was used as the index date for their unaffected siblings and matched population controls.</p><p>All study participants were followed from the index date until first diagnosis of any psychiatric disorder, death, emigration, first diagnosis of CVD (for unaffected siblings and matched population controls), or the end of the study period (December 31, 2016), whichever occurred first.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Ascertainment of CVD and psychiatric disorder</title><p>We defined CVD as any first inpatient or outpatient hospital visit with CVD as the primary diagnosis from the Swedish Patient Register. Incident psychiatric disorder was defined as any first inpatient or outpatient hospital visit with psychiatric disorder as the primary diagnosis. We used the 9th and 10th Swedish revisions of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-9 and 10) codes to identify CVD and psychiatric disorders and their subtypes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1b</xref>). In line with previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Song et al., 2019</xref>), we classified CVD as ischemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, emboli/thrombosis, hypertensive disease, heart failure, and arrhythmia/conduction disorder. We classified psychiatric disorders as non-affective psychotic disorders, affective psychotic disorders, alcohol or drug misuse, mood disorders excluding psychotic symptoms, anxiety and stress-related disorders, eating disorders, and personality disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Nevriana et al., 2020</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Covariates</title><p>We extracted socioeconomic information for each participant, including educational level, individualized family income, and cohabitation status, from the Longitudinal Integration Database for Health Insurance and Labor Market (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Longitudinell integrationsdatabas för sjukförsäkrings- och arbetsmarknadsstudier (LISA), 2018</xref>). Missing information on socioeconomic status was categorized as unknown or missing group.

We defined a family history of psychiatric disorders as a diagnosis of any psychiatric disorder among biological parents and full siblings of the study participants before the index date according to the Swedish Patient Register.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>We used flexible parametric survival models to estimate the time-varying association between CVD and subsequent risk of incident psychiatric disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Lambert and Royston, 2009</xref>), by comparing the rates of incident psychiatric disorders in CVD patients with the corresponding rates in their unaffected full siblings and matched population controls. As we observed a marked risk increase of psychiatric disorders immediately following the CVD diagnosis, we separately assessed the association within 1 year of CVD diagnosis and beyond 1 year. Hazard ratios (HRs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were derived from stratified Cox regression models, using time since the index date as the underlying time scale. We estimated HRs for any psychiatric disorder and categories of psychiatric disorders. We performed subgroup analyses by sex, age at index date (&lt;50, 50–60, or &gt;60 years), age at follow-up (&lt;60 or ≥60 years), history of somatic diseases (no or yes), and family history of psychiatric disorder (no or yes). We also performed subgroup analysis by calendar year at index date (1987–1996, 1997–2006, or 2007–2016) to check for potentially different associations over time (i.e., due to lifestyle factors that changed over time, including smoking and alcohol use) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sundin and Willner, 2007</xref>). In the sibling comparison, all Cox models were stratified by sibling sets and adjusted for sex, birth year, educational level, individualized family income, cohabitation status, and history of somatic diseases. In the population comparison, all Cox models were stratified by the matching variables birth year and sex and adjusted for all abovementioned covariates plus family history of psychiatric disorder.</p><p>To study the impact of additional cardiovascular comorbidity (i.e., patients with another type of CVD after diagnosis of the first CVD), we analyzed the association by the presence or absence of cardiovascular comorbidity after the index date according to the type of first CVD. This analysis was restricted to follow-up beyond 1 year to focus on patients who survived their first CVD to be able to receive the diagnosis of another CVD. As a patient with CVD might have different types of CVD, we identified all diagnoses of CVD during follow-up and considered CVD comorbidity as a time-varying variable through splitting the person-time according to each diagnosis.</p><p>Because the Swedish Patient Register includes only information related to specialist care, we might have misclassified patients with a history of milder psychiatric disorders diagnosed before index date attended only in primary care. To account for the reverse causality of having undetected psychiatric disorders or symptoms before the incident CVD, we performed a sensitivity analysis additionally excluding study participants with prescribed use of psychotropic drugs before the index date (ascertained from the Swedish Prescribed Drug Register including information on all prescribed medication use in Sweden since July 2005), and followed the remaining participants during 2006–2016. Use of psychotropic drugs during follow-up was also considered as having psychiatric disorder in this analysis.</p><p>To study rate of cardiovascular mortality (ascertained from the Swedish Causes of Death Register) in relation to psychiatric comorbidities after CVD diagnosis, we estimated Kaplan–Meier survival curves beyond the first year of follow-up for CVD patients with or without a diagnosis of psychiatric disorder during the first year of follow-up, separately. We estimated the survival curves by types of first diagnosed CVD as well as by types of psychiatric comorbidities. In addition to this 1-year time window, we also studied 6 months or 2 years since CVD diagnosis, to assess the robustness of these survival curves. We calculated the HRs of cardiovascular mortality for these two groups of patients using Cox model. To account for potential impact of unmeasured confounding due to lifestyle factors, we performed a sensitivity analysis excluding individuals with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis of liver (ICD-10 code K703) or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD, ICD-10 code J44), as proxies for heavy drinking or smoking.</p><p>Analyses were performed in STATA 17.0 (StataCorp LP).

The risk increment was greatest during the year after CVD diagnosis, indicating an opportunity for clinical surveillance in a high-risk time window. Further, an occurrence of psychiatric comorbidity after CVD diagnosis was associated with an approximately 55% higher risk of subsequent death from cardiovascular causes.

Our study therefore complements previous findings revealing a positive association between a broader range of CVDs and subsequent risk of incident psychiatric disorder, using a large cohort with control of various confounding factors. We found the association to be robust both in sibling and population comparisons, and after additional adjustment for various comorbidities including other additional CVDs, indicating that the association is unlikely explained by shared familial factors and various comorbidities. In addition to common psychiatric disorders, the evidence on CVD and other psychiatric disorders, for example, eating disorder, is limited. Our study therefore provides valuable indication on this association that deserves further research attention. We showed that CVD patients with psychiatric comorbidity were associated with an increased risk of subsequent CVD death, highlighting the importance of surveillance and prevention on psychiatric comorbidities for the newly diagnosed CVD patients. The associations remained similar after excluding individuals with liver cirrhosis and COPD, as proxies for heavy alcohol consumption and smoking, suggesting that residual confounding due to unmeasured lifestyle factors might not have overly substantial impact on the results.</p><p>The association between CVD and psychiatric disorders was noted both in men and women, across all age groups and calendar periods, as well as among individuals with or without a history of somatic diseases and family history of psychiatric disorders. Previous studies have indicated that major depression was more commonly recognized among individuals with multimorbidity (more than one CVD diagnosis) than those with only one condition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Findley et al., 2011</xref>). In our study, about 30% of the CVD patients developed one or more cardiovascular comorbidities during follow-up, and a higher risk of psychiatric disorder was indeed noted among patients with multiple CVD diagnoses. A compromised survival from CVD cause was indeed observed among most patients with common types of first CVD diagnosis and comorbid with psychiatric disorder, in particular among patients with hypertensive disease, ischemic heart disease, and arrhythmia/conduction disorder. Thus, particular clinical attention is needed for CVD patients with comorbid psychiatric disorders, particularly alcohol or drug misuse or psychotic disorders.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Potential mechanisms</title><p>The pathophysiological mechanisms linking CVD and psychiatric disorders are complex and not well understood, and may vary with specific diagnoses of CVD and psychiatric disorders. The highly increased risk noted immediately after CVD diagnosis may indicate a direct impact of stress reaction of being diagnosed with a life-threatening disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fang et al., 2012</xref>). In addition, it has been proposed that biological alterations in the cardiovascular system to a severe stress response may increase the risk of various psychiatric disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Levine et al., 2021</xref>). For example, cardiovascular risk factors including hypercoagulability, dyslipidemia, and an impaired immune response have been associated with impaired psychological health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Levine et al., 2021</xref>). Some biological changes in patients with coronary heart disease (e.g., decreased heart rate variability, increased arterial stiffness, and endothelial dysfunction) have been observed in patients with depressive and anxiety disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sherwood et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Seldenrijk et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Stein et al., 2000</xref>). Chronic inflammation may induce the development of atherosclerosis and arterial thrombosis, and elevation in inflammatory biomarkers (i.e., IL-6 and C-reactive protein) has been reported in various psychiatric disorders including post-traumatic stress disorder and major depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Libby, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sumner et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Miller and Raison, 2016</xref>). Other behavioral and psychosocial factors may as well interact with these pathways and need to be understood further.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>The strengths of our study include its large sample size of the entire Swedish nation and the prospective study design with sibling comparison that significantly alleviates concerns of familial confounding from shared genetic and environmental factors between siblings. The Swedish population and health registers provide the opportunity to obtain complete follow-up as well as the prospectively and independently collected information on disease identification, minimizing the risk of selection and information biases. The large sample size of our study further enables detailed subgroup analyses by types of CVD, types of psychiatric disorders, and patient characteristics.</p><p>Some limitations need to be acknowledged. First, we identified patients with CVD and psychiatric disorder through inpatient or outpatient hospital visit. The later inclusion of outpatient records in the Swedish Patient Register may lead to underestimation of the actual numbers of patients with CVD and psychiatric disorder, especially those with relatively milder symptoms. Second, we missed individuals attending primary care only, which may underestimate the proportion of individuals with history of psychiatric disorders at cohort entry. To alleviate such concerns, we additionally considered the use of prescribed psychotropic drugs as a proxy of psychiatric disorders and found similar results. Further, patients with CVD have an established contact with health care and may therefore be more likely than others to be diagnosed with psychiatric disorder. Although such surveillance bias may to some extent explain the increased risks during the first few months after CVD diagnosis, it is unlikely that the risk elevation during the entire follow-up is attributed to such bias. Finally, although we found similar results with and without excluding individuals with a history of liver cirrhosis or COPD, as proxies for heavy drinking or smoking (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1h</xref>). We did not have direct access to hazardous behaviors that could potentially modify this association, and therefore cannot exclude the possibility of residual confounding.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Using a large population-based sibling-controlled cohort with up to 30 years of follow-up, we found patients with CVD are at elevated risk of newly diagnosed psychiatric disorder, independent of familial background shared between siblings, history of somatic diseases, and other cardiovascular comorbidities. Our study further observes higher cardiovascular mortality among CVD patients with subsequent psychiatric comorbidities, providing evidence for increased surveillance of psychiatric comorbidity among newly diagnosed patients with CVD.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing - original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Investigation, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Data curation, Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Funding acquisition, Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Investigation, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con11"><p>Resources, Data curation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con12"><p>Investigation, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con13"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con14"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>The study was approved by the Ethical Vetting Board in Stockholm, Sweden (DNRs 2012/1814-31/4 and 2015/1062-32).

Previous studies have consistently reported an association between psychiatric disorders and CVD [1,2], thus, we agree that reverse causality may, in principle, explain some of the observed results indicating a rise in incident psychiatric disorders after incident CVD, particularly during the immediate period. Yet, it is reasonable to assume that a diagnosis of a lifethreatening disease, such as CVD, is in many cases a traumatic experience resulting in an immediate rise in risks of psychiatric disorders. Others have reported such associations e.g. after natural disasters and we have indeed observed such a pattern in our previous work, e.g., after cancer diagnosis [3]. However, we agree that reverse causality cannot be excluded and may partly contribute to the highly increased risk of psychiatric disorder immediately after CVD diagnosis. Indeed, some of these patients may have been attended for their psychiatric disorders in primary care before the incident CVD. As the Patient Register only captures in- and outpatient hospital care, we have conducted an additional analysis, also excluding individuals with previous prescriptions of psychotropic drugs (ATC codes: N05, N06) before their incident CVD – thereby adding a detection of patients with prevalent mental health problems attended by primary care. The results show similar point estimates (Supplementary File 1g) thus not supporting the notion that reverse causality is a major concern. Furthermore, the association is noted up to 28 years after CVD diagnosis, which is unlikely due to reverse causality.</p><p>We have now added our motivation for this additional analysis on the Method (Page 9), as below.</p><p>“Because the Swedish Patient Register includes only information related to specialist care, we might have misclassified patients with a history of milder psychiatric disorders diagnosed before index date attended only in primary care. To account for the reverse causality of having undetected psychiatric disorders or symptoms before the incident CVD, we performed a sensitivity analysis additionally excluding study participants with prescribed use of psychotropic drugs before the index date (ascertained from the Swedish Prescribed Drug Register including information on all prescribed medication use in Sweden since July 2005), and followed the remaining participants from 2006 to 2016.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Could adjusting for matched factors in such cohort studies re-introduce bias into these estimates?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the comment. Adjusting for matching factors should provide estimates with the same validity as using a stratified model. In our study, we matched individuals diagnosed with a CVD with their unaffected full siblings as well as 10 randomly selected, unexposed individuals, on the same age and sex, without such diagnosis. As controlling for matching variables is recommended when there are additional confounders [1,2], we used a stratified Cox model commonly applied in family-based studies [3,4].</p><p>References:</p><p>1.

As correctly pointed out by the reviewer, we used a matched cohort design, both in the population- and sibling comparison. We firstly identified a nationwide cohort of general population who were born after 1932 and were residing in Sweden 1987-2016. We then identified all exposed individuals with first-ever diagnosis of CVD and matched population controls from this same nationwide population.</p><p>A matched cohort design is applied here due to the strong confounding effects of some variables, e.g., age and sex, on the studied association between CVD and risk of psychiatric disorder. Exact matching on age and sex in our study makes the exposed and unexposed groups comparable and relief the confounding effects from matching factors in the design phase. Another practical viewpoint for why we use a matched cohort is a straightforward understanding of the comparison between exposed and unexposed groups being always at the same time, providing measures (such as risks and rates) during the follow-up period that are easily interpreted. Further, we have used this matched cohort design in many of our previous works [1,2] to maintain an identical design in both sibling and population comparison, so that the point estimates can be directly compared. The matched cohort design generates results of equal validity of the more conventional cohort design suggested by the reviewer [3] but has the additional quality of making the results from the various cohorts (here: population- and sibling comparison) more comparable. Our study therefore takes advantage of using a siblingcontrolled matched cohort, which is indeed a cohort design recommended for family-based studies [4] and provides results with similar validity as a full cohort.</p><p>We have now added a sentence and a reference in Method to motivate the use of matched cohort design (Page 7).</p><p>“We constructed a sibling-controlled matched cohort to control for the familial confounding according to guidelines for designing family-based studies.<sup>24</sup>”</p><p>We have now updated the flowchart to add a box in the top reflecting the source population where both groups were identified from, shown in Supplementary File 2.</p><p>References:</p><p>1.

Sibling comparison can control for shared familial factors including lifestyles developed in early life. However, residual confounding from lifestyle factors not shared within siblings may still exist. In our study, the associations between CVD and psychiatric disorders were quite stable across calendar time, although somewhat stronger by the end of the observation period. The evidence does not suggest a drastic change in lifestyle factors in Sweden during the latter part of the observation period except for a slight increase in alcohol consumption [1,2] and liver cirrhosis [3]. Although we find it implausible that such underlying secular trends in lifestyle are a major contributor in the reported associations, we have now conducted additional analyses, excluding individuals with alcoholic cirrhosis of liver (ICD-10 code: K70.3) or COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, ICD-10 code: J44) as a proxy for heavy drinking or smoking. The results remained virtually unchanged.</p><p>We have now added reasons for stratified analysis by calendar years in Method (Pages 8-9):</p><p>“We performed subgroup analyses by sex, age at index date (&lt;50, 50-60, or &gt;60 years), age at follow-up (&lt;60 or ≥60 years), history of somatic diseases (no or yes), and family history of psychiatric disorder (no or yes). We also performed subgroup analysis by calendar year at index date (1987-1996, 1997-2006, or 2007-2016) to check for potentially different associations over time (i.e., due to lifestyle factors that changed over time, including smoking and alcohol use).”</p><p>We found similar associations between first-onset CVD and incident psychiatric disorder with and without excluding individuals with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis of liver or COPD, used as a proxy for heavy drinking or smoking. The table has now added as Supplementary File 1h.</p><p>We have now added justifications in Method (Page 10) and in Discussion (Page 14 and Page 16-17), and as below: In method, Page 10:</p><p>“To account for potential impact of unmeasured confounding due to lifestyle factors, we performed a sensitivity analysis excluding individuals with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis of liver (ICD-10 code K703) or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD, ICD-10 code J44), as proxies for heavy drinking or smoking.”</p><p>In Discussion Page 14:</p><p>“The associations remained similar after excluding individuals with liver cirrhosis and COPD, as proxies for heavy alcohol consumption and smoking.”</p><p>Page 16-17:</p><p>“although we found similar results with and without excluding individuals with a history of liver cirrhosis or COPD, as proxies for heavy drinking or smoking (Supplementary File 1h).

As described in the public review, I feel the current version of the manuscript does not quite align at places in the abstract, introduction, and discussion with the lack of lifestyle data, which would encompass several key potential confounders. Without it, it seems likely that there is a high risk of substantial confounding. It would be helpful if the authors adjusted the language to more accurately reflect this throughout, such as removing allusions to causal inference and tempering statements about adjustment for confounders where appropriate.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the comment. We have now modified the text throughout, by removing causal terms. To explore the potential impact from lifestyle factors, we performed an additional analysis excluding individuals with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis of liver or COPD, as proxies for heavy drinking or smoking, and found similar results (Table added as Supplementary File 1h).</p><p>In Abstract</p><p>Page 3, remove “halted causal inferences” and replaced with: “The association between cardiovascular disease (CVD) and selected psychiatric disorders has frequently been suggested while the potential role of familial factors and comorbidities in such association has rarely been investigated.”</p><p>Page 3, replaced “increased” with “higher”.</p><p>In Introduction, Page 5-6:</p><p>Removed “firmly”;</p><p>Replaced “a rapid rise” to “subsequent risk of”;</p><p>Replaced “attributed to” to “explained by”;</p><p>Remove “comprehensively”;</p><p>In Method, Page 10:</p><p>“To account for potential impact of unmeasured confounding due to lifestyle factors, we performed a sensitivity analysis excluding individuals with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis of liver (ICD-10 code K703) or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD, ICD-10 code J44), as proxies for heavy drinking or smoking.”</p><p>In Discussion, Page 14:</p><p>“The associations remained similar after excluding individuals with liver cirrhosis and COPD (Supplementary Table S8), as proxies for heavy alcohol consumption and smoking.”</p><p>Page 16-17:</p><p>“although we found similar results with and without excluding individuals with a history of liver cirrhosis or COPD, as proxies for heavy drinking or smoking (Supplementary File 1h). We did not have direct access to hazardous behaviors that could potentially modify this association, and therefore cannot exclude the possibility of residual confounding.”</p><p>In conclusion,</p><p>Page 21: “Using a large population-based sibling-controlled cohort with up to thirty years of followup, we found patients with CVD are at elevated risk of newly diagnosed psychiatric disorder, independent of familial background shared between siblings, history of somatic diseases, and other cardiovascular comorbidities. The results further indicate higher cardiovascular mortality among CVD patients with subsequent psychiatric comorbidities, providing evidence for increased surveillance of psychiatric comorbidity among newly diagnosed patients with CVD.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. One of the main findings is that psychiatric disorder comorbidity diagnosed after cardiovascular disease diagnosis was associated with an increased risk of CVD-related mortality (as shown in Figure 4). There needs to be more discussion of the potential relevance of cardiovascular disease or psychiatric disorder subtype in this relationship, both in the results and the Discussion sections. Intuitively, it would be expected that more severe cardiovascular diseases are associated with higher stress and a greater risk of psychiatric disorders. As such, the greater rate of mortality in those diagnosed with psychiatric disorders may largely be reflective of the initial cardiovascular diagnosis rather than having much to do with the psychiatric disorder diagnosis. Supplementary Figure 4 suggests that different subtypes of cardiovascular disease may have different relationships between psychiatric disorder diagnosis and survival rate, but this doesn't appear to be touched on at all in the results or the discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the comment.
