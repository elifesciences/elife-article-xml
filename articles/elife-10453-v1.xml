It is unknown if these signals are necessary for oviduct function in supporting fertilization and preimplantation development. Here we show that conditional knockout (cKO) mice lacking estrogen receptor α (ERα) in oviduct and uterine epithelial cells have impaired fertilization due to a dramatic reduction in sperm migration. In addition, all successfully fertilized eggs die before the 2-cell stage due to persistence of secreted innate immune mediators including proteases. Elevated protease activity in cKO oviducts causes premature degradation of the zona pellucida and embryo lysis, and wild-type embryos transferred into cKO oviducts fail to develop normally unless rescued by concomitant transfer of protease inhibitors. Thus, suppression of oviductal protease activity mediated by estrogen-epithelial ERα signaling is required for fertilization and preimplantation embryo development. These findings have implications for human infertility and post-coital contraception.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.10453.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.10453.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10453.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>In female mammals, eggs made in the ovaries travel to the uterus via tubes called oviducts (or Fallopian tubes). If sperm fertilize these eggs on the way, they complete this journey as early embryos and then implant into the wall of the uterus. As sperm and then newly fertilized embryos travel down these tubes, they encounter fluid inside the oviduct, which is generated by the cells that line the tube.</p><p>The hormonal changes that occur with the menstrual cycle alter the complexity and cellular composition of the uterus. When an egg is fertilized, further changes in the levels of the hormones, estrogen and progesterone, ensure the uterus becomes receptive to the embryo. However, it remains unknown whether such hormone-mediated signals also regulate the oviduct to support fertilization and early embryo development.</p><p>To investigate this question, Winuthayanon et al. studied female mice that lack an important estrogen receptor in the cells that line their oviducts and uterus. These mice are infertile. This is partly because most sperm become stuck in the uterus and fail to reach the eggs in the oviduct in order to fertilize them. The oviduct also becomes a hostile environment for both eggs and embryos, as reflected in damaged eggs and the complete loss of all new embryos by two days after fertilization. These embryos die, not because their development fails, but because their outer membrane becomes damaged and breaks apart. Winuthayanon et al. showed that this is due to the persistence of enzymes that form part of the immune system inside the oviduct. These enzymes can degrade proteins and damage cell membranes.</p><p>The presence of this estrogen receptor on the inner lining of the oviduct thus appears to be crucially important for reproduction (these effects were not seen when it is removed from other cells of the oviduct). The loss of this receptor also reveals the vital role that estrogen plays in suppressing parts of the immune response to ensure the oviduct provides a supportive environment for fertilization and embryo development. These findings could also have future application in the development of new contraceptives and might also shed light on the causes of human infertility.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.10453.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.10453.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>oviduct</kwd><kwd>estrogen receptor</kwd><kwd>preimplantation embryo</kwd><kwd>fertilization</kwd><kwd>innate immunity</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000066</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1ZIAES70065</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Winuthayanon</surname><given-names>Wipawee</given-names></name><name><surname>Hewitt</surname><given-names>Sylvia C</given-names></name><name><surname>Korach</surname><given-names>Kenneth S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000066</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1ZIAES025034</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Edin</surname><given-names>Matthew L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000066</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1ZIAES050167</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lih</surname><given-names>Fred B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000066</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1ZIAES102405</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bernhardt</surname><given-names>Miranda L</given-names></name><name><surname>Padilla-Banks</surname><given-names>Elizabeth</given-names></name><name><surname>Williams</surname><given-names>Carmen J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funder had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Cyclic estrogen signaling in oviduct epithelial cells suppresses oviduct luminal protease activity to allow survival and development of preimplantation embryos</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In eutherian mammals, fertilization and preimplantation embryo development occur in the oviduct (Fallopian tube in humans), a tubular reproductive tract structure comprised of an inner columnar epithelium supported by mesenchymal tissues including stroma, smooth muscle, and an outer serosa. Oviduct tissue complexity, cellular composition, and luminal fluid components differ along the length of the oviduct and change temporally in response to alterations in steroid hormone levels that occur with the estrous/menstrual cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Buhi et al., 2000</xref>). Estrogen levels are highest in the period immediately prior to ovulation and are decreasing when fertilization occurs in the oviductal ampulla. During the several days of preimplantation embryo development, there is a continued decrease in estrogen and an increase in progesterone. In the uterus, cyclic alterations in steroid hormone levels orchestrate the initial proliferation and then cellular differentiation of the endometrium. These changes are critical for establishment of uterine receptivity to the implanting embryo. It is unknown what role, if any, steroid hormone-mediated signals have in regulating oviductal function to support fertilization and preimplantation embryo development.</p><p>We have shown previously using mice with an epithelial cell-selective ablation of estrogen receptor α (ERα) in the female reproductive tract (<italic>Wnt7a</italic><sup>Cre</sup>;<italic>Esr1</italic><sup>f/f</sup>) that ERα-mediated crosstalk between stromal and epithelial compartments in the uterus is critical for generating a receptive endometrium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Winuthayanon et al., 2010</xref>). In the oviduct, ERα is also found in both mesenchymal and epithelial compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yamashita et al., 1989</xref>), but the contributions of ERα in either of these compartments to oviductal function have not been evaluated. Here, we used epithelial cell (<italic>Wnt7a</italic><sup>Cre</sup>;<italic>Esr1</italic><sup>f/f</sup>) and stromal cell (<italic>Amhr2</italic><sup>Cre</sup>;<italic>Esr1</italic><sup>f/-</sup>) selective ERα ablation in mouse models to test the hypothesis that estrogen signaling via ERα in the epithelial cells regulates expression of secreted molecules required to create a microenvironment supportive of fertilization and preimplantation embryo development.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Mice lacking ERα in epithelial but not mesenchymal cells have impaired fertilization</title><p>Female mice lacking ERα only in reproductive tract epithelial cells were generated by crossing our <italic>Esr1</italic><sup>f/f</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hewitt et al., 2010</xref>) with <italic>Wnt7a</italic><sup>cre</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Winuthayanon et al., 2010</xref>) and are referred to as ‘cKO’ mice.

In mesenchymal cKO mice, ERα was effectively deleted from stromal and muscle cells underlying the epithelium throughout the oviduct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Minimal ablation of ERα in the epithelial cells was observed in some regions of the mesenchymal cKO oviduct. No gross or microscopic morphological alterations in oviduct structure were observed in either cKO mouse line. We previously showed that cKO females cycle and mate normally, indicating that gonadotropins and sex steroid hormones are not altered in these mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Winuthayanon et al., 2010</xref>). To determine whether lack of ERα in either epithelial or mesenchymal compartments affected fertilization, zygotes (one-cell embryos) were collected from normally cycling, mated females at 0.5 days post coitum (dpc). Despite similar numbers of spontaneously ovulated eggs found in the oviducts (typically 7–8), cKO mice had 58% as many zygotes as WT controls, whereas mesenchymal cKO mice had numbers similar to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>). There was also no difference in ovulation efficiency following superovulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Taken together, these findings indicate that lack of ERα in epithelial cells, but not mesenchymal cells, reduces fertilization.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10453.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Conditional deletion of estrogen receptor α (ERα) from cell type-selective regions of the oviduct.</title><p>Representative immunohistochemical analysis of ERα in the oviduct regions indicated from wild-type (WT), conditional knockout (cKO), and mesenchymal cKO mice.

To determine if lack of epithelial cell ERα affected sperm migration to the site of fertilization, female mice were mated and the numbers of sperm to reach the ovulated cumulus masses in the ampulla and the sperm storage reservoir in the isthmus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Suarez, 2008</xref>) at 0.5 dpc were counted. Despite high numbers of sperm present in the uterine horns, there was a dramatic reduction in the numbers of sperm to reach both the ampulla and isthmus regions of the oviduct in cKO compared to WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), suggesting that effects on sperm migration explained the reduced fertilization. Of note, we found that the mass of sperm in the upper uterine horns of cKO mice was held within a dense, partially solidified mass that retained the tubular shape of the uterine horn following release into culture medium. In contrast, sperm released into culture medium from control uterine horns rapidly dispersed into small clumps. This finding suggested that abnormalities in post-ejaculation seminal fluid processing in the uterine horn caused the failure of sperm migration into the oviduct.</p><p>To evaluate whether lack of epithelial ERα could also affect fertilizability of the ovulated eggs, cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs) were removed from the oviducts and inseminated. In vitro fertilization (IVF) of the eggs from cKO oviducts was still only about 50% as efficient as controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Removal of the surrounding cumulus cells using hyaluronidase completely rescued IVF of eggs from cKO oviducts to the same level as that of control eggs. Similarly, eggs within intact COCs removed directly from the ovary just prior to ovulation to completely avoid exposure to the cKO oviduct were fertilized in vitro as well as control eggs from WT ovaries. Taken together, these findings indicate that fertilization is impaired in the cKO mouse due to abnormal sperm migration into the oviduct and detrimental effects of the oviduct environment on the cumulus cell masses surrounding the eggs.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>The oviductal microenvironment in mice lacking epithelial ERα is toxic to preimplantation embryos</title><p>To evaluate preimplantation embryo development in vivo, oviducts of normally cycling, mated females were flushed at 1.5 dpc and the recovered embryos were counted. Oviducts from WT females contained two-cell embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>); however, cKO oviducts had no living embryos. Instead, only remnants of non-viable eggs or embryos were recovered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), indicating that all zygotes present at 0.5 dpc died before the two-cell stage. In contrast, mesenchymal cKO oviducts contained similar numbers of embryos with an appearance comparable to controls when collected on both 1.5 dpc (two-cell embryos) and 3.5 dpc (morulae/blastocysts) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>). We conclude that expression of epithelial, but not mesenchymal, ERα in the oviduct is crucial for preimplantation embryo development. Furthermore, when zygotes were recovered from cKO oviducts ∼6 hr after fertilization and then cultured in vitro, less than 50% cleaved to the two-cell stage, and only 14% progressed to the blastocyst stage, whereas more than 80% of the zygotes from WT oviducts developed to the blastocyst stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). However, if eggs were collected from either cKO oviducts or ovaries and then fertilized in vitro, the resulting zygotes developed to the blastocyst stage at a rate comparable to WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G,H</xref>). These results indicate that the zygotes’ developmental potential was severely compromised even if they were exposed to the cKO oviduct environment for only a few hours after fertilization.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Epithelial ERα regulates prostaglandin levels and inflammatory response mediators in the oviduct</title><p>To identify factor(s) in the cKO oviduct that could be responsible for inhibiting fertilization and embryo development, we used microarray analysis to compare transcripts in whole oviducts collected at 0.5 and 1.5 dpc from WT and cKO mice, respectively. The most highly altered genes at 0.5 and 1.5 dpc are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">2</xref>, respectively; representative genes were validated using real-time PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software, we found that biological functions significantly altered at 0.5 dpc included tissue development, lipid metabolism, inflammatory response, and cellular growth and proliferation (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>). At 1.5 dpc, there were fewer altered biological functions than at 0.5 dpc; these functions included tissue development, inflammatory response, cellular movement, and small molecule biochemistry (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl4">Table 4</xref>). Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of the microarray signal intensities indicated two groups of gene expression patterns, one consisting of WT 0.5 dpc, and the second including all remaining groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Note that in the cKO samples, replicates from both 0.5 and 1.5 dpc did not all cluster together, unlike WT sample replicates, which clustered together according to the day of pregnancy. Instead, the cKO 0.5 dpc samples were much more similar to both the cKO 1.5 dpc and WT 1.5 dpc samples. These findings demonstrate that estrogen signaling via epithelial ERα has dramatic effects on oviductal gene expression at 0.5 dpc but not 1.5 dpc and are consistent with the normal pattern of estrous cycle estrogen levels that reach a peak prior to ovulation and then drop significantly by 1.5 dpc.<fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10453.007</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Validation of up- and down-regulated genes in conditional knockout (cKO) compared to Wild-type (WT) oviducts at 0.5 and 1.5 dpc using real-time PCR analysis.</title><p>The transcripts were selected from microarray datasets for over- and under-expression in cKO oviducts compared to WT at 0.5 or 1.5 dpc, as indicated (n = 4–7 mice/group; mean ± SEM).

local innate immune response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wira et al., 2011</xref>). Biologic activity of antimicrobial proteins is modulated by secreted proteases and protease inhibitors (PIs), both of which can also serve as antimicrobials in the female reproductive tract and at other mucosal surfaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Shaw et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wira et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aboud et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dittmann et al., 2015</xref>). Immune suppression by steroid hormones during mid-cycle creates a window of susceptibility to infection well documented in human tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wira et al., 2010</xref>). Because the embryos in the cKO oviducts were dying rather than simply failing to develop, we hypothesized that estrogen signaling via epithelial ERα is required to suppress secretion of oviduct antimicrobial molecules that can cause preimplantation embryo death. This idea is consistent with the identification of inflammatory response as a biological category significantly altered in the cKO oviduct at both 0.5 and 1.5 dpc (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Tables 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl4">4</xref>). The altered inflammatory response genes included proteases, PIs, defensins, chemokines (including <italic>Il17, Il17rb</italic>, and <italic>Cxcl17</italic>), and enzymes regulating prostaglandin (PG) production such as hematopoietic prostaglandin D synthase (<italic>Hpgds</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B–D</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl5">Table 5</xref>). Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry was used to determine the PG profile of WT and cKO oviducts at 0.5 dpc. PGD<sub>2</sub> and PGF<sub>2α</sub> levels were significantly lower, whereas PGE<sub>2</sub> was increased in cKO compared to WT oviducts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). PGs are not normal components of embryo culture medium, so we reasoned that lack of PGD<sub>2</sub> and PGF<sub>2α</sub> could not cause embryo death in vivo. In contrast, PGE<sub>2</sub> was elevated in the cKO oviducts and in theory could contribute to the embryo phenotype either directly by effects on the embryo or indirectly by effects on the oviduct. To determine if PGE<sub>2</sub> could directly cause embryo death, we added PGE<sub>2</sub> to the culture medium during fertilization of WT eggs and during the entire period of embryo development to the blastocyst stage. Inclusion of excess PGE<sub>2</sub> had no effect on fertilization or embryo development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>), suggesting that although epithelial ERα regulates oviduct PG production, these lipid compounds alone are not directly responsible for causing embryo death.<table-wrap id="tbl5" position="float"><object-id

Protease treatment results in an initial swelling of the ZP, a morphological change consistent with the ZP appearance of the dead embryos recovered from cKO oviducts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The ZP is comprised of three heavily glycosylated proteins, ZP1, ZP2, and ZP3. After fertilization, there is a physiological proteolytic cleavage of ZP2 when the eggs undergo cortical granule exocytosis and release the protease ovastacin; this change makes the ZP resistant to penetration by additional sperm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Burkart et al., 2012</xref>). ZP2 cleavage is responsible for the observation of ‘zona hardening’ after fertilization, defined experimentally by an increased resistance of the ZP to dissolution by proteases in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Smithberg, 1953</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gulyas and Yuan, 1985</xref>).</p><p>One of the cysteine protease inhibitors with reduced expression in cKO oviducts was fetuin B (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl5">Table 5</xref>), which has inhibitory activity toward ovastacin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dietzel et al., 2013</xref>). We found that fetuin B protein levels were decreased in cKO oviducts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C,D</xref>). In WT oviducts, most fetuin B localized to epithelial cells; the protein was minimally detected in cKO oviducts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). Altered expression of fetuin B was not observed in mesenchymal cKO oviducts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>), indicating that fetuin B expression is regulated by estrogen-epithelial ERα signaling.</p><p>Although the large number of cortical granules released at fertilization causes sufficient ovastacin release to almost completely cleave ZP2 and prevent polyspermy, oocytes also gradually release cortical granules with time following hormone-induced initiation of maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ducibella et al., 1990</xref>). The consequent release of ovastacin from the cortical granules causes a small but significant amount of ZP2 cleavage and zona hardening when ovulated eggs are cultured in vitro in the absence of serum (which contains fetuin), or in vivo in <italic>Fetub<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Schroeder et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dietzel et al., 2013</xref>). We took advantage of ZP2 sensitivity to protease-mediated cleavage over time to determine if protease activity within the cKO oviducts was increased. Ovulated eggs were collected 16 hr after human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) administration, when they would have spent ∼4 hr in the oviduct, and then evaluated for premature ZP2 proteolysis. Based on immunoblot analyses, ovulated eggs recovered from cKO oviducts had significantly less intact ZP2 and more cleaved ZP2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A–C</xref>).

As expected, zygotes from WT oviducts had almost complete conversion of ZP2 to cleaved ZP2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D,E</xref>). In contrast, zygotes from cKO oviducts had much lower ZP2 cleavage, indicating that the normal process of ovastacin-mediated cleavage of the N-terminal region of ZP2 was disrupted.

To test whether proteases are capable of penetrating an intact ZP to access and cleave plasma membrane proteins, a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored Enhanced Green Fluorescent Protein (EGFP) that contains a trypsin-sensitive linker sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rhee et al., 2006</xref>) was expressed in ZP-intact oocytes.

To determine whether presence of the ZP protects embryos from protease-induced lysis, WT ZP-intact zygotes and WT zygotes with their ZP removed by either mechanical microdissection or by brief exposure to acidic Tyrode’s solution were cultured in 0.4% α-chymotrypsin, and time to cell lysis was determined. Regardless of the ZP removal method, ZP-free embryos lysed much more rapidly than ZP-intact embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I</xref>).

This pattern of fluorescence loss is representative of 5 imaging experiments, each using 6–12 EGFP-GPI-expressing oocytes.

We first tested whether protease activity alone could disrupt plasma membrane integrity by measuring intracellular sodium ([Na]<sub>i</sub>) levels, which increase as cells lose the ability to maintain physiological ion gradients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bortner et al., 2001</xref>). Zygotes incubated in α-chymotrypsin had increased [Na]<sub>i</sub> as compared to vehicle-treated zygotes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6J</xref>). Because oviducts express numerous antimicrobial peptides, <strike>including</strike> defensins, that can disrupt permeability of microbial membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yeaman and Yount, 2003</xref>), we tested whether these molecules could also affect zygote membrane integrity. Zygotes incubated in both α-chymotrypsin and recombinant defensins had further increased [Na]<sub>i</sub> when compared to zygotes treated with α-chymotrypsin alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6J</xref>). However, zygotes incubated for several hours in recombinant defensins alone had no morphological evidence of membrane disruption whether or not the ZP was present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Taken together, these findings indicate that elevated protease activity can disrupt zygote membrane integrity sufficiently to induce embryo lysis, but that antimicrobial molecules may also contribute to the embryo lysis phenotype.</p><p>Based on these in vitro studies, we reasoned that if elevated protease activity in the cKO oviducts caused ZP and plasma membrane changes that led to embryo death, then these embryos should be protected by inhibition of protease activity . To test this idea, WT zygotes were transferred into oviducts of WT or cKO recipients at 0.5 dpc using embryo transfer medium that either did or did not contain serine and cysteine PIs. Three days later, the oviducts and uteri were flushed to collect surviving embryos. A significant percentage of zygotes transferred to cKO recipients without PIswere underdeveloped, whereas inclusion of PI s rescued embryo development to control levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A,B</xref>). These findings indicate that excessive protease activity in the cKO oviduct luminal microenvironment is a proximate cause of the embryo development failure.<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10453.021</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Excessive protease activity in vivo in the conditional knockout (cKO) oviduct leads to embryo development failure.</title><p>(<bold><bold>A</bold></bold>) Percentage of underdeveloped embryos and morula/blastocyst stage embryos retrieved from pseudopregnant wild-type (WT) and cKO recipients that received no protease inhibitors (–PI) or received protease inhibitors ( PI) during embryo transfer (n = 5–12 mice/group and 42–64 embryos/group; mean ± SEM, <italic>*</italic>p &lt;0.05).

Lack of epithelial ERα in the female reproductive tract results in impaired fertilization by inhibiting sperm migration from the uterus into the oviduct and altering the properties of the cumulus cell mass surrounding the ovulated eggs. The successfully fertilized eggs are exposed to excess oviduct protease activity that disrupts ZP and plasma membrane integrity, causing protease-mediated embryo lysis that may also be promoted by antimicrobial peptides. These findings indicate that the preovulatory increase in estrogen levels not only serves to stimulate ovarian follicle development and uterine endometrial growth, but also has an essential and previously unrecognized function in regulating oviduct physiology.</p><p>Global alterations in gene expression critical for implantation have been extensively documented for the uterus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Reese et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kao et al., 2002</xref>). These alterations are programmed by the integrated output of cyclic steroid hormone signals and are mediated by nuclear receptors, mainly in the endometrial stromal and epithelial cells. Our findings that fertilization and preimplantation embryo development are normal in mice lacking mesenchymal ERα indicate that ERα-mediated signaling in this compartment is not a major regulator of oviduct function in early pregnancy. We propose instead that elevated estradiol levels in the periovulatory period act via epithelial ERα to alter secretion of oviduct innate immune mediators, particularly proteases and PIs, and that this process is essential to generate a luminal environment capable of supporting fertilization and embryo development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>).<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10453.022</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Schematic describing how estrogen receptor α (ERα) in oviduct epithelial cells supports fertilization and early embryo development.</title><p>(<bold><bold>A</bold></bold>) In wild-type mice, estrogen signals to ERα in both stromal and epithelial cells to suppress secretion of innate immune mediators and generate a luminal environment supportive of sperm migration, fertilization, and preimplantation embryo development.

Failure of sperm migration may be explained by the abnormal character of the ejaculate present in the uterine horns of cKO mice following mating. In rodents, a dense, hard copulatory plug forms in the vagina following mating as a consequence of the protein crosslinking activity of transglutaminase IV, which is generated in the prostate gland and induces coagulation of seminal vesicle proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dean, 2013</xref>). Although the ejaculate directly enters the rodent uterus, a copulatory plug does not normally form there, so secretions within the uterine lumen must either prevent protein crosslinking or promote liquefaction of the ejaculate. In humans, a copulatory plug does not form; instead, ejaculated semen coagulates into a gelatinous mass that then liquefies. Liquefaction is mediated by the activity of kallikrein 3 (KLK3; better known as prostate-specific antigen), a chymotrypsin-like protease, which promotes release of sperm from the coagulum [reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Robert and Gagnon, 1999</xref>)]. Rodents have evolved a large number of kallikrein-related proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Olsson and Lundwall, 2002</xref>), some of which are expressed in the uterus and estrogen-regulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Corthorn et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Rajapakse et al., 2007</xref>). We detected several kallikreins in the oviduct that were highly homologous to human <italic>KLK3</italic>, including <italic>Klk1</italic> and <italic>Klk1b</italic>-family kallikreins, and were downregulated in cKO mice (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl5">Table 5</xref>). Furthermore, we previously demonstrated that estrogen induces <italic>Klk1b5</italic> expression in the uterus of WT but not cKO mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Winuthayanon et al., 2014</xref>). These findings suggest that downregulation of KLK3-like proteins in the cKO uterus causes a failure of semen liquefaction, providing a plausible explanation for the failure of sperm migration into the oviduct.</p><p>Additional factors within the oviductal environment could also impair fertilization efficiency. Effects of luminal components on the cumulus-oocyte masses could diminish their ability to secrete chemoattractants that promote directional sperm migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Eisenbach and Giojalas, 2006</xref>), or the oviductal epithelial cells could secrete alternate chemoattractants that disrupt the directional signal. This idea is consistent with our findings that there were significant alterations in chemokines and their receptors expressed in the cKO oviduct and that there were alterations in PGs, which can modulate chemokine secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kalinski, 2012</xref>). Effects of altered oviductal PGs, chemokines, proteases, or PIs on the cumulus cells and/or extracellular matrix structure could also contribute to our observation of impaired fertilization in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kim et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tamba et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Beek et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Proteolytic cleavage of ZP2 is a physiological event mediated by ovastacin, a metalloendoprotease contained within the egg’s cortical granules that undergo exocytosis at the time of fertilization in the oviduct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Burkart et al., 2012</xref>). When ZP2 is cleaved, the sperm no longer recognize and bind to the egg’s ZP; therefore, ZP2 cleavage promotes monospermic fertilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gahlay et al., 2010</xref>). Ovastacin can also be released prior to fertilization via spontaneous cortical granule exocytosis during meiotic maturation in the ovarian follicle. Studies in the <italic>Fetub<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mouse demonstrated that fetuin B, a cysteine PI synthesized in the liver and present in serum, limits ovastacin-mediated premature ZP2 cleavage in the ovarian follicle so that fertilization can occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dietzel et al., 2013</xref>). Here, we have shown that fetuin B is also expressed locally in the oviduct in response to estrogen signaling in the epithelial cells. This finding suggests that in the <italic>Fetub<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mouse, complete lack of oviductal fetuin B contributes to the observed fertilization failure. In the ERα cKO mouse, the ∼50% reduction in fetuin B explains at least some of the elevation in protease activity in the oviductal lumen.</p><p>We found that the cKO oviduct had significant alterations in the expression of a large number of proteases and PIs, in addition to fetuin B. These changes resulted in an overall increase in protease activity within the oviduct milieu documented by the increase in ZP2 cleavage in cKO eggs. Protease action also explains the obvious morphological alterations in ZP structure of the lysed embryos recovered from cKO oviducts because these changes were prevented by artificially reducing protease activity in vivo, a procedure that also rescued embryo development to a large extent. These alterations in overall ZP structure, which were not observed in ovulated eggs recovered after only ∼4 hr in the cKO oviducts, could explain the apparent contradiction between increased oviductal protease activity and lower levels of ZP2 cleavage following fertilization in the cKO oviduct. For example, the altered ZP structure could have allowed more rapid passage of ovastacin through the ZP matrix, resulting in lower efficiency of ZP2 cleavage.</p><p>ZP thinning or removal is associated with egg and embryo death prior to the two-cell stage in oviducts in vivo but not during culture in vitro (Modlinski, 1970; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Liu et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rankin et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rankin et al., 2001</xref>). These findings can now be explained by our demonstration that in the presence of a disrupted or absent ZP, embryos lose membrane integrity when exposed to proteases similar to those present in the oviduct during the post-ovulatory time period. Because proteases rapidly penetrate the ZP to access proteins at the plasma membrane, our data suggest that the intact ZP serves as a ‘decoy substrate’ by providing a large excess of substrate for oviductal proteases that are then less able to disrupt embryo plasma membrane integrity.</p><p>Whether or not antimicrobial peptides such as defensins in the cKO oviduct contribute to the embryo lysis phenotype is less clear. The heavily glycosylated ZP protein matrix has a strong resemblance to bacterial cell walls, which are comprised of a lattice structure of cross-linked peptidoglycans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Osborn, 1969</xref>). Like the ZP, bacterial cell walls and phospholipid membranes are negatively charged, a property thought to enhance the affinity of antimicrobial peptides that typically have a net positive charge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wassarman, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yeaman and Yount, 2003</xref>). These findings indicate that the ZP could serve as a protective barrier for the embryo in part by serving as a ‘sink’ for antimicrobial peptides. Mammalian phospholipid membranes, in contrast, are generally charge-neutral, which is a property that protects them from antimicrobial peptide actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Matsuzaki, 1999</xref>). We showed that the combination of protease and defensins increased zygote membrane permeability to sodium more than protease alone, whereas defensins alone did not affect the zygote plasma membrane. Based on these findings, we speculate that in the cKO oviduct, the initial action of proteases on the zygote plasma membrane alters its charge sufficiently to allow antimicrobial peptides to further disrupt membrane integrity and promote cell lysis.</p><p>Infertility in women with hydrosalpinges (inflamed, dilated Fallopian tubes) is partially explained by direct effects of the tubal fluid on embryo development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ozmen et al., 2007</xref>). Indeed, culture of mouse zygotes in human hydrosalpingeal fluid leads to zygote degeneration and retarded embryo development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mukherjee et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beyler et al., 1997</xref>). We found that zygotes fertilized in vivo did not survive in the cKO oviduct and that there were detrimental effects on in vitro embryo development only after a several-hour exposure of these zygotes to the cKO oviduct lumen. These findings strongly suggest that innate immune mediators in the luminal fluid of cKO oviducts have persistent effects on embryo development in vitro. The poor but better survival of WT zygotes exposed for 3 days to cKO oviducts in our embryo transfer experiments is likely a result of at least two factors: 1) dilutional effects of the culture medium transferred into the oviduct during the embryo transfer procedure that would partially mitigate effects of proteases and antimicrobial peptides and 2) several hours less time spent in the cKO oviduct because fertilization occurred in a WT oviduct prior to embryo collection and transfer. The critical time frame during which the PIs prevented embryo death was likely to be on the first day of pregnancy, based on the minimal differences in gene expression between cKO and WT oviducts on pregnancy day 1.5 and relatively low circulating estrogen levels on pregnancy days 1.5–3.5.</p><p>In summary, we propose that elevated estradiol levels in the preovulatory period act via epithelial ERα to suppress protease-mediated aspects of innate immunity in the oviduct. This response to cyclic steroid hormone levels allows the oviduct to alternate between functioning as a mucosal immune barrier and an environment supportive of fertilization and embryo development. These findings imply that disruption of estrogen signaling, for example by endocrine disruptors or post-coital contraceptives, could prevent pregnancy by interfering with suppression of the oviductal mucosal immune response. Lastly, embryotoxic effects of abnormally elevated innate immune mediators in the Fallopian tubes may contribute to infertility in women with hydrosalpinges, endometriosis, or unexplained infertility.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>CF-1 female mice (6-week old; Harlan Laboratories) and B6D2F1/J male mice (8–12 week old; Jackson Laboratory) were obtained commercially.

For oviduct immunoblots, protein was extracted and analyzed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hewitt et al., 2003</xref>). The β-actin (#SC1616-R), fetuin B (#PA5-29468), and HPGDS (#MBS601438) antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Dallas, TX), Thermo Scientific, and MyBiosource (San Diego, CA), respectively, and used at a 1:1000 dilution. Immunohistochemical analyses of oviducts were performed as described previously for uterine tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Winuthayanon et al., 2010</xref>). For immunohistochemical analysis, fetuin B and HPGDS antibodies were diluted at 1:200 and 1:1000, respectively. For ZP immunoblots, MII eggs from COCs were collected 16 hr after hCG injection, freed of cumulus cells using hyaluronidase, washed, and then snap frozen in 5 μL of Tissue Protein Extraction Reagent (Thermo Scientific); zygotes were collected at 5:00 pm on the day of the copulatory plug. An equal volume of reducing sample buffer was added, then the samples were denatured, separated on a 4–12% tris-glycine gel (Novex, Grand Island, NY) and transferred to a polyvinyl difluoride membrane (Life Technologies). Blots were blocked in tris-buffered saline and Tween 20 (TBST) containing 3% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and then incubated overnight at 4°C in primary antibody diluted in blocking solution. Primary ZP antibodies (graciously provided by Dr. Jurrien Dean, NIDDK) were as follows: ZP1, mAB M-1.4 diluted 1:500 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rankin et al., 1999</xref>); ZP2, mAB M2c.2 diluted 1:5000 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rankin et al., 2003</xref>); ZP3, mAB IE-10 diluted 1:10,000 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">East et al., 1985</xref>).

Your submission has been favorably evaluated by Janet Rossant (Senior editor and Reviewing editor) and two reviewers.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This study describes a surprising and novel role for ER-alpha in the mouse oviduct. Conditional knockout of the gene in oviductal epithelial cells but not in the mesenchyme results not only in a decrease in sperm transport to the site of fertilization but also in increased protease activity (and antimicrobial peptides) causes zona rupture and preimplantation embryo lethality. Much research on fertilization and preimplantation development has involved in vitro studies, which constitutes a very artificial environment. A major strength of this study is that it focuses on functional analysis in the oviduct where fertilization and early cleavage events actually occur. The figures and videos are of exceptional quality, and, overall, this manuscript is judged to be valuable contribution to our understanding of oviductal function in fertilization and early development.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The work was judged to be for the most part complete and many of the conclusions are well justified by the data. Thus the reviewers do not feel that there are major additional experiments that need to be performed. However, they raise a number of questions that they would like to see in a revised manuscript and for which you may decide that some new experimental data might help in the interpretation.</p><p>1) The work on sperm transport is exciting, in that it shows reduced sperm arrival at the oviduct. This coincides with reduced fertilization (subsection “Mice Lacking ERα in Epithelial But Not Mesenchymal Cells Have Impaired Fertilization” et seq.). The question that arises is whether unfertilized oocytes were found in the oviduct. Can the failure of fertilization be due to simple fewer male gametes, or are fewer oocytes transported? Do the authors have any idea where the &quot;missing&quot; sperm are in the cKO oviduct?</p><p>2) Removal of cumulus cells improved IVF of COCs recovered from cKO oviducts. Do the authors have any idea as to whether sperm penetration of the COC is compromised, whether they undergo a premature acrosome reaction? Such information would be very useful.</p><p>3) If there is an assay that would capture total protease activity and you can obtain oviduct fluid, I would encourage the authors to assay the fluid to ascertain whether the protease activity is higher in the cKO than WT. Such data would permit them to make a statement rather than speculate. Note: it is not essential that this experiment be conducted because it may not be feasible.</p><p>4) The authors need to provide more background information/rationale regarding why they looked at ZP2 conversion following maturation. They provide this information the Discussion, but a reader not familiar with this system may be unaware of the maturation-associated proteolysis of ZP2. The same holds for providing background information/rationale regarding the effect of protease treatment on ZP dissolution, i.e., zona hardening.</p><p>5) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, there appears to be no expression of Esr1 in the isthmus of the oviduct of the Esr1 cKO mice, while it seems to be present in the WT animals.</p><p>6) The results presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref> are intriguing, as it would seem that the cKO oviduct has an effect on the cumulus complexes. This is not further discussed.</p><p>7) The authors dismiss the eicosanoids as effectors of embryo demise because elevated PGE2 did not affect embryos in culture. It is more likely that PGE contributes to the phenotype by its effects on the oviduct itself, and this should be mentioned.</p><p>8) The ovostacin/fetuin data appear contradictory. There is a reduction in ZP2 cleavage in the cKO, accompanied by an apparent loss of fetuin, the inhibitor of ovostacin. One might expect that decreased fetuin should result in greater ovostacin activity and thus greater cleavage of ZP2. This should probably be discussed.</p><p>9) The defensin experiments (subsection “Protease-Mediated Disruption of Plasma Membrane Integrity Leads to Embryo Death” et seq.) are interesting, but are not judged to be extensive or definitive enough, to justify the conclusion that oviductal innate immune suppression mediated by Esr1 signaling is required for fertilization and preimplantation embryo development. The focus of the discussion and conclusions should be on the microarray findings on proteases and the wealth of functional data on proteases presented in the manuscript.

Thus the reviewers do not feel that there are major additional experiments that need to be performed. However, they raise a number of questions that they would like to see in a revised manuscript and for which you may decide that some new experimental data might help in the interpretation. 1) The work on sperm transport is exciting, in that it shows reduced sperm arrival at the oviduct. This coincides with reduced fertilization (subsection “Mice Lacking ERα in Epithelial But Not Mesenchymal Cells Have Impaired Fertilization” et seq.). The question that arises is whether unfertilized oocytes were found in the oviduct. Can the failure of fertilization be due to simple fewer male gametes, or are fewer oocytes transported? Do the authors have any idea where the &quot;missing&quot; sperm are in the cKO oviduct?</italic> </p><p>Yes, unfertilized oocytes were found in the oviduct. When zygotes were collected from the oviducts of spontaneously cycling, mated cKO females at 11:00 am on 0.5 dpc, we routinely found that about half of the 7-8 total ovulated eggs were fertilized and the rest were not. This point has now been clarified in the text of the Results (first paragraph).</p><p>To address the question of the “missing” sperm, we performed additional experiments to determine if the sperm manage to enter the “sperm reservoir” in the isthmus of the oviduct after mating and deposition in the uterus. Wild type and cKO females were superovulated and mated. The following morning, females with copulatory plugs were sacrificed and the reproductive tracts removed. The oviducts were dissected from the uteri as close to the uteri as possible, and then flushed from the ampulla toward the isthmus, beginning distal to the cumulus mass, using ~30 µL water via a 30 G needle. The number of sperm flushed from each oviduct was counted. We found that there were far fewer sperm in the oviductal isthmus in the cKO mice, indicating that migration from the uterus to oviduct was severely impaired. These new findings were added to the graph in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, and a representative image of the sperm flushed from the oviducts is provided as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2–figure supplement 1</xref>.</p><p>In addition, the upper uterine horns were flushed to release the luminal contents. We found that the mass of sperm in the upper uterine horns of cKO mice was held within a dense, partially solidified mass that retained the tubular shape of the uterine horn following release into culture medium. In contrast, sperm released into culture medium from control uterine horns rapidly dispersed into small clumps. This finding suggests that in response to estrogen signaling, the normal uterine epithelium secretes components that prevent solidification of the ejaculate in the uterine horn, and thus prevents changes similar to those that form the vaginal copulatory plug. The altered seminal fluid properties in the cKO uterine horns likely explain the decreased numbers of sperm in the oviductal sperm reservoir and the subsequent low numbers of sperm to reach the oviductal ampulla. These findings are now mentioned in the Results (second paragraph) and Discussion (third paragraph); the Methods section was also appropriately revised.</p><p><italic>2) Removal of cumulus cells improved IVF of COCs recovered from cKO oviducts. Do the authors have any idea as to whether sperm penetration of the COC is compromised, whether they undergo a premature acrosome reaction? Such information would be very useful.</italic> </p><p>As outlined in our response to question #6 below, we did not tease out the mechanisms that could underlie the reduction in fertilization efficiency of the cumulus cell masses recovered from the cKO oviducts, such as alterations in timing of acrosomal exocytosis. We agree that these would be very interesting and useful experiments to perform, but we felt that they were not as critical as determining the mechanisms underlying the 100% embryo death phenotype in vivo and would require a large number of additional experiments. We have added a new paragraph to the Discussion that explores further the effects of the oviductal environment on both sperm migration and fertilization in vitro (fourth paragraph).</p><p><italic>3) If there is an assay that would capture total protease activity and you can obtain oviduct fluid, I would encourage the authors to assay the fluid to ascertain whether the protease activity is higher in the cKO than WT. Such data would permit them to make a statement rather than speculate. Note: it is not essential that this experiment be conducted because it may not be feasible.</italic> </p><p>This was an experiment that we were very eager to perform. Unfortunately, despite numerous attempts, we were only able to collect far less than 1 µL fluid from a mouse oviduct, and we were only able to do that if the fluid was collected shortly following ovulation when the oviduct fluid was likely mixed with follicular fluid. Given the difficulty in obtaining fluid, we did not feel that we could reliably collect samples from WT and cKO oviducts that would provide a valid comparison. Our inability to carry out this experiment led to the alternative experiment of examining the cleavage status of the zona pellucida of the ovulated eggs as an indirect indicator of protease activity in the oviduct, which we showed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A-C</xref>. Application of CRISPR/Cas9 gene targeting methods in larger size animals such as rats, cows or pigs, which have larger oviducts from which oviductal fluid can be reliably obtained, may allow a direct test of protease activity in oviducts lacking ER alpha in epithelial cells.</p><p><italic>4) The authors need to provide more background information/rationale regarding why they looked at ZP2 conversion following maturation. They provide this information the Discussion, but a reader not familiar with this system may be unaware of the maturation-associated proteolysis of ZP2. The same holds for providing background information/rationale regarding the effect of protease treatment on ZP dissolution, i.e., zona hardening.</italic> </p><p>We have added more information regarding ZP2 cleavage and zona hardening in the Results section for the benefit of readers less familiar with zona pellucida changes that occur with age and following fertilization (subsection “Protease-Mediated Disruption of Plasma Membrane Integrity Leads to Embryo Death”, first and third paragraphs).</p><p><italic>5) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, there appears to be no expression of Esr1 in the isthmus of the oviduct of the Esr1 cKO mice, while it seems to be present in the WT animals.</italic> </p><p>There is minimal staining for ERα in the smooth muscle and stromal cells of the isthmus region of the oviduct in both WT and cKO mice, and there was no difference in the intensity of ERα staining in these cell types in the two groups. The vast majority of the ERα staining in this region is in the epithelial cells, where there is an obvious lack of staining in the cKO. Additional oviductal isthmus sections stained for ERα from WT and cKO mice have been added to the manuscript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–figure supplement 1</xref>) to provide additional examples of the staining patterns in each group for the reader.</p><p><italic>6) The results presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref> are intriguing, as it would seem that the cKO oviduct has an effect on the cumulus complexes. This is not further discussed.</italic> </p><p>We were not initially anticipating that the cumulus mass being present or absent would impact on the success of in vitro fertilization. Our finding that fertilization efficiency was far lower in vitro unless the cumulus cells were removed indicated that even a short amount of time spent by the cumulus mass in the oviductal environment was detrimental. One explanation for this finding is that the rather sticky cumulus mass brings with it proteases (or other components) from the oviduct that then negatively impact on the function of sperm that were not exposed to the oviductal environment. An alternate explanation is that the oviductal environment directly affects either the hyaluronic acid matrix between the cumulus cells such that the sperm have more difficulty reaching and penetrating the zona pellucida, or causes alterations in the expression of chemoattractant molecules by the cumulus cells. Either explanation is plausible, and they are not exclusive. Because of this reviewer comment, we have now added a new paragraph to the Discussion that explores further the effects of the oviductal environment on both sperm migration and fertilization in vitro (fourth paragraph).</p><p>However, teasing out these details was not something we pursued because the finding was related to an in vitro assay, was a partial effect (IVF was about 50% as efficient), and was likely to be multifactorial and so would require extensive experiments. The failure of sperm migration into the oviduct was so dramatic that it seemed much more likely that this was the explanation for the low fertilization efficiency in vivo, rather than an effect of the oviductal environment on the cumulus cell matrix.</p><p><italic>7) The authors dismiss the eicosanoids as effectors of embryo demise because elevated PGE2 did not affect embryos in culture. It is more likely that PGE contributes to the phenotype by its effects on the oviduct itself, and this should be mentioned.</italic> </p><p>We were testing whether the eicosanoids could directly cause embryo lysis, which they did not appear to do. But yes, it is certainly possible that the eicosanoids could affect oviductal function in a way that promotes embryo lysis. We have added text to the Results to raise this possibility (subsection “Epithelial ERα Regulates Prostaglandin Levels and Inflammatory Response Mediators in the Oviduct”, second paragraph).</p><p><italic>8) The ovostacin/fetuin data appear contradictory. There is a reduction in ZP2 cleavage in the cKO, accompanied by an apparent loss of fetuin, the inhibitor of ovostacin. One might expect that decreased fetuin should result in greater ovostacin activity and thus greater cleavage of ZP2. This should probably be discussed.</italic> </p><p>The apparent contradiction in our findings that fetuin B was decreased and ZP2 cleavage was also decreased is now addressed in the Discussion (sixth paragraph).</p><p><italic>9) The defensin experiments (subsection “Protease-Mediated Disruption of Plasma Membrane Integrity Leads to Embryo Death” et seq.) are interesting, but are not judged to be extensive or definitive enough, to justify the conclusion that oviductal innate immune suppression mediated by Esr1 signaling is required for fertilization and preimplantation embryo development. The focus of the discussion and conclusions should be on the microarray findings on proteases and the wealth of functional data on proteases presented in the manuscript. Indeed, the defensins are not featured in the excellent summary slide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>).</italic> </p><p>We agree that the defensin data is not extensive or definitive, and does not belong in the summary schematic because we have no evidence that it represents a functional difference between the WT and cKO oviducts. The expression levels of various defensins were different in the WT and cKO oviducts, but there was not an overall up- or down-regulation of defensin expression in the cKO oviduct, and even direct application of defensins to embryos in vitro did not cause embryo lysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6–figure supplement 1</xref>), so it is unlikely that defensins alone explain the embryo lysis phenotype. Instead, we believe that the information provided regarding how defensins could contribute to the protease-mediated embryo lysis phenotype brings out the multifaceted nature of the innate immune environment present in the oviduct lumen.</p><p>Our conclusions regarding oviductal innate immune suppression are based on our understanding that both proteases and protease inhibitors function as important components of the innate immune system. For example, kallikreins are proteases that function to activate antimicrobial peptides (reviewed in Yu et al., Biol. Chem. 2014, 395:931) and have been documented to have this function in the human female reproductive tract (Shaw et al., Biol Chem 2008, 389:1513). SLPI and elafin are protease inhibitors that have antibacterial, antifungal, and antiviral activities (see Lecaille et al., Biochimie 2015, doi:10.1016/j.biochi.2015.08.014). Proteases and protease inhibitors both serve as innate immune mediators in the female reproductive tract (Wira et al., J Reprod Immunol 2011, 65:196; Aboud et al., American Journal of Reproductive Immunology 2014, 71:12). One of the downregulated protease inhibitors we identified in cKO oviducts, <italic>Serpine1</italic>, was recently demonstrated to function as a secreted protease inhibitor that inhibits influenza A virus spreading by preventing viral surface glycoprotein maturation (Dittmann et al., Cell 2015, 160:631). In response to this reviewer concern, we have included additional information regarding antimicrobial proteins in the Results section (subsection “Epithelial ERα Regulates Prostaglandin Levels and Inflammatory Response Mediators in the Oviduct”, second paragraph) and modified the Abstract, Significance Statement, and the first and second paragraphs of the Discussion to focus more on the protease/protease inhibitor findings.</p><p><italic>10) The results presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> are somewhat surprising, as they indicate the persistence of exogenous protease inhibitors in the oviduct for a fairly long period of time. It is not clear to what the percentage data refer, how could 100% of the embryos be at the morula/blastocyst stage, while 30% ore underdeveloped in the cKO -PI group.</italic> </p><p>We agree it is highly unlikely that the exogenous protease inhibitors would persist in the oviduct for 3 days. However, we found by microarray analysis that in contrast to the large differences in gene expression in WT and cKO oviducts on pregnancy day 0.5, there was very little difference in the gene expression patterns on pregnancy day 1.5. Although we did not perform microarrays on pregnancy days 2.5 or 3.5, we would predict that on these days the oviduct would have similarly small differences because estradiol levels are relatively low, and progesterone levels are high. The critical time, therefore, that the exogenous protease inhibitors are needed is on pregnancy day 0.5 when there are the most differences between the WT and cKO oviductal environments. A statement to this effect has been added to the Discussion (end of ninth paragraph).</p><p>We also agree that the graph representing the embryo development data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref> could be somewhat difficult to follow, and as a result we have changed the graph format. The stacked bars in the original graph represented in white the morula/blastocyst embryos, and in black the underdeveloped embryos. So, in the cKO-PI group, there were ~30% underdeveloped and 70% morula/blast, while in the cKO + PI group there were ~10% underdeveloped and 90% morula/blast. All mice in both WT groups had 100% morula/blast, and no underdeveloped embryos. We have now un-stacked the bars to make the graph clearer. The numbers of embryos per group were moved into the Figure legend.</p><p><italic>11) The conclusions about effects on the innate immune system seem to somewhat of a stretch and should be modified.</italic> </p><p>Please see response to question #9.</p></body></sub-article></article>
