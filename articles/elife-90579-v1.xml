delaying the onset of many diseases of aging. However, the delivery of transgenes and potential risk of teratoma formation present challenges for in vivo applications. Recent advances include the use of cocktails of compounds to reprogram somatic cells, but the characteristics and mechanisms of partial cellular reprogramming by chemicals remain unclear. Here, we report a multi-omics characterization of partial chemical reprogramming in fibroblasts from young and aged mice. We measured the effects of partial chemical reprogramming on the epigenome, transcriptome, proteome, phosphoproteome, and metabolome. At the transcriptome, proteome, and phosphoproteome levels, we saw widescale changes induced by this treatment, with the most notable signature being an upregulation of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. Furthermore, at the metabolome level, we observed a reduction in the accumulation of aging-related metabolites. Using both transcriptomic and epigenetic clock-based analyses, we show that partial chemical reprogramming reduces the biological age of mouse fibroblasts. We demonstrate that these changes have functional impacts, as evidenced by changes in cellular respiration and mitochondrial membrane potential. Taken together, these results illuminate the potential for chemical reprogramming reagents to rejuvenate aged biological systems and warrant further investigation into adapting these approaches for in vivo age reversal.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>aging</kwd><kwd>reprogramming</kwd><kwd>mitochondria</kwd><kwd>oxidative phosphorylation</kwd><kwd>biological age</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000049</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Aging</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AG067782</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gladyshev</surname><given-names>Vadim N</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000070</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32EB016652</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mitchell</surname><given-names>Wayne</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM132129</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Paulo</surname><given-names>Joao A</given-names></name><name><surname>Gygi</surname><given-names>Steven P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM67945</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gygi</surname><given-names>Steven P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Partial chemical reprogramming is able to reduce the biological age of cells by diverting them to a different metabolic state marked by a strong upregulation of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cellular aging is accompanied by various features, such as epigenetic changes, upregulation of inflammation, metabolic dysfunction, decreased proteostatic clearance, and increased DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Schumacher et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hipp et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ferrucci and Fabbri, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amorim et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kane and Sinclair, 2019</xref>). However, while all these hallmarks consistently show changes during aging, there are only limited insights into their potential causative roles. Additionally, many therapies that have targeted single ‘hallmarks’ of aging have failed to increase lifespan or improve biological functions in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gems and de Magalhães, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Keshavarz et al., 2023</xref>). An alternative way to discover therapies for targeting biological age is to develop tools to quantify it, and then screen interventions for their effect on biological age reduction. Several methods currently exist for quantifying cell aging, such as epigenetic clocks that use mean methylation levels of CpG sites that change during aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Horvath, 2013</xref>), transcriptomic clocks that rely on age-associated changes in gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Choukrallah et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Buckley et al., 2023</xref>), clocks that rely on age-dependent telomere attrition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Vaiserman and Krasnienkov, 2020</xref>), and various proteomic, metabolomic, and glycomic clocks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Jansen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Pearce et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Johnson et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Krištić et al., 2014</xref>). The development of tools that aim to quantify biological aging have undergone significant improvements over the years. Most notably, second-generation epigenetic clocks trained to predict phenotypic measures and mortality instead of chronological age have been shown to outperform many of these aforementioned clocks in their ability to predict lifespan and healthspan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Lu et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Using various methods for biological age prediction, several intervention strategies have recently been shown to slow down and/or reverse biological aging. These include pharmacological interventions such as rapamycin and metformin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Sharp and Strong, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Shindyapina et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Juricic et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kulkarni et al., 2020</xref>), genetic interventions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Petkovich et al., 2017</xref>), heterochronic parabiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Ma et al., 2022</xref>), and partial reprogramming by doxycycline-induced expression of Yamanaka factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Yang et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Lu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kriukov et al., 2022</xref>). A natural rejuvenation process during early development has also been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kerepesi et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gladyshev, 2021</xref>). Although partial reprogramming of somatic cells has been shown to lead to improvements in biological function lost during aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Ocampo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Browder et al., 2022</xref>), the effective in vivo delivery of the transgenic cassettes and precise control of the expression of Yamanaka factors present challenges. To date, only one peer-reviewed study has demonstrated lifespan increase of wild type animals upon the treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Macip et al., 2024</xref>).</p><p>Recently, administration of cocktails of small-molecule compounds have been shown to reprogram somatic cells back to pluripotency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Guan et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hou et al., 2013</xref>); moreover, short-term administration of two chemical cocktails (7c and 2c) has demonstrated efficacy at ameliorating several hallmarks of aging in human fibroblasts, while simultaneously preserving cellular identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Lucas and Paine, 2022</xref>). Thus, partial reprogramming by short-term administration of chemicals could represent a more feasible, controllable, and adaptable method for inducing rejuvenation in vivo. However, the effects of short-term chemical reprogramming on biological age and function are currently unknown, and the mechanisms by which these chemical reprogramming cocktails act are not fully elucidated.</p><p>To address this knowledge gap, we have studied the effects of short-term partial cellular reprogramming by chemicals in both young and aged mouse fibroblasts using a multi-tiered approach. In essence, we have systematically evaluated the impact of chemical reprogramming on (i) the epigenome, transcriptome, proteome, phosphoproteome, and metabolome using various omics-based approaches, (ii) biological age with epigenetic and transcriptomic clocks, and (iii) cellular function using gene set enrichment analyses (GSEA) and measurements of cellular respiration. We demonstrate that partial chemical reprogramming induces widespread molecular changes that occur irrespective of the age of the cells. Moreover, we find significant upregulation of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) complexes in all treatment conditions at the transcriptome and proteome levels. Importantly, mitochondrial OXPHOS is downregulated in aging, and conversely upregulated by many lifespan-increasing interventions. Using both epigenetic and transcriptomic clocks, we show that 7c, but not 2c, reduces biological age in both young and old fibroblasts. Finally, we show that upregulation of mitochondrial OXPHOS by short-term 7c treatment strongly increases spare respiratory capacity and basal mitochondrial transmembrane potential levels. Taken together, these results imply that partial chemical reprogramming by 7c can rejuvenate several aspects of cellular aging, and that regulation of mitochondrial OXPHOS may play an important role in aging and rejuvenation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Partial chemical reprogramming increases pluripotency and mitochondrial OXPHOS activity</title><p>For this study, we freshly isolated tail and ear fibroblasts from young (4-month-old, or ‘4 month’) and old (20-month-old, or ‘20 month’) male C57BL/6 mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We only used fibroblasts that had been passaged ≤ 4 times to ensure that they maintain a physiologically relevant aged phenotype in cell culture. Indeed, previous studies have shown that the epigenetic age of fibroblasts increases rapidly once they are cultured in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Sturm et al., 2019</xref>). For our study, we used two cocktails: 7c (repsox, trans-2-phenylcyclopropylamine, DZNep, TTNPB, CHIR99021, forskolin, and valproic acid), which can reprogram somatic cells to pluripotency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Guan et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hou et al., 2013</xref>); and 2c (repsox, trans-2-phenylcyclopropylamine), a subset of 7c that does not negatively affect cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Lucas and Paine, 2022</xref>). First, we initiated treatment for 4 days prior to assessing their effects on pluripotency by staining for alkaline phosphatase (AP) activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Campbell, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). While neither 7c nor 2c treatment appeared to affect fibroblast morphology, 2c treatment dramatically increased the number of cells positive for AP activity in both young and old fibroblasts, an indication of increased pluripotency. In contrast, 7c treatment had no effect on AP activity.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Functional effects of partial chemical reprogramming.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Overview of the study.

Previous studies have established a decline of mitochondrial membrane potential with age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hagen et al., 1997</xref>), that caloric restriction (a well-characterized longevity intervention) acts by increasing mitochondrial membrane potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berry et al., 2023a</xref>), and that artificially increasing the mitochondrial membrane potential of <italic>C. elegans</italic> extends their lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Berry et al., 2023b</xref>). Thus, characterizing the effect of partial chemical reprogramming on basal mitochondrial membrane potential may be a reporter of its efficacy in rejuvenating cells. We observed a strong increase in normalized TMRM fluorescence upon 2c and 7c treatment, and this effect was mirrored across young and old fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). As a control, we pre-treated fibroblasts with the mitochondrial uncoupler CCCP and observed the expected decrease in TMRM signal relative to fibroblasts treated with vehicle. Thus, we concluded that partial chemical reprogramming strongly impacts mitochondrial bioenergetics during basal conditions.</p><p>Given these results, we further wanted to establish the effect of partial chemical reprogramming on mitochondrial function. To this end, we performed Seahorse experiments on fibroblasts treated with 7c and 2c (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) using the Mito Stress Test protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Divakaruni et al., 2014</xref>). In order to account for the effects of these cocktails on cell proliferation, we stained and counted the cells with LCS1 immediately after the run finished, and normalized the oxygen consumption rates (OCR) to OCR per 10,000 cells. From the raw traces, we observed similar responses between young and old fibroblasts. While 2c and 7c treatment only had minor effects on basal oxygen consumption rates, 7c dramatically increased both proton leak (mitochondrial oxygen consumption with inhibited ATP synthase minus non-mitochondrial respiration) and spare respiratory capacity (uncoupled minus basal respiration). Furthermore, these results were corroborated by the observed increase in mitochondrial mass and magnitude of the mitochondrial membrane potential in response to 7c treatment.

By principal component analysis (PCA; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), we observed that fibroblasts treated with 7c are strongly separated from control and 2c treatment by principal component 1, whereas control and 2c-treated fibroblasts are separated by principal component 2. Moreover, when we assessed the association of gene expression changes caused by fibroblast age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>, left panel) with previously established signatures of OSKM reprogramming and aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kriukov et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Tyshkovskiy et al., 2023</xref>), we saw positive associations with multiple tissue-specific (kidney, liver) and multi-tissue (mouse and rat) signatures of aging, and negative associations with the mouse signature of OSKM-induced iPSCs. Thus, at the level of gene expression, the aged phenotype of the 20-month-old fibroblasts was preserved in vitro. However, the number of differentially expressed genes with 2c and 7c treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) far exceeded the number of differentially expressed genes modified by age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>, right panel). Accordingly, changes induced by 2c or 7c were highly correlated across tested age groups (Spearman correlation coefficient &gt; 0.8) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). We first quantified the effect of partial chemical reprogramming on the expression of pluripotency markers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Shi et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Sevilla et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Lowry et al., 2008</xref>) and the transcription factors <italic>Klf4</italic> and <italic>Myc</italic> (<italic>c-Myc</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). <italic>Bend4</italic>, <italic>Esrrb</italic>, and <italic>Klf4</italic> were all upregulated following partial chemical reprogramming, and this occurred irrespective of the age of the fibroblasts.

Furthermore, 7c somewhat paradoxically reduced expression of <italic>Nanog</italic> and <italic>Myc</italic>. Thus, 2c treatment appeared to have a more pronounced pro-pluripotency effect, which was supported by the increase in AP-positive cells following partial chemical reprogramming. Moreover, 7c had differing effects on pluripotency despite 2c being a subset of this cocktail. Thus, short-term partial chemical reprogramming with 7c appeared to show a different mechanism than normal OSKM cellular reprogramming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Takahashi and Yamanaka, 2006</xref>), whereas 2c in contrast appeared to share more similarities with OSKM reprogramming.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Effect of partial chemical reprogramming on gene expression.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) PCA of bulk RNA-seq samples.

For 7c-treated fibroblasts, we observed a significant lowering of splicing-related protein damage. Furthermore, we noticed a marginally significant elevation of splicing-related damage with age, whereas the relative proportions of alternative splicing events remained unchanged. To further characterize the effect of 7c treatment on alternative splicing, we assessed the distribution of ΔPercent spliced-in (ΔPsi) values of differentially spliced (|ΔPsi| &gt; 0.1 and p-value &lt; 0.05) genes for old (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>) and young (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C</xref>) fibroblasts, separated by the type of alternative splicing. While the number of differentially spliced events with positive and negative ΔPsi values for exon skipping was roughly equivalent, there was an excess of events with negative ΔPsi values for intron retention across both age groups.

In aging signatures, we observed a significant upregulation of pathways involved in inflammation, apoptosis, and p53 signaling, accompanied by a downregulation of genes related to energy metabolism and DNA repair. Furthermore, for aging in the fibroblast system used in this study, we also observed an upregulation of apoptosis, inflammation, and interferon signaling, thus further validating these fibroblasts isolated from aged mice as an appropriate system to study aging in vitro. When we examined all pathways affected by age at the protein level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>, left panel), we further identified several other upregulated pathways classically associated with aging, including Mtorc1 and Kras signaling, and hypoxia.</p><p>In contrast, OSKM reprogramming in both human and mouse models counteracted most of these age-related changes. Interestingly, treatment with 2c and 7c also produced multiple anti-aging effects, particularly at the protein level, including upregulation of OXPHOS, TCA cycle, fatty acid metabolism, and mitochondrial translation, and downregulation of interferon signaling. Surprisingly, genes and proteins associated with the p53 pathway were upregulated by both cocktails. Partial chemical reprogramming also affected the abundance of proteins involved in cellular differentiation and extracellular matrix organization, resembling the effect of OSKM-induced iPSCs. Many of the pathways upregulated by fibroblast age at the protein level were counteracted by treatment with 7c and 2c, with Mtorc1 signaling being a notable exception in that it appeared to be even more strongly activated by 7c treatment in old fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>, center and right panels). Finally, 7c treatment resulted in a significantly lower concentration of proteins associated with PI3K/Akt signaling, suggesting that this intervention may induce pro-longevity mechanisms. Thus, partial chemical reprogramming ameliorated multiple molecular features of aging at the level of individual genes, proteins and cellular pathways, and reproduced several effects of OSKM reprogramming.</p><p>Since the anti-aging effects of partial chemical reprogramming on the proteome were more pronounced than their effects on the transcriptome, we then used GSEA on the proteomics data to find pathways affected by 7c and 2c treatments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Many mitochondria-related processes were upregulated by partial chemical reprogramming, whereas only functions related to cell proliferation and cell cycle were downregulated. Notably, all mitochondrial OXPHOS complexes (I-V, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>) were upregulated for both treatments in both age groups. Proteins essential for mRNA splicing were downregulated by both age and partial chemical reprogramming, although 7c downregulated more splicing-involved proteins than 2c (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Additionally, proteins essential for RNA methylation were upregulated in both 2c- and 7c-treated fibroblasts, with more pronounced effects observed with 7c. This observation could be relevant for the reduced splicing damage after 7c treatment, as RNA methylation is known to affect mRNA splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Covelo-Molares et al., 2018</xref>). Finally, we studied the effects of partial chemical reprogramming on other proteins relevant for aging, such as chaperones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Sóti and Csermely, 2000</xref>), collagens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ewald, 2020</xref>), and proteins implicated in the mitochondrial unfolded protein response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Shpilka and Haynes, 2018</xref>) (UPR<sup>mt</sup>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Although UPR<sup>mt</sup> was upregulated by both 7c and 2c, chaperones were significantly upregulated only by 7c treatment, and collagen proteins were down in 7c and up in 2c. Taken together, these results suggested that partial chemical reprogramming strongly upregulated mitochondrial function, with 7c treatment having a more profound effect.</p><p>Finally, we examined Spearman correlation of changes in both mRNA and protein abundance induced by 2c and 7c with gene expression signatures of OSKM reprogramming and aging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Consistent with our previous findings, we observed a significant positive association between OSKM reprogramming features and the effects of 2c, both at the gene expression and protein abundance levels. Furthermore, the transcriptomic and proteomic changes induced by 2c and 7c were negatively correlated with multiple signatures of mammalian aging. Therefore, partial chemical reprogramming demonstrated the ability to reduce molecular signatures of aging at both the protein and mRNA levels.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Correlation of gene expression and protein abundance changes with signatures of aging and OSKM reprogramming.</title><p>Spearman correlation of gene expression and protein abundance changes induced by partial chemical reprogramming (blue: 7c, green: 2c) with the signatures of OSKM reprogramming (cyan) and aging (red).

First, we performed GSEA on the normalized relative phosphopeptide intensities.

For all treatments and age-groups, only Prkaca signaling was significantly (FDR &lt; 0.05) and consistently upregulated. Notably, Prkaca, the catalytic alpha subunit of the cAMP-activated protein kinase A, is crucial for regulating glucose metabolism, and upon activation, for increasing lipolysis and energy expenditure in white adipose tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Turnham and Scott, 2016</xref>). Thus, it is interesting that this kinase was activated by 7c treatment when no statistically significant effect on lipolysis was observed with this treatment. In contrast, in young fibroblasts, Akt1 and Mapk1 signaling were significantly upregulated and downregulated, respectively upon 2c treatment. Both pathways were also strongly affected by 2c treatment in old fibroblasts but did not reach statistical significance (FDR &gt; 0.05). Mapk1 and Akt1 have opposing effects on regulating the expression of structural constituents of muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>); thus, this observed influence is entirely consistent with upregulation of proteins involved in muscle contraction by 2c treatment. Therefore, we concluded that 2c and 7c share similar mechanisms of partial chemical reprogramming via activation of Prkaca signaling and mitochondrial phosphorylation. However, activation of Prkaca by 7c treatment had different downstream effects than by 2c treatment.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Prkaca is dispensable for mediating increase in mitochondrial membrane potential following partial chemical reprogramming with 7c</title><p>Next, we wanted to verify if Prkaca signaling activated by partial chemical reprogramming was necessary to mediate its effects on the upregulation of mitochondrial OXPHOS. To this end, we knocked down Prkaca in old fibroblasts using RNA interference and assessed its impact on mitochondrial membrane potential during 7c partial chemical reprogramming (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, left panel). While Prkaca was successfully knocked down to approximately 25% of its basal level as analyzed by western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>), TMRM fluorescence of 7c-treated Prkaca knockdown fibroblasts was not statistically different from either 7c-treated control knockdown fibroblast treatments (treated with 7c only, or 7c and a non-targeted siRNA). Thus, we concluded that Prkaca signaling is either not necessary for mediating the increase in mitochondrial membrane potential caused by 7c treatment, or the amount of Prkaca remaining after knockdown is sufficient to mediate the required level of signaling. Despite this, we did observe a change in cellular distribution of Prkaca following 7c treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, right panel) by confocal microscopy. Instead of translocating to mitochondria, we observed that Prkaca appeared to localize to the nucleus more strongly during partial chemical reprogramming with 7c in old fibroblasts. Therefore, Prkaca could have a functional role in moderating some of the transcriptional responses to partial chemical reprogramming.</p><p>Finally, we checked the effect of partial chemical reprogramming with 7c on apoptosis in old fibroblasts using Annexin V staining and flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>). During the course of partial chemical reprogramming, we observed a steady increase in the percentage of apoptotic cells (DAPI negative, Annexin V FITC positive) that reached a maximum of approximately 20% on day 6. This percentage of apoptotic cells is similar to what has been reported with OSK/OSKM reprogramming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cheung et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, these data suggest that the majority of cells successfully undergo partial chemical reprogramming by 7c treatment.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Partial chemical reprogramming reverses the accumulation of aging-related metabolites</title><p>As the levels of endogenous cellular metabolites can have both activating and inhibitory effects on various signaling pathways, we performed an untargeted mass spectrometry-based analysis of metabolites following partial chemical reprogramming (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).

These analyses revealed that the levels of many metabolites, including guanidoacetic acid, creatine, and several nucleotides, were affected by fibroblast age. Moreover, 7c treatment had a much more pronounced effect on the metabolome than 2c, which agreed with both the previous functional and multi-omics data. Since only some of the metabolites affected by fibroblast age were subsequently counteracted by 7c treatment, these data suggested that rather than targeting specific aging-related changes, 7c treatment appeared to divert cells to a different metabolic state. Analysis of the top 50 significantly altered metabolites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>) revealed a cluster of 6 metabolites strongly upregulated by 7c treatment (guanidoacetic acid, S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH), tyramine, tributylamine, trimethylamine N-oxide, and atenolol). Interestingly, SAH is known as an inhibitor of DNA methyltransferases, both by product build-up and by competitive inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lin et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kumar et al., 2008</xref>). Thus, the increased abundance of SAH upon 7c treatment could stem from changes in epigenetic regulation through the activity of DNA methyltransferases, especially since protein levels of Mat2a were decreased by 7c treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>, top). Guanidoacetic acid, on the other hand, is the biosynthetic precursor of creatine and accepts a donor methyl group from S-adenosyl methionine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">McBreairty et al., 2015</xref>) (SAM). Therefore, the effects of 7c treatment on guanidoacetic acid and SAH levels were intertwined. Conversely, many metabolites were strongly downregulated by 7c treatment, including 3’,5’ cyclic AMP (an activator of protein kinase A <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Turnham and Scott, 2016</xref>), xanthine (an inhibitor of phosphodiesterases that increase cyclic AMP levels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Wharton and Goz, 1979</xref>), and various other purines, nucleosides, and nucleotides (hypoxanthine, inosine, pseudouridine, uridine, uracil, adenosine, and guanosine). In agreement with this observation, proteins involved in xanthine metabolism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>, bottom) were upregulated by partial chemical reprogramming with 7c. Moreover, several purine degradation metabolites have been shown to be positively associated with aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Panyard et al., 2022</xref>), suggesting that 7c treatment may reverse the accumulation of aging-related metabolites.</p><p>In the case of 2c treatment, two upregulated and related metabolites stood out: serotonin, and its biosynthetic precursor 5-hydroxy-tryptophan (5-HTP), which is decarboxylated to form serotonin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Maffei, 2020</xref>). Besides being an important neurotransmitter, serotonin and its precursor 5-HTP are formed downstream from tryptophan by tryptophan hydroxylase and 5-HTP decarboxylase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Maffei, 2020</xref>). While the abundance of tryptophan itself was not altered by partial reprogramming, the abundance of niacinamide, which is also synthesized from tryptophan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fukuwatari and Shibata, 2007</xref>), was slightly reduced following 2c treatment. Lastly, for 2c, two byproducts of lysine metabolism (Glu-Lys and aminoadipic acid) were downregulated, whereas lysine levels were not significantly altered. Since lysine is crucial for the cross-linking of collagen fibrils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Yamauchi and Sricholpech, 2012</xref>), and since 2c strongly upregulated the abundance of collagen proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>), 2c treatment could be downregulating lysine catabolism. Therefore, we observed strong effects of partial reprogramming on the cellular metabolome, and these effects were generally consistent with the analyses of protein abundance and gene expression. Additionally, partial chemical reprogramming with 7c appeared to reduce the levels of several purine derivatives, which could be important for reducing aging-related accumulation of damaging metabolites.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Partial chemical reprogramming rejuvenates both young and aged cells</title><p>To assess the rejuvenation potential of partial chemical reprogramming, we analyzed the effects of 7c and 2c treatment on fibroblast age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) using mouse multi-tissue transcriptomic clocks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). As tools to measure age, transcriptomic clocks have successfully reported the effects of interventions known to affect lifespan and rate of biological aging, and appear to be sensitive to transient changes in gene expression that may occur upon short-term treatment with drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Choukrallah et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Buckley et al., 2023</xref>) and OSKM reprogramming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kriukov et al., 2022</xref>).

Additionally, the chronological transcriptomic clock revealed that the 20-month-old untreated primary fibroblasts were transcriptionally older than 4-month-old fibroblasts, which suggested that the fibroblast system used in this study demonstrated age-related changes in gene expression shared across multiple mouse organs. However, when the lifespan-adjusted biological clock was applied, no statistical significance was observed. Thus, we determined that the 20-month-old fibroblasts used in our study did not exhibit substantial changes in gene expression associated with decreased healthspan, while 7c had substantial effects on both general and mortality-associated age-related transcriptomic changes.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Effects of partial chemical reprogramming on biological age.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Effects of partial chemical reprogramming on transcriptomic age (tAge). tAge was assessed by using mouse multi-tissue transcriptomic clocks to analyze the bulk RNA-seq data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> (n=4 independent biological replicates). p-values were determined by one-way ANOVA and Tukey’s post-hoc analysis. ns p ≥ 0.1, ^p &lt; 0.1, *p &lt; 0.05, **p &lt; 0.01.

As a positive control, we measured the epigenetic ages (DNAmAge) of young and old fibroblasts reprogrammed by OSKM expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). We found a consistent lowering of DNAmAge in response to 7c treatment, whereas the effect of 2c treatment was weaker and more variable, depending on the clock used. As expected, fibroblasts isolated from old mice were epigenetically older than fibroblasts taken from young mice, which further confirmed that the fibroblasts maintained their aged phenotype in cell culture. Finally, fully-reprogrammed fibroblasts (iPSCs) demonstrated an epigenetic age of approximately 0, which was consistent with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Horvath, 2013</xref>). Therefore, we concluded that partial chemical reprogramming, particularly by 7c treatment, can rejuvenate both young and aged cells.</p><p>When we further analyzed the effects of fibroblast age on the epigenome, we observed a significant number of CpG sites that became differentially methylated with age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2A</xref>). While these aging-related differences did not impact mean DNAm levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2B</xref>), we did observe an enrichment of hypomethylated CpG sites for active enhancer regions in 20-month-old fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2C</xref>). When we compared these results with the effects of partial chemical reprogramming, we observed by PCA that the samples were much more strongly separated by treatment condition rather than fibroblast age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3A</xref>). OSKM- and 7c-reprogrammed cells were clearly separated from control samples, whereas 2c-reprogrammed cells were not. This was made further evident by the fact that 7c treatment caused a greater number of CpG sites to become significantly differentially methylated than 2c treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3B</xref>). Furthermore, rather than targeting specific CpG sites that changed with fibroblast age, 7c treatment induced global hypomethylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3C</xref>) that consequently caused the reduction in cell epigenetic age. Moreover, hypomethylated CpG sites after 7c treatment were enriched for transcription and exon regions and conversely, depleted at heterochromatin and promoter regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3D</xref>). This signature was shared in both young and old fibroblasts, suggesting that 7c treatment appeared to push cells to a distinct epigenetic landscape independent of their initial state.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The goal of our study was to characterize the effects of partial chemical reprogramming of cells at the level of the epigenome, transcriptome, proteome and phosphoproteome, and metabolome. To do this, we used low-passage fibroblasts isolated from young (4-month-old) and old (20-month-old) C57BL/6 male mice and treated the fibroblasts with two chemical reprogramming cocktails (2c and 7c). We then analyzed the effects of partial chemical reprogramming and its relationship to aging using a suite of omics-based approaches. Finally, we combined these multi-omics assays with measures of biological age (by using aging clocks) and cellular function (by utilizing respirometry and fluorescence microscopy to determine the effects of partial chemical reprogramming on mitochondrial bioenergetics). Together, these studies evaluated the potential for partial chemical reprogramming to ameliorate aging features, and uncovered its associated mechanisms for further optimization and development of treatments that could slow and/or reverse aging in vivo.</p><p>Based on measurements of biological age using epigenetic and transcriptomic clocks, we concluded that partial chemical reprogramming with 7c was able to rejuvenate fibroblasts taken from both young and old mice. Additionally, from measures of mRNA, protein, and phosphoprotein abundances, we determined that partial chemical reprogramming causes wide-scale changes to fibroblast gene expression that are larger in magnitude than the changes that occur due to aging. Based on GSEA analyses of these multi-omics data, we uncovered that the most prominent mechanistic signature of partial chemical reprogramming is the upregulation of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), which further manifested as a functional increase in spare respiratory capacity and increased mitochondrial transmembrane potential. Moreover, this increase in OXPHOS activity was accompanied by a slight increase in apoptosis during the course of reprogramming, suggesting that partial chemical reprogramming might remove cells with dysfunctional mitochondria. Finally, we showed that partial chemical reprogramming can reverse molecular damage positively associated with aging, including the accumulation of aging-related metabolites and mis-spliced mRNA.</p><p>The downregulation of mitochondrial OXPHOS and translation is a known signature of aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Tyshkovskiy et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Tyshkovskiy et al., 2023</xref>); furthermore, several recent studies have highlighted that augmenting the mitochondrial transmembrane potential can increase longevity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berry et al., 2023a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Berry et al., 2023b</xref>). In this light, we suggest that partial chemical reprogramming of fibroblasts induces rejuvenation, at least in part, by upregulating mitochondrial OXPHOS. Importantly, this differs significantly from OSKM reprogramming, which shows a strong glycolytic shift in response to the induction of OSKM expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Nishimura et al., 2019</xref>). Furthermore, our results are consistent with the activation of different transcription factors by partial chemical reprogramming with 7c, which showed negligible expression of the Yamanaka factors, increased expression of two pluripotency markers (<italic>Esrrb</italic> and <italic>Bend4</italic>), and decreased expression of <italic>Nanog</italic>.</p><p>The results of several recent studies have illustrated the changes in mitochondrial ultrastructure that occur during aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brandt et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Lu et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Stahon et al., 2016</xref>), which may result from several interdependent mechanisms such as disrupted Opa1-, Drp1-, and Micos-mediated fission and fusion dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Warnsmann et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Zer et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Pellegrini and Scorrano, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Sharma et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Rana et al., 2017</xref>), decreased cardiolipin content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Semba et al., 2019</xref>), destabilized ATP synthase dimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Daum et al., 2013</xref>), and uncontrolled opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Rottenberg and Hoek, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Angeli et al., 2021</xref>). Importantly, mitochondrial ultrastructure determines bioenergetic function and thus, detrimental changes to mitochondrial ultrastructure (such as loss of tight cristae junctions and cristae curvature) can lead to bioenergetic declines during aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Sun et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gómez and Hagen, 2012</xref>). These declines include increased proton leak and reactive oxygen species production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Sun et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gómez and Hagen, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>), decreased respiratory supercomplex assembly and associated spare respiratory capacity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gómez and Hagen, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Novack et al., 2020</xref>), and impaired proteostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Patron et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Moehle et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, the activation of factors that reinforce proper mitochondrial ultrastructure could reverse many aging-related elements of mitochondrial dysfunction.</p><p>It should be emphasized that across most assays, the effects of partial chemical reprogramming were similar in both young and old fibroblasts. In simplest terms, this could be because the changes observed due to fibroblast aging (i.e. in terms of the number of differentially expressed genes, proteins, and metabolites) were approximately an order of magnitude lower than those observed with partial chemical reprogramming. An alternative, non-mutually exclusive explanation is that partial chemical reprogramming, particularly with 7c, pushes cells to a different metabolic state that makes them biologically younger (i.e. at the transcriptional and epigenome levels) as a byproduct. For example, with the untreated fibroblasts, we observed an increased epigenetic age in the 20-month-old fibroblasts vs. the 4-month-old fibroblasts without a change in mean DNAm. In contrast, with 7c treatment, we saw decreased epigenetic age in both young and old fibroblasts that occurred due to induced global hypomethylation. Thus, we believe that 7c-mediated partial chemical reprogramming may activate a unique set of transcription factors that produce an epigenetically-distinct cellular state, irrespective of the initial state of the epigenome and in addition to the known de-methylating effects of DZNep.</p><p>In conclusion, we have shown that partial chemical reprogramming is able to reverse many signs of aging in a mouse fibroblast model. We thus posit that partial reprogramming by chemicals may represent a viable alternative to the cyclically-induced, ectopic expression of Yamanaka factors for rejuvenating aged cells. There are several limitations of OSK/OSKM partial reprogramming, including low efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Takahashi and Yamanaka, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Ohnishi et al., 2014</xref>), oncogenic risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Ohnishi et al., 2014</xref>), and potential toxicity due to varying cell types being reprogrammed at different rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Singh and Zhakupova, 2022</xref>). In this study, we have shown that partial chemical reprogramming with 7c features a distinct mechanism from OSK/OSKM partial reprogramming; thus, partial chemical reprogramming could potentially circumvent these risks because it activates different transcriptional programs to reduce cellular biological age. Furthermore, as partial chemical reprogramming utilizes druggable small-molecule compounds, dosages and delivery agents can be precisely tailored to modify their pharmacokinetics and tissue distributions, and to minimize their cellular toxicity and potential off-target effects. Further testing however, particularly in animal models of aging, is needed to fully elucidate the effectiveness of partial chemical reprogramming in vivo, and to establish what advantages, if any, it may have over OSK/OSKM partial reprogramming. In addition, it is important to note that this study was performed using only one cell type isolated from inbred male mice; different cell types experience varying changes during aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kimmel et al., 2019</xref>), and the effects of aging and lifespan-extending interventions are generally sex-dimorphic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Sampathkumar et al., 2020</xref>). Thus, extensive validation in multiple cell types and in genetically-diverse male and female mice is necessary to determine if partial chemical reprogramming can ameliorate several relevant dimensions of mammalian aging. In addition, a more thorough characterization of the effect of partial chemical reprogramming on mitochondrial dynamics and function, such as OXPHOS supercomplex assembly, cristae ultrastructure, and protein import, could shed greater light on the importance of various mitochondrial processes in the aging process. Finally, elucidating the molecular targets of chemical reprogramming compounds, whether they may be transcription factors, regulators of the epigenome, and/or various kinases and cellular receptors, could further contribute to our understanding of aging and how to best reverse it.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Materials and animals</title><p>Young (4-month-old) and old (20-month-old) male C57BL/6 mice were acquired from the National Institute on Aging (NIA) aged rodent colonies (Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA) and were fed standard 5053 chow.

To further validate our findings, we have proceeded as follows:(1) First, we have investigated the role of Prkaca activation during partial chemical reprogramming with 7c (see updated Fig. 5C, Fig. 5 – figure supplement 1B). By confocal microscopy, we show that partial chemical reprogramming with 7c does not cause Prkaca to localize to mitochondria; rather, its cellular distribution is altered to favor nuclear localization. We also use RNAi to knockdown Prkaca and find that Prkaca is not necessary for mediating the increase in mitochondrial membrane potential upon partial chemical reprogramming with 7c.</p><p>(2) We have determined the effect of partial chemical reprogramming with 7c on apoptosis using Annexin V assay (see updated Fig. 5 – figure supplement 1C).

The authors highlighted consistent changes across the different datasets that are thought to be associated with aging phenotypes, showing reduction of age-associated signatures previously identified in various tissues. However, from the findings, it remains unclear which changes are functionally relevant in the specific fibroblast system being used. Specifically:</p><p>(1) The 4 month and 20 month mouse fibroblasts are designated &quot;young&quot; vs &quot;old&quot; in this study. An important analysis that was not shown for each of the profiled modalities was a comparison of untreated young vs old fibroblasts to determine age-associated molecular changes in this specific model of aging. Then, rather than using aging signatures defined in other tissues, it would be more appropriate to determine whether the chemical cocktails reverted old fibroblasts to a younger state based on the age-associated changes identified in this comparison.</p></disp-quote><p>In our study, we have used 4 biological samples per group for young and old untreated fibroblasts, and these samples have been used to calculate the effect of 7c and 2c cocktails on gene expression in each age group. Therefore, the correlation between logFC induced by 7c/2c treatment and logFC between young and old fibroblasts would be biased, since the same untreated samples would be used in both calculations: estimates B-A and C-B will be, on average, negatively correlated even if A, B and C are independent random variables. For this reason, to investigate the effect of cocktails on biological age, we utilized gene expression signatures of aging, estimated based on more than 2,600 samples of different ages from 25 data sources (PMID: 37269831). Notably, our multi-tissue signatures of aging were identified based on data from 17 tissues, including skin. Therefore, these biomarkers seem to represent more reliable and universal molecular mechanisms of aging. Since they have been identified using independent data, the signatures also don’t introduce the statistical bias described above. For these reasons, we think that they are more applicable for the current analysis. To demonstrate that the utilized aging signatures are overall consistent with the changes observed in studied fibroblasts, we performed GSEA-based analysis, testing association between logFC in aged fibroblasts and various signatures of aging and reprogramming (similar to our analysis in Fig. 2E). We found that the changes in aged fibroblasts from the current study demonstrated positive association with the majority of aging signatures (kidney, liver and multi-tissue signatures in mouse and rat) (Fig. 2 – figure supplement 1A) and were negatively associated with signatures of reprogramming. In addition, we characterized functional changes perturbed in untreated aged fibroblasts at the level of gene expression and protein concentrations and observed multiple changes consistent with the aging signatures, such as upregulation of genes and proteins involved in inflammatory response and interferon signaling (Fig. 3D, Fig. 2 – figure supplement 1C). Therefore, changes observed in untreated aged fibroblasts seem to agree with age-related molecular changes identified across mammalian tissues in our previous studies.</p><p>We would also like to mention that the epigenetic clocks used in this study consistently show that the fibroblasts from 20-month-old fibroblasts are significantly older than the fibroblasts from 4-month-old mice (Fig. 7B). Moreover, we have revised the manuscript to show that these epigenetic differences between young and old untreated fibroblasts are not due to overall changes in mean DNA methylation (Fig. 7 – figure supplement 2). In contrast, in the revised manuscript, we observe that 7c treatment is reducing the epigenetic age of cells by decreasing mean DNA methylation levels (Fig. 7 – figure supplement 3).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Across all datasets, it appears that the global profiles of young vs old mouse fibroblasts are fairly similar compared to treated fibroblasts, suggesting that the chemical cocktails are not reverting the fibroblasts to a younger state but instead driving them to a different cell state. Similarly, in most cases where specific age-related processes/genes are being compared across untreated and treated samples, no significant differences are observed between young and old fibroblasts.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that our data shows that partial chemical reprogramming seems to induce a similar effect on young and old fibroblasts. In Fig. 2 – figure supplement 1B, the Spearman correlation coefficients for the effects on gene expression in young and old fibroblasts are 0.80 and 0.85 for 2c and 7c, respectively. It is important to note that the effect of partial chemical reprogramming is a magnitude higher (say in terms of number of differentially expressed genes) than the effect of aging in the untreated fibroblasts. Partial chemical reprogramming with 7c, we believe, is pushing the cells to a younger state as a byproduct of producing a different cellular metabolic state with a strong increase in OXPHOS capacity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Functional validation experiments to confirm that specific changes observed after partial reprogramming are indeed reducing biological age is limited.</p></disp-quote><p>Functional validation of rejuvenating interventions is limited in vitro, as cells do not completely maintain their “aged” phenotype once isolated and cultured, and pursuing partial chemical reprogramming in vivo in naturally-aged mice was beyond the scope of the study. One of the best reporters of biological age that are preserved in primary cells in vitro are epigenetic and transcriptomic clocks, which were both utilized in this manuscript to show that 7c treatment, but not 2c, reduces biological age. We show that splicing-related damage is marginally elevated in old fibroblasts compared to young, and that 7c reduces splicing damage by reducing intron retention. Moreover, the epigenetic clocks used in this study show that the 20-month-old fibroblasts are significantly older than the 4-month-old fibroblasts, indicating that the “aged” phenotype is at least partially preserved. Furthermore, according to previous studies (PMIDs: 37269831, 31353263), one of the strongest functional biomarkers of aging is downregulation of mitochondrial function and energy metabolism, including oxidative phosphorylation, while upregulation of these functions is usually associated with extended lifespan in mice. For this reason, we have focused on these pathways in our study and assessed them with functional assays.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Partial reprogramming appears to substantially reduce biological age of the young (4 month) fibroblasts based on the aging signatures used. It is unclear how this result should be interpreted.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a caveat of all reprogramming strategies/”anti-aging” interventions developed and tested to date. Currently, there are no genetic or pharmacological methods that target only the “aged” state and not the “young” state as well (i.e. an intervention that would only cause a change in old cells and revert them to a younger state). However, “young” cells in our study and many other studies are still the cells of an intermediate age, as aging appears to begin early during development. Therefore, perhaps unsurprisingly, partial chemical reprogramming seemed to have similar effects on fibroblasts isolated from young and old mice, which is in line with OSK/OSKM reprogramming. These results should be interpreted as follows: partial chemical reprogramming does not depend on the epigenetic state (biological age) of adult cells to induce rejuvenation. We have updated the discussion section of our manuscript accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1:</bold></p><p>(1) How was the PCA conducted for RNA-seq data?

Since there are likely both rejuvenating and oncogenic aspects of the OSKM signatures, it is unclear what conclusions can be made from these comparisons.</p></disp-quote><p>Two central questions of this study were (1) if partial chemical reprogramming could induce cellular rejuvenation, and (2) if so, would it do so by merely chemically activating expression of Yamanaka factors. In this study, we find that 7c, the cocktail that demonstrated the most profound effect on biological age, only minorly upregulates Klf4, downregulates c-Myc, and has no effect on Sox2 or Oct4 expression. Thus, partial chemical reprogramming seems to operate through a mechanism independent of upregulating OSK/OSKM gene expression. This is crucial as it suggests that there are other transcription factors outside of OSKM that can be targeted to induce cellular rejuvenation and reversal of biological age. However, the direct transcriptional targets of partial chemical reprogramming are currently unknown and require further investigation.</p><p>Partial reprogramming with OSK/OSKM has several limitations, including low efficiency, oncogenic risk, and differences in the speed of reprogramming according to cell/tissue type. These risks could be inherently tied to the transcription factors OSKM themselves; thus, partial chemical reprogramming, by avoiding strong activation of these genes, could potentially avoid these risks and provide a safer means for reversing biological age in vivo. However, extensive follow-up studies beyond the scope of this manuscript are certainly required to determine this.</p><p>We have addressed this comment by modifying the discussion to include these points.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) When analyzing the phospho-proteomics data, results are discussed as general changes in phosphorylation of proteins involved in different cellular processes. However, phosphorylation can either activate or inhibit a specific protein, and can depend on the specific residue in a protein that is modified. Different proteins in a cellular process can also respond in opposite directions to phosphorylation. Treating activating and inactivating phosphorylation events separately in describing these results would be more informative.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that an analysis that considers for each specific phosphosite whether it activates or inactivates a particular pathway would in principle be preferable over our current enrichment analysis that only accounts for the increase or decrease in phosphorylation of each site without knowing its biological meaning. However, unfortunately, we think it is currently practically not possible to conduct such an analysis. The proposed analysis would require a database with information on which residues are (de-)phosphorylated when a certain pathway is activated. However, as far as we know, there are currently no databases that link activation or inactivation of specific phosphosites to pathways in repositories like KEGG, HALLMARK, GObp, GOcc, GOmf, Reactome, etc.</p><p>Some databases link phosphosites to drugs, diseases and kinases (e.g. PTMsigDB (PMID: 30563849)). However, these authors explicitly state: “We note that we do not capture functional annotations of PTM sites in PTMsigDB, such as activating or inactivating effect on the modified protein.” Furthermore, even in these databases, for the vast majority of the registered phosphosites, the responsible kinases are unknown, especially in mice. In our work, we made use of PhosphoSitePlus for kinase substrate enrichment analysis (see Fig. 5B). Such analyses, where kinase activity is inferred based on activated phosphosites are indeed commonly performed (see PMIDs: 34663829, 37269289, 37585503).</p><p>In the absence of a repository that assigns activity to phosphosites, if enrichment analysis is being done for biological pathways, it is standard practice to so without accounting for whether phosphosites are activating or inactivating (see PMID: 34663829), as we have done in our manuscript (Fig. 5A).</p><p>Despite the drawbacks, we believe our analysis is relevant, as it demonstrates important biological activity in these pathways uopn 2c/7c treatments as compared to controls. For example, the observed increase in abundance in mitochondrial OXPHOS complexes (Fig. 3E) combined with an increase in general phosphorylation of mitochondrial proteins (Fig. 5A) likely points to an increase mitochondrial activity, although one cannot exclude that some individual phosphorylation events might have inhibitory effects on certain mitochondrial proteins, while others might indicate increases in activity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) For the transcriptomic and epigenetic aging clocks used in Fig 7, significance tests need to be included for untreated 4 month vs 20 month fibroblasts. Particularly for the transcriptional clock, the differences are small and suggest that it may not be a strong aging signature.</p></disp-quote><p>We have updated our clock analysis with the most recent versions of the clocks and added statistical significance between 4-month-old and 20-month-old untreated fibroblasts there (Fig. 7A). The difference is statistically significant for the chronological clock. However, when the lifespan-adjusted clock was applied, no statistical significance was observed, suggesting that 20-month-old fibroblasts do not exhibit substantial changes in gene expression associated with decreased healthspan and increased mortality.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) For heatmaps shown in Figure 3D and Figure 4, please include untreated 4 month and 20 month fibroblasts as well to determine if pathways being compared are different between young and old fibroblasts.</p></disp-quote><p>We have updated Figure 3D with functional enrichment results for aged fibroblasts at gene and protein expression levels, as requested. As for Fig. 4, we explained in our reply to point 1 of Reviewer #2 in the public review why addition of aged fibroblasts there would be biased there. Instead, we have performed GSEA-based association analysis for changes observed in aged fibroblasts and signatures of aging (Fig. 2 – figure supplement 1), confirming that our signatures are overall consistent with patterns of 20-month-old fibroblasts from the current study.</p></body></sub-article></article>
