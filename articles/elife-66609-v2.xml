extracellular osmolality, is regulated by feedback and feedforward mechanisms. Feedback regulation is reactive, occurring as deviations in osmolality are <italic>detected</italic>. Feedforward or presystemic regulation is proactive, occurring when disturbances in osmolality are <italic>anticipated</italic>. Vasopressin (AVP) is a key hormone regulating water balance and is released during hyperosmolality to limit renal water excretion. AVP neurons are under feedback and feedforward regulation. Not only do they respond to disturbances in blood osmolality, but they are also rapidly suppressed and stimulated, respectively, by drinking and eating, which will ultimately decrease and increase osmolality. Here, we demonstrate that AVP neuron activity is regulated by multiple anatomically and functionally distinct neural circuits. Notably, presystemic regulation during drinking and eating are mediated by non-overlapping circuits that involve the lamina terminalis and hypothalamic arcuate nucleus, respectively. These findings reveal neural mechanisms that support differential regulation of AVP release by diverse behavioral and physiological stimuli.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Fine-tuning the amount of water present in the body at any given time is a tight balancing act. The hormone vasopressin helps to ensure that organisms do not get too dehydrated by allowing water in the urine to be reabsorbed into the bloodstream. A group of vasopressin neurons in the brain trigger the release of the hormone if water levels get too low (as reflected by an increase in osmolality, the level of substances dissolved in a unit of blood). However, these cells also receive additional information that allows them to predict and respond to upcoming changes in water levels. For example, drinking water while dehydrated ‘switches off’ the neurons, even before osmolality is restored in the blood to normal levels. Eating, on the other hand, rapidly activates vasopressin neurons before the food is digested and blood osmolality increases as a result.</p><p>How vasopressin neurons receive this ‘anticipatory’ information remains unclear. Kim et al. explored this question in mice by inhibiting different sets of brain cells one by one, and then examining whether the neurons could still exhibit anticipatory responses. This revealed a remarkable division of labor in the neural circuits that regulate vasopressin neurons: two completely different sets of neurons from distinct areas of the brain are dedicated to relaying anticipatory information about either water or food intake.</p><p>These findings help to understand how healthy levels of water can be maintained in the body. Overall, they give a glimpse into the neural mechanisms that underlie anticipatory forms of regulation, which can also take place when hunger or thirst neurons ‘foresee’ that food or water will be consumed.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>vasopressin</kwd><kwd>presystemic</kwd><kwd>feedforward</kwd><kwd>osmolality</kwd><kwd>water balance</kwd><kwd>fiber

common feature of many homeostatic circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Betley et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zimmerman et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Augustine et al., 2018</xref>). While the purpose of feedforward regulation has yet to be established, a number of compelling proposals have been suggested. Several studies have shown that feedforward regulation plays an important role in shaping ingestive behavior by promoting negative-reinforcement learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Betley et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Leib et al., 2017</xref>). It is also suggested that feedforward regulation is crucial for maintaining energy/water balance as it prevents overconsumption by preemptively terminating ingestive behavior before systemic disturbance is detected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Andermann and Lowell, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Augustine et al., 2020</xref>). Although the significance of feedforward regulation is just beginning to be recognized, the idea of such regulation in the hypothalamus existed since the late 1900s. A conceptual framework for feedforward regulation was provided by studies looking at the effect of water intake on thirst and blood vasopressin (AVP) levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rolls et al., 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wood et al., 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Thrasher et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Stricker and Hoffmann, 2007</xref>), from which the term ‘presystemic regulation’ originates.</p><p>AVP, also known as antidiuretic hormone, is synthesized by posterior pituitary-projecting magnocellular AVP neurons of the paraventricular (PVH) and supraoptic nuclei (SON) of the hypothalamus. These neurons underlie the body’s main non-behavioral response to dehydration or elevated systemic osmolality—an increase in circulating AVP. Upon stimulation of AVP neurons, AVP is released from the axon terminals in the posterior pituitary and enters the bloodstream (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ferguson et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bolignano et al., 2014</xref>). Once released, AVP binds to receptors in the kidney and stimulates water reabsorption to restore water balance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nielsen et al., 1995</xref>). Activity of AVP neurons is regulated by two temporally distinct mechanisms. Feedback or systemic regulation, which mainly informs AVP neurons of changes in systemic water balance, is mediated by the lamina terminalis (LT), comprised of the subfornical organ (SFO), median preoptic nucleus (MnPO), and organum vasculosum lamina terminalis (OVLT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">McKinley et al., 2004</xref>). The SFO and OVLT are circumventricular organs (CVOs) that lack a blood-brain barrier, and are capable of sensing systemic osmolality and blood-borne factors, such as angiotensin II. Osmolality information sensed by the SFO and OVLT is then sent to AVP neurons directly or indirectly via the MnPO. Feedforward or presystemic regulation, on the other hand, informs AVP neurons of anticipated future osmotic perturbation, based on the array of presystemic signals that occur immediately before (pre-ingestive) and after (post-ingestive) food or water ingestion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Stricker and Hoffmann, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Stricker and Stricker, 2011</xref>).</p><p>Presystemic regulation of AVP release was first described in 1980, in a study using dehydrated dogs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Thrasher et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Thrasher et al., 1987</xref>), and was later replicated in humans, monkeys, sheep, and rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arnauld and du Pont, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Geelen et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Blair-West et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Huang et al., 2000</xref>). These studies demonstrated that drinking causes a rapid reduction in blood AVP levels and that this decrease precedes any detectable decrease in blood osmolality (i.e., it is presystemic). However, due to lack of temporal resolution in blood AVP measurements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Christ-Crain and Fenske, 2016</xref>), these studies failed to capture rapid dynamics of presystemic regulation, preventing further dissection of distinct stimuli causing the presystemic reductions in AVP.</p><p>In a previous study, we demonstrated that magnocellular AVP neurons are under bidirectional presystemic regulation by drinking and eating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mandelblat-Cerf et al., 2017</xref>). However, the neural inputs providing presystemic information to these neurons are still unclear. Here, we used various circuit-mapping techniques, in vivo calcium imaging, and opto- and chemo-genetics to identify and characterize the neural circuits mediating presystemic regulation of AVP neuron activity.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>AVP neurons receive inhibitory and excitatory inputs from the LT</title><p>As the presystemic regulation of AVP neurons is rapid, it must be brought about by neural afferent inputs. To identify these afferents, we performed retrograde rabies mapping from posterior pituitary-projecting, magnocellular SON<sup>AVP</sup> and PVH<sup>AVP</sup> neurons using AVP-IRES-Cre mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a and e</xref>). Cre-dependent TVA (EnvA receptor) (AAV-DIO-TVA) and rabies glycoprotein (RG) (AAV-DIO-RG) viruses were injected into the SON or PVH. After 3 weeks, EnvA-pseudotyped G-deleted rabies virus (RV-EnvA-ΔG-GFP) was injected into the SON or posterior pituitary as described below. To target magnocellular SON<sup>AVP</sup> neurons, we injected the rabies virus directly into the SON (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). Note that all AVP neurons in the SON project to the posterior pituitary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Brown et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mandelblat-Cerf et al., 2017</xref>). In contrast, the PVH contains magnocellular and non-posterior pituitary-projecting, parvocellular AVP neurons. To specifically target magnocellular neurons, we devised a retrograde approach in which rabies virus was injected into the posterior pituitary instead of the PVH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>). Because TVA, in addition to being expressed at the cell body, is trafficked to the axon terminals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Betley et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Livneh et al., 2017</xref>), rabies virus can be taken up by TVA-expressing axons of PVH<sup>AVP</sup> neurons in the posterior pituitary, leading to projection-specific infection. Starter neurons in the PVH and SON were identified by co-expression of rabies-GFP and TVA-mCherry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b and f</xref>). Remarkably, despite their distinctly different anatomical locations, but in agreement with their identical functions, rabies mapping results from magnocellular PVH<sup>AVP</sup> and SON<sup>AVP</sup> neurons were strikingly similar. Both received strong inputs from the SFO, MnPO, and OVLT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d and h</xref>), and additional sparse rabies labeling was found in the arcuate nucleus (ARC) of the hypothalamus and the perinuclear zone (PNZ), an area surrounding the SON. We also found surprisingly dense rabies labeling in the PVH and SON when inputs to SON<sup>AVP</sup> and PVH<sup>AVP</sup> neurons were examined, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c and g</xref>). We performed additional experiments to investigate these unexpected findings. First, we injected AAV that Cre-independently expresses ChR2-mCherry into either the PVH or SON and found that neurons in these sites do not send direct projections to the SON and PVH, respectively. Furthermore, we also injected retrograde tracer cholera toxin subunit B into either the PVH or SON, and in agreement with the above-mentioned anterograde tracing study, failed to detect any labeled neurons in the SON and PVH, respectively (not shown). Based on these results, we believe that axosomatic and axodendritic PVH → SON<sup>AVP</sup> or SON → PVH<sup>AVP</sup> connections do not exist, and we speculate that the above-mentioned rabies results were caused by either non-synaptic transfer of rabies (i.e., an artifact) or synaptic transfer via axoaxonic synapses that might exist between PVH and SON neurons at the level of the posterior pituitary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Silverman et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Choudhury and Ray, 1990</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Magnocellular AVP neurons receive excitatory and inhibitory input from the LT.</title><p>(<bold>a, e</bold>) Schematic of monosynaptic rabies tracing from magnocellular PVH<sup>AVP</sup> (<bold>a</bold>) and SON<sup>AVP</sup> (<bold>e</bold>) neurons.

We injected the Cre-dependent synaptophysin (Syn) anterograde tracer, AAV-DIO-Syn-YFP, into the SFO and MnPO/OVLT of Vglut2-IRES-Cre and Vgat-IRES-Cre mice to individually trace glutamatergic and GABAergic projections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1i</xref>). The MnPO and OVLT were considered as one group because viral targeting of individual structures was challenging. We found that the MnPO/OVLT sends both excitatory and inhibitory projections to the PVH and SON while the SFO only sends excitatory projections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1j</xref>). Lack of long-range inhibitory projections of the SFO has been previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Oka et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Next, we performed channelrhodopsin (ChR2)-assisted circuit mapping (CRACM) to test synaptic connectivity of these projections to PVH<sup>AVP</sup> and SON<sup>AVP</sup> neurons.

All SON<sup>AVP</sup> neurons recorded are magnocellular. We did not distinguish parvocellular and magnocellular PVH<sup>AVP</sup> neurons in this experiment. We found that SFO<sup>Vglut2</sup> and MnPO/OVLT<sup>Vglut2</sup> neurons provided robust glutamatergic input to PVH<sup>AVP</sup> and SON<sup>AVP</sup> neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1l and n</xref>). In contrast, GABAergic input from MnPO/OVLT<sup>Vgat</sup> neurons was detected only in half of the PVH<sup>AVP</sup> and SON<sup>AVP</sup> neurons. Next, we tested the synaptic connectivity of the LT to GFP-negative neurons in the PVH and SON (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1m</xref>). The MnPO/OVLT provided glutamatergic and GABAergic input to the majority of GFP-negative neurons in the PVH and SON. We did not find any connection between SFO <sup>Vglut2</sup> neurons and GFP-negative PVH neurons, suggesting that SFO <sup>Vglut2</sup> inputs were highly specific to AVP neurons.

At various latencies following the beginning of each session, a water bowl was placed in the cage and mice were allowed to drink freely for ~15 min. Each mouse had one experimental session per day, in which they were pre-injected with either saline or CNO. In the control group, as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mandelblat-Cerf et al., 2017</xref>), SON<sup>AVP</sup> neurons were rapidly inhibited as the water bowl was introduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). This pre-ingestive response was learning-dependent as it gradually developed over the course of training (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Pre- and post-ingestive suppression of SON<sup>AVP</sup> neurons were observed before the significant drop in systemic osmolality, which we previously found to begin 10–15 min after drinking onset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mandelblat-Cerf et al., 2017</xref>). Inhibition of the MnPO/OVLT abolished the pre-ingestive drop in SON<sup>AVP</sup> neuron activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b–f</xref>). The post-ingestive response was also significantly attenuated. When recordings were performed from mice expressing the calcium-independent fluorescent marker, EYFP, in SON<sup>AVP</sup> neurons, no feeding/drinking-induced response was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>), demonstrating that the changes in GCaMP6s fluorescence were not due to movement artifacts.</p><p>Because the MnPO contains thirst-regulating neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abbott et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Augustine et al., 2018</xref>), we also analyzed drinking behavior in these mice. MnPO/OVLT inhibition did not prevent drinking but delayed drinking onset as demonstrated by a significant increase in the latency to drink (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2g</xref>). The number of drinking bouts per session was not affected. The MnPO/OVLT, along with the SFO, is the main source of excitatory input that underlies activation of SON<sup>AVP</sup> neurons during systemic hyperosmolality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">McKinley et al., 2004</xref>). Consistent with this, we found that MnPO/OVLT inhibition caused a drop in the baseline activity of SON<sup>AVP</sup> neurons in water-restricted mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2h</xref>). In a separate group of mice, we investigated the effect of SFO inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2i</xref>). Inhibition of the SFO caused a slight but non-significant attenuation of pre- and post-ingestive suppression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2j–l</xref>). Taken together, these data indicate that neurons in the MnPO/OVLT are important mediators of water-related presystemic signals to AVP neurons.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Presystemic signals enter the LT at the level of MnPO</title><p>Next, we sought to understand the organization of the presystemic circuit mediating water-related information within and upstream of the LT. Both the SFO and MnPO/OVLT provide strong excitatory inputs to AVP neurons. However, we found that only the MnPO/OVLT was required for water-related presystemic regulation of SON<sup>AVP</sup> neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), suggesting that the presystemic circuit might be organized similarly to the hierarchical thirst circuit described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Augustine et al., 2018</xref>). To test this idea, we mapped inputs to SON-projecting MnPO/OVLT<sup>Vglut2</sup> and SFO<sup>Vglut2</sup> neurons using monosynaptic rabies tracing. SON-projecting neurons were targeted using a retrograde approach shown schematically in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a and d</xref>. SON-projecting starter neurons, visualized by co-expression of GFP and mCherry, were seen in the MnPO/OVLT and SFO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b and e</xref>). Results from the MnPO/OVLT and SFO were strikingly different. SON-projecting MnPO/OVLT<sup>Vglut2</sup> neurons received inputs from multiple sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>), including the SFO, PVH, ventromedial (VMH), and dorsomedial nuclei (DMH) of the hypothalamus, and the lateral parabrachial nucleus (LPBN). Among these areas, the SFO contained the greatest number of rabies-labeled neurons, demonstrating strong interconnectivity between these LT structures. In contrast, SON-projecting SFO<sup>Vglut2</sup> neurons received inputs only from the other LT structures, the MnPO and OVLT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3f</xref>). The result was further validated using Nos-1-IRES-Cre mice, another Cre line that specifically marks excitatory SFO neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zimmerman et al., 2016</xref>). These data suggest that the MnPO/OVLT is the primary LT region that receives and relays extra-LT inputs to AVP neurons and, thus, is likely the main entry point for water-related presystemic information.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Organization of water-related presystemic neural circuit.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Schematic of monosynaptic rabies tracing from MnPO/OVLT<sup>Vglut2</sup> neurons.

To explore the possibility that presystemic regulation of both PVH<sup>AVP</sup> and SON<sup>AVP</sup> neurons is mediated by collateral projections from the same LT neurons, we performed rabies-based axon collateral mapping from SON-projecting MnPO/OVLT<sup>Vglut2</sup>, MnPO/OVLT<sup>Vgat</sup>, and SFO<sup>Vglut2</sup> neurons and examined their collateral projections in the LT, PVH, and SON. Rabies-based axon collateral mapping was performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Betley et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Livneh et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Livneh et al., 2020</xref>). We found rabies-labeled collateral projections of SON-projecting MnPO/OVLT<sup>Vglut2</sup>, MnPO/OVLT<sup>Vgat</sup>, and SFO<sup>Vglut2</sup> neurons in the PVH and LT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3g–i</xref>). The density of collateral projections was lower than that of the projections to the SON, suggesting that only a subset of SON-projecting MnPO/OVLT<sup>Vglut2</sup>, MnPO/OVLT<sup>Vgat</sup>, and SFO<sup>Vglut2</sup> neurons send collaterals to the PVH and LT. Interestingly, we found that MnPO/OVLT-projecting SFO<sup>Vglut2</sup> neurons, which include thirst-promoting neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Matsuda et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Augustine et al., 2018</xref>), send a similar density of rabies-labeled fibers to the MnPO/OVLT, PVH, and SON (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3j</xref>). This result suggests that a majority of these SON-projecting SFO<sup>Vglut2</sup> neurons send collaterals to the MnPO/OVLT and PVH, and, therefore may be capable of simultaneously regulating AVP release and thirst. Taken together, these results indicate that, unlike convergence of afferent presystemic inputs to the MnPO/OVLT, downstream projections of the LT are redundantly organized such that presystemic information is shared not only between the LT structures but also between PVH<sup>AVP</sup> and SON<sup>AVP</sup> neurons via collateral projections.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>SON-projecting LT neurons show presystemic responses to water-predicting cues and drinking</title><p>Next, we measured in vivo calcium dynamics of SON-projecting MnPO/OVLT and SFO neurons in response to water bowl presentation and drinking. GCaMP6s was expressed in SON-projecting excitatory or inhibitory neurons of the MnPO/OVLT and SFO using a modified herpes simplex virus that Cre-dependently expresses GCaMP6s (HSV-GCaMP6s) and retrogradely infects neurons from the axon terminals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kohl et al., 2018</xref>).

Both pre- and post-ingestive responses were significantly affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b–f</xref>). However, in comparison to non-specific silencing of the same area, which caused a complete removal of the pre-ingestive response of SON<sup>AVP</sup> neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f</xref>), inhibition of excitatory neurons in the MnPO/OVLT was less effective in reducing pre-ingestive component of the response as ~30% of the pre-ingestive response persisted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5g</xref>). Post-ingestive responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2f</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5g</xref>) and baseline activity before water bowl presentation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2h</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5i</xref>) were reduced to a similar degree in both cases. No significant change in latency to drink or in the number of drinking bouts was observed during the experimental session. However, when mice were tested in a separate setup using a lickometer, MnPO/OVLT<sup>Vglut2</sup> neuron inhibition caused a significant reduction in the amount of water intake in the same group of animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5h</xref>).</p><p>In contrast, the effect of MnPO/OVLT<sup>Vgat</sup> neuron inhibition was strictly restricted to the pre-ingestive phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5k–o</xref>). More specifically, a significant reduction in the SON<sup>AVP</sup> neuron response was found only during the last 5 s of pre-ingestive period that immediately precedes the onset of drinking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5p</xref>). This result is in line with our previous finding that MnPO/OVLT<sup>Vgat</sup> neurons show a transient activation to water-predicting cues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4h–k</xref>). The degree of reduction in pre-ingestive responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5p</xref>) was comparable to that of non-specific silencing of the MnPO/OVLT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f</xref>), suggesting that water-predicting cue/pre-ingestive information is primarily conveyed by inhibitory neurons of the MnPO/OVLT. Consistent with a lack of post-ingestive or any sustained changes in the activity of MnPO/OVLT<sup>Vgat</sup> neurons in response to drinking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4h–k</xref>), their inhibition had no effect on post-ingestive responses or baseline activity of SON<sup>AVP</sup> neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5p and r</xref>).

Due to inefficiency and tropism of the rabies virus, rabies retrograde tracing can, in some cases, be prone to false-negative results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Saleeba et al., 2019</xref>). Therefore, we decided to study additional sites suggested by a study using a traditional retrograde tracer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tribollet et al., 1985</xref>): the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) and A1/C1 neurons in the ventrolateral medulla (VLM).

First, to test the effectiveness of hM4Di in silencing A1/C1 neurons, we studied the effect of CNO on hypotension-induced activation of AVP neurons. A1/C1 neurons are suggested to be crucial for hypotension-induced AVP release as non-specific inhibition/lesion of the VLM causes a significant attenuation of this response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Blessing and Willoughby, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Head et al., 1987</xref>). A1/C1 inhibition significantly attenuated the activation of SON<sup>AVP</sup> neurons in response to drug-induced hypotension (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7e</xref>). This finding validates our experimental system and provides further evidence for the importance of A1/C1 neurons in hypotension-induced AVP release. We then used the same approach to examine the involvement of A1/C1 neurons in food-related presystemic regulation. In contrast to the robust blockade of hypotension-induced SON<sup>AVP</sup> neuron activation, A1/C1 neuron inhibition had no effect on feeding-induced activation of SON<sup>AVP</sup> neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7f</xref>).

While we found that PNZ<sup>Vgat</sup> neurons provided direct inhibitory input to AVP neurons and showed a selective response to food but not water (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2b, f</xref>), inhibition of these neurons had no effect on the baseline activity of SON<sup>AVP</sup> neurons (not shown) or their response to feeding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2g,i</xref>). Taken together, these data suggest that AgRP, POMC, and PNZ<sup>Vgat</sup> neurons are not primary contributors to food-related presystemic regulation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-10"><title>Food-related presystemic regulation of AVP neurons is mediated by unknown neurons in the ARC</title><p>Next, we decided to focus on the entire ARC population. Because it is difficult to selectively target all ARC neurons without hitting surrounding nuclei, to examine the role of ARC neurons we decided to use a subtractive approach by creating three groups of animals with differing hM4Di expression: (1) ARC+VMH+DMH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7k</xref>), (2) VMH only (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7o</xref>), and (3) DMH only (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7q</xref>). This approach allowed for effective silencing of the ARC with hM4Di, which is difficult to achieve with restricted injection of Cre-independent AAVs into the ARC. All three groups of mice underwent the same experimental protocol. Mice were chronically food-restricted and were habituated to the experimental session as described above. Inhibition of neurons in all three nuclei (ARC+VMH+DMH) caused a significant attenuation of feeding-induced activation that persisted throughout the recording (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7l–n</xref>). In contrast, inhibition of the VMH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7p</xref>) or DMH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7r</xref>) alone, fully sparing the ARC, had no effect. Injection of CNO in all three groups did not affect the baseline activity of SON<sup>AVP</sup> neurons (not shown) or short-term feeding behavior of mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s4">Figure 7—figure supplement 4</xref>). Taken together, these results indicate that the ARC contains a cell type, distinct from AgRP or POMC neurons, that relay food-related presystemic signals to SON<sup>AVP</sup> neurons.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Water homeostasis is achieved by an intricate balance between water intake and output that are dictated, respectively, by thirst and antidiuretic hormone (AVP). While the field has experienced great advances in the neurobiological understanding of thirst in the last several years, our knowledge of neural regulation of AVP release remains rudimentary due to lack of technical approaches for reliable and temporally precise measurement of circulating AVP in vivo. In a prior study, by directly monitoring the activity of magnocellular AVP neurons, we demonstrated that AVP neuron activity, and thus likely AVP release, is altered surprisingly rapidly by water and food ingestion before any change in systemic osmolality is observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mandelblat-Cerf et al., 2017</xref>). While such feedforward, presystemic regulation has been demonstrated in other homeostatic circuits, AVP neurons are unique in that they are capable of responding presystemically to both water and food, and the response is <italic>bidirectional</italic>—water-predicting cues and drinking inhibit and eating activates AVP neurons—and <italic>asymmetric</italic>—water causes pre- and post-ingestive presystemic inhibition but food only causes post-ingestive presystemic activation. In this study, we expand on our prior findings by presenting a neural circuit mechanism by which these unique properties arise. Our study revealed two parallel, non-overlapping neural pathways for water- and food-related presystemic regulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Key components of the water-related presystemic circuit are neurons in the LT, which provide direct synaptic input to AVP neurons and exhibit water-related presystemic responses that closely resemble those of AVP neurons. Food-related presystemic regulation, on the other hand, is mediated by an as yet unidentified neuronal population in the ARC that is completely distinct from feeding-regulating AgRP and POMC neurons. In the course of our study, we confirmed additional afferents that were previously proposed to be involved in other aspects of AVP function, such as A1/C1 neurons in the brainstem that mediate hypotension-induced AVP release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Blessing and Willoughby, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Head et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Leng et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Guyenet et al., 2013</xref>). Collectively, these findings demonstrate that water- versus food-related presystemic signals are relayed to AVP neurons independently and differently via two non-overlapping circuits to give rise to the bidirectional, asymmetric presystemic response of AVP neurons.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Neural circuits for presystemic regulation of AVP neurons.</title><p>AVP, vasopressin; MnPO, median preoptic nucleus; OVLT, organum vasculosum lamina terminalis; PVH, paraventricular; SFO, subfornical organ SON, supraoptic nuclei.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-66609-fig8-v2.tif"/></fig><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Summary of the result.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="2" valign="top">Afferents tested</th><th align="left" rowspan="2" valign="top">Connection toAVP neurons(validation method)<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="table1fn1"><sup>*</sup></xref></th><th align="left" colspan="2" valign="top">Presystemic response(pre-/post-ingestive)</th><th align="left" rowspan="2" valign="top">Effect of inhibition on AVP neuron activity</th></tr><tr><th align="left" valign="top">Water</th><th align="left" valign="top">Food</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top"><bold>SON-projecting SFO<sup>Vglut2</sup>, MnPO/OVLT<sup>Vglut2</sup></bold></td><td align="left" valign="top">✓(Rabies mapping, CRACM, and projection mapping)</td><td align="left" valign="top">↓ / ↓↓</td><td align="left" valign="top">↔ / ↔</td><td align="left" valign="top">▼ Water-related presystemic response(pre- and post-ingestive)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top"><bold>SON-projecting MnPO/OVLT<sup>Vgat</sup></bold></td><td align="left" valign="top">✓(Rabies mapping, CRACM, and projection mapping)</td><td align="left" valign="top">↑ / ↔</td><td align="left" valign="top">↑ / ↔</td><td align="left" valign="top">▼ Water-related presystemic response(pre-ingestive only)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top"><bold>A1/C1</bold></td><td align="left" valign="top">✓(CRACM and projection mapping)</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">?</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">?</td><td align="left" valign="top">▼ Hypotension-induced activation</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top"><bold>PNZ<sup>Vgat</sup></bold></td><td align="left" valign="top">✓(Rabies mapping and CRACM)</td><td align="left" valign="top">↑ / ↔</td><td align="left" valign="top">↑ / ↓↓</td><td align="left" valign="top">No effect</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top"><bold>AgRP</bold><sup>a</sup></td><td align="left" valign="top">X(Rabies mapping, CRACM, and projection mapping)</td><td align="left" valign="top">↔</td><td align="left" valign="top">↓ / ↓↓</td><td align="left" valign="top">No effect</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top"><bold>POMC</bold><sup>a</sup></td><td align="left" valign="top">X(Rabies mapping, CRACM, and projection mapping)</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">?</td><td align="left" valign="top">↑ / ↑↑</td><td align="left" valign="top">No effect</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top"><bold>ARC</bold></td><td align="left" valign="top">✓(Rabies mapping)</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">?</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">?</td><td align="left" valign="top">▼ Feeding-related presystemic response</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn id="table1fn1"><label>*</label><p>✓, connected; X, not connected; ↑, increase (↑&lt;↑↑); ↓, decrease (↓&lt;↓↓); ↔, no change;?, not tested; ▼, significantly attenuated; a, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Betley et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mandelblat-Cerf et al., 2017</xref>.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><p>Recent studies have identified multiple molecularly or anatomically distinct neuronal populations in the LT that are involved in different aspects of water homeostasis ( <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abbott et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Matsuda et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Augustine et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Matsuda et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pool et al., 2020</xref>). In this study, we investigated the role of the LT neurons in mediating presystemic regulation of AVP neurons. We identified at least three groups of LT neurons that provide direct input to AVP neurons: SFO<sup>Vglut2</sup>, MnPO/OVLT<sup>Vglut2</sup>, and MnPO/OVLT<sup>Vgat</sup> neurons. Interestingly, while all these neurons connect to AVP neurons with high probability, only MnPO/OVLT neurons were required for their presystemic regulation. More strikingly, while being indispensable for water-related presystemic responses of AVP neurons, MnPO/OVLT neurons played no role in mediating food-related presystemic responses, indicating that presystemic regulation of AVP neurons involves two distinct neural pathways dedicated to water- or food-related regulation. Three groups of AVP-regulating LT neurons were studied individually by selectively isolating them using projection-specific approaches (i.e., to the SON) and genetic markers (i.e., Vglut2 and Vgat). As can be expected from their opposite neurochemical nature, SON-projecting MnPO/OVLT<sup>Vglut2</sup> and MnPO/OVLT<sup>Vgat</sup> neurons showed opposing responses to water-related presystemic signals. SON-projecting MnPO/OVLT<sup>Vglut2</sup> neurons were rapidly suppressed by both water-predicting cues and drinking whereas SON-projecting MnPO/OVLT<sup>Vgat</sup> neurons were activated transiently and exclusively by water-predicting cues. SON-projecting SFO<sup>Vglut2</sup> neurons showed similar presystemic response to MnPO/OVLT<sup>Vglut2</sup> neurons but their contribution to presystemic regulation of AVP neurons may be minor as inhibition of the SFO did not affect the activity of AVP neurons. Of note, while we refer to SON-projecting LT neurons as ‘AVP-regulating’ based on their high probability connections to SON<sup>AVP</sup> neurons, we acknowledge that subsets of SON-projecting LT neurons may also be involved in regulation of other downstream processes such as oxytocin release (via their connection to SON<sup>Oxytocin</sup> (non-AVP) neurons as demonstrated by CRACM) and thirst (via their collaterals to other downstream structures as demonstrated by collateral mapping).</p><p>By selectively silencing MnPO/OVLT<sup>Vglut2</sup> and MnPO/OVLT<sup>Vgat</sup> neurons, we demonstrate that both excitatory and inhibitory inputs from the MnPO/OVLT are necessary for water-related presystemic regulation of AVP neurons. MnPO/OVLT<sup>Vgat</sup> and MnPO/OVLT<sup>Vglut2</sup> neurons were each responsible for pre- and post-ingestive phases of the response, respectively, which is consistent with the contrasting neural dynamics of SON-projecting MnPO/OVLT<sup>Vgat</sup> and MnPO/OVLT<sup>Vglut2</sup> neurons. Initial pre-ingestive cue-induced suppression of AVP neurons was mediated primarily by MnPO/OVLT<sup>Vgat</sup> neurons as their silencing completely prevented this response. Silencing of MnPO/OVLT<sup>Vglut2</sup> neurons also caused a significant attenuation but failed to completely block the pre-ingestive response. These results suggest that the pre-ingestive response is a combined outcome of direct and indirect suppression of AVP neurons by MnPO/OVLT<sup>Vgat</sup> neurons, via their direct projections to AVP neurons and local projections to MnPO/OVLT<sup>Vglut2</sup> neurons, which consequently results in reduced excitatory drive to AVP neurons. Post-ingestive drinking-induced suppression of AVP neurons was primarily the result of decreased excitatory drive from the MnPO/OVLT as post-ingestive response was significantly attenuated by silencing of MnPO/OVLT<sup>Vglut2</sup> neurons, but not MnPO/OVLT<sup>Vgat</sup> neurons. Silencing of MnPO/OVLT<sup>Vglut2</sup> neurons simultaneously caused a significant reduction in the amount of water intake. While reduced water intake could contribute to the reduction in post-ingestive response, this is unlikely a major factor given the consistent degree of silencing throughout both pre- and post-ingestive phases and the high probability connection and similar response dynamics in SON-projecting MnPO/OVLT<sup>Vglut2</sup> versus SON<sup>AVP</sup> neurons.</p><p>Presystemic responses of thirst-regulating counterparts of the LT have been extensively studied by many groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zimmerman et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Augustine et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Augustine et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zimmerman et al., 2019</xref>). While thirst-regulating LT neurons also exhibit presystemic suppression (thirst-promoting neurons) and activation (thirst-suppressing neurons), their responses surprisingly lack a pre-ingestive component that is present in AVP-regulating LT neurons and also hunger-regulating AgRP and POMC neurons (this study and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Betley et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mandelblat-Cerf et al., 2017</xref>). This raises the possibility that presystemic regulation of thirst neurons may be different. Alternatively, it is possible that prior studies missed this regulation due to either its magnitude being small in comparison to post-ingestive regulation and/or the fact that population recordings, which may have pooled thirst-regulating LT neurons with other neurons, obscured its detection. Indeed, a study using single-cell imaging reported a small subset of MnPO/OVLT neurons that are activated or inhibited by pre-ingestive cue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zimmerman et al., 2019</xref>). In addition, considering that the pre-ingestive response is not innate but requires several days of training (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mandelblat-Cerf et al., 2017</xref>), failure to detect pre-ingestive responses in these thirst-related studies might possibly be due to the use of experimental paradigms not optimally designed to assess pre-ingestive responses.</p><p>The MnPO is traditionally considered as a hub that functions as the main input and output region of the LT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">McKinley et al., 2015</xref>). In line with this, we found that SON-projecting MnPO/OVLT <sup>Vglut2</sup> neurons receive inputs from multiple regions outside the LT while inputs to SON-projecting SFO<sup>Vglut2</sup> neurons were confined to the MnPO/OVLT. This result supports hierarchical organization of the LT with the MnPO/OVLT functioning as the main entry point for neurally transmitted afferent information. Systemic osmolality information (from the CVOs [the SFO and OVLT]) and water-related presystemic information (from yet-undefined regions outside the LT) converge on the MnPO/OVLT and are redistributed to AVP neurons and other downstream targets directly, or indirectly via the SFO. Based on our rabies mapping of afferents to SON-projecting MnPO/OVLT<sup>Vglut2</sup> neurons, the following sites could in principle relay water-related presystemic information to the MnPO/OVLT: the VMH, DMH, PVH, and LPBN. The DMH is of particular interest as it is already known to play a role in presystemic regulation of AgRP neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Garfield et al., 2016</xref>). By analogy, it may also contain neurons involved in water-related presystemic regulation of MnPO/OVLT neurons. The LPBN is also of interest in that it is known to relay interoceptive information to forebrain sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Herbert et al., 1990</xref>), and it has been strongly implicated in regulation of water balance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Davern, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gizowski and Bourque, 2018</xref>). Indeed, recent studies identified two groups of thirst-suppressing neurons in the PBN that send direct projections to the MnPO/OVLT and exhibit post-ingestive activation in response to drinking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ryan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kim et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>We found that food-related presystemic regulation is not mediated by the LT. LT neurons do not show food-related presystemic changes in their activity and silencing of LT neurons does not affect food-related presystemic changes in activity of AVP neurons. Inhibition of neurons in the ARC, on the other hand, causes a significant attenuation of food-related presystemic responses suggesting that neurons in this region mediate food-related regulation. Many anatomical and electrophysiological studies have demonstrated that AVP neurons receive direct excitatory and inhibitory projections from the ARC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Iijima and Ogawa, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Saphier and Feldman, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Leng et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ludwig and Leng, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pineda et al., 2016</xref>). This is further supported by our rabies mapping results. Due to technical limitations, however, the ARC neurons responsible for food-related presystemic regulation were not identified. The most widely studied neurons in the ARC, AgRP and POMC neurons, were ruled out, as inhibition of these neurons had no effect on the food-related presystemic response. Considering rapid feeding-induced activation of AVP neurons, it is highly likely that feeding-related presystemic regulation involves glutamatergic neurons in the ARC. Oxytocin receptor-expressing glutamatergic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fenselau et al., 2017</xref>) are a good candidate for mediating food-related presystemic regulation as these neurons are activated by feeding and are capable of inhibiting food intake rapidly when activated. Alternatively, it is possible that a completely novel ARC neuron is involved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Campbell et al., 2017</xref>). The combination of projection- and synaptic connectivity-based gene profiling techniques will facilitate specific identification of ARC neurons mediating food-related presystemic regulation.</p><p>In summary, presystemic regulation of AVP release is mediated by the LT and ARC circuits that, respectively, exclusively relay water- or food-related presystemic signals. The two circuits operate largely independently and relay different repertoire of presystemic signals (water-related pre- and post-ingestive signals by the LT and food-related post-ingestive signals by the ARC), giving rise to the bidirectional and asymmetric nature of AVP neurons’ presystemic responses. Additional anatomically and functionally distinct neural circuits converge on AVP neurons to mediate other aspects of AVP function, such as occurs during hypotension. Convergence and integration of multiple inputs at the level of AVP neurons, the final common pathway for AVP release, provide a neural circuit basis for differential regulation of AVP release by diverse behavioral and physiological stimuli. Identifying and characterizing key neural components of the extended neural circuitry underlying these processes will be an important area for future investigation.</p></sec><sec id="s4"

A pulled glass micropipette (20–40 μm diameter tip) was used for stereotaxic injections of adeno-associated virus (AAV). Virus was injected into the posterior pituitary (100 nl; AP: −3.0 mm; ML: ± 0 mm; DV: –6.0 mm from bregma), SON/PNZ (100 nl/side; AP: −0.65 mm; ML: ± 1.25 mm; DV: –5.4 mm from bregma), MnPO/OVLT (10 nl/depth; AP: +0.25 mm; ML: 0 mm; DV: –4.8, 4.5 mm from bregma), SFO (10 nl; AP: –0.6 mm; ML: 0 mm; DV: –2.6 mm from bregma), PVH (50 nl/side; AP: –0.75 mm; ML: ± 0.3 mm; DV: –4.85 mm from bregma), DMH (50 nl/side; AP: –1.85 mm; ML: ± 0.3 mm; DV: –5.2 mm from bregma), VMH (50 nl/side; AP: –1.6 mm; ML: ± 0.4 mm; DV: –5.5 mm from bregma), or Arcuate (50 nl/side; AP: –1.5 mm; ML: ± 0.25 mm; DV: –5.8 mm from bregma) by an air pressure system using picoliter air puffs through a solenoid valve (Clippard EV 24VDC) pulsed by a Grass S48 stimulator to control injection speed (40 nl/min). The pipette was removed 3 min post-injection followed by wound closure using tissue adhesive (3 M Vetbond). For viral injections into the NTS and VLM, mice were placed into a stereotaxic apparatus with the head angled down at approximately 45°. An incision was made at the level of the cisterna magna, then skin and muscle were retracted to expose the dura mater covering the fourth ventricle. A 28-gauge needle was used to make an incision in the dura and allow access to the NTS and VLM. Virus was then injected into the NTS (10 nl/side; AP: –0.2 mm; ML: ± 0.2 mm; DV: –0.2 mm from obex) VLM (50 nl*2/side; AP: –0.3 and –0.6 mm; ML: ± 1.3 mm; DV: –1.7 mm from obex) as described above. The pipette was removed 3 min post-injection followed by wound closure using absorbable suture for muscle and silk suture for skin. For fiber photometry, an optic fiber (200 µm diameter, NA=0.39, metal ferrule, Thorlabs) was implanted in the MnPO/OVLT, SFO, or SON and secured to the skull with dental cement. Subcutaneous injection of sustained release Meloxicam (4 mg/kg) was provided as postoperative care. The mouse was kept in a warm environment and closely monitored until resuming normal activity.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Brain slice electrophysiology and channelrhodopsin-assisted circuit mapping</title><p>To prepare brain slices for electrophysiological recordings, brains were removed from anesthetized mice and immediately placed in ice-cold cutting solution consisting of (in mM): 72 sucrose, 83 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 1 NaH2PO4, 26 NaHCO3, 22 glucose, 5 MgCl2, 1 CaCl2, oxygenated with 95% O2/5% CO2, measured osmolarity 310–320 mOsm/l. Cutting solution was prepared and used within 72 hr. About 250-μm-thick coronal sections containing the PVH and SON were cut with a vibratome (7000smz-2 Campden Instruments) and incubated in an oxygenated cutting solution at 34°C for 25 min. The SON was located by using the bifurcation of the anterior and middle cerebral arteries on the ventral surface of the brain as a landmark. Slices were transferred to oxygenated aCSF (126 mM NaCl, 21.4 mM NaHCO3, 2.5 mM KCl, 1.2 mM NaH2PO4, 1.2 mM MgCl2, 2.4 mM CaCl2, and 10 mM glucose) and stored in the same solution at room temperature (20–24°C) for at least 60 min prior to recording. A single slice was placed in the recording chamber where it was continuously super-fused at a rate of 3–4 ml per min with oxygenated aCSF. Neurons were visualized with an upright microscope equipped with infrared-differential interference contrast and fluorescence optics. Borosilicate glass microelectrodes (5–7 MΩ) were filled with internal solution. Whole-cell voltage clamp recordings were obtained using Cs-based internal solutions containing either (in mM): 135 CsMeSO3, 10 HEPES, 1 EGTA, 4 MgCl2, 4 Na2-ATP, 0.4 Na2-GTP, and 10 Na2-phosphocreatine (pH 7.3; 295 mOsm) for recording EPSCs; or for recording IPSCs from Vgat neurons expressing ChR2: 140 CsCl, 1 BAPTA, 10 HEPES, 5 MgCl2, 5 Mg-ATP, 0.3 Na2GTP, and 10 lidocaine N-ethyl bromide ([QX-314], pH 7.35, and 290 mOsm). To photostimulate ChR2-positive fibers, an LED light source (473 nm) was used. The blue light was focused on to the back aperture of the microscope objective, producing a wide-field exposure around the recorded cell of 1 mW. The light power at the specimen was measured using an optical power meter PM100D (Thorlabs). The light output is controlled by a programmable pulse stimulator, Master-8 (AMPI Co., Israel), and the pClamp 10.2 software (AXON Instruments). All recordings were made using Multiclamp 700B amplifier, and data was filtered at 2 kHz and digitized at 10 kHz. The photostimulation-evoked EPSC detection protocol consisted of four blue light laser pulses administered 1 s apart during the first 4 s of an 8 s sweep, repeated for a total of 30 sweeps. We attempted to maximize our ability to detect light-evoked currents by biasing our recordings to cell bodies within the densest axon fields. In some experiments, TTX (1 mM) and 4-AP (100 mM) were added to the bath solution to confirm monosynaptic connectivity. All CRACM results presented are from 2 to 3 mice per group. All analysis was conducted off-line in Clampfit 10 and Origin.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Fiber photometry experiments and analysis of photometry data</title><p>All experiments were conducted in the home-cage in freely moving mice. Beginning 3 weeks post-surgery (details above), animals prepared for in vivo fiber photometry experiments (outlined above), were food restricted to 85–90% of initial body weight. Over this 1-week period, mice were acclimated to chow pellets (500 mg, Bio-Serv Dustless Precision Pellets), and to the food bowl and water bowl used in subsequent photometry experiments. Mice were habituated to the paradigm for at least 5 days prior to the first recording day. For experiments with hM4Di, saline or CNO (1 mg/kg) was injected 20 min prior to the experiment. In vivo fiber photometry was conducted as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mandelblat-Cerf et al., 2017</xref>). A fiber optic cable (1 m long, metal ferrule, 400 µm diameter; Doric Lenses) was attached to the implanted optic cannula with zirconia sleeves (Doric Lenses). Laser light (473 nm) was focused on the opposite end of the fiber optic cable to titrate the light intensity entering the brain to 0.1–0.2 mW. Emitted light was passed through a dichroic mirror (Di02-R488-25×36, Semrock) and GFP emission filter (FF03-525/50-25, Semrock), before being focused onto a sensitive photodetector (Newport part #2151). The GCaMP6 signal was passed through a low-pass filter (50 Hz), and digitized at 1 kHz using a National Instruments data acquisition card and MATLAB software.</p><p>The recorded data was exported and then imported into MATLAB for analysis. Fluorescent traces were down-sampled to 1 Hz. We calculated the fractional change in GCaMP6s fluorescence according to the following equation: ΔF/F=(F–F0)/F0, where F is fluorescence measurement and F0 is the mean fluorescence in the 30 s prior to food/water bowl presentation or feeding onset or 2 or 3 min prior to drug injection. In some experiments, to facilitate the comparison across different groups, we normalized the responses of each mouse. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4f</xref>, normalization was performed by (ΔF/F)/F<sub>totalΔF</sub>, where F<sub>totalΔF</sub> was maximum average change over the entire recording period. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>, normalization was performed by (ΔF/F)/c, where c was maximum average response of control trials within 5 min of water bowl placement or feeding onset.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Drinking behavior</title><p>Drinking was assessed by modified Drinking Event Monitor cages (Lickometer cages; Columbus Instruments). Mice were placed into these “lickometer” cages where licks on each bottle sipper tube were detected by electrical conductivity and recorded by a computer counter interface.

Importantly, the authors show that the drinking and feeding related effects on VP neural activity originate from distinct anatomical sites thus laying the groundwork for mapping out the rest of the neural circuit responsible for anticipatory regulation of thirst.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Neural Basis for Regulation of Vasopressin Secretion by Anticipated Disturbances in Osmolality&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Richard D Palmiter as Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Catherine Dulac as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Zachary Knight, PhD (Reviewer #2); Yuki Oka (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. It is not clearly reported to what extent the chemogenetic silencing of the MnPO/OVLT in the mice used in Figure 2 and 5 reduces the amount of water consumed and how this relates to the dynamics in each animal/trial. This is confounding in two ways. Given that the silencing does not fully block drinking, this implies that the MnPO/OVLT silencing is incomplete (based on Augustine 2018), and thus the negative photometry result in Figure 5 is hard to interpret. Conversely, if silencing reduces drinking partially, which seems likely, then this behavioral change could account for the reduced presystemic inhibition of AVP neurons. It is hard to see how the direct effect of MnPO on AVP neural dynamics could be separated from its effects on behavior in this experiment.</p><p>2. MnPO neurons are heterogeneous in their dynamics, especially the MnPO-GABA neurons, and for this reason ruling out a possible mechanism based on a photometry trace is challenging. For example, compare the interpretation of the photometry recordings of MnPO-Glp1r neurons in (Augustine, 2018) with the results of single cell imaging of the same neurons in (Zimmerman, 2019). -In Figure 2, DREADD was used to suppress the activity of the LT. However, the virus construct is a general promoter, and no data are provided to demonstrate that CNO/DREADD works in this system or cells.

However, for the following reasons, we do not believe it is likely that reduced presystemic suppression of AVP neurons is mainly driven by behavioral changes. First, pre-ingestive, cue-induced suppression observed prior to any drinking behavior is completely blocked by silencing of MnPO/OVLT<sup>Vgat</sup> neurons (Figure 5). Second, MnPO/OVLT neurons provide direct excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs to AVP neurons with high probability connections (~100% and ~50%, respectively, Figure 1). Finally, SON-projecting, putative AVP-regulating MnPO/OVLT neurons show water-related presystemic responses that resemble those seen in AVP neurons (Figure 3). Altogether, these factors strongly support the notion that the reduced presystemic suppression of AVP neurons upon silencing of MnPO/OVLT input is primarily caused by direct reduction of the influence of MnPO/OVLT input onto AVP neurons.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

As now illustrated in Figure 5, effects of silencing excitatory (MnPO/OVLT<sup>Vglut2</sup>) and inhibitory (MnPO/OVLT<sup>Vgat</sup>) neurons were strikingly different. Silencing of MnPO/OVLT<sup>Vglut2</sup> neurons caused an overall decrease in the presystemic response of SON<sup>AVP</sup> neurons whereas silencing of MnPO/OVLT<sup>Vgat</sup> neurons caused a very specific attenuation of pre-ingestive, cue-induced response. These results are consistent with our data in Figure 4 where we demonstrate that MnPO/OVLT<sup>Vglut2</sup> neurons show both pre- and post-ingestive responses and MnPO/OVLT<sup>Vgat</sup> neurons show only a pre-ingestive response.</p><p>These results directly validate our previous findings and significantly strengthen the conclusion of our paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4.

A main obstacle in targeting glutamatergic ARC population is that we currently do not have a specific genetic marker for these neurons. We could not use Oxtr-cre mice that were used in our original study because we saw cre expression around the SON that prevented us from using Oxtr-cre;AVP-cre mice to selectively target ARC Oxtr and AVP neurons in the same animal. We also attempted using Vglut2-flp;AVP-cre mice but achieving restricted hM4Di expression in the ARC with viral injection was extremely challenging and we decided that the experiment is too inefficient to be completed “in a timely manner”.</p><p>As we now present in Figure 7—figure supplement 4, DMH/VMH/ARC silencing did not alter feeding behavior. Therefore, reduced feeding-related presystemic response in AVP neurons are not indirectly caused by slower or less food consumption.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Because of the complexity of this circuitry, a diagram of all the circuitry that they deduce between MnPO/OVLT, SFO and AVP-expressing SON + PVH neurons would be useful for readers unfamiliar with this system.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for suggesting this.
