Those genes exhibiting the largest difference in glucose response were assessed for association with diabetic retinopathy in a genome-wide association study meta-analysis. Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) of the glucose response genes were tested for association with diabetic retinopathy. We detected an enrichment of the eQTLs from the glucose response genes among small association p-values and identified folliculin (<italic>FLCN</italic>) as a susceptibility gene for diabetic retinopathy. Expression of <italic>FLCN</italic> in response to glucose was greater in individuals with diabetic retinopathy. Independent cohorts of individuals with diabetes revealed an association of <italic>FLCN</italic> eQTLs with diabetic retinopathy. Mendelian randomization confirmed a direct positive effect of increased <italic>FLCN</italic> expression on retinopathy. Integrating genetic association with gene expression implicated <italic>FLCN</italic> as a disease gene for diabetic retinopathy.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>One of the side effects of diabetes is loss of vision from diabetic retinopathy, which is caused by injury to the light sensing tissue in the eye, the retina. Almost all individuals with diabetes develop diabetic retinopathy to some extent, and it is the leading cause of irreversible vision loss in working-age adults in the United States. How long a person has been living with diabetes, the extent of increased blood sugars and genetics all contribute to the risk and severity of diabetic retinopathy. Unfortunately, virtually no genes associated with diabetic retinopathy have yet been identified.</p><p>When a gene is activated, it produces messenger molecules known as mRNA that are used by cells as instructions to produce proteins. The analysis of mRNA molecules, as well as genes themselves, can reveal the role of certain genes in disease. The studies of all genes and their associated mRNAs are respectively called genomics and transcriptomics. Genomics reveals what genes are present, while transcriptomics shows how active genes are in different cells.</p><p>Skol et al. developed methods to study genomics and transcriptomics together to help discover genes that cause diabetic retinopathy. Genes involved in how cells respond to high blood sugar were first identified using cells grown in the lab. By comparing the activity of these genes in people with and without retinopathy the study identified genes associated with an increased risk of retinopathy in diabetes. In people with retinopathy, the activity of the folliculin gene (FLCN) increased more in response to high blood sugar. This was further verified with independent groups of people and using computer models to estimate the effect of different versions of the folliculin gene.</p><p>The methods used here could be applied to understand complex genetics in other diseases. The results provide new understanding of the effects of diabetes. They may also help in the development of new treatments for diabetic retinopathy, which are likely to improve on the current approach of using laser surgery or injections into the eye.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>LCLs</kwd><kwd>folliculin</kwd><kwd>diabetic retinopathy</kwd><kwd>eQTL</kwd><kwd>mendelian randomization</kwd><kwd>gene expression</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000053</institution-id><institution>National Eye Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01EY023644</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Grassi</surname><given-names>Michael A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000053</institution-id><institution>National Eye Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ZIAEY000546</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Swaroop</surname><given-names>Anand</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Integrating gene expression with genetic association data provided insights into the functional relevance of genetic risk for a complex disease, thus implicating folliculin as a putative diabetic retinopathy susceptibility gene.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Almost all individuals with diabetes will develop some form of diabetic retinopathy over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">National Diabetes Fact Sheet, 2011</xref>). In the United States diabetic retinopathy is the most frequent cause of blindness among working age individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2018</xref>). Interindividual variation contributes significantly to susceptibility of the severe manifestations of diabetic retinopathy, which results in vision impairment. Epidemiological studies suggest that phenotypic variation is influenced by two primary risk factors: the duration of diabetes and an individualâs level of glycemia (HbA1c) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">DCCT/EDIC Research Group et al., 2017</xref>). However, these two factors do not completely explain an individualâs risk for developing diabetic retinopathy. For instance, a common anecdotal clinical experience is the comparison of patients with similar durations of diabetes and similar levels of glycemic control who have tremendously disparate clinical outcomes for diabetic retinopathy. Moreover, some individuals with diabetes develop very minimal retinopathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sun et al., 2011</xref>), whereas others clearly seem to have a predisposition for severe retinopathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gao et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Together, these observations in conjunction with the high concordance of diabetic retinopathy between family members support an underlying genetic mechanism. Familial aggregation and twin studies estimate that genetic factors account for 25â50% of an individualâs risk of developing severe diabetic retinopathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arar et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hietala et al., 2008</xref>). Unfortunately, little is known about the genetic architecture that contributes to susceptibility for diabetic retinopathy. Genetic studies suggest that it is a highly polygenic trait influenced by multiple genetic variants of small effect. Our group and others have performed genome-wide association studies to better delineate the molecular factors that predispose to diabetic retinopathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Grassi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Grassi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pollack et al., 2019</xref>). However, these studies have had limited success, likely due to insufficient study sample sizes and the phenotypic heterogeneity of diabetic retinopathy.</p><p>Notably, like other complex disease traits including age-related macular degeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fritsche et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fritsche et al., 2016</xref>), a majority of genetic variants nominally associated with diabetic retinopathy are located in intronic or inter-genic regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Risch and Merikangas, 1996</xref>). Most of these variants appear to play critically important functional roles in regulating gene expression. In fact, several of the top associated SNPs identified in our meta-GWAS of diabetic retinopathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Grassi et al., 2011</xref>) are present in DNase hypersensitivity sites and affect gene expression levels by altering the allelic chromatin state or the binding sites of transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Maurano et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>The observation that disease-associated genetic loci often influence gene expression levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gamazon et al., 2018</xref>) led us to postulate that integrating gene expression with genetic association would be a powerful approach to identify susceptibility genes for diabetic retinopathy. We hypothesized that cell lines derived from individuals with diabetes with and without retinopathy could be used to uncover genetic variation that explain individual differences in the response to diabetes. Culturing two sets of cell lines under controlled, identical conditions from individuals with diabetes who did and those who did not develop retinopathy could unmask molecular differences in how these groups respond to glucose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Grassi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Grassi et al., 2014</xref>). We presumed that a portion of those differences would have a genetic basis.</p><p>In this article, we identify genes whose expression responds differently to glucose in cells derived from T1D individuals with and without diabetic retinopathy. We show that one of these genes, folliculin (<italic>FLCN)</italic>, is causally implicated in diabetic retinopathy based on results from genetic association testing and Mendelian randomization.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Individuals with retinopathy (PDR) show differences in diabetes duration and level of glycemia compared to individuals without retinopathy (nDR)</title><p>Matched DCCT/EDIC participants (for age, sex, treatment group, cohort, and diabetes duration) from whom the gene expression profiling was obtained are detailed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1a</xref>.

An overview of our approach is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>. First, we selected the top 103 genes (p&lt;0.01) that showed the largest difference in gene expression response to glucose between individuals with diabetes with and without retinopathy. We next identified all of the significant expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) for these genes in GTEx (version 7) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">GTEx Consortium, 2015</xref>). In total, we found 7253 unique eQTL SNPs (hereafter referred to as eSNPs) in at least one of the 48 tissues investigated by GTEx. Differential response genes are more likely to harbor eSNPs, and hence be eGenes, compared to the genome-wide average (p=2.0Ã10<sup>â16</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1</xref>). This suggests that differential response genes are more likely to be genetically regulated and may contribute to interindividual differences in the development of diabetic retinopathy. To test if the eSNPs for the 103 differential response genes were more associated with diabetic retinopathy than expected, we evaluated the association between the 7253 differential response gene eSNPs and diabetic retinopathy using our published GWAS of diabetic retinopathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Grassi et al., 2011</xref>). The 7253 eSNPs from the differential response genes are enriched for association with diabetic retinopathy (FDRÂ &lt;Â 0.05) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). To further assess the significance of this enrichment, we performed permutation testing of eSNPs from random sets of 103 genes which demonstrated that less than 1% contained the same proportion of similarly skewed GWAS p-values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2</xref>). The eSNPs for differential response genes were enriched among diabetic retinopathy meta-GWAS p-values relative to all eSNPs (p=0.0012) and all SNPs (p=0.0023) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>).

Variations in the cellular response to glucose at a molecular level have not been wellÂ characterized between cell types, and to an even lesser degree between individuals. In prior work, we characterized robust, repeatable interindividual differences in transcriptional response to glucose in LCLs of individuals with diabetic retinopathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Grassi et al., 2016</xref>). As anÂ LCLÂ generated from each individual is genetically unique, it follows that the gene expression response to glucose between individuals should be phenotypically heterogeneous and that a portion of the interindividual variability will be genetically determined. We hypothesized that interindividual variation in the cellular response to glucose may reveal clues to the genetic basis of diabetic retinopathy, thereby providing insights into its predisposition.</p><p>We demonstrated that different individual-derived cell lines treated under identical culture conditions reveal an individual-specific transcriptional response to glucose and this signal far exceeds accompanying experimental noise. Transformation and multiple freeze/thaw passages do not homogenize the individualized response to HG-induced gene expression in LCLs. Analyzing the individual glucose-stimulated transcriptional response revealed several insights into the pathophysiology of the diabetic state and how it relates to the development of retinopathy. For instance, TXNIP was identified as the top differential response gene to glucose in all individuals (RG<sub>all</sub>). TXNIP is a key marker of oxidative stress. It is upregulated in the diabetic retina where it induces Muller cell activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Devi et al., 2017</xref>). HGÂ treatment has been shown to increase <italic>TXNIP</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2016</xref>). <italic>TXNIP</italic> is a glucose sensor whose expression has been strongly associated with both hyperglycemia and diabetic complications. Specifically, the <italic>TXNIP</italic> locus was differentially methylated in the primary leukocytes of EDIC cases and controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2016</xref>). A key mechanism by which cells respond to stress is through changes in genome configuration. Conformational alterations in DNA packaging influence the accessibility of DNA for transcription. Structural changes in DNA conformation facilitate cellular adaptation and response to stimuli which can enable transcriptional changes. The GSEA showed that the cellular response to chronic glucose stress involves alterations in DNA accessibility which facilitates the gene expression response to this environmental stimulus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Smith and Workman, 2012</xref>). The transcriptional response to glucose in part manifests as diminished immune responsiveness, a well-characterized feature of diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Shanmugam et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mowat and Baum, 1971</xref>).</p><p>Further, we considered that the genetic component of an individualâs response to glucose may influence their susceptibility to diabetic complications like retinopathy. Cell lines from individuals with diabetes with and without retinopathy reveal differences in the response to glucose at a molecular level. In addition, not only were some of these differential response genes biologically relevant to diabetic retinopathy as exemplified by <italic>IL1B</italic> and <italic>PDGF</italic>, but also many had a genetic basis for their differential response. By integrating the gene expression findings with GWAS data, we implicated <italic>FLCN</italic> as a putative disease gene in diabetic retinopathy. Mendelian randomization provided evidence that genetic variation affects diabetic retinopathy through alterations in <italic>FLCN</italic> expression thereby suggesting that FLCN expression is a mediator of diabetic retinopathy. <italic>FLCN</italic> is a biologically plausible diabetic retinopathy disease gene since its expression is present in both neuronal and vascular cells of the retina. Current evidence suggests that FLCN is a negative regulator of AMPK which helps to modulate the energy sensing ability of AMPK and plays a role in responding to cellular stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hasumi et al., 2012</xref>). AMPK plays an important role in providing resistance to cellular stresses by regulating autophagy and cellular bioenergetics to avoid apoptosis. Loss of <italic>FLCN</italic> results in constitutive activation of AMPK. Higher levels of FLCN would suggest less cellular capacity to deal with stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Possik et al., 2014</xref>). Interestingly, the protective effect of agents such as metformin and fenofibrate on diabetic retinopathy might be mediated through AMPK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kim et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Joe et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Our study design had several advantages over prior approaches aimed at revealing the genetic basis of diabetic retinopathy. First, we utilized white blood cells which are readily accessible from the peripheral circulation of human patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Epidemiology of Diabetes Interventions and Complications (EDIC) Research Group, 1999</xref>) and can reveal differential molecular characteristics depending on the stage of diabetic retinopathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tang and Kern, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gubitosi-Klug et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kern, 2007</xref>). LCLs are derived from white blood cells making them a relevant cellular population to study for diabetic retinopathy. LCLs have been shown to be a powerful model system for functional genetic studies in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tang and Kern, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kern, 2007</xref>). Second, an LCL was generated for every individual enrolled in the landmark DCCT/EDIC study. DCCT/EDIC is the best-characterized prospective interventional cohort ever created to follow systemic complications of long-standing diabetes. DCCT/EDIC allows for detailed stratification of individuals, each of whom has had extensive prospective clinical phenotyping. Third, glucose was employed to elicit a provocative response in LCLs. By focusing on a secondary sequela of diabetes like retinopathy, the cellular response to glucose stimulation through transcription became a meaningful and directly relevant reflection of the stress each cell in the body encounters from diabetes. Insights into glucose-stimulated gene expression in LCLs have broad applicability to multiple tissues of interest for diabetic complications (even in the retina as we have shown) due to significant evidence supporting a shared framework for gene regulation among tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">GTEx Consortium, 2015</xref>). Finally, disease-associated eQTL provide functional insights into the pathogenesis of a condition. We show that altering the levels of <italic>FLCN</italic> expression impacts risk of diabetic retinopathy. Aggregating independent eQTLs for the same gene (that are not in high linkage disequilibrium) revealed an enriched association that may otherwise have been missed by a conventional GWAS approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wu et al., 2018b</xref>). Treating the associated eQTL as an instrumental variable, Mendelian randomization supported the potential causality of <italic>FLCN</italic> in the pathogenesis of the disease. Inherently, this approach yielded all three Mâs of target modulation: mechanism, magnitude, and markers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Plenge, 2019</xref>).</p><p>The present work had inherent limitations. First, LCLs are not primary cells but rather a transformed cell line. The Multiple Tissue Human Expression Resource (MuTHER) LCL study revealed a large impact of common environmental exposure, stemming from shared sample handling, on gene expression in twin LCLs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wright et al., 2014</xref>). The significant correlation of these extrinsic factors on LCL gene expression emphasizes the importance of randomization and biological replicates which we implemented in this study. Moreover, as a cell line, heterogeneous genomic alterations have been identified in lymphoblastoid cells that increase with passaging, thereby raising the concern that this can lead to variability in their transcriptome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ben-David et al., 2018</xref>). Importantly, the EDIC cell lines employed in this study were only passaged once previously. Additionally, genomic changes have only a minor effect on genotypic frequencies with a 99.63% genotype concordance between lymphoblastoid cells and their parent leukocytes. Mendelian error rates in levels of heterozygosity are not significantly different between LCLs and their primary B-lymphocyte cells of origin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">McCarthy et al., 2016</xref>). Second, it is not possible to delineate cause from effect in gene expression studies. Gene expression changes may be causal, epiphenomena, or due to reverse causality (the disease causing the gene expression changes rather than the other way around). In this study, by integrating genetic analyses with gene expression and recognizing that variation in the underlying genome precedes disease onset and can therefore be considered an instrumental variable, we identified through Mendelian randomization potentially causal gene expression changes in <italic>FLCN</italic> that act as a mediator for retinopathy thereby avoiding the trap of reverse causality. Finally, eQTL found in LCLs may not be relevant to diabetic retinopathy. As noted previously we found 43% of retina eQTL are shared with LCLs. We demonstrated that independent <italic>FLCN</italic> eQTLs found both in the retina and GTEx tissues showed an enriched association with diabetic retinopathy, a finding that was replicated in a large independent cohort from the UKBB. For complex trait associations in general and for those specifically in the retina, eQTL that are shared between tissues explain a greater proportion of associations than tissue-specific eQTL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gamazon et al., 2018</xref>). For instance, shared tissue eQTL are enriched among genetic associations with age-related macular degeneration, another common retinal disease, despite the high tissue specificity of the disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ratnapriya et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Unlu et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>In summary, integration of gene expression from a relevant cellular model with genetic association data provided insights into the functional relevance of genetic risk for a complex disease. Using disease-associated differential gene and eQTL-based genome-wide association testing, we identified possible causal genetic pathways for diabetic retinopathy. Specifically, our studies implicated <italic>FLCN</italic> as a putative diabetic retinopathy susceptibility gene. Future work that incorporates more extensive molecular profiling of the cellular response to glucose in conjunction with a greater number of cell lines may yield further insights into the underlying genetic basis of diabetic retinopathy.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Overview</title><p>In this study we profiled the transcriptomes of cell lines derived from 22 individuals (seven individuals with no diabetes [nDM], eight with T1D with PDR, and seven with T1D with no retinopathy [nDR]) utilizing gene expression microarrays to characterize the transcriptional response to glucose.

Quality control excluded individuals who were outliers based on relatedness, exhibited an excess of missing genotype calls, had more heterozygosity than expected, or had sex chromosome aneuploidy. A total of 337,147 individuals were available for analysis. Case participants were defined as those who answered âyesâ to questionnaire data eyesight field 6148 âDiabetes related eye diseaseâ (nÂ =Â 2332). Our prior work validated the utility of self-report for the presence of severe diabetic retinopathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Grassi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Grassi et al., 2009</xref>). Control participants were defined as those who answered âyesâ to data field 2443 âDiabetes diagnosed by doctorâ (nÂ =Â 14,680), excluding case participants. SNPs were excluded according to the following: minor allele frequencyÂ &lt;0.004; missing rateÂ &gt;0.015; HWE p&lt;1Ã10<sup>â10</sup>; INFO scoreÂ &lt;0.8. We performed logistic regression as implemented in Plink2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chang et al., 2015</xref>) on this set of cases and controls. The logistic regression, including the following covariates: first 10 genotype-based principal components, chromosomal sex (as defined by XX, XY status), age, type of diabetes, HbA1c, and genotyping array type.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Mendelian randomization</title><p>To explore a possible causal effect of increased <italic>FLCN</italic> expression on diabetic retinopathy, we employed Mendelian randomization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Davies et al., 2019</xref>). Effects were estimated with summary data-based Mendelian randomization analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zhu et al., 2016</xref>) (SMR). We estimated the effect of increasing levels of <italic>FLCN</italic> expression on diabetic retinopathy in the UKBB GWAS for diabetic retinopathy (described above) utilizing 272 SNPs that were significant cis-eSNPs (FDRÂ â¤Â 0.05) for <italic>FLCN</italic> in retina and also in at least 20 GTEx tissues. A total of 246 SNPs remained after removing those SNPs or their proxies (r<sup>2</sup>Â &gt;Â 0.8) not genotyped in the UKBB. For each individual, the exposure was based on the genetically predicted gene expression of <italic>FLCN</italic> in retina and the outcome was the likelihood of having diabetic retinopathy. Heterogeneity in dependent instruments (HEIDI) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zhu et al., 2016</xref>) was used to investigate the possibility of confounding bias from horizontal pleiotropy with 14 independent (r<sup>2</sup>Â &lt;Â 0.2) <italic>FLCN</italic> eQTLs. As multiple independent (r<sup>2</sup>Â &lt;Â 0.2, nÂ =Â 14) <italic>FLCN</italic> eQTLs exist, we also employed multi-SNP Mendelian randomization to assess for an aggregated effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wu et al., 2018a</xref>) of the eQTLs on diabetic retinopathy mediated through <italic>FLCN</italic> expression.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>FLCN localization in human donor eye retina</title><p>A whole eye from a 69-year-old Caucasian female post-mortem donor without diabetes was obtained from National Disease Research Interchange (NDRI). Findings were replicated in an additional five post-mortem donors without diabetes from the NDRI. The eye was cut in half in a horizontal plane, and each half was placed in an individual cassette. Samples were processed on ASP300 S automated tissue processor (Leica Biosystems) using a standard overnight processing protocol and embedded into paraffin blocks. Tissue was sectioned at 5 Âµm, and sections were de-paraffinized and stained on BOND RX autostainer (Leica Biosystems) following a preset protocol. In brief, sections were subjected to EDTA-based (BOND ER2 solution, pH9) antigen retrieval for 40 min at 100Â°C, washed, and incubated with protein block (Background Sniper, Biocare Medical, BS966) for 30 min at room temperature. For immunofluorescence (IF), sequential staining with rabbit polyclonal anti-FLCN antibody (1:50, Abcam #ab93196) and mouse monoclonal anti-CD31 antibody (1:50, DAKO, M0823) was conducted using goat-anti-rabbit Alexa-488 and goat-anti-mouse Alexa-555 secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes) for detection. DAPI (Invitrogen, #D3571) was used to stain nuclei. The slides were mounted with ProLong Diamond Antifade mounting media (ThermoFisher, #P36961). Images were taken at 20Ã magnification on Vectra three multispectral imaging system (Akoya Biosciences). A spectral library acquired from mono stains for each fluorophore (Alexa-488, Alexa-594), DAPI, and human retina background fluorescence slide was used to spectrally unmix images in InForm software (Akoya Biosciences) for visualization of each color.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This research has been conducted using the UK Biobank Resource under Application Number 44316.Â We acknowledge the guidance and assistance provided by the members of the DCCT/EDIC committee at the time of this publication.

complications of diabetes in humans. The approach used here was considered innovative. Rather than using traditional genetic approaches, such as genome wide association, the examination of glucose induced changes in gene expression in cell lines from people with type 1 diabetes either with or without retinopathy provided new insights into the disease. The identification of SNPs associated with such changes â so called eQTLs â followed by validation in independent human cohorts took the study one step beyond many others in the field. The further confirmation of <italic>FLCN</italic> as a mediator of diabetic retinopathy using Mendelian Randomization provided further confidence in the method. This study was considered to provide advances in our understanding of the mechanisms that lead to diabetic retinopathy in humans.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Mendelian randomization identifies folliculin expression as a mediator of diabetic retinopathy.&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by David James as the Senior and Reviewing Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As the editors have judged that your manuscript is of interest, but as described below that additional experiments are required before it is published, we would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>While your study was well performed, several rather serious issues were raised by the reviewers as detailed below and all of these points need to be addressed prior to further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Also one reviewer noted that the title only focused on &quot;Mendelian randomization&quot;, which is an overstatement of what is essentially only a gene expression study. In addition stating that RM &quot; identifies folliculin expression as a mediator of diabetic retinopathy&quot; is also an overstatement as the mediator effect is not shown. So it will be important to reword the title if you decide to undertake a substantial revision.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This study investigates gene expression profiling related to diabetic retinopathy using several strategies including differential gene expression associated with response to glucose by comparing lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) between cases (with retinopathy) and controls (without retinopathy) with type 1 diabetes. The study identified significant eQTLs from gene expression analysis and public gene expression databases and then tested significant eSNPs by the meta-analysis GWAS using independent cohorts. The expression of one gene, <italic>FLCN</italic>, to be a mediator of diabetic retinopathy by the Mendelian Randomization method was confirmed.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The whole paper and its conclusions are based on a very small number of samples and not supported by strong experimental data about causality. Overall, the small group of studied subjects present huge differences in duration of diabetes and glucose control the 2 main factors of retinopathy. Thus, it is unclear how to differentiate the biological effects of long term high glucose and their impact on retinopathy.</p><p>2) Based on the transcriptome analysis the conclusion &quot;This finding suggests that chronic glucose exposure depresses cellular immune responsiveness and may explain in part the increased risk of infection found in patients with diabetes&quot; is not based on evidence as authors selected transcripts of their choice and also causality is not shown.</p><p>&quot;Individuals with diabetic retinopathy exhibit a differential transcriptional response to glucose&quot;. Note that the level of association shown (especially for PDGF) is somewhat marginal.</p><p>3) &quot;Genes with differential response to glucose are implicated in the pathogenesis of diabetic retinopathy.&quot; This part is the most intriguing and original but it is based on expression in many tissues and thus the title is also overstated: it shows some kind of association but certainly not that the 103 genes &quot;are implicated&quot; in retinopathy.</p><p>4) &quot;Folliculin (<italic>FLCN</italic>) is a putative diabetic retinopathy disease gene&quot; this part is also interesting (and includes some in vivo experiments) but the original whole genome gene expression study did not detect FLNC as differentially expressed in the cell blood of the patients with retinopathy. Can the authors comment on this? One of the reviewers also mentioned that no SNPs near <italic>FLCN</italic> have been identified in diabetes (or complications) GWAS and this is somewhat worrying.</p><p>5) It is confusing that the authors used different selection criteria for gene identifications. In Results (subsection âIndividuals with diabetic retinopathy exhibit a differential transcriptional response to glucoseâ), they identified 19 differentially response genes (P &lt;0.05) between retinopathy cases and controls. However, they have selected the top 103 genes with P&lt;0.01 (Results, subsection âGenes with differential response to glucose are implicated in the pathogenesis of diabetic retinopathyâ) for further investigations. What is the gap between these two gene sets selection? I assume that the <italic>FLCN</italic> gene is in the top 103 gene set but not in the above 19 gene set. Explanations are needed for including specific genes for different analysis purposes.</p><p>6) The authors selected LCLs from individuals of 3 groups, non-diabetes (nDM), type 1 diabetes without retinopathy (nDR) and type 1 diabetes with proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR). The benefits of utilizing nDM samples in the analysis was not clear. Although both gene expression and GSEA methods were conducted, the results were not relevant to diabetic retinopathy. What is the purpose of including these samples? Similarly, it is not clear what the purpose of using the gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was because it seems that the authors performed most analyses to identify genetic components by gene-based or SNP-based methods in the manuscript.</p><p>7) The authors tested gene expression profile and associations using data from type 1 diabetic retinopathy. However, for the confirmation with UK BioBank (UKBB) data, they included all samples with both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Did you perform the analysis stratified by the type of diabetes? Do you have any explanations of possible differences?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.59980.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The whole paper and its conclusions are based on a very small number of samples and not supported by strong experimental data about causality.</p></disp-quote><p>The gene expression analyses conducted in our work were performed for the purposes of discovery and hypothesis generation, which were then to be subsequently validated in the genomic studies. While we agree with the reviewerâs observation that the transcriptomic studies were conducted in a small group of individuals, it is important to note that the conclusions of the manuscript are not based on the gene expression findings themselves, but rather on the genomic analyses which incorporated close to twenty thousand individuals from three independent cohorts.</p><p>Genetics offers an excellent way to differentiate the biologic effects of long-term high glucose and its impact on retinopathy thereby disentangling causality, epiphenomenon and reverse causality (Pearl, J, Cambridge University Press, 2009; Davies et al., 2019). Recognizing that variation in the underlying genome precedes disease onset and can therefore be considered an instrumental variable, we integrated genetic analyses with gene expression and identified, through Mendelian randomization, potentially causal gene expression changes for retinopathy that avoid potential confounding factors such as duration of diabetes and level of glycemia.</p><p>Mendelian randomization provides support for causality in this manuscript. We agree with the reviewerâs point that further corroborating functional evidence from the standpoint of molecular and cell biological assays in vitro and in vivo is lacking. We have changed the language throughout the manuscript to reflect this point. We have also amended the title accordingly to âIntegration of genomics and transcriptomics predicts diabetic retinopathy susceptibility genesâ.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Overall, the small group of studied subjects present huge differences in duration of diabetes and glucose control the 2 main factors of retinopathy. Thus, it is unclear how to differentiate the biological effects of long term high glucose and their impact on retinopathy.</p></disp-quote><p>As expected, differences existed between the cases and controls used in the gene expression studies in the primary risk factors for the development of complications including the level of glycemia and duration of diabetes. As the reviewer notes, it would be unclear how to distinguish fundamentally the role of any identified gene expression differences in this situation as being potentially causal for the development of retinopathy as opposed to purely being an epiphenomenon or, potentially worse, a change that is due to reverse causality from the disease itself (e.g. elevated HbA1c on the gene expression profile). Therein, in our opinion, lies a major strength of this paper through its incorporation of a completely independent, orthogonal approach of genomic analysis. By itself, the gene expression study provides only an association which could be significantly confounded or biased from uncontrolled covariates. The strength of genetic analysis in this setting is that a DNA nucleotide and its association to a disease cannot be confounded by duration of diabetes or the level of glycemia. While gene expression can be altered by both of these covariates, the genome sequence cannot.</p><p>To control for potential confounding, a paired analysis compared gene expression between individuals with and without retinopathy who were matched based on age, sex, treatment group, cohort and diabetes duration. Due to the dominant role in the development of retinopathy played by glycemia, we were not able to match individuals between the two groups based on this covariate. The genetic analyses did however account for differences in level of glycemia by controlling for HbA1c. Likewise, given the key role that duration of diabetes plays in the development of retinopathy, this factor also was not able to be completely controlled through matching between the two groups for the gene expression experiments.</p><p>In response to the reviewerâs comment, we revised the text of the manuscript further emphasizing (particularly in the Materials and methods and the Results sections) the use of a paired study design with individuals in the gene expression studies matched for age, sex, treatment group cohort, and diabetes duration. For example, we specifically made the following revisions to the manuscript text:</p><p>a) We added the following to the description of matching in the âCell Linesâ subsection of the Materials and methods: âFor the seven pairs matched on duration: 4 pairs were matched by duration quartiles (baseline duration 0-4 years, 4-8 years, 8-12 years, or 12-15 years) and 3 pairs were matched by duration halves (&lt;8 years vs. &gt;=8 years). Matching by age was done similarly to duration: four pairs by quartile (&lt;21 years, 21-25 years, 26-31 years, &gt;=31 years) and the remaining four by halves (&lt;26 years vs. &gt;=26 years).â</p><p>b) We revised the sentence âDifferential expression is described using fold change (FC) while differential response reflects fold change (FC) differences between groupsâ to âDifferential response reflects fold change (FC) differences between matched individuals in the two groups in their paired response to glucoseâ.</p><p>c) We have changed the sentence âAs anticipated, notable differences were observed between individuals with and without retinopathy (PDR vs. nDR) for duration of diabetes (53 +/- 43.4 months vs. 27 +/- 13.4 months) and mean HbA1c (9.71 +/- 2.37 vs. 7.62 +/- 1.07), respectively, given their significant impact on retinopathyâ to âAs anticipated, notable differences were observed between individuals with and without retinopathy (PDR vs. nDR) for mean duration of diabetes (53 Â±43.4 months vs. 27 Â± 13.4 months) as it was also not possible to completely match participant pairs for this covariate or for level of glycemia (HbA1c), mean HbA1c (9.71 Â± 2.37 vs. 7.62 Â± 1.07) given their significant impact on retinopathyâ.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Based on the transcriptome analysis the conclusion &quot;This finding suggests that chronic glucose exposure depresses cellular immune responsiveness and may explain in part the increased risk of infection found in patients with diabetes&quot; is not based on evidence as authors selected transcripts of their choice and also causality is not shown.</p><p>&quot;Individuals with diabetic retinopathy exhibit a differential transcriptional response to glucose&quot;. Note that the level of association shown (especially for PDGF) is somewhat marginal.</p></disp-quote><p>As noted by the reviewer, the transcriptome analysis is underpowered. We agree with the reviewer that the underpowered nature of the transcriptional analyses are insufficient in themselves, given the marginal levels of significance, to suggest more than a limited association, which is why we employed a completely independent orthogonal approach of genomic analysis to validate the gene expression findings. We have accordingly amended the manuscript so as to not overstate the significance of the gene expression findings:</p><p>We have changed the sentence âConversely, genes that modulate the cellular response to infection were considerably down-regulated (type 1 Interferon, FDR &lt; 0.0001; gamma Interferon, FDR &lt; 0.0001; leukocyte chemotaxis genes, FDR &lt; 0.0001) and may explain in part the increased risk of infection found in patients with diabetesâ¦â to âConversely, genes that modulate the cellular response to infection were considerably down-regulated (type 1 Interferon, FDR &lt; 0.0001; gamma Interferon, FDR &lt; 0.0001; leukocyte chemotaxis genes, FDR &lt; 0.0001) potentially supporting earlier work that chronic glucose exposure depresses cellular immune responsivenessâ.</p><p>The goal of the gene expression analysis was not to demonstrate causality, but rather as a cross-check to support the biological plausibility of the response to glucose gene expression assay. All validation was done through the genomic analyses. The preliminary gene expression studies were purely hypothesis-generating. Prior to undertaking the genomic analyses, we investigated whether assessing the gene expression response to glucose in lymphoblastoid cell lines provided biologically plausible findings. Assessment for biological plausibility was conducted at both the gene level, as well as the pathway level. The gene level analysis identified <italic>TXNIP</italic>, a highly glucose-inducible gene in multiple cell types. On the pathway level we performed gene set enrichment analyses and identified several pathways that were down-regulated at an FDR &lt; or = 0.0001 including type 1 gamma interferon response and leukocyte chemotaxis. The identification of these pathways was done through an analysis of the entire transcriptome in a completely unbiased, agnostic fashion with GSEA. Associated pathways at an FDR threshold &lt; or = 0.0001 were highlighted. We felt that the pathway analysis, in addition to the single-gene analysis, supported the biological plausibility of the lymphoblastoid cell line gene expression response to glucose assay, given the pre-existing literature support for depressed cellular responsiveness in diabetes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) &quot;Genes with differential response to glucose are implicated in the pathogenesis of diabetic retinopathy.&quot; This part is the most intriguing and original but it is based on expression in many tissues and thus the title is also overstated: it shows some kind of association but certainly not that the 103 genes &quot;are implicated&quot; in retinopathy.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that not all 103 genes are likely associated with retinopathy. We have changed the title of this subsection to âGenetic association reveals that some genes with differential response to glucose play a role in susceptibility to diabetic retinopathyâ so as not to overstate the nature of the findings. We used eQTLs from multiple tissues from the GTEx Project, because eQTLs that are shared between tissues show stronger associations, specifically for complex-trait associations in the retina. Retina eQTLs are not currently present in GTEx, although 43% of retina eQTLs are shared with LCLs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) &quot;Folliculin (FLCN) is a putative diabetic retinopathy disease gene&quot; this part is also interesting (and includes some in vivo experiments) but the original whole genome gene expression study did not detect FLCN as differentially expressed in the cell blood of the patients with retinopathy. Can the authors comment on this?</p></disp-quote><p>In fact, the original whole genome expression study did detect differential expression of <italic>FLCN</italic> between individuals with proliferative diabetic retinopathy and individuals without diabetic retinopathy (log<sub>2</sub>FC difference = 0.27, P = 2.5x10<sup>-3</sup>). We agree with the reviewer that this point could be made clearer in the manuscript. Accordingly, we have added text to this section indicating that the differential <italic>FLCN</italic> expression can also be seen in Figure 2 and Supplementary file 1B of the manuscript in addition to Figure 4âfigure supplement 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>One of the reviewers also mentioned that no SNPs near FLCN have been identified in diabetes (or complications) GWAS and this is somewhat worrying.</p></disp-quote><p>In our earlier GWAS published in Human Molecular Genetics (Grassi M.A. et al., 2011) we identified an association with diabetic retinopathy for the SNP rs11867934. rs11867934 is an eSNP for <italic>FLCN</italic> that has shown an association with diabetic retinopathy in two independent cohorts: GoKinD (P=6.1 X 10<sup>-4</sup>), EDIC (P=3.3 X 10<sup>-3</sup>), and their meta-analysis (P= 7 X 10<sup>-6</sup>). In the present manuscript, Figure 4âfigure supplement 3 and Figure 4B reveal an enrichment of small GWAS p-values associated for the eSNPs associated with <italic>FLCN</italic> expression. Figure 4âfigure supplement 4 demonstrates replication of these findings in a third cohort, the UK Biobank. Together, these analyses show the validity and reproducibility of these findings in separate, independent large cohorts of individuals with diabetic retinopathy.</p><p>GWASes for diabetic retinopathy have been historically underpowered. Applying a gene-based eQTL approach that aggregates the effects of multiple variants to a single testing unit, the gene, increases study power to identify a novel disease-associated locus by reducing the multiple testing burden by at least two orders of magnitude. This has allowed us, in an innovative and novel fashion, to identify signals that have previously not been identified for diabetic retinopathy. Examining the genome-wide association signal for disease from eQTLs for a gene in aggregate can be a more powerful strategy to discern heterogeneous genetic signals than testing each of these SNPs individually. Collating all of the eSNPs for <italic>FLCN</italic>, we assessed the aggregate association of <italic>FLCN</italic> eSNPs to diabetic retinopathy and observed an enrichment with a true positive rate of 0.9 in the GoKinD EDIC meta-analysis and a true positive rate of 0.7 in the UK Biobank. Such an approach has never been done before for diabetic retinopathy and speaks to a strength of the study and the reason for the novelty of the findings.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) It is confusing that the authors used different selection criteria for gene identifications. In Results (subsection âIndividuals with diabetic retinopathy exhibit a differential transcriptional response to glucoseâ), they identified 19 differentially response genes (P &lt;0.05) between retinopathy cases and controls. However, they have selected the top 103 genes with P&lt;0.01 (Results, subsection âGenes with differential response to glucose are implicated in the pathogenesis of diabetic retinopathyâ) for further investigations. What is the gap between these two gene sets selection? I assume that the FLCN gene is in the top 103 gene set but not in the above 19 gene set. Explanations are needed for including specific genes for different analysis purposes.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer. In order to address this point we have changed the volcano plot for Figure 2 to highlight all 103 genes (P &lt; 0.01) (red dots) instead of the 19 originally highlighted and updated Supplementary file 1B to reflect this point by including a list of these 103 genes. Both Figure 2 and Supplementary file 1B include <italic>FLCN</italic>.</p><p>The 19 and 103 gene sets come from the same list of differential glucose response genes and rather reflect different parameters. One set simply reflects the 103 genes with P &lt; 0.01, whereas the other set of 19 genes had P &lt; 0.05 and a fold-change difference of &gt; or =0.26 (thresholds which were solely chosen to highlight their position on the volcano plot as well as the pre-existing literature support for some of these genes in terms of their role in retinopathy and their biological plausibility). Both the 19 and 103 gene sets contain <italic>FLCN</italic> and were derived from the differential response to glucose gene expression analysis between individuals with and without retinopathy. The entire data set listing all of these genes can be found in the source files for the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The authors selected LCLs from individuals of 3 groups, non-diabetes (nDM), type 1 diabetes without retinopathy (nDR) and type 1 diabetes with proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR). The benefits of utilizing nDM samples in the analysis was not clear. What is the purpose of including these samples?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that the nDM individuals were not central to the main message of the study. We initially included the nDM individuals because prior to this experiment we did not know whether we would see any difference between the gene expression profiles of individuals with and without retinopathy and how this might differ simply between individuals with and without diabetes itself. Our earlier work (Grassi et al., 2016) that interrogated expression differences for a small subset of candidate genes in these groups suggested we might not see a difference between individuals with and without retinopathy. If a difference was indeed present in the individuals with retinopathy, it was also unclear whether that would be due to a result of the differences in diabetes severity (from the standpoint of known differences in levels of glycemia and duration of diabetes between individuals with and without retinopathy), or due to underlying genetic differences. For this reason, we decided it would be prudent to include a group with no diabetes (nDM) for comparison purposes. It was only after we performed the multidimensional scaling analysis in which we saw clustering based on gene expression, revealing differences in individuals with and without retinopathy (Figure 2âfigure supplement 1), and saw that these differences were grounded in known biology of diabetes and complications (Figure 2âfigure supplement 2), that we then narrowed our focus to disentangling and better discerning the genetic basis for these differences. Ultimately, we decided to keep the nDM samples in the manuscript because their inclusion was relevant to the first question of simply whether there is interindividual variation in the transcriptional response (RG<sub>all</sub>). Including the nDM individuals increased the power of the RG<sub>all</sub> analysis by increasing the sample size substantially. All of the findings from the analysis of the nDM group itself and in comparison to the other two groups can be found in the source files. We felt that including these specific analyses for the nDM group in the manuscript distracted from the primary findings presented for retinopathy.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Although both gene expression and GSEA methods were conducted, the results were not relevant to diabetic retinopathy. Similarly, it is not clear what the purpose of using the gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was because it seems that the authors performed most analyses to identify genetic components by gene-based or SNP-based methods in the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>GSEA was performed to support the biological plausibility of assessing glucose response in LCLs. The initial analyses assessing the response to glucose in the entire cohort (RG<sub>all</sub>, which included nDM, nDR and PDR) investigated whether there was any inter-individual variation in the transcriptional response to glucose (Figure 1âfigure supplements 1-4), and whether the genes showing an inter-individual response to glucose were biologically plausible for diabetes and diabetic complications at both gene-level (e.g. <italic>TXNIP</italic>) (Figure 1A) and pathway-level (e.g. PDGF) (Figure 1B). Including the nDM individuals in this portion of the analysis increased the power of the study to identify these changes by increasing the sample size almost 50%.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The authors tested gene expression profile and associations using data from type 1 diabetic retinopathy. However, for the confirmation with UK BioBank (UKBB) data, they included all samples with both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Did you perform the analysis stratified by the type of diabetes? Do you have any explanations of possible differences?</p></disp-quote><p>We decided to study individuals with both type 1 and type 2 diabetes from the UKBB to increase the study power as has been done in other consortia in which we have participated (Pollack et al., 2019; Meng, W et al., Acta Ophthalmologica, 2018). In order to account for the discrepancy between analyzing type 1 individuals (in GoKinD and EDIC) and type 2 individuals (in UKBB), we controlled for type of diabetes by including it as a covariate in our model for the GWAS in the UK Biobank. In fact, controlling for type of diabetes diminished the power of the UKBB GWAS (TPR 0.76 without vs. 0.73 with type of diabetes as a covariate) likely explaining some its decreased true positive rate compared to the GoKinD/EDIC meta-analysis. We did not perform a stratified analysis based on type of diabetes as the vast majority of individuals in the UK Biobank have type 2 diabetes. For our analysis, likely over 90% of cases had type 2 diabetes (8% had type 1 diabetes, but 15% were unspecified â the vast majority of which one would assume is likely type 2 diabetes); for controls, this number was even more pronounced with only 3% having type 1 diabetes. Hence, almost all of our association signals were found in individuals with type 2 diabetes. We were not sufficiently powered to reliably assess this signal only in individuals with type 1 diabetes. From a clinical and biological standpoint, we were most interested in identifying genes that predispose to retinopathy in the setting of diabetes, whether it be type 1, type 2 or unspecified.</p></body></sub-article></article>
