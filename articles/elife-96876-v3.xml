neuroblasts (NBs) produces specific neural lineages of various lineage sizes depending on their location in the brain. In the <italic>Drosophila</italic> visual processing centre - the optic lobes (OLs), medulla NBs derived from the neuroepithelium (NE) give rise to neurons and glia cells of the medulla cortex. The timing and the mechanisms responsible for the cessation of medulla NBs are so far not known. In this study, we show that the termination of medulla NBs during early pupal development is determined by the exhaustion of the NE stem cell pool. Hence, altering NE-NB transition during larval neurogenesis disrupts the timely termination of medulla NBs. Medulla NBs terminate neurogenesis via a combination of apoptosis, terminal symmetric division via Prospero, and a switch to gliogenesis via Glial Cell Missing (Gcm); however, these processes occur independently of each other. We also show that temporal progression of the medulla NBs is mostly not required for their termination. As the <italic>Drosophila</italic> OL shares a similar mode of division with mammalian neurogenesis, understanding when and how these progenitors cease proliferation during development can have important implications for mammalian brain size determination and regulation of its overall function.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Every cell in the body can be traced back to a stem cell.

This revealed that the number of neuroblasts dropped drastically 12 to 18 hours after the fruit fly larvae developed in to pupae, and were completely gone by 30 hours in to pupae life<bold>.</bold></p><p>Further experiments revealed that the timing of this decrease is influenced by neuroepithelium cells, the pool of stem cells that generate neuroblasts during the early stages of development. Nguyen and Cheng found that speeding up this transition so that neuroblasts arise from the neuroepithelium earlier, led neuroblasts to disappear faster from the optic lobe; whereas delaying the transition caused neuroblasts to persist for much longer<bold>.</bold> Thus, the time at which neuroblasts are born determines when they are terminated.</p><p>Furthermore, Nguyen and Cheng showed that the neuroblasts were lost through a combination of means. This includes dying via a process called apoptosis, dividing to form two mature neurons, or switching to a glial cell fate.</p><p>These findings provide a deeper understanding of the mechanisms regulating stem cell pools and their conversion to different cell types, a process that is crucial to the proper development of the brain. How cells divide to form the optic lobe of fruit flies is similar to how new neurons arise in the mammalian brain. Understanding how and when stem cells in the fruit fly brain stop proliferating could therefore provide new insights in to the development of the human brain.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>medulla neuroblast</kwd><kwd><italic>Drosophila</italic></kwd><kwd>termination</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001782</institution-id><institution>University of Melbourne</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Graduate student scholarship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nguyen</surname><given-names>Phuong-Khanh</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100022084</institution-id><institution>Peter MacCallum Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Strategic Support for Research Leaders</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cheng</surname><given-names>Louise Y</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The termination of medulla neuroblasts is specified by the depletion of the neuroepithelium and mediated by apoptosis, differentiation, and gliogenic switch.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The CNS is the cognitive control centre of the body and is generated by neural stem cells (NSCs) during development. <italic>Drosophila</italic> NSCs, called neuroblasts (NBs), produce different neural and glial cell types and subtypes that contribute to the formation of the adult brain. The cellular diversity of the CNS is determined in a region-specific manner, via differential control of NB division mode and their temporal identity (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Harding and White, 2018</xref>). The majority of NBs are Type I NBs located in the ventral nerve cord (VNC) and the central brain (CB). They divide asymmetrically to generate a NB and a smaller ganglion mother cell (GMC) that undergoes terminal differentiation to give rise to neurons or glial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Harding and White, 2018</xref>). In addition, in each brain hemisphere, there are eight Type II NBs located on the dorsal surface of the CB, which asymmetrically divide to give rise to a NB and an intermediate neural progenitor (INP; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bello et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boone and Doe, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bowman et al., 2008</xref>). INPs undergo maturation prior to additional rounds of asymmetric division, to give rise to neurons or glial cells.</p><p>The optic lobes (OLs) are the visual processing centre of the adult fly brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). During neural development, neurogenesis in the OLs takes place in two proliferation centres: the inner and the outer proliferation centres (OPC), which produce different neural cell types that populate various cortexes of the visual system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Apitz and Salecker, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Sato et al., 2019</xref>). In the OPC, medulla NBs are generated from a pseudostratified neuroepithelium through a differentiating âproneural waveâ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1Aâ</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Egger et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Li et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Yasugi et al., 2008</xref>). This proneural wave is characterised by the expression of proneural factors such as Lethal of scute (Lâsc) which precedes NB generation from NE cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Yasugi et al., 2008</xref>). During early larval stages, OPC NE cells undergo symmetric cell divisions to expand the progenitor population. By early-third instar, progression of the proneural wave is initiated in the NE cells at the medial edge, leading to their differentiation into medulla NBs. Medulla NBs sequentially express a series of temporal transcription factors according to their birth order (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Konstantinides et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Li et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Zhu et al., 2022</xref>). During the early-mid temporal stages, NBs divide asymmetrically to self-renew and to generate a GMC that in turn produces two neurons. Upon acquiring the terminal temporal identity, NBs switch to become glial precursor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Zhu et al., 2022</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Medulla NBs are terminated during early pupal development.</title><p>(<bold>A-Aâ</bold>) Schematic depicting the larval CNS that is consisted of three main regions: the central brain (CB), the ventral nerve cord (VNC) and the optic lobe (OL).

For instance, type I NBs in the VNC and the CB exit the cell cycle and terminally differentiate at around 24 hr after pupal formation (APF), whereas type I abdominal NBs are eliminated via apoptosis prior to pupation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bello et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ito and Hotta, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Maurange et al., 2008</xref>). Mushroom body NBs are the last NBs to undergo termination, and they do so through apoptosis or autophagy prior to adult eclosion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Pahl et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Siegrist et al., 2010</xref>). So far, the timing and mode by which medulla NBs terminate are not known; furthermore, it is unclear whether the temporal series, which schedules NB cessation in other NB lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Maurange et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Syed et al., 2017</xref>) is also involved in the termination of medulla NBs.</p><p>Here, we find that medulla NBs terminate between 12 and 18 hr APF. Unlike other NB lineages, the timing of medulla NB cessation is mainly regulated by the depletion of the NE pool. As such, altered NE-NB transition is sufficient to change the timing of NB termination. Additionally, we demonstrate that medulla NBs terminate via a combination of apoptosis, size-symmetric terminal differentiation via Pros and a switch to gliogenesis via Gcm. Pros-mediated differentiation and Gcm-mediated gliogenic switch occur independently of each other. Notably, while medulla NBs undergo temporal transitions, the temporal series is largely not required for NB termination.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Medulla NBs terminate during early pupal development</title><p>To characterise the timing at which medulla NBs are eliminated during pupal development, we first monitored the number of NBs in the OPC of <italic>w<sup>1118</sup></italic> animals using the pan-NB marker Deadpan (Dpn). We found that the number of NBs was significantly reduced between 12 and 18 hr APF and by 30 hr APF, all the NBs in the OPC were eliminated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1BâC</xref>).</p><p>In the larval CB and the VNC, it was previously shown that type I NBs regrow to their original size after each division empowered by aerobic glycolysis which in turn provides the NBs with energy and metabolites for rapid cell growth and proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Homem et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Maurange et al., 2008</xref>). However, upon larval-pupal transition, glycolysis is downregulated, resulting in their terminal differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Homem et al., 2014</xref>). To assess if a reduction in cell size also precedes NB elimination in the medulla, we measured the nuclear size of NBs marked by Dpn between 12 and 18 hr APF when the majority of medulla NBs disappear. We found that there was a significant reduction in the nuclear sizes of the medulla NBs between 12 and 18 hr APF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1DâE</xref>), suggesting that decreased cell growth likely precedes the cessation of medulla NB. Nonetheless, increasing cellular growth through the overexpression of a constitutive active form of the PI3K catalytic subunit Dp110 (<italic>Dp110<sup>CAAX</sup></italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Leevers et al., 1996</xref>), or the activation of the cellular growth regulator Myc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Rust et al., 2018</xref>) in clones did not prolong NB persistence in the OLs at 24 hr APF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A, B, E, F</xref>). Therefore, although a decrease in cell growth coincides with NB elimination in the pupal medulla, it is not necessary for medulla NB termination.</p><p>Previous literature showed that NB termination is dependent on core components of the Mediator complex, which promotes key enzymes to increase oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) to slow down NB regrowth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">van den Ameele and Brand, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Homem et al., 2014</xref>).

As clonal induction is random and we could not determine whether Med12 is acting in the NE cells or the NBs, we next used a NB-specific driver <italic>eyR16F10-GAL4</italic> (expressed in approximately 50% of medulla NBs, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1GâK</xref>) to drive the expression of <italic>med12 RNAi</italic>. This manipulation did not promote the persistence of medulla NBs at 24 hr APF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1LâN</xref>), suggesting that <italic>med12</italic> is likely important in the NE but not the NBs.

In contrast, <italic>notch RNAi</italic> clones consisted of few NE cells and ectopic NBs in the deep section of the medulla (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1B</xref>). This indicates the ectopic formation and delamination of NBs from the NE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Egger et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Yasugi et al., 2010</xref>).

Whereas <italic>notch</italic> RNAi clones consisted of mostly NBs with a laterally shifted NE-NB boundary (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>). These are consistent with previous reports suggesting that the downregulation of Notch signalling induces ectopic NE-NB transition and the delamination of NBs into the deeper layers of the medulla (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Egger et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Yasugi et al., 2010</xref>). At 12 hr APF, we found that <italic>notch</italic> RNAi clones were smaller in size and consisted of very few NBs compared to control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G, I, J</xref>). Thus, it is likely that a precocious NE-NB transition resulted in a premature depletion of the NE, leading to the early termination of medulla NBs. To test this further, we overexpressed the proneural gene <italic>lethal of scute</italic> (<italic>lâsc</italic>), which has been shown to promote NE-NB transition during larval stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Yasugi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K</xref>).

Overall, our results suggest that early depletion of the NE results in the early cessation of medulla NBs, whereas delayed formation of the NBs from the NE results in the late termination of medulla NBs.

In the <italic>Drosophila</italic> OL, there are two main stem cell pools, the NE cells that divide symmetrically, and the NBs. Medulla NBs are derived from the OPC NE via the proneural wave, which switch to asymmetric division where they self-renew and give rise to GMCs that will produce post-mitotic neurons and glial cells of the medulla cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Egger et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Li et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Yasugi et al., 2008</xref>). Our study shows that during early pupal development, medulla NBs terminate via a combination of mechanisms including apoptosis-mediated cell death, Pros-mediated differentiation and a switch from neurogenesis to gliogenesis. While factors such as ecdysone signalling and OxPhos of the NBs are involved in NB termination in other lineages outside of the OL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Homem et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Syed et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">van den Ameele and Brand, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Yang et al., 2017</xref>), we found that these factors do not play a significant role in the termination of medulla NBs. Instead, the main regulator of the timely NB cessation in the pupal medulla is the timing of the NE-NB conversion during larval stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Interestingly, we showed that while <italic>med12 RNAi</italic> clones exhibited persistent NBs in the OL at 24 hr APF, this is likely due to the role of Med12 in regulating NE-NB transition during larval development (Med12 knockdown in the medulla NBs did not cause persistent NBs; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Additionally, while a specific cascade of temporal identity transcription factors in the medulla NBs has been shown to generate the cellular diversity of medulla neurons and glia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Konstantinides et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Li et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Zhu et al., 2022</xref>), temporal progression in the medulla NBs appears to exert negligible effects on the timing of NB cessation in the pupal stages. Diseases such as microcephaly are mediated by the premature depletion of the NE pool, or through a precocious commitment to neurogenic divisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">GÃ¶tz and Huttner, 2005</xref>). Consistent with this, our data present evidence that during development, the regulation of the NE stem cell pool, and its timely conversion into NSCs is of critical importance for the overall size and function of the brain.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Working model of the termination of medulla NBs.</title><p>In the wildtype, medulla NBs terminate during early pupal development via three main mechanisms: (1) apoptosis, (2) Pros-mediated symmetric division, and (3) Gcm-mediated gliogenic switch.

NBs transit through their temporal series to terminally differentiate into neurons and glia, which marks the end of medulla neurogenesis. Thus, unlike type I NB lineages in which NB termination is scheduled by ecdysone signalling-mediated temporal progression at the level of the NBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Syed et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Yang et al., 2017</xref>); in the OL, NB termination is pre-determined in the NE. While our work has only tested the role of Notch signalling in the NE for determining medulla NB termination, JAK/STAT signalling was previously demonstrated to control the proneural wave and the associated NE-NB transition, in part through Notch signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Yasugi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Yasugi et al., 2010</xref>). Therefore, we speculate that JAK/STAT signalling will also likely influence the timing of medulla NB termination. In the OL, besides medulla NBs, NE cells also sequentially express an array of temporal factors, such as Chinmo and Broad downstream of ecdysone signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arain et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dillard et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lanet et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Zhou et al., 2019</xref>). Moreover, inhibiting the Chinmo-to-Broad expression switch in the NE was shown to delay the NE-NB transition, resulting in tumours with persistent NBs in the adult OLs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dillard et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Zhou et al., 2019</xref>). Overall, the differences in the regulation of NB termination in the OL medulla versus other lineages may be due to some fundamental differences in the origins of these NBs. In the OL, NBs are derived from the NE, that undergoes rapid growth during larval development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Egger et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lanet et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Yasugi et al., 2008</xref>). In contrast, NBs from other lineages are produced directly from the neuroectoderm in the embryo without undergoing the transition from the NE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Harding and White, 2018</xref>). Hence, their termination mechanism acts predominantly in the NBs during pupal development.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Apoptosis-mediated cell death makes a small contribution to NB termination</title><p>Consistent with previous reports, we found that apoptosis occurred in a subset of medulla NBs from 12 hr to 16 hr APF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hara et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Furthermore, we showed that although apoptosis inhibition caused persistent NBs at 24 hr APF, by 48 hr APF, all NBs were still eliminated in the OL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3M, O and P</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1BâG</xref>). Notably, half of the NBs undergoing apoptosis at 12 hr APF expressed the mid-temporal factor Ey, but not Slp or Tll (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3AâD and K</xref>). These data suggest an intriguing link between the expression of the mid-temporal factor and the competence of the NBs to undergo apoptosis. It is possible that the early-born medulla NBs that in turn express late temporal factors (Tll or Gcm) during pupal development, will terminate via either Pros-mediated symmetric division or gliogenic switch. Whereas the late-born NBs, that still express mid-temporal transcription factors such as Ey, will terminate via apoptosis. This mechanism could be a fail-safe paradigm to ensure the elimination of all the medulla NBs before adulthood. Whether such decision of the NBs is determined by the intrinsic factors like the temporal series, or extrinsic factors such as signalling cues from other cell types in the niche remain to be probed. Although the timing of apoptosis in the medulla NBs coincides with a small pulse of ecdysone around 10 hr APF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Riddiford, 1993</xref>), we showed that the inhibition of ecdysone signalling in the medulla NBs did not phenocopy the inhibition of apoptosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2BâE</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1C, G</xref>). Therefore, unlike neurons in the OL which require ecdysone signalling for apoptosis during pupal development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hara et al., 2013</xref>), medulla NBs undergo apoptosis independently of ecdysone signalling. Altogether, while some NBs terminate proliferation through apoptosis, it is likely that apoptosis of the NBs makes a minor contribution to the termination of neurogenesis in the medulla.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Symmetric divisions and a neurogenic-gliogenic switch cause NB cessation</title><p>We showed that many medulla NBs displayed nuclear Pros expression during early pupal stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Consistent with the essential role of Pros in promoting differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Choksi et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Maurange et al., 2008</xref>), <italic>pros</italic> knockdown caused the persistence of the NBs in the OL at 24 hr APF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G, I</xref>). Nevertheless, later during the pupal stages, <italic>pros</italic> knockdown was insufficient to maintain medulla NB persistence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>), suggesting that Pros expression in the medulla NBs is not strictly required for their termination. In addition to Pros-mediated differentiation, another mechanism responsible for the cessation of neurogenesis is the gliogenic switch. We found cells triple positive for the pan-NB marker Dpn, the differentiation marker Pros, and the glial cell determinant Gcm in the early pupal medulla (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), which likely give rise to glial cells at the end of the temporal series. Interestingly, the inhibition of Pros did not affect gliogenesis in the larval medulla (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5BâD</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1AâB</xref>); conversely, the inhibition of Gcm did not influence Pros expression in the pupal OL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1CâD</xref>). As such, these data suggest that despite Pros and Gcm co-localisation in the terminating NBs, gliogenesis and differentiation appear to act in parallel. Taken together, apoptosis, symmetric cell division and a gliogenic switch appear to be employed as fail-safe mechanisms that help eliminate the NB progenitor pool in the pupal OL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Hence, it would be interesting to explore in the future the cross-regulatory relationship between these termination programs.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Fly stocks and husbandry</title><p>The fly strains used were detailed in the following table:</p><table-wrap id="inlinetable1" position="anchor"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="top">System</th><th align="left" valign="top">Genotype</th><th align="left" valign="top">Source</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Wildtype</td><td align="left" valign="top"><italic>w<sup>1118</sup></italic></td><td align="left" valign="top"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Flip-out</td><td align="left" valign="top"><italic>hs-FLP,act &gt;CD2&gt;GAL4;UAS-Dcr2,UAS-GFP</italic></td><td align="left" valign="top">Lei Zhang</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="7">MARCM</td><td align="left" valign="top"><italic>UAS-mCD8::GFP,hs-FLP;FRT42D,tub-GAL80;

Description of the planned revisions</p><p>Reviewer #1 (Evidence, reproducibility and clarity (Required)):</p><p>The manuscript by Nguyen and Cheng is investigating the timing and mechanism of cessation of neuroblasts in the pupal optic lobe. Previous studies by several groups have determined the spatial and temporal factors required for the neuroepithelial to neuroblast transition and neuroblast to neural/glycogenesis in third instar larvae such that neuroblasts are eliminated. The mechanism of elimination of neuroblasts in the VNC or mushroom bodies have been investigated, but the mechanism(s) and the timing of elimination of medulla neuroblasts has not been investigated. The authors suggest that medulla neuroblasts are eliminated via a combination of mechanisms including apoptosis, prospero induced size symmetric terminal differentiation and a switch to gliogenesis by gcm expression. Expression of Tailless also was found to affect the timing of medulla neuroblast termination. They also ruled out several mechanisms such as ecdysone pulses.</p><p>Major comments</p><p>Clearly written and logical flow to experiments and results not over interpreted.</p><p>Clearly show that the neuroblast number and size decrease (12 to 18 hrs) and are eliminated by 30 hours</p><p>Figure 2a Marking of the Neuroepithelium. Would be more convincing if shown by PatJ expression and is clonal analysis. While the following panels use PatJ in clones suggesting are NE and NBs present it is more difficult to put into the context in the higher magnification images (Figure 2 D- M) and the Miranda expression in F' seems to be the entire lobe and it is not clear if would be any NE which does not agree with what is shown in panel A.</p></disp-quote><p>We will perform clonal analysis using MARCM to show that the elimination of medulla NBs (marked by Dpn) is accompanied by the depletion of the NE (marked by PatJ). For Figure 2 D, E, I, L, we will change the images from high magnifications to the whole lobes to clearly show the shift in the NE-NB transition upon Notch OE/KD.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Is difficult to see the neuroblasts in Figure 2 D D&quot; and E. The figure does not match what is stated in the results in that the neuroblasts are difficult to observe. If the point is that there is fewer NE cells and more neuroblasts then this is hard to see. It has been previously shown that with Notch RNAi clones prematurely extrude form the NE (Egger 20210; Keegan 2023) and could be expressing more Neuroblast markers but this is not visible in the panels as shown. Are the images single focal plane or maximum projections? Imaging more deeply in the brain or viewing in cross section would account for these possibilities. The possibility that are more neuroblasts but not all at the surface of the OL should be addressed as this could also alter the overall results.</p><p>Figure 2 is key to first point of the paper so needs to be addressed.</p></disp-quote><p>The images are single focal plane of the superficial layer of the medulla. We will specify this information in the figure legends. In addition, we will include cross-section images of the <italic>notch RNAi</italic> clones in our supplementary figure to show the delamination of precocious NBs and comment on this observation in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor comments</p><p>Why express volume of DPN in clone volume.

As these are most similar to mammalian brain development (Radial glial to NSC) this information provides more context to interpret the formation of glial and neurons in the adult optic lobe given the effect on timing and mechanisms of elimination.</p><p>This paper would be of interest to developmental biologist who work with <italic>Drosophila</italic> or mice who are looking at neural development. An understanding of how neural diversity is achieved and the mechanisms behind this that can be dysfunctional in terms of etiology of neural diseases. Is a well done study for the most part that would be improved by clarifying some data and provided more replicates for robustness of the data.</p><p>I am a developmental biologist working with <italic>Drosophila</italic> in larval and adult neural development.</p><p>Reviewer #2 (Evidence, reproducibility and clarity (Required)):</p><p>Lineages of neural stem cells are of great interest to understand how many neural types are generated. They produce very diverse neurons, often in a highly stereotyped series. However, they must terminate their life when the animal becomes functional or if neurons need time to become mature before birth.</p><p>In the <italic>Drosophila</italic> optic lobes, neural stem cells are produced over a period of several days by a wave of neurogenesis that transforms a neuroepithelium into neural stem cells that undergo a series of temporal patterning steps. It has been reported that they finish their life when a symmetric division generates glial cells. The authors however analyze the end of a particular lineage, that of the latest born neural stem cells of the medulla.</p><p>The paper shows that neural stem cells stop being produced when the neuroepithelium is consumed. But how do the latest born neural stem cells stop their lineage?</p><p>The results show that they do so by several means, which is quite unexpected: they may die from apoptosis, or autophagy, by becoming glioblasts or by a terminal symmetric division.</p><p>There are no major issues affecting the conclusions</p><p>â The paper shows that the end of production of neural stem cells occurs the neuroepithelium is completely transformed. The experiments performed by the authors are fine and show that, if the transition is delayed, neural stem cells terminate their life later, and vice versa. However, the lifespan of the neural stem cells is not affected by the timing of the transition. Therefore, these experiments do not tell us how neural stem cells terminate their life, which is the central question of the study. The discussion should be written accordingly and the title and the model in Figure 6 modified to reflect the importance of the end of life of the stem cells, the main theme of the paper.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that our said experiments did not elucidate how NBs terminate at the end of neurogenesis in the medulla. Nevertheless, our Figure 2 showed that the timing of NB termination in the medulla is dependent on the timing of the NE-NB transition (i.e. if born early, will terminate early, and if born late, will terminate late).</p><p>In Supplementary Figure 1, we showed that factors previously shown to be involved in NB termination in other lineages did not play similar roles in the medulla NBs. Thus, we think that NB termination in the medulla is likely regulated at the levels of the NE, but not the NBs themselves. Although we have briefly mentioned this in the discussion, we hope that by conducting the experiments suggested by the reviewer (see below), we can subsequently modify our model in Figure 6 and our discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>â The authors talk about Pros-dependent symmetric division and gliogenic switch as two separate processes, but these may be two sides of the same phenomenon. Tll+ gcm+ neural stem cells undergo Pros-dependent cell cycle exit, generating glial progeny. If the authors agree with this, could they update their model (and discussion) to reflect the fact that gliogenic switch occurs via a Pros-dependent symmetric division, and these are not two separate processes independently contributing to the depletion of the neural stem cell pool? Ideally, a triple staining between Dpn, Pros, and gcm would show that the symmetrically dividing cells seen by the authors are committed to the glial fate.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree it is likely that the two mechanisms are linked. In Figure 5C, we did show the triple staining the reviewer suggested: at 12h APF, there are Dpn+ NBs in the medulla that expressed both Pros::GFP and <italic>gcm-lacZ</italic>, suggesting that NBs likely undergo Pros-dependent cell cycle exit to generate glial progeny (Figure 5K). We will update our final model as suggested.</p><p>To investigate this further, we propose to test if gliogenesis is affected in <italic>pros RNAi</italic> clones. The results may shed light on whether Pros-mediated symmetric division is required for Gcm-mediated gliogenesis in the medulla.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>â Why were Notch RNAi experiments assessed for the presence of neural stem cells at P12 and gcm RNAi experiments at P24? Given that most optic lobe neural stem cells disappear between P12-18, a subtle effect of gcm RNAi may have been missed. Do the authors have data for gcm RNAi at P12?</p></disp-quote><p>We hypothesized that the timing of NE-NB transition affects the timing of NB termination in the medulla. Because Notch KD was previously shown to induce precocious NE-NB transition in the OL i.e., NBs are born prematurely, we expected that this manipulation will lead to a premature elimination of the NBs.</p><p>In contrast, <italic>gcm RNAi</italic> which inhibits the switch into the glial cell fate of the NBs, is expected to prolong the neurogenic phase of the NBs, and thereby, their persistence by 24h APF when WT NBs are eliminated. We agree that there might be some subtle effects of <italic>gcm RNAi</italic> at 12h APF. However, we can show the number of NBs in <italic>gcm RNAi</italic> clones in the medulla at 12h APF as suggested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>â The authors should acknowledge that the inhibition of either apoptosis or autophagy alone may not be fully sufficient to prevent the death of NBs. In mushroom body neural stem cells, both processes must be inhibited simultaneously to produce a strong effect on their survival (Pahl et al. 2019, PMID 30773368).</p></disp-quote><p>We will add this information in our discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>â There is an important missing point that should be addressed: is there a specific point in time when all neural stem cells must stop their lineage wherever they are in the temporal series and either die or divide symmetrically? One possibility that is not discussed is that most neural stem cells end their life through a gliogenic symmetric division while those that were generated late must stop en route and die by apoptosis and/or autophagy. This would solve the strange diversity of end-of-life, which could be easily addressed by identifying the temporal stage of the neural stem cells that undergo apoptosis</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that it would be of interest to understand how there are diverse mechanisms by which medulla NBs terminate during pupal development. We agree with the above possibility that the reviewer raised such that most old NBs appear terminate through a gliogenic switch whereas newly generated NBs terminate en route via apoptosis. To investigate this, we will characterise the expression of some temporal transcription factors (e.g., Ey, Slp, Tll) in the NBs undergoing apoptosis at 12h APF as suggested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor suggestions:</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with these minor suggestions and will amend these as suggested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>â Line 46: Specify that there are 8 type II neural stem cells in each hemisphere*.</p><p>â The statement in lines 181-182 that &quot;cell death, and not autophagy, makes a minor contribution toâ¦&quot; should be replaced with &quot;apoptosis, and not autophagy,&quot; as autophagy is also a type of cell death.</p><p>â The authors should adjust the logic of the section &quot;Medulla neuroblasts terminate during early pupal development&quot;: Describe the wild-type pattern first (the decrease in the number of neural stem cells and their size with age) and then describe the perturbations aimed at disrupting the number and the size of neural stem cells</p><p>â Line 151 should refer to Figure 2I-K, not Figure 2J-K.</p><p>Referees cross-commenting</p><p>How can NBs die by different mechanisms??

Through time course experiments the authors demonstrate the medulla NBs are completely eliminated by 30h APF during early pupal development. By manipulating the Notch signalling pathway as well as proneural genes such as lethal of scute, the authors show that altering the NE-NB transition is sufficient to change the timing of NB termination. In contrast, ecdysone signalling and components of the mediator complex, known to terminate proliferation of central brain NBs, are not required for the termination of medulla NBs. Medulla NBs sequentially express a variety of temporal transcription factors to promote cellular diversity, however, the authors demonstrate that altering temporal factors such as Ey, Sco or Hth, does not affect the timing of the medulla NBs termination. Interestingly however overexpression of the transcription factor tailless can cease medulla NB termination via the conversion of type I to type II NB fate. They further go on to show the importance of the differentiation factor, Prospero, in promoting the differentiation of medulla NBs as well as terminating medulla neurogenesis during pupal development. Finally, in addition to differentiation, the authors show another mechanism responsible for the cessation of neurogenesis which is the commencement of gliogenesis. Through manipulation of the neurogenic to gliogenic switch by knockdown or overexpressing the glial regulatory gene, gcm, the authors show that even though the downregulation of gcm is is not sufficient to induce NB persistence, gcm overexpression can cause premature termination of NBs.</p><p>Major comments:</p><p>â Are the key conclusions convincing?</p><p>Yes, the key conclusions are convincing with proper controls, quantifications and statistical analyses.</p><p>â Should the authors qualify some of their claims as preliminary or speculative, or remove them altogether?</p><p>The conclusion that temporal transcription factors (TTF) do not affect the timing of medulla NB termination is somewhat preliminary. The authors investigated a simplified temporal series including Homothorax, Eyeless, Sloppy-paired, Dichaete and Tailless. However, there are additional temporal factors that have not been examined for their potential involvement in medullar NB termination. Previous reports have identified several other temporal factors that play a role in medulla TTF cascade, such as, SoxNeuro (SoxN) and doublesex-Mab related 99B (Dmrt99B) that start their expression in the NE similar to Hth, however, Dmrt99B is likely to be repressed much later than Hth (Li, Erclik et al. 2013, Zhu, Zhao et al. 2022). At this point, it remains challenging to completely rule out the possibility that other temporal factors play a role in medullar NB termination or have redundant functions in regulating the timing of medulla NB cessation. It is suggested to tone down this claim and provide a brief discussion on alternative possibilities, citing relevant papers on the functions of other temporal factors in medullar NBs.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and will make the suggested changes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>â Would additional experiments be essential to support the claims of the paper? Request additional experiments only where necessary for the paper as it is, and do not ask authors to open new lines of experimentation.</p><p>Loss of pros by RNAi caused the formation of ectopic NBs and the NBs persist even at 24h APF.

The authors use the eyR6F10-Gal4 driver in certain experiments. The eyR6F10-Gal4 driver is however expressed only in a subset of medulla NBs.

Figure 1C has a p value of only 0.03 (*) but shows a strong reduction in the number of Dpn+ cells from 12h to 18h, etc. Is this correct?

The balance between stem cell maintenance and differentiation is critical for proper brain development and the results presented in this paper are impactful. Furthermore, <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> is an excellent model to study stem cell niches and neuroblast temporal patterning. The authors provide key mechanisms namely cell death, Pros-mediated differentiation and the gliogenic switch that contribute to a better understanding of how the NB progenitor pool can be terminated in the Drosophila OL, which is largely supported by the data.</p><p>- Place the work in the context of the existing literature (provide references, where appropriate).</p><p>So far, most work in this field has focused on the regulation of the temporal factors to promote the progression of the TTF transcriptional cascade and thereby diversity of the neural progenitors (Li, Erclik et al. 2013, Naidu, Zhang et al. 2020, Ray and Li 2022, Zhu, Zhao et al. 2022). Furthermore, work on pathways such as EGFR and Notch signalling that allows the proneural wave to progress and subsequently induce neuroblast formation in a precise and orderly manner have also been studied (Yasugi, Umetsu et al. 2008, Yasugi, Sugie et al. 2010). Here, considering previous literature, the authors move one step forward to determine how and when these neuroblast progenitors cease proliferation during development thus providing mechanisms for the regulation of the neuroepithelial stem cell pool, its timely conversion into NSCs and the switch from neurogenesis to gliogenesis thus providing important implications for brain size determination and function.</p><p>- State what audience might be interested in and influenced by the reported findings.</p><p>Stem cell research, neurobiologists and developmental biologists.</p><p>- Define your field of expertise</p><p>Stem cells, developmental biology</p></disp-quote><p>List of planned experiments for revision:</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Lineage analysis (MARCM) of the medulla NE cells (PatJ+) and NBs (Dpn+) from 12-30h APF.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Re-staning of <italic>mCherry RNAi</italic>, <italic>notch RNAi</italic>, and <italic>N<sup>ACT</sup></italic> clones with PatJ and Dpn at larval and pupal stages.</p></list-item><list-item><p><italic>pros RNAi</italic> clones at 48-72h APF to test the persistence of medulla NBs.</p></list-item><list-item><p><italic>pros</italic> overexpression clones at 12h APF to test for precocious termination of medulla NBs.</p></list-item><list-item><p><italic>gcm RNAi</italic> clones at 12h APF to look for subtle effects of gliogenic inhibition in the medulla.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Characterisation of temporal factor expressions in apoptotic NBs in the wildtype medulla at 12h APF.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Characterisation of <italic>eyR16F1-GAL4</italic> expression in the medulla at 12h APF.</p></list-item><list-item><p>RT-qPCR to validate <italic>UAS-med27 RNAi</italic>.</p></list-item></list></body></sub-article></article>
