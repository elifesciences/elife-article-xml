a posttranslational modification (PTM) of proteins that controls many cellular processes, including DNA repair, transcription, chromatin regulation and mitosis. A number of proteins catalyse the transfer and hydrolysis of ADPr, and also specify how and when the modification is conjugated to the targets. We recently discovered a new form of ADPr that is attached to serine residues in target proteins (Ser-ADPr) and showed that this PTM is specifically made by PARP1/HPF1 and PARP2/HPF1 complexes. In this work, we found by quantitative proteomics that histone Ser-ADPr is reversible in cells during response to DNA damage. By screening for the hydrolase that is responsible for the reversal of Ser-ADPr, we identified ARH3/ADPRHL2 as capable of efficiently and specifically removing Ser-ADPr of histones and other proteins. We further showed that Ser-ADPr is a major PTM in cells after DNA damage and that this signalling is dependent on ARH3.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.28533.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.28533.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.28533.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Inside cells, genetic information is stored within molecules of DNA. If any of the DNA becomes damaged, the cell has a suite of proteins that can help to repair the DNA. Many of these proteins act as signals that alert the cell to the presence of damaged DNA. One such signal involves adding a molecule called ADPr onto specific proteins that are near the damaged section of DNA.</p><p>There are several enzymes that can attach ADPr molecules to proteins and other enzymes known as ADP-ribosylhydrolases can halt the signal by removing the ADPr molecules. Together, these two groups of enzymes control how strong the ADPr signal is, how long it lasts, and therefore control the DNA repair process.</p><p>Proteins are made up of building blocks called amino acids. Previous studies have shown that ADPr molecules can be attached to several different amino acids including glutamate, aspartate and cysteine. Specific ADP-ribosylhydrolase enzymes are known to be responsible for removing ADPr molecules from these amino acids. In 2016, a group of researchers found that ADPr can also be added to an amino acid called serine. However, it is not known if cells are able to remove ADPr molecules from serine, or which ADP-ribosylhydrolases might be involved.</p><p>Fontana, Bonfiglio, Palazzo et al. – including some of the researchers involved in the earlier work – used biochemical techniques to investigate if any human enzymes are able to remove ADPr molecules that have been attached to serines on proteins. The experiments reveal that the serine ADPr signal increases after DNA damage, before reducing over time. However, in human cancer cells that lack an ADP-ribosylhydrolase known as ARH3, the serine ADPr signal persists after DNA damage. This suggests that adding ADPr molecules to the amino acid serine is a key signal that controls DNA repair and that ARH3 is the main enzyme responsible for erasing this signal.</p><p>Drugs that inhibit some of the enzymes that attach ADPr molecules to proteins are used to treat some breast, ovarian and prostate cancers. Therefore, understanding how cells remove these signals from proteins may aid the development of new therapies for these conditions. The next steps following on from this work are to find out more about the structure of ARH3 and to understand how cells that lack this enzyme behave.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.28533.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.28533.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>PARP</kwd><kwd>ADP-ribosylation</kwd><kwd>ARH3</kwd><kwd>ADP-ribose</kwd><kwd>macrodomain</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>H2020 Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>657501</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bonfiglio</surname><given-names>Juan José</given-names></name><name><surname>Matic</surname><given-names>Ivan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EXC 229</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Matic</surname><given-names>Ivan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010269</institution-id><institution>Wellcome</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>101794</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ahel</surname><given-names>Ivan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000289</institution-id><institution>Cancer Research UK</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>C35050/A22284</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ahel</surname><given-names>Ivan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>281739</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ahel</surname><given-names>Ivan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>ARH3 is an enzyme that hydrolyses serine ADP-ribosylation, a recently uncovered post-translational protein modification.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>eLife Digest</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>ADP-ribosylation (ADPr) is a chemical modification of macromolecules that regulates a wide variety of cellular processes, such as DNA damage repair, transcription, translation, aging, stress responses, microbial pathogenicity and many others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gupte et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hottiger, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jankevicius et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Palazzo et al., 2017</xref>). The modification reaction involves the transfer of the ADP-ribose moiety from NAD<sup>+</sup> onto the target molecule and the release of nicotinamide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gupte et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Langelier et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Schreiber et al., 2006</xref>). There are several ADP-ribosyl transferase (ART) enzyme families that can specifically modify proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bütepage et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hassa et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rack et al., 2015</xref>). The most thoroughly characterised class of ARTs is the poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) family. PARPs are widespread throughout Eukarya and are also found sporadically in bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Perina et al., 2014</xref>). The human genome encodes 17 members of the PARP family, which are grouped into five distinct classes according to protein domain architecture and involvement in different cellular processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Perina et al., 2014</xref>). The majority of these PARPs can catalyse the addition of only one unit of ADP-ribose (mono-ADPr; MAR; MARylation) onto target proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bütepage et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kleine et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Vyas et al., 2014</xref>). However, several PARP family members such as PARP1, PARP2, and Tankyrases can generate long chains of the repeating ADP-ribose units on their protein targets (poly-ADPr; PAR; PARylation) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">D'Amours et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gibson and Kraus, 2012</xref>). Furthermore, PARP family members have displayed differential activities with respect to the preferred amino acid for ADP-ribose attachment. Several amino acids have been reported as acceptors of PARP-mediated modification; most commonly glutamate, but also aspartate, lysine, arginine and cysteine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Daniels et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gagné et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Martello et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Vyas et al., 2014</xref>). Most recently, we identified serine as an acceptor of ADPr modification by PARP1 and PARP2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bonfiglio et al., 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Leidecker et al., 2016</xref>). We also discovered that the PARP1/2 interacting protein HPF1 (Histone PARylation Factor 1) is responsible for introducing this shift in amino acid specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bonfiglio et al., 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gibbs-Seymour et al., 2016</xref>). Further analyses, by utilising mass spectrometry of human cells treated with DNA damaging agents, revealed large numbers of serine ADP-ribosylation (Ser-ADPr) modifications across a variety of human proteins involved in regulation of genome stability, including histones and PARP1 itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bonfiglio et al., 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bilan et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Protein ADP-ribosylation can affect structure, function and stability of target proteins, and hence, requires strict control. One mode of regulation is the degradation and/or removal of the ADPr signal by specific enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Feijs et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Palazzo et al., 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rack et al., 2016</xref>). PAR glycohydrolase (PARG) is the most well characterized enzyme in humans for PAR hydrolysis, which utilises a macrodomain fold to bind ADPr and specifically cleaves the ribose–ribose bonds between the subunits of the PAR chains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lin et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Slade et al., 2011</xref>). ADP-ribosylhydrolase 3 (ARH3, also called ADPRHL2) is also able to degrade PAR chains on proteins, but features a different structural composition to PARG, and hydrolyses PAR less efficiently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hatakeyama et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mueller-Dieckmann et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Oka et al., 2006</xref>). However, neither PARG nor ARH3 were previously shown to be able to process a single unit of ADPr (mono-ADPr) attached to a protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Oka et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Slade et al., 2011</xref>). This MARylation is instead regulated by a different suite of proteins that do not degrade PAR chains, but rather specifically cleave amino acid-linked ADPr moieties; terminal ADPr protein glycohydrolase (TARG1), MACROD1, MACROD2 and ARH1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barkauskaite et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Feijs et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jankevicius et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mashimo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rosenthal et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sharifi et al., 2013</xref>). TARG1, MACROD1 and MACROD2 have been shown to hydrolyse acidic residue (Asp/Glu) linked mono-ADPr, whilst ARH1 is capable of removing ADPr from arginine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Glowacki et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jankevicius et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rosenthal et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sharifi et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Our recent discoveries that HPF1 enables PARP1-mediated Ser-ADPr suggest a new mechanism of ADPr signalling that would potentially require precise regulation. Additionally, understanding the regulation of Ser-ADPr of histones could provide significant insights to the already complex tapestry of histone modification. Here we endeavoured to determine if Ser-ADPr is a reversible modification and if so, which hydrolase is responsible for the release of this form of ADPr. Our investigations show that DNA damage induced Ser-ADPr modification of histones is reversible in human cells, and that ARH3 is a hydrolase capable of efficiently removing Ser-ADPr from proteins. Here we also establish ARH3 as a much-needed experimental tool to expand the investigations of Ser-ADPr dynamics as our understanding of this recently unveiled form of ADPr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Leidecker et al., 2016</xref>) is still in its infancy.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Histone serine ADP-ribose modification is reversible</title><p>PARP-dependent ADP-ribosylation signalling is a rapid and dynamic process in human cells. Within minutes of incurring DNA damage, the peak PARylation signal is observed, before it quickly diminishes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hakmé et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mortusewicz et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tallis et al., 2014</xref>). Our recent studies have shown that Ser-ADPr is catalysed by PARP1 and PARP2 in a HPF1-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bonfiglio et al., 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gibbs-Seymour et al., 2016</xref>), and we identified a large number of Ser-ADPr target proteins involved in response to DNA damage. This raised the question of whether Ser-ADPr was a reversible modification as seen for other forms of ADPr and for virtually all the PTMs playing a role in cell signalling. To investigate this, we carried out quantitative proteomics experiments using stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ong et al., 2002</xref>) in combination with our recently developed mass spectrometric approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bonfiglio et al., 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Leidecker et al., 2016</xref>). U2OS heavy labeled (Lys8) cells were treated with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> at different time points (0 min, 10 min and 120 min) and then combined with light labelled H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-tretead cells (Lys0) that were used as a spike-in SILAC standard (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Geiger et al., 2011</xref>). As expected, all the detected Ser-ADPr marks increased in cells exposed to oxidative DNA damage for 10 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Leidecker et al., 2016</xref>). However, after 120 min of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment, Ser-ADPr returned to levels similar to the untreated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>), demonstrating that Ser-ADPr is also a reversible modification.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.28533.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Histone serine ADP-ribose modification is reversible.</title><p>U2OS cells were treated with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and analysed at indicated time-points.

This raised the question of how ADPr attached to serine residues is removed from its protein targets. We reasoned that a known hydrolase or its homologue could be responsible for the removal of Ser-ADPr. Previous research has found protein ADP-ribosyl hydrolase activity in proteins bearing one of two evolutionari﻿ly unrelated domains: a ADP-ribosylglycohydrolase (DraG-like) fold (pfam PF03747) and a macrodomain (pfam PF01661) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Glowacki et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Oka et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rack et al., 2016</xref>). Therefore, we screened all known human ADP-ribosylhydrolases, belonging to either the macrodomain family (PARG, TARG1, MACROD1, and MACROD2) or to DraG family (ARH1, ARH2 and ARH3) for their ability to cleave Ser-ADPr. We also tested human macrodomains (such as ALC1 and MACROH2A) that are thought to be devoid of catalytic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ahel et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Timinszky et al., 2009</xref>). We used a well-defined histone H3 peptide fragment (aa 1-21) as a known substrate for serine mono-ADP-ribosylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bonfiglio et al., 2017a</xref>) which we then incubated with each of the previously mentioned proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Strikingly, only ARH3 was able to catalyse removal of ADPr from the histone peptide, implicating a serine ADP-ribosylhydrolase activity. Preceding studies with ARH3 found poly(ADP-ribosyl) hydrolase activity, but inability to remove terminal arginine, or other amino acid, ADP-ribose linkages that were known prior to discovery of Ser-ADPr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Oka et al., 2006</xref>). As expected, we also observed that both PARG and ARH3 were able to degrade the PAR chains on automodified PARP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, lanes 2 and 8), albeit ARH3 was less efficient in removing the chains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mueller-Dieckmann et al., 2006</xref>). We then performed a similar experiment using full length recombinant histone H1, which can be ADP-ribosylated by PARP1 on serine residues in the presence of HPF1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bonfiglio et al., 2017a</xref>). Whilst ARH3 was able to remove both the PARylation and mono(ADP-ribosyl)ation of H1, PARG was only able to degrade the PAR chains on histone H1 and PARP1, leaving a mono(ADP-ribosyl)ation signal that was visible as two distinct bands at the sizes of H1 and PARP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). This may be expected given the inability of PARG to process mono(ADP-ribosyl)ation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Slade et al., 2011</xref>). The other glycohydrolases had no discernible effect on the modification of either PARP1 or histone H1.

We prepared these substrates by incubating H1 and HPF1 together with either wild type, or E988Q mutant PARP1 for a modification reaction. The E988Q mutation alters the activity of PARP1 to that of mono-ADP-ribosylation, so in this way we were able to generate Ser mono-ADPr modifications on a protein target that is otherwise PARylated under wild type conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B–C</xref>). The activities of the hydrolases tested against PARylation products yielded the same result as before in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> – both PARG and ARH3 degraded the PAR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, lanes 2 and 4 - upper panel); and collapsed the protein signal for PARP1 and H1 proteins as seen by Coomassie stain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, compare lane 1 with lanes 2 and 4; - lower panel). However, the serine mono-ADP-ribosylated histone H1 samples were only hydrolysed by ARH3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, lane 9), with no notable reduction in mono-ADP-ribose band intensity by the other hydrolases, including PARG. Although it cannot be resolved well in these gels, we consistently observed a small but notable shift in the stained protein signal after the reaction with ARH3, suggesting the reversal of serine mono(ADP-ribosyl)ated H1 into its unmodified form (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> compare lane 9 to lanes 6, 7, 8, and 10).</p><p>To investigate whether ARH3 is also capable of removing ADPr from histones purified from cells that had been modified on serine upon DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bonfiglio et al., 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Leidecker et al., 2016</xref>), we carried out quantitative proteomics experiments using a SILAC approach. Core histones purified from heavy labeled H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-treated cells (Lys8) were incubated in the presence or absence of ARH3 for 30 min. To quantitatively evaluate the removal of Ser-ADPr by ARH3, core histones purified from light labelled H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-treated cells (Lys0) were added as a spike-in SILAC standard. All the identified histone ADPr peptides were significantly decreased in samples treated with recombinant ARH3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>), demonstrating that this hydrolase is also able to remove Ser-ADPr from endogenous histones.</p><p>We have recently characterised the Ser-ADPr sites on the isolated automodifcation domain of PARP1 (aa 374-525) when incubated in the presence of full length PARP1 and HPF1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bonfiglio et al., 2017a</xref>). During this reaction, the isolated domain is modified on 3 serine residues and thus we were able to use it as a well-defined model to analyse removal of the Ser-ADPr from an ADP-ribosylated non-histone protein. We used purified PARP1 automodification domain with HPF1 and either wild type PARP1 or PARP1 E988Q mutant, to produce PARylated and MARylated substrates (respectively) for the hydrolase reactions and then tested them with ARH3, MACROD2, TARG1 or ARH1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>).

In order to detect the effects of ARH3 KO on ADPr levels we used two different antibodies; the widely used anti-PAR antibody which recognises only long PAR chains, and a macrodomain recombinant fusion protein that binds all forms of ADPr including mono and short oligo-ADPr (described here as a pan-ADPr antibody) which has been recently developed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gibson et al., 2016</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>).

Given that we have determined that ARH3 is specific for Ser-ADPr and that this hydrolase does not remove ADPr from several other known target amino acids, we set to employ ARH3 for the establishment of a simple alternative approach for monitoring the modification of known Ser-ADPr target proteins. We reasoned that the new pan-ADPr reagent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gibson et al., 2016</xref>), which by itself does not distinguish between different amino acid specificities, in combination with ARH3 could discern the presence of histone Ser-ADPr by immunoblotting. Identically to what we observed for in vitro Ser-ADPr on peptides and proteins, ARH3 completely removes ADPr from core histones derived from DNA damage treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). This confirms our previous mass spectrometric analyses that conclusively identified histone ADPr on serine, but not other residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Leidecker et al., 2016</xref>), thus providing further indication of serines as the exclusive modification sites on core histones under these experimental conditions. Next, we implemented this newly established approach to confirm the reversibility of histone Ser-ADPr in DNA repair indicated by our SILAC spike-in experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). As expected, following a strong induction of histone Ser-ADPr after 10 min of treatment with peroxide, the modification is completely reversed after 120 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). This strategy based on ARH3 is set to enhance and significantly facilitate any further investigation of Ser-ADPr on established substrates.<fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.28533.013</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>ARH3 as a tool for recognizing histone Ser-ADPr.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Core histones were purified from U2OS cells treated with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> for the indicated time points.

As with all homeostatic and stress control systems, this level of regulation relies on reversibility to maintain balance, in this case the fine-tuning of the attachment and removal of PTMs. In fact, disruption of the enzymes responsible for deconjugational (and conjugational) dynamics of PTMs often leads to disease states. This also applies to ADP-ribosylation, as disregulation of mono- or poly-ADPr processes can result in neurodegenerative disorders and cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bütepage et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hanai et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rouleau et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sharifi et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>We recently discovered serine ADP-ribosylation (Ser-ADPr) as a novel modification of proteins involved in genome stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bonfiglio et al., 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Leidecker et al., 2016</xref>). Our data identified nearly 300 hundred Ser-ADPr modification sites in proteins extracted from living cells, suggesting that this PTM is widespread across a breadth of pathways including; DNA repair, chromatin organisation, mitotic nuclear division, DNA recombination, transcriptional regulation and mRNA splicing amongst others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bonfiglio et al., 2017a</xref>). We further showed that at least a fraction of these Ser-ADPr targets are modified by the HPF1/PARP1/2 complex, including histones, PARP1 itself and High Mobility Group (HMG) proteins, as we were able to reconstitute the sites in vitro using recombinant proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bonfiglio et al., 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gibbs-Seymour et al., 2016</xref>). These findings raised an obvious question of whether Ser-ADPr modification is reversible and which enzyme is responsible for said activity. ARH3 has previously been demonstrated to cleave PAR chains, although less rapidly than PARG, but also to hydrolyse O-acetyl-ADP-ribose by-products generated by Sir2 deacetylases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mashimo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Oka et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ono et al., 2006</xref>). Here, we established that ARH3 is also capable of efficiently removing Ser-ADPr in a magnesium-dependent manner, and that mutation of key aspartate residues (which are also critical for PAR cleavage) ablates this activity. Given our previous discoveries that Ser-ADPr is a widespread modification in the human proteome following DNA damage, the identification of ARH3 as the first enzyme that is able to hydrolyse Ser-ADPr may prove a critical advance in understanding control of NAD signalling and ADP-ribosylation in regulation of genome stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bonfiglio et al., 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Leidecker et al., 2016</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C and D</xref>).</p><p>Prior observations suggest a wide distribution of ARH3 throughout the cell; cytosol, nucleus and mitochondria—an interesting array of localisations given that the ARH3 protein possesses a mitochondrial targeting peptide at the N-terminus (both in Human and Murine proteins) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mashimo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Niere et al., 2012</xref>). Despite the wide cellular distribution, all described ARH3 functions so far seem to converge on safeguarding genome stability. Previous studies suggested that ARH3 functioned in the degradation of PAR chains that had been released by both nuclear and cytosolic PARG following the oxidative stress exposure. As a result of this cooperation, ARH3 buffers the Parthanatos response (a Caspase-independent cell death induced by the transport and binding of PAR to mitochondrial protein AIF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mashimo et al., 2013</xref>). Furthermore, ARH3 KO MEFs were found to be sensitive to hydrogen peroxide compared to wild type cells, and in the absence of ARH3 protein PAR was observed to accumulate in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mashimo et al., 2013</xref>). Additionally, the sensitivity of the ARH3 KO MEFs to hydrogen peroxide was rescued by treatment with a PARP1 inhibitor, linking the function of ARH3 to the PARP1 controlled DNA damage response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mashimo et al., 2013</xref>). Here, we have described ARH3’s Ser-ADP-ribosylhydrolase activity which offers a more parsimonious explanation of the susceptibility of ARH3 KO cells to DNA damage. We have previously observed DNA damage induced Ser-ADP-ribosylation of histones and other proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bonfiglio et al., 2017a</xref>), and now we report that ARH3 is necessary for the reversal of these modifications. We also detected persistence of ADPr on numerous proteins in human ARH3 KO cells and found that ARH3 is a major hydrolyse that demodifies these proteins post DNA damage. These data suggest a conserved role for ARH3 in the response to DNA damage and the regulation of ADPr signalling.</p><p>The ADP-ribose linked to serine via an <italic>O</italic>-glycosidic bond is chemically similar to the ribose-ribose bond within the ADP-ribose polymer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bonfiglio et al., 2017b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Leidecker et al., 2016</xref>). Consequently, it may be unsurprising that ARH3 can both degrade PAR chains and remove MARylation from serine residues. This observation raises a discrepancy between PARG and ARH3; both are able to hydrolyse PAR, neither are able to cleave ester bonds between the proximal ADPr unit and protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barkauskaite et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Oka et al., 2006</xref>), yet ARH3 can cleave Ser-ADPr glycosidic bonds and completely remove the ADPr chains attached to serine residues in proteins. Architecturally, both enzymes are clearly distinct from each other, with PARG adopting a macrodomain fold with a unique catalytic loop allowing for hydrolysis of ADPr, whilst ARH3 has an eponymous ARH fold featuring a binucleate Mg<sup>2+</sup> catalytic site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barkauskaite et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mueller-Dieckmann et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Slade et al., 2011</xref>). Both enzymes perform acid-base catalysis in PAR hydrolysis, but PARG has a preference for binding to the long PAR chains and is inefficient in hydrolysing short oligo-ADPr fragments and incapable or removing mono-ADPr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barkauskaite et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hatakeyama et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mueller-Dieckmann et al., 2006</xref>). Altogether, these observations suggest functional differences between PARG and ARH3, but also potential redundancies. More elaborate future structural and functional studies will be needed to resolve these questions as well as the Ser-ADPr specificity of ARH3.</p><p>Advanced mass spectrometry has played an indispensable role in the discovery of Ser-ADPr as a widespread signal in DNA repair and in the identification of the enzymes and cofactors responsible for its attachment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bonfiglio et al., 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Leidecker et al., 2016</xref>). However, these findings have opened up many questions that currently cannot be addressed efficiently as only a limited number of researchers have both expertise and access to advanced instrumentation needed for unbiased and unambiguous mass spectrometric analysis of ADPr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bonfiglio et al., 2017b</xref>). Thus to broaden the study of the amino acid specificities of ADPr we employed the strikingly specific activity of ARH3 as a practical analytical tool to discern the presence of Ser-ADPr without the need for mass spectrometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C and D</xref>). In combination with available biological techniques and tools, such as the anti-pan ADPr binding reagent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gibson et al., 2016</xref>), we showed that ARH3 allows a simple exploration of histone Ser-ADPr dynamics during DNA damage response.</p><p>In summary, here we present ARH3 as a serine ADP-ribosylhydrolase that functions to reverse the PARP1/HPF1 mediated modification of histones and other proteins modified on serine residues. This thread of investigation has delineated a novel aspect of cellular ADP-ribosylation, an intricate level of control of ADPr signal transduction that requires specific protein tools. Understanding the activities, tendencies and regulation of these proteins may provide key insights into diseases and disorders that either rely on common ADP-ribosylation pathways, or suffer from the lack of a key protein that breaks the carefully balanced ADPr homeostasis.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Material and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Antibodies</title><p>Anti-PAR Polyclonal Antibody (rabbit) was purchased from Trevigen ﻿(Gaithersburg, MD﻿, ﻿U﻿S﻿).

Proteins were eluted with elution buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 2 M NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT) in 10 fractions. Eluted proteins (mainly core histones) were precipitated overnight in 4% (v/v) PCA at 4°C. The fractions were then centrifuged at 21,000 g at 4°C for 45 min and the resulting pellets were washed with 4% PCA (2 × 1 ml), 0.2% HCl in acetone (2 × 1 ml), acetone (2 × 1 ml).</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Western blot analysis</title><p>For Western blot analysis, samples were subjected to a standard SDS-PAGE method. Proteins were transferred to PVDF membranes (Merck Millipore). Membranes were then blocked with TBS-T buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20% and 5% non-fat dried milk) and incubated overnight with primary antibodies at 4°C, followed by a one hour incubation with peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies at room temperature. Blots were developed using ECL Select and signals were captured using a ChemiDoc MP System (Bio-Rad). Dilutions used for the primary antibodies were: Anti-poly-ADP-ribose: diluted at 1:2000, Anti-pan-ADP-ribose binding reagent: diluted 1:1000.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Mass spectrometric analysis</title><p>Proteins were digested using partial FASP as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Leidecker et al., 2016</xref>). After digestion, peptides were desalted on either C18 cartridges (3M Empore) or using in-house manufactured StageTips (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rappsilber et al., 2003</xref>), depending on the peptide amounts. Eluted peptides were dried down in ﻿a Speedvac concentrator and resuspended in 0.1% FA prior to LC-MS/MS analysis. Liquid chromatography and MS for all LC-MS/MS runs were performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bonfiglio et al., 2017a</xref>). For unambiguous identification of ADPr sites on PARP1 E988Q and H1 from in vitro reactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), ETD fragmentation was used, with the same parameters as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bonfiglio et al., 2017a</xref>). For histone Ser-ADPr quantification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D and E</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) HCD fragmentation was used, using the same conditions as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bonfiglio et al., 2017a</xref>).

responses. A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Serine ADP-ribosylation removal by the hydrolase ARH3&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Ivan Dikic as Reviewing Editor and Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors present a thorough analysis of the reversal of the posttranslational modification of serines with ADP-ribose. They report the identification of ARH3 as the ADP-ribosylhydrolase working on Ser-ADP-ribosylation. The study used mass spectrometry to clearly demonstrate that the serine modification is reversible. Using a panel of purified proteins that were considered likely candidates to process serine-ADP-ribose, the study identified ARH3 as an enzyme capable of reversing this modification. The panel of enzymes make a nice tool set for the identification of potential modification types in other proteins. The identification of serine modification is an exciting development in the PARP field, and the current study addresses a key question that many groups are certainly working toward.</p><p>With the identification of ARH3 as the serine-ADP-ribosylhydrolase, serine ADP-ribosylation is now also an enzymatically fully reversible post-translational modification. This is a very important finding and warrants high visibility that would be achieved by publishing in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The relevance of ARH3 in reversing Ser-ADPrylation in vivo. Authors identify ARH3 as an enzyme that efficiently reverses serine ADPrylation in vitro. The presented experiments do not exclude the possibility that other yet unknown enzymes might also reverse serine ADPrylation and that ARH3 is important for the reversal in a cellular context. The authors should test whether ARH3 is required for removal of SerADPr in vivo, for instance by knocking down ARH3 and then monitoring the amount of Serine-ADPr by mass spectrometry and WB.</p><p>2) Specificity: The biochemical assays showed virtually complete reversal of histone peptide serine-ADP-ribose in the presence of ARH3, yet the signal for modified PARP1 protein was reduced to a similar level by PARG and ARH3. Why is ARH3 not efficient in completely removing ADPr from PARP1 whereas it does so on histones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B, C and D</xref>). These reactions were done with HPF so the ADPr on PARP1 should be on serine. Could the authors provide some information about the activity of PARG and ARH3 in removing poly SerADPr? Is one enzyme more active than another in assays that are done by authors? What is to be expected in vivo?</p><p>3) The manuscript could be improved by giving a better description of what we already know about ARH3 in terms of cellular localization, expression level, etc., The discussion about the possible importance of ARH3 in DNA damage response in light of previous studies on ARH3 and findings presented in this manuscript should be extended.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.28533.016</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic></p><p> <italic>1) The relevance of ARH3 in reversing Ser-ADPrylation</italic> in vivo<italic>.

We generated ARH3 KO cells in which we show by WB and MS that levels of Ser-ADPr are drastically increased when compared to control cells, especially post DNA damage. MS analyses showed that ARH3 KO cells show strong increase in Ser-ADPr of histones (40-fold for the best quantified histone ADPr mark, H2BS6-ADPr) 2 hours post DNA damage (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C and D</xref>). Finally, in vitro complementation experiments with recombinant enzymes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>) show that ADP-ribosylation persisting in ARH3 KO cell extracts can be efficiently erased by adding recombinant ARH3, but not by PARG or MACROD2.</p><p> <italic>2) Specificity: The biochemical assays showed virtually complete reversal of histone peptide serine-ADP-ribose in the presence of ARH3, yet the signal for modified PARP1 protein was reduced to a similar level by PARG and ARH3. Why is ARH3 not efficient in completely removing ADPr from PARP1 whereas it does so on histones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B, C and D</xref>). These reactions were done with HPF so the ADPr on PARP1 should be on serine. Could the authors provide some information about the activity of PARG and ARH3 in removing poly SerADPr?

What is to be expected</italic> in vivo<italic>?</italic></p><p>We suspect that this comment addresses <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A, B</xref> and C. The in vitro activity of ARH3 against PAR on PARP1 chains is 10 times slower than that of PARG (Mueller-Dieckmann et al., 2006; Oka, Kato and Moss, 2005). In our in vitro reactions, we also have substrates with serine-ADPr that additionally compete with modified PARP1 for ARH3 activity. As a consequence, ARH3 cannot fully process the PAR substrate and often yields a smeared PAR signal, rather than neatly collapsing the PAR signal into a single band as always seen with PARG (see for example the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). We further used a combination of PARG and ARH3 to show that the majority of PARylated sites on PARP1 (in the presence of HPF1) are on serine residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Our new data shows that the situation is similar in cells (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>); while dynamics of the long PAR chains is less affected in ARH3 KO cells thanks to active PARG protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>; panel with PAR antibody), the removal of short oligo- and mono-ADPr chains is dramatically affected in ARH3 KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, panel with pan-ADPr antibody). These observation match the in vitro data and the model proposed by Hatakeyama et al., 1986 which shows that PARG preferentially cleaves long PAR chains, with the <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> value for long PAR chains being 1% of that for small ones.</p><p> <italic>3) The manuscript could be improved by giving a better description of what we already know about ARH3 in terms of cellular localization, expression level, etc., The discussion about the possible importance of ARH3 in DNA damage response in light of previous studies on ARH3 and findings presented in this manuscript should be extended.</italic></p><p>The knowledge about the cellular distribution of ARH3 and phenotypes induced by its loss of function are very limited (Niere et al., 2012; Mashimo et al., 2013). We have now extended the discussion, reporting all that is currently known.</p></body></sub-article></article>
