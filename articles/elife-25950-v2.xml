(HGT) plays a major role in the spread of antibiotic resistance. Of particular concern are <italic>Acinetobacter baumannii</italic> bacteria, which recently emerged as global pathogens, with nosocomial mortality rates reaching 19–54% (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2013; Joly Guillou, 2005; Talbot et al., 2006). <italic>Acinetobacter</italic> gains antibiotic resistance remarkably rapidly (Antunes et al., 2014; Joly Guillou, 2005), with multi drug-resistance (MDR) rates exceeding 60% (Antunes et al., 2014; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2013). Despite growing concern (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2013; Talbot et al., 2006), the mechanisms underlying this extensive HGT remain poorly understood (Adams et al., 2008; Fournier et al., 2006; Imperi et al., 2011; Ramirez et al., 2010; Wilharm et al., 2013). Here, we show bacterial predation by <italic>Acinetobacter baylyi</italic> increases cross-species HGT by orders of magnitude, and we observe predator cells functionally acquiring adaptive resistance genes from adjacent prey. We then develop a population-dynamic model quantifying killing and HGT on solid surfaces. We show DNA released via cell lysis is readily available for HGT and may be partially protected from the environment, describe the effects of cell density, and evaluate potential environmental inhibitors. These findings establish a framework for understanding, quantifying, and combating HGT within the microbiome and the emergence of MDR super-bugs.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25950.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Every year, antibiotics save millions of lives, but this may not last forever. The bacteria that cause infections are getting smarter and continuously evolve genes to become resistant to antibiotics, which makes it harder to kill them. In many cases, using stronger drugs can bypass this problem, but some 'super-bugs' are developing resistance to every drug we have. For example, the bacterium <italic>Acinetobacter baumannii</italic> has recently been classified as a global threat that kills thousands of people every year, which placed it on a top six 'most wanted' list for multi drug-resistant bacteria. Worryingly, this drug resistance seems to develop faster than 'standard' evolution would allow, making it difficult to keep up with developing new effective drugs.</p><p>One way bacteria can shortcut the evolution of resistance is through a process called horizontal gene transfer, in which they collect resistance genes from other bacteria. Some bacteria can speed up this gene transfer by actively killing their neighbors to extract their DNA. However, until now, this process has not been observed directly, and it was not fully understood where and when killing neighbors becomes important for gene transfer.</p><p>Now, Cooper, Tsimring and Hasty have studied a relative of <italic>A. baumannii</italic> called <italic>A. baylyi</italic>. Together with another type of bacteria that contained green fluorescence genes, <italic>A. baylyi</italic> was placed onto a surface that allowed both species to grow. As the two types of bacteria grew together, <italic>A. baylyi</italic> started to kill the other one and stole their genes. This happened so often that some started to become fluorescent, which could be observed in real time under a microscope. <italic>A. baylyi</italic> also stole genes for antibiotic resistance, and when an antibiotic was added, the bacteria with the stolen resistance genes kept growing and dividing, while the others were killed.</p><p>Cooper et al. then developed a mathematical model to quantify and simulate this killing-enhanced horizontal gene transfer. The results showed that killing other bacteria made gene transfer more effective when the number of <italic>A. baylyi</italic> was high and the number of 'victims' was low – and also when they were together for a shorter period.</p><p>This work may help to explain how <italic>Acinetobacter</italic> and similar bacteria develop drug resistance so quickly. A next step will be to measure and compare gene transfer parameters in different types of bacteria. A better understanding of how, where, and when gene transfer happens, may in the future help to guide strategies to fight resistance.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>Acinetobacter baylyi</italic></kwd><kwd>horizontal gene transfer</kwd><kwd>antibiotic resistance</kwd><kwd>natural competence</kwd><kwd>multi-drug resistance</kwd><kwd>microbial population dynamics</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006792</institution-id><institution>Hartwell Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cooper</surname><given-names>Robert M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>San Diego Center for Systems Biology (P50 GM085764)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cooper</surname><given-names>Robert M</given-names></name><name><surname>Tsimring</surname><given-names>Lev</given-names></name><name><surname>Hasty</surname><given-names>Jeff</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Killing their neighbors allows bacteria to steal genes, including antibiotic resistance genes, which we observed under a microscope, quantified, modeled, and predicted potentially guiding strategies to combat it.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The spread of antibiotic resistance among pathogenic microbes is a major and growing threat to public health. Gram-negative <italic>Acinetobacter</italic> spp. are a particularly worrisome example - these bacteria thrive in hospital settings, causing around 9% of nosocomial infections, particularly in the respiratory tract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Joly-Guillou, 2005</xref>). This prevalence, combined with high levels of antibiotic resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Antunes et al., 2014</xref>), has led the Infectious Diseases Society of America to designate <italic>Acinetobacter baumanii</italic> one of six particularly problematic multidrug-resistant (MDR) pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Talbot et al., 2006</xref>) and the US Centers for Disease Control to assign it threat level ‘Serious’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 2013</xref>).</p><p>Much of the threat posed by <italic>Acinetobacter</italic> stems from its ability to acquire drug resistance via horizontal gene transfer (HGT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Peleg et al., 2012</xref>). <italic>Acinetobacter</italic> has a remarkably high rate of HGT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Touchon et al., 2014</xref>), and many antibiotic resistance genes in clinical isolates appear to have been recently acquired from other human pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fournier et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Imperi et al., 2011</xref>). Although <italic>A. baumanii</italic> can be naturally competent in vitro under some conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ramirez et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wilharm et al., 2013</xref>), it is not understood at the population level how <italic>Acinetobacter</italic> acquires foreign genes at such high rates in real-world conditions, particularly considering that extracellular DNA is rapidly degraded or sequestered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nielsen et al., 2007</xref>). For example, DNA lost its transforming ability with a half life of around 1 hr in soil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nielsen et al., 2000</xref>) and 1 min in saliva (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mercer et al., 1999</xref>), and ingested DNA was unable to transform even highly competent <italic>A. baylyi</italic> within the mouse gut (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Nordgård et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Many <italic>Streptococcus</italic> species also actively exchange genetic material in natural environments. Some of these species use quorum sensing to enhance HGT by co-regulating competence (the ability to take up extracellular DNA) with secretion of diffusible bacteriocins (small protein toxins) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Steinmoen et al., 2002</xref>). These toxins cause the release of potential donor DNA by lysing nearby sister cells (fratricide) or closely related species (sobrinocide) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Johnsborg et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kreth et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wei and Håvarstein, 2012</xref>), thereby making their genes available for uptake. However, fratricide-enhanced HGT has not been observed outside <italic>Streptococcus</italic>, and the narrow target range of bacteriocins limits potential DNA donors. Another killing mechanism, the contact-dependent type-VI secretion system (T6SS), is conserved across a much broader range of bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Schwarz et al., 2010a</xref>). Recently, <italic>Vibrio cholera</italic> was shown to similarly co-regulate T6SS expression with competence, also enhancing HGT within biofilms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Borgeaud et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>In this work, we extend the observation of killing-enhanced HGT to <italic>Acinetobacter</italic>, and we develop an experimental and modeling framework to quantify the population dynamics of this phenomenon within microbial communities. As a model system, we used <italic>Acinetobacter baylyi</italic>, which is closely related to <italic>A. baumannii</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Touchon et al., 2014</xref>), because it is genetically tractable, fully sequenced, and well-studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Elliott and Neidle, 2011</xref>). The two also share the key features of T6SS-mediated killing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Weber et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carruthers et al., 2013</xref>) and natural competence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ramirez et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wilharm et al., 2013</xref>), and they are similar enough that standard phenotypic assays used in the clinic often fail to distinguish between them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>We show that <italic>A. baylyi</italic> uses its T6SS to lyse and acquire genes from neighboring <italic>E. coli</italic> cells, and that this process is frequent enough to observe functional and adaptive HGT from prey to predator cells in real time. Prey cell DNA released by predator cells is also available for uptake by other nearby, non-killing cells, highlighting the importance of polymicrobial population dynamics in HGT and the emergence of MDR. To understand the population dynamics of killing-enhanced HGT, we develop a model quantifying both neighbor killing and natural transformation. HGT parameters fit using naked DNA predict transfer of genes released via neighbor killing surprisingly well, suggesting DNA released from cell lysis in situ is readily available for uptake. Using this model, we characterize the impact of neighbor killing on HGT in a wide range of environmental conditions and evaluate potential inhibition strategies, and we experimentally confirm the key predictions. Contact-dependent neighbor killing may be a widespread contributor to HGT among gram-negative bacteria, and for <italic>Acinetobacter</italic> in particular, killing-enhanced HGT may play a key role in the emergence of clinically pervasive MDR ‘super-bug’ strains. In this context, our dynamic model should be useful for predicting and combating HGT of antibiotic resistance.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Killing-enhanced horizontal gene transfer in <italic>Acinetobacter</italic></title><p>To study the population dynamics generated by contact-dependent cell killing, we designed a custom microfluidic device (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) enabling visualization of spatially structured communities at single-cell resolution in a monolayer. We seeded the device with a simplified community consisting of predator <italic>A. baylyi</italic> strain ADP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Elliott and Neidle, 2011</xref>) (the predator) that kill directly adjacent, GFP-expressing <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (the prey) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Basler et al., 2013</xref>). As expected, we observed spontaneous lysis of individual <italic>E. coli</italic> adjacent to <italic>Acinetobacter</italic> cells. Serendipitously, a few <italic>Acinetobacter</italic> cells spontaneously began expressing GFP, suggesting that they had acquired the GFP gene via HGT from DNA released by lysed <italic>E. coli</italic>.</p><p>In our initial experiments, the GFP-expressing plasmid in <italic>E. coli</italic> had a ColE1 origin of replication that does not stably replicate in <italic>Acinetobacter</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Palmen et al., 1993</xref>).

To test whether this directly observed HGT would be enough to provide a population-level selective advantage, we used our microfluidic chip to visualize functional HGT of antibiotic resistance in real time. We seeded the microfluidic device with mCherry-expressing <italic>Acinetobacter</italic> alongside <italic>E. coli</italic> carrying pBAV1k-GFP, grew them for just under 12 hr to allow <italic>E. coli</italic> lysis and HGT to occur, and then added kanamycin (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video7">Videos 7,S8</xref>). Within about 7 hr of kanamycin addition, multiple HGT events could be visibly identified by the emergence of GFP-expressing <italic>Acinetobacter</italic> (arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e–g</xref>). Only those <italic>Acinetobacter</italic> that were expressing GFP, indicating horizontal transfer of kanamycin resistance, continued to grow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1h</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video7">Videos 7</xref>,<xref ref-type="video" rid="video8">8</xref>), while the parental GFP-negative <italic>Acinetobacter</italic> cells became smaller and stopped dividing.

This likely indicates a spatial effect - actively killing predator cells will be physically closest to the DNA released from their lysed prey. Together with experiments below showing HGT inhibition by extracellular DNase (Figure 7e), these results support a model in which the T6SS releases DNA into the extracellular environment via lysis of neighboring cells, thereby making it available for uptake by any nearby cell, but the T6SS is not directly involved in DNA uptake (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2j</xref>).</p><p>To further characterize killing-enhanced HGT in <italic>Acinetobacter</italic>, we analyzed the effect of genetic context. Previous experiments have shown that <italic>A. baylyi</italic> is competent to take up and replicate plasmids with a limited set of origins of replication, they require genomic homology for efficient recombination into their genome, and both genomic and plasmid DNA can serve as a source for recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Palmen et al., 1993</xref>). However, those experiments were done using chemically purified, exogenously added DNA. Therefore, we experimentally confirmed them for the specific case of killing-enhanced HGT.</p><p>We co-cultured <italic>Acinetobacter</italic> on agar plates with <italic>E. coli</italic> containing each of three different bait plasmids conferring kan resistance: pBAV1k that replicates in both species, pRC03 that cannot replicate in <italic>Acinetobacter</italic>, and pRC03H - a derivative of pRC03 containing 3 kb of <italic>Acinetobacter</italic> genomic homology to promote genomic integration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">de Vries and Wackernagel, 2002</xref>). <italic>Acinetobacter</italic> acquired the kan resistance gene from either pBAV1k or pRC03H, but not from pRC03 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1a</xref>). We also tested whether contact-dependent killing enables <italic>Acinetobacter</italic> to efficiently acquire genes from the <italic>E. coli</italic> genome. To do so, we created a bait plasmid containing kan resistance adjacent to 22 kb of <italic>Acinetobacter</italic> genomic homology. We transformed this plasmid into <italic>E. coli</italic> to create a plasmid bait strain, and then we integrated it into the <italic>E. coli</italic> genome to create a genomic bait strain (see Materials and methods). <italic>Acinetobacter</italic> acquired the kan resistance gene regardless of its location (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1b</xref>), but HGT was approximately 100-fold lower when the kan gene was in the <italic>E. coli</italic> genome. Considering that the bait plasmid had a pBR322 origin of replication, with 10–20 plasmids per cell, the per-copy difference was only about 5- to 10-fold.</p><p>Finally, we picked three double-resistant <italic>Acinetobacter</italic> clones each that had acquired either the replicating or homology plasmid for further analysis, isolated both plasmid and genomic DNA, and confirmed that the replicating plasmid pBAV1k had transferred as an episomal unit, whereas the homology plasmid pRC03H had integrated into the genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). These results do not rule out additional lower frequency mechanisms, but they indicate that previous characterizations of competence using purified DNA are equally applicable to in situ HGT within spatially structured microbial communities.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Quantifying microbial population dynamics of killing-enhanced gene transfer</title><p>While killing-enhanced HGT has now been observed in multiple genera, little is known about the population dynamics of this process, its efficiency, or how that efficiency is influenced by environmental conditions. This lack of understanding is largely due to the absence of a quantitative method to measure mechanistic HGT parameters. Currently, HGT is generally quantified using the fraction of transformed CFUs or transformed CFUs per ng of DNA. This is problematic, because results depend on multiple parameters extrinsic to inherent competence, including cell concentration, DNA concentration, and incubation time. This makes results difficult to compare across experiments, conditions, strains, or even labs. A more useful approach would be to quantify transformation using variables intrinsic to the cells and the DNA, such as the DNA uptake rate and transformation efficiency per molecule of DNA. To this end, we developed a population dynamic model of spatially structured microbial communities that couples transformation via natural competence and contact-dependent killing (summarized in <xref

model parameters pertaining to growth, transformation, and killing can each be measured sequentially in simplified conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). For all parameter fitting, we incubated cells in spots on agar plates, the same condition used to measure HGT in dual-species communities (see Materials and methods). First, we measured growth parameters for each species separately (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">2</xref>, and see Materials and methods). Second, we fit the natural transformation parameters using data obtained by mixing <italic>Acinetobacter</italic> with known concentrations of the genomically integrating kan resistance plasmid pRC03H-2S, derived from pRC03H used earlier, with higher efficiency integration via fully homolgous recombination (HR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Palmen et al., 1993</xref>), rather than homology-facilitated illegitimate recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">de Vries and Wackernagel, 2002</xref>) as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, see Materials and methods. We incubated the cell-DNA mixtures on agar plates, and then we counted the number of cells that had acquired kan resistance. To obtain values for the HGT parameters, we simultaneously fit data from time courses with either limiting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>) or saturating (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>) DNA, and from DNA dilution series with cells harvested at different time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>). Third, we fit parameters for T6SS-mediated killing by mixing different concentrations of <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>Acinetobacter</italic>, incubating them together on agar plates, and counting the cells of each type that were present upon harvesting. As with DNA uptake, we fit killing parameters simultaneously for several time courses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d–i</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>) and dilution series (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3j</xref>).

Therefore, we used our model to explore how well killing-enhanced HGT could be blocked by two potential environmental perturbations: either degradation by DNase or competitive inhibition with added DNA.

To quantify the efficacy of each inhibition strategy, we calculated the HGT reduction factor, defined as the ratio of HGT without inhibition to HGT with inhibition.

Our model had previously predicted contact-dependent killing-enhanced HGT to WT<italic> Acinetobacter</italic> to occur most frequently when both species begin at high density (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>), so that may be the most important condition in which to inhibit HGT. Importantly, our model predicted DNAse to remain effective even at high initial cell density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>), whereas competing DNA was predicted to dramatically lose efficacy in that condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6f</xref>). This suggests that DNase may better inhibit HGT in dense communities such as biofilms than competitive inhibition with exogenous DNA. Regardless of the inhibition strategy, killing consistently increased HGT to the wild type relative to the killing mutant, even in the presence of the inhibitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6d,h</xref>).</p><p>Finally, we experimentally tested the predictions from our model, focusing on cases with relatively high cell numbers where HGT events are detectable.

Similarly, killing provides less HGT enhancement when the interaction time is longer, because killing <italic>Acinetobacter</italic> deplete their donor DNA source by killing neighboring prey <italic>E. coli</italic>, whereas the non-killing mutants have a slower, but exponentially growing, source of DNA from spontaneously lysing <italic>E. coli</italic>.</p><p>Interestingly, this seeding ratio at which contact-dependent killing most enhances HGT - when the predator outnumbers the prey - is the same condition in which it provides the strongest competitive advantage in terms of cell growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Borenstein et al., 2015</xref>). High predator cell density is also the condition that induces fratricide-mediated HGT in <italic>Streptococci</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Steinmoen et al., 2002</xref>) and simultaneously induces both T6SS expression and competence in <italic>V. cholera</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Borgeaud et al., 2015</xref>). However, T6SS regulation does not always depend on high cell density, and it can be quite complex and varied, even within strains of the same species, likely reflecting the wide range of ecological contexts and functions performed by the T6SS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Miyata et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bernard et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Weber et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Weber et al., 2015</xref>). Given that the only demonstrated advantages are at high cell density, it remains an open question what, if any, selective advantages the T6SS may provide at lower cell density. While T6SS regulation in <italic>A. baylyi</italic> has not been extensively characterized with respect to cell density (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Weber et al., 2016</xref>), it is active and functional in standard in vitro conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Weber et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Basler et al., 2013</xref>), and we observed T6SS-mediated killing of <italic>E. coli</italic> at all times in the Supplemental <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Videos 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="video" rid="video6">6</xref>.</p><p>We also used our model to evaluate the effect of two conditions that may inhibit HGT: addition of either competing DNA or DNAse. Although our model predicted neither condition would eliminated the HGT enhancement provided by killing in our model, both strategies were predicted to reduce HGT when at realistic levels. DNA degradation began to reduce HGT when DNA half life was less than 2–3 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>), which is just longer than the half life of free DNA in saliva, about 1 min (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mercer et al., 1999</xref>). Competing DNA began to reduce HGT at about 10<sup>9</sup> kb or greater (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6e</xref>), and given that our agar spots could support 10<sup>7</sup>–10<sup>8</sup> cells, that would be 10–100 kb of extracellular DNA per cell at carrying capacity.</p><p>Importantly, DNase was predicted to be more effective than competing DNA at high cell seeding densities, which is the condition where contact-dependent killing-enhanced HGT is most efficient. Our experimental results supported this, showing that DNase can reduce HGT to wild type <italic>Acinetobacter</italic> by nearly 10<sup>4</sup>-fold even at high seeding densities, whereas 10<sup>11</sup> kb of competing DNA was ineffective at high cell density. The reduced efficacy of competing DNA in this condition is likely because the high initial killing rate releases a large amount of prey DNA at once, overcoming competitive inhibition.</p><p>Interestingly, competing DNA was nearly 10-fold less effective than predicted, which may reflect its physical exclusion from dense microbial communities, or the fact that our model does not reflect the spatial heterogeneity of DNA released from lysing <italic>E. coli</italic>. The potential importance of non-isotropic DNA concentration is also suggested by the observation that there appears to be a small sub-population of <italic>Acinetobacter</italic> with access to prey cell DNA protected from DNase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7e</xref>), and the observation that even in three-strain communities, HGT to <italic>Acinetobacter </italic><inline-formula><mml:math id="inf60"><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">Δ</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula><italic>hcp</italic> remains slightly lower than HGT to WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c,i</xref>). Spatial dependence of DNA concentration would be a valuable limitation to address in future work; nevertheless, the qualitative trends predicted by our model show its usefulness in guiding experiments and intuition. Additionally, the observation that contact-dependent killing appears to provide a sub-population of cells with privileged access to DNA that is protected from DNase may help explain how HGT can occur so frequently in real-world environments where DNA is quickly degraded.</p><p>While we used <italic>A. baylyi</italic> as a model for the more clinically threatening <italic>A. baumannii</italic>, the two are closely enough related that they are difficult to distinguish with standard phenotypic tests used in the clinic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2007</xref>). Indeed, careful re-examination of clinical isolates recently revealed that <italic>A. baylyi</italic> can also opportunistically infect humans, including case clusters in hospitals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2008</xref>). It was a clinical <italic>A. baylyi</italic> isolate that contained the first <italic>bla</italic>SIM-1 carbapenemase reported in China (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zhou et al., 2011</xref>), and the difficulty of distinguishing between the two suggests that <italic>A. baylyi</italic> may in fact be causing additional infections that are either misidentified as <italic>A. baumannii</italic> or identified nonspecifically as <italic>Acinetobacter</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">2008</xref>). Perhaps more importantly, <italic>A. baylyi</italic> may serve as an easily sampled reservoir of genetic diversity for <italic>A. baumannii</italic>, due to the extremely high transformability of <italic>A. baylyi</italic> coupled to the ease with which <italic>Acinetobacter</italic> species exchange DNA. For example, another carbapenemase gene, <italic>bla</italic>OXA23, has been found in multiple <italic>Acinetobacter</italic> species isolated from both humans and animals, including both <italic>A. baumannii</italic> and <italic>A. baylyi</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Smet et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nigro and Hall, 2016</xref>).</p><p>In addition to helping to explain, predict, and combat the rapid spread of multi drug-resistance, particularly among <italic>Acinetobacter</italic>, the population dynamics revealed here are likely important in the microbiome and microbial evolution more broadly. Both the T6SS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Schwarz et al., 2010a</xref>) and natural competence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Johnsborg et al., 2007</xref>) are widespread among gram-negative bacteria, and both competence and other neighbor killing mechanisms are found in both gram-negatives and gram-positives. Therefore, our results are likely broadly generalizable and may contribute to understanding the known increase of HGT within biofilms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Madsen et al., 2012</xref>). The method presented here for quantifying natural competence with standardized parameters may also help researchers address other outstanding questions about microbial evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Vos et al., 2015</xref>). In the light of a growing threat from antibiotic resistance, the quantitative methods presented here should greatly aid study of the mechanisms by which bacteria swap genes, shortcut evolution, and outsmart our drugs.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell growth, strains, plasmids, CFU counting, and HGT characterization</title><p>We obtained <italic>Acinetobacter baylyi</italic> sp.

To verify genomic integration of the kan gene from pRC03H, we isolated genomic DNA and performed inverse PCR from the kan gene. In particular, we digested the genomic DNA with SalI, diluted to 2 ng/ul, and used T4 DNA ligase to circularize the resulting fragments. Next, we performed PCR using primers pointing outward from the kan gene to amplify the circularized, surrounding genomic region.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Gisela Storz as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted the following issues that we feel you must address if this work is to be considered for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. At this point, please respond with an experimental plan and a time table for the completion of the work. The Board and reviewers will then consider your plan and issue a binding recommendation.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors report horizontal gene transfer (HGT) to <italic>Acinetobacter baylyi</italic> and show that bacterial contact-dependent predation by <italic>A. baylyi</italic> via the type VI secretion system can enhance cross-species horizontal acquisition of antibiotic resistance genes by three to four orders of magnitude. Real-time observations show predator <italic>A. baylyi</italic> cells functionally gaining multi-drug resistance through functional, adaptive, horizontal gene transfer through natural competence by lysing neighboring prey cells and horizontally acquiring the released genes. The authors then present a dynamic mechanistic population-based model to quantify this killing-enhanced gene-transfer, predict its prevalence in different conditions, and evaluate strategies to reduce it.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) All reviewers were concerned that the authors were overselling the clinical relevance of the work (given that <italic>A. baylyi</italic> is not a clinically important organism) and agreed that comments about the microbiome +biofilm aspects of the work were also overblown. At the very least these need to be toned down and some important caveats added, as the work concerns a microbiome only in a very minimal sense.</p><p>2) A major strength of the work was the combination of the experimental work and the model, but the reviewers felt the link between the two was weak and should be strengthened, ideally by testing model predictions. For example, there are predictions about the role of the predator/prey ratio and the effects of DNAse or competing DNA. Experimental validation of at least one aspect of model predictions would considerably strengthen this work (of course, it might also highlight a problem with the model, another good reason for doing it).</p><p>3) The methods were lacking precision, with insufficient detail provided to allow the work to be replicated (see https://elifesciences.org/content/5/e21070 and comments from reviewer #3).</p><p>4) It is not completely clear what is going in all the videos and stills. This needs to be clarified (see comments from reviewer #2).</p><p>5) There are well-reasoned objections to the term &quot;proximicide&quot;. A better-fitting term should be substituted.</p><p>6) The assumption that &quot;predation can occur only at the perimeter of micro-colonies&quot; needs to be supported by some images/data. It would also be helpful to compare model fits to data with and without this assumption.</p><p>7) Section 4.1 ninth paragraph reports adding DNAse to block HGT, but experimental data needs to be supplied (reviewers failed to find them anywhere).</p><p>8) The manuscript should extend the description of previous work on fratricide in Streptococcus and competence-mediated neighbor predation and transformation (see comments from reviewer #3).</p><p>The broader importance of the work should also be discussed (see comments from reviewer #4).</p><p>9) The reviewers had two concerns about the title: first, this paper is about the microbiome only in a very minimal sense. Second, the focus in the title on multi-drug resistance suggests a clinical relevance that reviewers felt was lacking, given the focus <italic>A. baylyi</italic> (a soil organism) and no good reasons for thinking the results would be directly relevant for <italic>A. baumanii</italic>. A revised title was felt to be appropriate.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>1) Section 4.1 first paragraph. I don't understand why that first result is 'unexpected'. Is it because the plasmid doesn't have an origin or replication so should not be stably maintained in <italic>Acinetobacter</italic>, or because the time would be too short to expect transfer? Could they explain this.</p><p>2) In <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Videos 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="video" rid="video6">6</xref> it is really hard to tell which bacteria is <italic>E. coli</italic> and which is <italic>Acinetobacter</italic>. The background fluorescence of the green cells at the start of the video (presumably these are <italic>E. coli</italic>, since they subsequently lyse and <italic>Acinetobacter</italic> should not be green yet) is about as high as the 'positive' green at the end of the video in <italic>Acinetobacter</italic>, so the lacI repression doesn't seem very strong. The authors say that at the end the bacteria are red and green, but in the videos I couldn't see any red + green bacteria – the red all looks bleached so the bacteria are only green. How do we know that these are <italic>E. coli</italic>? Would it be possible to trace the lineage back through the movie (only for a few, as an example) to show that these green <italic>Acinetobacter</italic> micro colonies really started as red cells, and better still that they were physically located close to an <italic>E. coli</italic> cell that subsequently lysed?</p><p>3) Section 4.1 ninth paragraph, they mention adding DNAse to block HGT – where is this data? I couldn't find it. This is a good control.</p><p>4) From the modelling part of the paper they come up with some testable predictions about the role of ratio of predator/prey and the effects of DNAse or competing DNA. Given that they have a really straightforward quantitative assay in their hands, I am wondering why they did not experimentally test some of these hypotheses. I understand the microfluidics is technically challenging, but presumably it would be straightforward enough to repeat their drug resistance acquisition experiments from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> using a few of the predicted variables?</p><p>5) Intuition behind many of the modelling results is discussed, but I think it could be worth doing this a bit more thoroughly in the appendix. Often the most useful thing about models is helping to develop this intuition.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>In the manuscript by Cooper et al. the authors describe horizontal gene transfer in <italic>Acinetobacter baylyi</italic>. Precisely, the author investigated the propensity of this organism to use kin-discriminated neighbor predation coupled to competence-mediated DNA uptake to enhance HGT. Such enhancement of HGT by killing of adjacent cells followed by the absorption of their DNA has previously been described for Gram-positive bacterial strains of the genus Streptococcus in which case competence cells attacked their not yet competent siblings (known as fratricide; note that kin-discriminated killing is also possible in this context). The Gram-negative pathogen Vibrio cholerae, on the other hand, was shown to use a molecular killing device (the type VI secretion system; T6SS) to attack its non-kin neighbors, which is followed by the uptake of the prey-released DNA. Experimental data showed a significant enhancement of HGT through the regulatory link between kin-discriminated killing and DNA absorption and this earlier study concluded that the T6SS enhances HGT in this organism. The current study follows up on these initial observations as it describes a similar link between neighbor predation and transformation for <italic>A. baylyi</italic>. The authors move on to describe a quantitative model, which takes predator and prey growth rates, natural transformability, cell density and DNA stability into consideration. Through the use of this model, the authors concluded that competing DNA would be less efficient to interrupt HGT under such killing-enhanced HGT conditions, while DNases might be useable for intervention strategies.</p><p>While the model is very interesting and the study nicely contributes to our basic knowledge on HGT, the manuscript tries to sell this in the context of the microbiome (microbiota?), biofilm, and the spread of antibiotics resistance in hospital-acquired pathogens (see title). While all of these areas are extremely important, this study does not address any of these areas. Indeed, <italic>A. baylyi</italic> is a soil organism and neither a part of the microbiota nor a problem in hospitals (while <italic>A. baumannii</italic> is, but this organism was not studied here). Thus, sentences like &quot;Therefore, expression of GFP in Acinetobacter should indicate a newly kanamycin-resistant strain, whose de novo appearance demonstrates the clinical relevance of HGT within a microbiome community&quot; seem totally out of place. In general, using key words such a multi-drug resistance (MDR) strains over and over throughout the manuscript seems highly inappropriate. Indeed, all that was shown here are in vitro selected strains in which a single antibiotics gene was transferred by the uptake of a plasmid. This method is commonly used in the transformation field and nobody ever considers such strains as &quot;MDR&quot;. The provided experimental data would likewise work if the transfer of a metabolic gene was scored in auxotrophic mutants instead of the transfer of a resistance genes (which is, in fact, only a tool to enumerate transfer efficiencies of any single gene).</p><p>Another problem is that the title of the manuscript implies information on population dynamics of the microbiome (=microbiota is probably meant). However, the work describes the transfer of plasmids between a laboratory <italic>E. coli</italic> strain and the soli bacterium <italic>A. baylyi</italic>. Thus, the stretch to the microbiota is far-fetched. Lastly, the work also does not address bona fide biofilms, which is also highly misleading.</p><p>In summary, the model part of the study is very interesting and provides novel information on the dynamics of HGT linked to neighbor predation while the experimental part is of limited novelty and lacks methodological information (an extensive list is provided below).</p><p>1) <italic>Acinetobacter baumannii</italic> is indeed an opportunistic pathogen and part of the &quot;ESKAPE&quot; pathogens and therefore listed under Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2013, (and in a recent report by the WHO) as major threat because of its high level of antibiotic resistance. However, <italic>Acinetobacter baylyi</italic>, which was used in the experimental settings of the current study, is primarily a soil bacterium with very few studies that indicate that it could also be a causative agent of hospital-acquired infections. Thus, stressing that antibiotic resistance is such a problem in hospital settings and that multi-drug resistance rates exceed 60% in <italic>Acinetobacter</italic> is too generalized and misleading. Indeed, this is primarily the case for <italic>A. baumannii</italic>, which is also solely referred to in Antunes, Visca and Towner, 2014. Consequently, the authors should explain to the reader why the experiments were done in <italic>A. baylyi</italic> instead and they should provide valid arguments why this might anyway be applicable to hospital-acquired pathogens and especially <italic>A. baumannii</italic>. Using a different non-pathogenic species of the same genus and then concluding that this is also relevant for the pathogenic strains seems inappropriate (e.g., nobody would solely rely on data on the non-pathogenic bacterium <italic>Mycobacterium smegmatis</italic> to conclude anything of significant importance about the pathogen <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic>). Thus, the authors should provide comparable data for <italic>A. baumannii</italic> or clearly state that <italic>A. baylyi</italic> was used as a surrogate for pathogenic <italic>Acinetobacter</italic>. In the latter case, the manuscript needs to be significantly toned down – especially the Abstract – with respect to the role in antibiotic transmissions in hospitals etc. Indeed, at the start of the last paragraph of the Introduction, &quot;In this work, we extend the observation of killing-enhanced HGT to the clinically threatening <italic>Acinetobacter</italic> genus&quot; is inappropriate, as most species within the genus <italic>Acinetobacter</italic> are not at all clinically threatening but soil inhabitants.</p><p>2) Title &quot;Microbiome Population Dynamics&quot; and Results: &quot;enabling visualization of model microbiomes&quot; – this is irrelevant here, as <italic>E. coli</italic> alone is not representative of &quot;microbiomes&quot; (even though the <italic>E. coli</italic> strain was probably a descendant of the original <italic>E. coli</italic> K12 strain, which was indeed isolated from a stool sample of a patient in 1922) and as far as I am aware of <italic>A. baylyi</italic> has never described as members of the microbiome because it is in fact a soil organism as stated above (if it is a common member of the microbiota, a reference is for sure needed). Thus, this must be considered as &quot;overselling&quot; and the link with the microbiome is non-existent (except if every <italic>E. coli</italic> study would be likewise considered a microbiome study, in which case old conjugation papers on F factor would have already shown horizontal gene transfer in the microbiome).</p><p>3) If the study is meant to be meaningful for <italic>A. baumannii</italic> and its high prevalence of antibiotic resistance genes, the manuscript should contain the information in T6SS regulation in this organism (e.g., Weber et al., 2015, PNAS). This study shows that multidrug-resistant strains of <italic>A. baumannii</italic> harbor a self-transmissible resistance plasmid that negatively regulates the T6SS. Thus, following HGT of this plasmid the T6SS is inactive and could have significant consequences, which should be discussed. Along the same line, the authors should provide information about T6SS regulation in <italic>A. baylyi</italic>.</p><p>4) The manuscript should extend the description on previous work on fratricide in Streptococcus and competence-mediated neighbor predation and transformation in <italic>Vibrio</italic> (=same T6SS-mediated killing procedure, as addressed in the current study). In fact, the finding in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> that T6SS enhances HGT and that &quot;elimination of proximicide impaired HGT by about 100-fold&quot; was shown before for <italic>V. cholerae</italic> for T6SS-mediated neighbor predation and transformation. Notably, several other experiments such as the nuclease control experiment, the testing of T6SS-mutants, the transformation with purified DNA, the homologous-recombination of genomic DNA that contains homolog regions etc. are likewise the same as in the previous study. Thus, the link between neighbor predation and DNA transfer is not new. The quantitative model, on the other hand, is extremely interesting and should represent the central part of the current manuscript. It is also recommended that the authors discuss whether their model would also be applicable to the previously studied kin-discriminating neighbor-predating bacteria (that is, <italic>Streptococci</italic> and <italic>Vibrios</italic>).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #4:</italic> </p><p>This is an intriguing and broadly interesting paper, supported well by multimedia (video) presentations. Microbial ecology was long a relatively niche field, but with paper after paper finding a general audience, it is in ascendance. While key findings (horizontal gene transfer [HGT] via/following contact antagonism [CDI]; HGT linked to antagonism) were developed initially in the <italic>Vibrio</italic> and <italic>Streptococcus</italic> systems, the new finding provides the required generalization to interpret the phenomena as broadly applying to Gram negative bacteria, including a wide swath of environmental and likely pathogenic bacteria; and the new data is mechanistically detailed.</p><p>The new finding addresses longstanding problems in microbial evolution about the amazing rate (and heterogeneity) of HGT. It does not necessarily address the question of why a cell would want to take up the DNA of a newly dead cell, which was clearly not well served by it; but there are hypothetical answers to that. For example, if relatively untargeted proximity killing (say, by physical means) is orthogonal to the traits which increased the frequency of the cell in community or population, then successful cells will be killed more frequently and their DNA may prove valuable. This is particularly interesting under bacteriostatic conditions, such as nutrient limitation and antibiotic exposure.</p><p>The experiments are carefully done. While I typically dislike 'and then we' papers and presentations, there is an element of surprise in the initial finding that justifies some of that narrative structure. Perhaps further findings would be better organized outside of chronology; but this is stylistic. The demonstrations are powerful and effective.</p><p>The mathematical models of HGT via CDI are not necessarily as compelling as the experimental data because of the reality gap between even in vivo and in the environment(s). Even where this was partly closed, the math was left somewhat hanging. As an example, the presence of extracellular DNAse effectively reduces the rate of HGT. This was tested in experiment, and performed as a mathematic model, but I don't see a clear connection made in the text between the model and data demonstrating the effect. I similarly didn't see a clear connection between the competing DNA model and an experiment demonstrating the fit or lack of fit to the model. For the conclusions about likely therapeutic strategies, at least some in vitro data should be clearly fit to the model.</p><p>Natural interest in MDR aside, this research has broader importance and the discussion should reflect that. How does this tie into the local taxonomic and genomic heterogeneity of natural populations? Soil, healthy microbiome, unhealthy microbiome? What sort of genes are likely to be exchanged (siderophore uptake, AT pairs, adhesins, phage resistance)? Clearly DNA transfer isn't restricted to a single species; yet homology was demonstrated as accelerating the integration of material into the genome. Some commentary on this is appropriate.</p><p>In conclusion, the writing is generally good and the methods, particularly the microfluidics, are clever and elegant. The data presentation avoids many potential pitfalls and supports most of the Discussion. There are a couple points that could be strengthened, particularly the connection between the DNAse experiments and the model; and the Discussion should take a more global microbiology perspective.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25950.035</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) All reviewers were concerned that the authors were overselling the clinical relevance of the work (given that A. baylyi is not a clinically important organism) and agreed that comments about the microbiome +biofilm aspects of the work were also overblown.

There appear to be three main issues here:</p><p>i) Extrapolation from <italic>A. baylyi</italic> as a model to implications for <italic>A. baumannii</italic>, ii) Use of the word “microbiome”, iii) Use of the word “biofilm”.</p><p>The common thread among these concerns seems to stem from our extrapolation from simplified, bottom-up, model systems to more complex real-world scenarios. We agree that there are important distinctions that we need to make more clear, but we also believe that bottom-up mechanistic studies like this one are a necessary complement to top-down studies of more complete systems. In the specific case of HGT, top-down microbiome sequencing has revealed that HGT is remarkably rapid in <italic>Acinetobacter</italic>, but the exact mechanisms and specific inter-species dynamics within biofilms that lead to this high-level observation can only be elucidated with bottom-up studies of simplified model systems. Because quantitative, mechanistic understanding of “biofilm” and “microbiome” dynamics requires isolating particular interactions in minimal systems, we do not believe it is inappropriate to discuss extrapolation to the more complete systems, although we agree we should make this link and caveats more clear.</p><p>i) Extrapolation from <italic>A. baylyi</italic> as a model to implications for <italic>A. baumannii</italic>. It is clear we should place stronger emphasis on the fact that <italic>A. baylyi</italic> is not as immediately clinically relevant as <italic>A. baumannii</italic>, and indeed it is primarily known as a soil organism. However, we expect that the same neighbor killing-enhanced HGT dynamics observed in <italic>A. baylyi</italic> should be generalizable to <italic>A. baumannii</italic>, particularly given their close relationship and the fact that they (along with many other gram-negatives) share the two key features of T6SS-mediated killing and natural competence. We have added discussion both in the Introduction:</p><p>“As a model system, we used <italic>A. baylyi</italic>, which is closely related to <italic>A. baumannii</italic> [Peleg et al., 2012], because it is genetically tractable, fully sequenced, and well-studied [Elliott and Neidle, 2011]. The two also share the key features of T6SS-mediated killing [Weber et al., 2013; Carruthers et al., 2013] and natural competence [Soledad Ramirez et al., 2010; Wilharm et al., 2013], and they are similar enough that standard phenotypic assays used in the clinic often fail to distinguish between them [Chen et al., 2007].”</p><p>And a more detailed discussion in the Discussion:</p><p>“While we used <italic>A. baylyi</italic> as a model for the more clinically threatening <italic>A. baumannii</italic>, the two are closely enough related that they are difficult to distinguish with standard phenotypic tests used in the clinic [Chen et al., 2007]. […] For example, another carbapenemase gene, blaOXA23, has been found in multiple <italic>Acinetobacter</italic> species isolated from both humans and animals, including both <italic>A. baumannii</italic> and <italic>A. baylyi</italic> [Smet et al., 2012; Nigro and Hall, 2016].</p><p>ii) Use of the word “microbiome” Thank you for pointing out this error – “microbiota” or “microbial” would be the more appropriate term in most of the places where we used it. We have changed the title and the word “microbiome” now appears only twice, in discussions of broader implications in the Abstract and the final paragraph of the Discussion.</p><p>iii) Use of the word “biofilm” It is true that our work focused on only the very early stages of biofilm formation, but we use the term “biofilm” to indicate that cells are surface-attached and developing a spatially-structured community, rather than in shaking culture tubes. We also note that the term “biofilm” has previously been used to describe simplified microbial communities with spatial structure, for example, 2-dimensional, single-species cultures in a microfluidic chip (Liu et al. 2015 Nature). We have clarified this more explicitly in the Results:</p><p>“While these experiments captured only the beginning stages of biofilm development, we use the term biofilm to indicate that the cells were surface-attached and developing a spatially-structured community, rather than growing in shaking culture tubes.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) A major strength of the work was the combination of the experimental work and the model, but the reviewers felt the link between the two was weak and should be strengthened, ideally by testing model predictions. For example, there are predictions about the role of the predator/prey ratio and the effects of DNAse or competing DNA. Experimental validation of at least one aspect of model predictions would considerably strengthen this work (of course, it might also highlight a problem with the model, another good reason for doing it).</p></disp-quote><p>This is an excellent suggestion.

This needs to be clarified (see comments from reviewer #2).</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing out these areas. We have clarified these points as requested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) There are well-reasoned objections to the term &quot;proximicide&quot;. A better-fitting term should be substituted.</p></disp-quote><p>We recognize the potential for confusion, as sister cells are immune to killing, thus not all cells in the immediate “proximity” are killed. However, appropriately-defined short terms are often valuable aids for discussion of complex phenomena. As a substitute for contact-dependent lysis of unrelated directly adjacent cells, we feel “proximicide” improves readability. We have added the following text to be more clear about how we are using the proposed term, but if the reviewers and editors still feel it is not useful, we could remove it.</p><p>“Given the unique dynamics of contact-dependent killing of non-immune, neighboring bacteria, and its potential for significant clinical, ecological, and evolutionary relevance, we propose to call this phenomenon proximicide. […] Proximicide would include, but be broader than, both T6SS-mediated killing and the previously described contact- dependent inhibition (CDI), which refers to a particular two-partner secretion system (CdiB/CdiA) [Aoki et al., 2005; Aoki et al., 2010].</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The assumption that &quot;predation can occur only at the perimeter of micro-colonies&quot; needs to be supported by some images/data. It would also be helpful to compare model fits to data with and without this assumption.</p></disp-quote><p>It has been established by others that T6SS-mediated lysis requires cell-to-cell contact between predator and prey, which can only occur at the boundaries between micro-colonies of predator and prey. The case when all micro-colonies are actually single cells is described in equation 4 (all cells are boundary cells), and we account for the transition between single cells and bona fide micro-colonies in equation 5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5</xref>). We have added citations to support this claim.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Section 4.1 ninth paragraph reports adding DNAse to block HGT, but experimental data needs to be supplied (reviewers failed to find them anywhere).</p></disp-quote><p>The new experimental data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref> (to test model predictions) shows HGT inhibition by a dilution series of DNase, and we have updated this section to reference those results, which are more informative than the previously described experiment in which HGT was below detection.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) The manuscript should extend the description of previous work on fratricide in Streptococcus and competence-mediated neighbor predation and transformation (see comments from reviewer #3).</p><p>The broader importance of the work should also be discussed (see comments from reviewer #4).</p></disp-quote><p>These are good points; we have expanded Discussion as recommended below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) The reviewers had two concerns about the title: first, this paper is about the microbiome only in a very minimal sense.

Would it be possible to trace the lineage back through the movie (only for a few, as an example) to show that these green Acinetobacter micro colonies really started as red cells, and better still that they were physically located close to an E. coli cell that subsequently lysed?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree it is unfortunate both that the GFP expression in <italic>E. coli</italic> is poorly repressed early in the videos, and that the mCherry expression in <italic>Acinetobacter</italic> becomes bleached later in the movies. We believe both of these phenomena are due to nutrient restriction, which is caused by <italic>Acinetobacter</italic> sticking to and clogging the channels meant to supply nutrients. Indeed, the stickiness of <italic>Acinetobacter</italic> makes microfluidic experiments much more challenging than with only lab <italic>E. coli</italic> strains, and obtaining these videos took many attempts.

While all of these areas are extremely important, this study does not address any of these areas. Indeed, A. baylyi is a soil organism and neither a part of the microbiota nor a problem in hospitals (while A. baumannii is, but this organism was not studied here). Thus, sentences like &quot;Therefore, expression of GFP in Acinetobacter should indicate a newly kanamycin-resistant strain, whose de novo appearance demonstrates the clinical relevance of HGT within a microbiome community&quot; seem totally out of place. In general, using key words such a multi-drug resistance (MDR) strains over and over throughout the manuscript seems highly inappropriate. Indeed, all that was shown here are in vitro selected strains in which a single antibiotics gene was transferred by the uptake of a plasmid. This method is commonly used in the transformation field and nobody ever considers such strains as &quot;MDR&quot;. The provided experimental data would likewise work if the transfer of a metabolic gene was scored in auxotrophic mutants instead of the transfer of a resistance genes (which is, in fact, only a tool to enumerate transfer efficiencies of any single gene).</p><p>Another problem is that the title of the manuscript implies information on population dynamics of the microbiome (=microbiota is probably meant). However, the work describes the transfer of plasmids between a laboratory E. coli strain and the soli bacterium A. baylyi. Thus, the stretch to the microbiota is far-fetched. Lastly, the work also does not address bona fide biofilms, which is also highly misleading.</p><p>In summary, the model part of the study is very interesting and provides novel information on the dynamics of HGT linked to neighbor predation while the experimental part is of limited novelty and lacks methodological information (an extensive list is provided below).</p></disp-quote><p>See above response to Essential revisions 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) Acinetobacter baumannii is indeed an opportunistic pathogen and part of the &quot;ESKAPE&quot; pathogens and therefore listed under Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2013, (and in a recent report by the WHO) as major threat because of its high level of antibiotic resistance. However, Acinetobacter baylyi, which was used in the experimental settings of the current study, is primarily a soil bacterium with very few studies that indicate that it could also be a causative agent of hospital-acquired infections. Thus, stressing that antibiotic resistance is such a problem in hospital settings and that multi-drug resistance rates exceed 60% in Acinetobacter is too generalized and misleading. Indeed, this is primarily the case for A. baumannii, which is also solely referred to in Antunes, Visca and Towner, 2014. Consequently, the authors should explain to the reader why the experiments were done in A. baylyi instead and they should provide valid arguments why this might anyway be applicable to hospital-acquired pathogens and especially A. baumannii. Using a different non-pathogenic species of the same genus and then concluding that this is also relevant for the pathogenic strains seems inappropriate (e.g., nobody would solely rely on data on the non-pathogenic bacterium Mycobacterium smegmatis to conclude anything of significant importance about the pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis). Thus, the authors should provide comparable data for A. baumannii or clearly state that A. baylyi was used as a surrogate for pathogenic Acinetobacter. In the latter case, the manuscript needs to be significantly toned down – especially the Abstract – with respect to the role in antibiotic transmissions in hospitals etc. Indeed, at the start of the last paragraph of the Introduction, &quot;In this work, we extend the observation of killing-enhanced HGT to the clinically threatening Acinetobacter genus&quot; is inappropriate, as most species within the genus Acinetobacter are not at all clinically threatening but soil inhabitants.</p></disp-quote><p>See point (i) above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Title &quot;Microbiome Population Dynamics&quot; and Results: &quot;enabling visualization of model microbiomes&quot; – this is irrelevant here, as E. coli alone is not representative of &quot;microbiomes&quot; (even though the E. coli strain was probably a descendant of the original E. coli K12 strain, which was indeed isolated from a stool sample of a patient in 1922) and as far as I am aware of A. baylyi has never described as members of the microbiome because it is in fact a soil organism as stated above (if it is a common member of the microbiota, a reference is for sure needed). Thus, this must be considered as &quot;overselling&quot; and the link with the microbiome is non-existent (except if every E. coli study would be likewise considered a microbiome study, in which case old conjugation papers on F factor would have already shown horizontal gene transfer in the microbiome).</p></disp-quote><p>See point (ii) above. To remove “microbiome” and “multi-drug”, we suggest “Microbial Population Dynamics Enhance Horizontal Gene Transfer And Speed Spread Of Antibiotic Resistance”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) If the study is meant to be meaningful for A. baumannii and its high prevalence of antibiotic resistance genes, the manuscript should contain the information in T6SS regulation in this organism (e.g., Weber et al., 2015, PNAS). This study shows that multidrug-resistant strains of A. baumannii harbor a self-transmissible resistance plasmid that negatively regulates the T6SS. Thus, following HGT of this plasmid the T6SS is inactive and could have significant consequences, which should be discussed. Along the same line, the authors should provide information about T6SS regulation in A. baylyi.</p></disp-quote><p>That observation of Weber at al. is fascinating, and we admit our results do not help us understand what advantages that regulation would provide, if any. However, T6SS regulation varies widely even between strains of the same species, so it may not be appropriate to draw too general conclusions at this point. We have added the following to our discussion of T6SS regulation:</p><p>“However, T6SS regulation does not always depend on high cell density, and it can be quite complex and varied, even within strains of the same species, likely reflecting the wide range of ecological contexts and functions performed by the T6SS [Weber et al., 2013; Miyata, Bachmann and Pukatzki, 2013; Bernard et al., 2010; Weber et al., 2015]. […] While T6SS regulation in <italic>A. baylyi</italic> has not been extensively characterized with respect to cell density [Weber et al., 2016], it is active and functional in standard in vitro conditions [Weber et al., 2013; Basler, Ho and Mekalanos, 2013], and we observed T6SS-mediated killing of <italic>E. coli</italic> at all times in the (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Videos 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="video" rid="video6">6</xref>).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The manuscript should extend the description on previous work on fratricide in Streptococcus and competence-mediated neighbor predation and transformation in Vibrio (=same T6SS-mediated killing procedure, as addressed in the current study). In fact, the finding in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> that T6SS enhances HGT and that &quot;elimination of proximicide impaired HGT by about 100-fold&quot; was shown before for V. cholerae for T6SS-mediated neighbor predation and transformation. Notably, several other experiments such as the nuclease control experiment, the testing of T6SS-mutants, the transformation with purified DNA, the homologous-recombination of genomic DNA that contains homolog regions etc. are likewise the same as in the previous study. Thus, the link between neighbor predation and DNA transfer is not new. The quantitative model, on the other hand, is extremely interesting and should represent the central part of the current manuscript. It is also recommended that the authors discuss whether their model would also be applicable to the previously studied kin-discriminating neighbor-predating bacteria (that is, Streptococci and Vibrios).</p></disp-quote><p>We have attempted to clarify the previous observations in <italic>Streptococcus</italic> and <italic>V. cholera</italic>. The phenomena observed in <italic>Streptococcus</italic> represent slightly different dynamics, since the killing is mediated by diffusible bacteriocins, thus enabling longer-range interactions, and it is restricted to certain species. Since HGT facilitated by T6SS-mediated killing has only been reported once, we believe it is valuable to corroborate this in a different species, demonstrating its reproducibility and generalizability. In addition, our observation of in trans complementation of HGT by co-cultured, T6SS+ cells has not yet been reported elsewhere.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #4:</p><p>[…] The mathematical models of HGT via CDI are not necessarily as compelling as the experimental data because of the reality gap between even in vivo and in the environment(s). Even where this was partly closed, the math was left somewhat hanging. As an example, the presence of extracellular DNAse effectively reduces the rate of HGT. This was tested in experiment, and performed as a mathematic model, but I don't see a clear connection made in the text between the model and data demonstrating the effect. I similarly didn't see a clear connection between the competing DNA model and an experiment demonstrating the fit or lack of fit to the model. For the conclusions about likely therapeutic strategies, at least some in vitro data should be clearly fit to the model.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an excellent suggestion.

How does this tie into the local taxonomic and genomic heterogeneity of natural populations? Soil, healthy microbiome, unhealthy microbiome? What sort of genes are likely to be exchanged (siderophore uptake, AT pairs, adhesins, phage resistance)? Clearly DNA transfer isn't restricted to a single species; yet homology was demonstrated as accelerating the integration of material into the genome. Some commentary on this is appropriate.</p></disp-quote><p>We do indeed expect that neighbor killing-enhanced HGT likely plays a larger and broader role in microbial evolution than currently recognized. Many of these questions are beyond the scope of this paper, but by presenting this data and accompanying model, we hope to both raise awareness of its potential importance, and to provide mathematical tools that will help to study it more quantitatively. We have added some discussion of the broader ecological implications for open questions about microbial evolution with references at the end of the Discussion:</p><p>“In addition to helping to explain, predict, and combat the rapid spread of multi drug-resistance, particularly among <italic>Acinetobacter</italic>, the population dynamics revealed here are likely important in the microbiome and microbial evolution more broadly.
