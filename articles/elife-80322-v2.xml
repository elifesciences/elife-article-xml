important epigenetic control factors, reportedly regulate wound repair. However, our insufficient knowledge of clinically relevant miRs hinders their potential therapeutic use. For this, we performed paired small and long RNA-sequencing and integrative omics analysis in human tissue samples, including matched skin and acute wounds collected at each healing stage and chronic nonhealing venous ulcers (VUs). On the basis of the findings, we developed a compendium (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.xulandenlab.com/humanwounds-mirna-mrna">https://www.xulandenlab.com/humanwounds-mirna-mrna</ext-link>), which will be an open, comprehensive resource to broadly aid wound healing research. With this first clinical, wound-centric resource of miRs and mRNAs, we identified 17 pathologically relevant miRs that exhibited abnormal VU expression and displayed their targets enriched explicitly in the VU gene signature. Intermeshing regulatory networks controlled by these miRs revealed their high cooperativity in contributing to chronic wound pathology characterized by persistent inflammation and proliferative phase initiation failure. Furthermore, we demonstrated that miR-34a, miR-424, and miR-516, upregulated in VU, cooperatively suppressed keratinocyte migration and growth while promoting inflammatory response. By combining miR expression patterns with their specific target gene expression context, we identified miRs highly relevant to VU pathology. Our study opens the possibility of developing innovative wound treatment that targets pathologically relevant cooperating miRs to attain higher therapeutic efficacy and specificity.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>microRNA</kwd><kwd>regulatory network</kwd><kwd>wound healing</kwd><kwd>chronic wound</kwd><kwd>venous ulcer</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004359</institution-id><institution>Swedish Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2016-02051</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xu Landén</surname><given-names>Ning</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004359</institution-id><institution>Swedish Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2020-01400</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xu Landén</surname><given-names>Ning</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Ragnar Söderbergs Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>M31/15</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xu Landén</surname><given-names>Ning</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Welander and Finsens Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xu Landén</surname><given-names>Ning</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>LEO foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xu Landén</surname><given-names>Ning</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Ming Wai Lau Centre for Reparative Medicine</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xu Landén</surname><given-names>Ning</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004047</institution-id><institution>Karolinska Institutet</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xu Landén</surname><given-names>Ning</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AR073614</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tomic-Canic</surname><given-names>Marjana</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>No external funding was received for this work.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A comprehensive microRNA expression and function landscape of human wounds unraveled miRNAs highly relevant to venous ulcer pathology.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Wound healing is a fundamental biological process (BP) comprising three sequential and overlapping phases, that is, inflammation, proliferation, and remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Reinke and Sorg, 2012</xref>). This delicate repair process is often disrupted in chronic venous insufficiency patients, resulting in venous ulcers (VUs) characterized by persistent inflammation and proliferative phase initiation failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Eming et al., 2014</xref>). VU is the most common chronic nonhealing wound type, comprising 45–60% of all lower extremity ulcerations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Vivas et al., 2016</xref>). VU exhibits a marked impact on health-related life quality and represents a significant financial burden both to the patients and the society with an annual health care cost of overall $14.9 billion in the USA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hoversten et al., 2020</xref>). A deeper understanding of the underlying gene expression regulatory mechanisms during physiological and pathological wound repair is essential for developing more effective wound treatments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Stone et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>MicroRNAs (miR) represent a group of short (~22 nt) noncoding (nc) ribonucleic acids, incorporating into the RNA-induced silencing complex and binding to the 3′ untranslated region of their target mRNAs, resulting in mRNA destabilization and translational repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Stavast and Erkeland, 2019</xref>). Given that an individual miR can target dozens to hundreds of genes, miRs have been identified as regulators of complex gene networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Stavast and Erkeland, 2019</xref>). MiR-mediated regulation is reportedly crucial in multiple fundamental BPs including skin wound repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Herter and Xu Landén, 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Meng et al., 2018</xref>). Importantly, manipulating miRs critical for the disease pathogenesis could offer a prominent therapeutic effect, supported by viral infection- and cancer-targeting miR therapeutics clinical trials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rupaimoole and Slack, 2017</xref>). Therefore, miR-based therapeutics for hard-to-heal wounds represent a promising approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Herter and Xu Landén, 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Luan et al., 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Meng et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nie et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pastar et al., 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sen and Roy, 2012</xref>).</p><p>However, our insufficient knowledge of the miR-mediated gene regulation in human wounds severely hinders the identification of clinically relevant miRs and their potential therapeutic use. While most previous wound healing-related miR studies rely on in vitro or animal models, only a few have approached miR profiles in human wound tissues or primary cells from patients, including tissues and fibroblasts of diabetic foot ulcers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Liang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ramirez et al., 2018</xref>), burn wound dermis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Liang et al., 2012</xref>), and acute wounds at the inflammatory phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Li et al., 2015</xref>). Despite sharing several fundamental features, the human skin structure and repair processes are different from those of the commonly used animal models (e.g., rodents) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Elliot et al., 2018</xref>). Moreover, animal models cannot fully simulate the human disease complexity, and the findings are difficult to extrapolate to humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Darwin and Tomic-Canic, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pastar et al., 2018</xref>). Thereby, a rigorous and in-depth characterization of miR-mediated gene regulatory networks in human healing and nonhealing wounds is timely needed.</p><p>In this study, we performed paired small and mRNA expression profiling in the human skin, acute wounds during the inflammatory and proliferative phases, and VU, unraveling time-resolved changes of the whole transcriptome throughout the wound healing process and the unique gene expression signature of a common chronic wound type. The integrative miR and mRNA omics analysis provides a network view of miR-mediated gene regulation in human wounds in vivo and demonstrates the functional involvement of miRs in human skin wound repair at the system level. Importantly, we identified miRs highly relevant to VU pathology, based not only on their aberrant expression but also their targetome enriched in the VU-related gene expression signature. Apart from confirming the in silico findings, the experimental miR expression, targetome, and function validation uncovered that VU-dysregulated miRs could act cooperatively contributing to the stalled wound healing characterized by failed transition from inflammatory-to-proliferative phase, which opens up new possibility for the development of more precise and innovative wound treatment targeting pathologically relevant cooperating miRs to achieve higher therapeutic efficacy and specificity. Additionally, based on this comprehensive analysis of human wound tissues, we built a browsable resource web portal (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.xulandenlab.com/humanwounds-mirna-mrna">https://www.xulandenlab.com/humanwounds-mirna-mrna</ext-link>), which is the first wound healing-focused miR resource for facilitating the exploration of miR’s clinical application and for aiding in the elucidation of posttranscriptional regulatory underpinnings of tissue repair.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>miRNA and mRNA paired expression profiling in human wounds</title><p>To better understand tissue repair in humans, we collected wound-edge tissues from human acute wounds and chronic nonhealing VUs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref> and Materials and methods, Tables 2 and 3). Donor demographics are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>. We created 4-mm full-thickness punch wounds at the lower legs of healthy volunteers aged beyond 60 years to match the advanced age of VU patients and anatomical location of the highest VUs occurrence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Vivas et al., 2016</xref>). Tissue was collected at baseline (Skin), and at day 1 and 7 post-wounding (Wound1 and Wound7) to capture the inflammatory and proliferative phases of wound healing, respectively. In total, 20 samples divided into four groups, that is, Skin, Wound1, Wound7, and VU, were analyzed by Illumina small RNA sequencing (sRNA-seq) and ribosomal RNA-depleted long RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). After stringent raw sequencing data quality control (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>), we detected 562 mature miRs and 12,069 mRNAs in our samples. Our principal component analysis showed that either the miR or the mRNA expression profiles clearly separated these four sample groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). Next, we performed pairwise comparisons to identify the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) during wound repair. We compared the VUs with both the skin and acute wounds and unraveled a VU-specific gene signature, including aberrant increase of 22 miRs and 221 mRNAs and decrease of 10 miRs and 203 mRNAs (differentially expressed [DE] analysis false discovery rate [FDR] &lt;0.05, fold change ≥2 for miRs, and ≥1.5 for mRNAs, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c–e</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>).

Therefore, describing the mRNA expression context would be required for understanding the role of miRs in wound repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agarwal et al., 2015</xref>). We thus performed WGCNA in the paired long RNA-seq data and identified 13 mRNA coexpression modules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4a–c</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata4">Figure 2—source data 4</xref>). The gene ontology (GO) analysis of the mRNA modules largely confirmed the previous knowledge of wound biology, such as skin hemostasis (M2) and barrier function (M4)-related gene downregulation in the wounds, the upregulation of the genes involved in the immune response (M8), RNA processing, and protein production (M1, M3, and M5) in the inflammatory phase, and the prominent cell mitosis-related gene expression (M7) in the proliferative phase of wound repair (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5a</xref>). These results further supported the robustness and reproducibility of our profiling data. Moreover, this unique dataset allows the identification of the key TFs driving these BPs. For example, we identified NFKB1 and RELA, well known for their immune functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Liu et al., 2017</xref>), as the most enriched upstream regulators for the M1 mRNAs, while E2F1, a TF promoting cell growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ertosun et al., 2016</xref>), surfaced as a master regulator TF in M7 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata5">Figure 2—source data 5</xref>).</p><p>Importantly, our study unraveled a VU molecular signature: downregulated expression of RNA and protein production- (M1, M3, and M5) as well as cell mitosis-related (M7) genes, and upregulated expression of genes involved in extracellular matrix organization and cell adhesion (M9). These results were in line with the dermal tissue fibrosis observed in patients with chronic venous insufficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Blumberg et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pappas et al., 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Stone et al., 2020</xref>).

Both miR-218-5p and miR-96-5p were predicted to promote ribosome biogenesis and nc RNA processing, while miR-218-5p might also suppress keratinization. miR-34a/c-5p were predicted to enhance innate immune response, while reducing mitosis. Similarly, GO analysis indicated that miR-424-5p and miR-516b-5p might increase the cellular defense response, while inhibiting cell proliferation. In addition, we showed that miR-450-5p upregulated genes related to the ncRNA metabolic process and mitochondrial respiratory chain complex assembly, whereas miR-7704 downregulated insulin, ERBB, and small GTPase-mediated signaling pathway-related genes. Of particular interest, combining the miR expression changes with their annotated functions, we found a regular pattern, that is, the miRs upregulated in VU (i.e., miR-34a-5p, miR-34c-5p, miR-424-5p, miR-450-5p, miR-7704, and miR-516-5p) were predicted to promote inflammation but inhibit proliferation; whereas the miRs downregulated in VU (i.e., miR-218-5p and miR-96-5p) might be required for cell growth and activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8b</xref>).

E2F signaling plays a unique role in keratinocyte proliferation and migration, as well as in wound repair and epidermal regeneration in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">D’Souza et al., 2002</xref>).

We thus hypothesized that miR-34a-5p and miR-424-5p might cooperate to impact stronger on cell proliferation and migration by targeting different gene sets within the same signaling pathway. To test this idea, we measured keratinocyte growth by detecting proliferation marker gene Ki-67 expression both on mRNA and protein levels.

These findings open new opportunities of developing wound treatment targeting cooperating miRs with potentially higher therapeutic efficacy and specificity.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our genome-wide paired analysis of miR and mRNA expression in human healing and nonhealing wounds provides a novel global landscape of the miR regulatory roles in wound biology. A detailed overview of the mRNA expression context at different healing stages or under pathological condition VU allows a more precise understanding about the complex role of miRs in wound repair. The same miR is often described to play different or even opposite roles in different cells, as each cell type has specific gene expression context subjected to the miR-mediated posttranscriptional regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Erhard et al., 2014</xref>). Thereby, the different mRNA expression profiles in acute or chronic wounds should be considered to understand the precise role of an miR in these distinct contexts. With this aspect in mind, we highlight miRs with their targetome most enriched in the VU mRNA signature, as these miRs display a higher likelihood to regulate pathologically relevant genes. Notably, certain of these miRs did not exhibit the greatest expression change in VU, they would thus be missed with the commonly used strategy that focuses on the top miR expression profiling data changes.</p><p>Another strength of our study is the decryption of time-resolved miR–mRNA expression pattern during human skin wound healing, providing a temporal view to our understanding of the functional miR roles. miRs and their target gene expression contexts change dynamically to support different functional needs during wound repair. Defining an miR as ‘pro-healing’ or ‘anti-healing’ requires specifying its temporal expression pattern. For example, continuous expression of a miR that is beneficial for one healing phase but not the other might also lead to deleterious effects.</p><p>To understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the miR coexpression patterns, we analyzed the enriched TFs for each miR module with experimentally validated TF-miR regulation data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tong et al., 2019</xref>). This analysis led us to important TFs, such as GATA3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kaufman et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kurek et al., 2007</xref>) that play fundamental roles in skin development and postnatal remodeling, as well as KLF4, crucial for establishing skin barrier function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Segre et al., 1999</xref>). Notably, both GATA3 and KLF4 are reportedly downregulated in human VU (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Stojadinovic et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Stojadinovic et al., 2008</xref>). Our study confirms these findings and provides a novel insight, showing that the loss of these TFs might contribute to VU pathology through their regulated miRs.</p><p>We summarized the miRNAs that reportedly regulate wound healing and found that most of them also surfaced in our study, supporting the robustness of our profiling data and bioinformatics analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1—figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). Thereby, our data would be potentially helpful to evaluate the clinical relevance of these miRs. For example, miR-34a/c reportedly enhance keratinocyte inflammatory response, while suppressing proliferation and migration in cultured cells and mouse wound models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wu et al., 2020</xref>). miR-34a was also identified as one of the most induced miRs in diabetic foot ulcer fibroblasts. Induction of miR-34a together with miR‐21‐5p and miR‐145‐5p inhibits fibroblast movement and proliferation, whereas activates cell differentiation and senescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Liang et al., 2016</xref>). In this study, we described that miR-34a/c were specifically upregulated in VU, whereas their levels during wound repair remained relatively low and stable, suggesting their specific role in wound pathology. miR-34 targets were enriched in the M5 mRNA module, containing genes upregulated in the inflammatory phase of wound healing but downregulated in VUs. The VU-relevant miR-34 targetome identified in this study would be potentially useful for determining the precise role of miR-34 in VU pathology. Our current findings in human samples together with previous functional data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Liang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wu et al., 2020</xref>) suggest that miR-34 inhibition along with modulation of additional deregulated miRs might be a promising VU treatment approach.</p><p>In addition, certain of these VU-related miRs are involved in skin-related functions but have not yet been linked to wound healing. For example, miR-218-5p regulates hair follicle development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zhao et al., 2019</xref>), inhibits melanogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Guo et al., 2014b</xref>), and enhances fibroblast differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Guo et al., 2014a</xref>). miR-7704 was identified as an exosomal miR produced by melanocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Shen et al., 2020</xref>). miR-424-5p suppresses keratinocyte proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ichihara et al., 2011</xref>) and cutaneous angiogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nakashima et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Yang et al., 2017</xref>). Moreover, our VU-related miR list (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>) also contains miRs without prior knowledge in their role either in skin or wound healing, for example, miR-517a-3p, miR-517b-3p, miR-516b-5p, miR-512-3p, and miR-450-5p. It would be highly interesting to examine the role of these miRs in VU. Overall, our dataset can serve as a valuable reference for prioritizing clinically relevant miRs for further functional studies.</p><p>Moreover, we studied the relationships between the dysregulated miRs in VU, regarding their target repertoire and biological functions and identified miRs that could act cooperatively. Such knowledge is required for developing combined miR therapeutics with increased specificity and efficacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lai et al., 2019</xref>). In the miR-target networks underpinning VU (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">2</xref>), we identified a few putative cooperating miR pairs/clusters that were coexpressed and shared multiple common targets, including the upregulated miR-34a/c together with miR-424-5p and miR-7704, as well as the downregulated miR-218-5p and miR-96-5p in VU. Furthermore, although not sharing targets, the majority of the VU-dysregulated miRs could still regulate the common BPs coordinately. For example, the miRs upregulated in VU (e.g., miR-34a/c-5p, miR-424-5p, miR-450-5p, miR-7704, and miR-516-5p) were predicted to promote inflammation but inhibit proliferation; whereas the miRs downregulated in VU (e.g., miR-218-5p and miR-96-5p) might be needed for cell growth and activation. Particularly, we validated the cooperation between miR-34a-5p and miR-424-5p in suppressing keratinocyte proliferation and migration, as well as the cooperation between miR-34a-5p and miR-516b-5p in enhancing keratinocyte expression of inflammatory chemokine CCL20. The effect of miR-34 family in promoting keratinocyte inflammatory response has been recently reported and one of the miR-34 targets, LGR4, has been identified to mediate this effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wu et al., 2020</xref>). However, the mechanism underlying the proinflammatory function of miR-516b-5p in keratinocytes warrants further study. As a combined consequence, this VU-miR signature could disrupt the swift transition from inflammation to proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9i</xref>). The failure of this phase transition represents a core pathology of chronic wounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Eming et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Landén et al., 2016</xref>). Our findings open the possibility of developing innovative wound treatment targeting multiple pathologically relevant cooperating miRs to attain higher therapeutic efficacy and specificity.</p><p>Based on the integrative small and long RNA-omics analysis of human wound tissues, we have developed an openly available compendium (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.xulandenlab.com/humanwounds-mirna-mrna">https://www.xulandenlab.com/humanwounds-mirna-mrna</ext-link>) for the research community. This novel, rich resource enabled us to gain a network view of miR-mediated gene regulation during human physiological and pathological wound repair in vivo. With the same sequencing datasets, we have also analyzed circular RNA expression and their potential interaction with miRs and miR targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Toma et al., 2022</xref>), which results can be queried at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.xulandenlab.com/humanwounds-circrna">https://www.xulandenlab.com/humanwounds-circrna</ext-link>. These efforts result in many testable hypotheses for future studies elucidating gene expression regulatory mechanisms underpinning tissue repair.</p><p>A limitation of bulk RNA-seq of wound tissues is that the observed expression changes could occur in a single or multiple cell types or reflect cell composition changes. To obtain cell-specific miRNA expression data, single-cell sRNA-seq is required. However, this technology needs extensive cell handing and therefore has only been applied to few cells and still remains challenging to be used at a scale for analyzing complex dynamics of tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nielsen and Pedersen, 2021</xref>). Alternatively, we analyzed miR and mRNA expression in epidermal cells isolated from human skin and wound tissues and validated miR-mediated gene regulation in keratinocytes, excluding the possibility of cellular heterogeneity-related changes for several miRs identified in our study.</p><p>In conclusion, this genome-wide, integrative analysis of miR and mRNA expression in human skin and wound tissues reinforce and extend the evidence about the functional role of miRs in wound repair and their therapeutic potential for chronic wound treatment. By combining miR expression patterns with their specific target gene expression context, we identified miRs highly relevant to VU pathology. This rigorous and in-depth molecular characterization of human wound tissues adds a novel dimension to our current knowledge mostly relying on nonhuman models and would serve as a unique platform and valuable resource for further mechanistic studies of miRs with a high translational potential.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Human wound samples collection</title><p>Patients with VUs, which persisted for more than 4 months despite conventional therapy, were enrolled in this study (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>).

First, we calculated the strength of pairwise correlations between miRNAs using the ‘biweight’ mid-correlation method. The function <italic>pickSoftThreshold</italic> was then employed to compute the optimized soft-thresholding power based on connectivity, which led to an approximately scale-free network topology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zhang and Horvath, 2005</xref>). Second, a signed weighted coexpression network was constructed with a power of 18 using the one-step <italic>blockwiseModules</italic> algorithm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2a</xref>). Network modules were filtered according to parameters: minModuleSize = 10 and mergeCutHeight = 0.25.</p><p>The expression profile of each module was represented by the module eigengene (ME), referred to as the PC1 of all miRNAs in each module. Pearson’s correlations (values from −1 to 1) and the corresponding p values between MEs and traits were computed. p values were further adjusted to FDR across all the modules using the BH method. Modules significantly associated with each trait were selected by FDR &lt;0.05 and absolute correlation coefficients &gt;0.4. The module membership (also known as kME) of each miRNA was calculated by the correlations between miRNA expression and ME. MiRNAs with the highest kME values were defined as intramodular hub miRNAs, and networks of hub miRNAs in significant modules were visualized using the Cytoscape v3.7.2 software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Shannon et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>To check the robustness of module definition, we carried out module preservation analysis and calculated the standardized <italic>Z</italic>-scores for each module by permutating 200 times using the same 20 samples as reference and test datasets.

Fisher’s exact tests were employed to evaluate the enrichment of each TF in the significant modules, and FDRs were adjusted to the total number of TFs (OR &gt;1 and FDR &lt;0.05). Correlations of gene expression between TFs and miRNA modules (represented by MEs) were further filtered to identify putative TF-mediated miRNA gene expression patterns (Pearson’s correlation: p value &lt;0.05, coefficient &gt;0).

Gene expression was then quantified by counting unique mapped fragments to exons by using the feature count function from the Subread package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Liao et al., 2014</xref>). Raw counts for each gene were normalized to fragments per kilobase of a transcript, per million mapped reads (FPKM)-like values. Only mRNAs with FPKM ≥1 in at least 10 samples were kept for the rest analysis. We used the same pipeline described above for mRNA DE and PCA analysis. The DE mRNAs were defined as FDR &lt;0.05 and |log2(fold change)| ≥0.58.

Among these miRNAs’ strongest targets, we selected the ones that were hit by ≥2 miRNAs from m8, m9, m12 modules or miRNAs downregulated in VU; ≥3 miRNAs from m7 module or miRNAs upregulated in VU; ≥4 miRNAs from m3 module, to capture putative module-driving targets.

What follows is the decision letter after the first round of review.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting the paper &quot;Integrative small and long RNA-omics analysis of human healing and non-healing wounds discovers cooperating microRNAs as therapeutic targets&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Senior Editor.</p><p>Comments to the Authors:</p><p>We are sorry to say that, after consultation with the reviewers, we have decided that this work will not be considered further for publication by <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>This study has conducted a comprehensive analysis to make the bioinformatic analysis results important to this field, while data volume regarding functional validation seems limited. The examined parameters are rather weak to reflect the regulatory network of the pathogenesis-relevant miRNAs, and the cell type chosen for in vitro experiment is circumscribed to mimic the exact biological process during wound healing. Also, the novelty of this work is relatively limited since similar results using similar samples have been reached before.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Limited human-derived specimens and insufficient identification of clinical relevant miRNA hindered development of miRNA based therapy in venous ulcer treatment, this study performed an innovative work to acquire sufficient high-quality miRNA profiles from self-collected human skin specimens, and comprehensively analyzed miRNAs which participate in venous ulcer pathogenesis, and resolved the dynamic change within temporal dimension. The brief experimental validation also makes the conclusions more solid and reliable. While the data presentation form needs to be improved.</p><p>The project is ambitious and of interest to the medical community in dermatology as the compendium access is free of charge for academic institutions. Moreover, a certain validation of the data has been performed for the identified pathologically relevant miRs in abnormal VU expression.</p><p>1. The article could be updated on the presentation of clinical data or reference for miRs already found for VU or related dermatological disorders.</p><p>2. My main criticism is that the compendium database linked to the article is rather difficult to use for clinicians. I would recommend that the authors could propose a virtual visit with an example of miRs and mRNA expression etc, how to look for its level of expression in VU as well as their therapeutic indications.</p><p>3. Another criticism is that as mentioned in the article, extensive validation should be performed in cell type-specific miR expression data to confirm their findings. Otherwise, it may be difficult to make conclusions based on mixed cell types in biopsies from VU patients.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Liu et al. used biopsies from acute human excisional wounds and from chronic venous ulcers to identify miRNAs and mRNAs that are dysregulated in the ulcer tissue.

The major problem is the impaired migration (Usui et al., 2008).

These approaches allow us to detect many miRNAs and their putative target mRNAs simultaneously and gain an overview of the miR-mediated gene regulation in wound-edge keratinocytes.

Although the strategy of paired miRNA and mRNA analysis has been used in other diseases (e.g., cancers and neurodevelopmental disorders), to the best of our knowledge, our study is the first attempt to apply this strategy to human wounds.

(2) The acute wounds were matched with venous ulcer in donor age and wound site – which has been rarely achieved in previous studies, although both aging and body locations are important factors affecting gene expression. (3) Paired small and long RNA-seq allows more accurate integrative multi-omics analysis. Our work leads to a novel and easy-to-use resource that can be used to prioritize clinical-relevant miRNAs for more in-depth functional studies and to evaluate the clinical relevance of previous findings of miRNAs studied in non-human models – such efforts are highly demanded in research community.</p><p>Regarding the sample size, this is a common challenge in the studies with human wound tissues<sup>7</sup>. Pastar I<italic>. et al.</italic> have summarized published studies using human wound tissues and stated each study's sample size (n=3-30 donors, please see Table 1 in the review article<sup>7</sup>). Pastar I<italic>. et al.</italic> commented that 'Traditional clinical trials that are testing efficacy typically involve hundreds of patients. Most clinical research sample size collections are markedly smaller, which often challenges their value. Therefore, one has to make a fundamental distinction between clinical trial and clinical research that is not just semantic. As described above, clinical research that focuses on deciphering molecular and cellular mechanisms that inhibit healing use comprehensive multipronged strategies involving modern technologies, and the type of research is often limited by rather moderate research funds and an allotted amount of time to complete it. Therefore, it is unrealistic to expect that the sample size of clinical research studies should be compared to that of clinical trials that are testing efficacy of therapies and interventions.' <sup>7</sup></p><p>After revision, we have analyzed tissue samples from 22 healthy donors (skin, day1, and/or day7 acute wounds were collected from each donor) and 19 venous ulcer patients in this study, which sample size is bigger than most existing studies using human wound tissues. Together with rigorous research design (e.g., skin and acute wounds from the same donor, matched VU and control patient cohort, paired small and long RNA-seq) and fortified efforts in experimental validation of the <italic>in-silico</italic> analysis (e.g., Figure 5–9), our study generated transcriptomic data of human wound tissues with relatively high robustness and reproducibility. Such efforts add a novel dimension to the current knowledge mostly relying on non-human models, and would be a valuable resource for further mechanistic studies of miRs with high translational potential.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

We next validated the miR-mediated gene regulatory network in keratinocytes or fibroblasts for 8 miRs by overexpressing each of them and performing microarray analysis with 33 samples (Figure 6). By comparing these in vitro identified miR targets with the VU-in vivo gene expression signature – we unravelled the most pathological-relevant miR targets (Figure 7) and their related biological processes (Figure 8). We then examined the impacts of hsa-miR-34a-5p, hsa-miR-424-5p, miR-516-5p and their combinations on the major biological processes of keratinocytes required for skin wound healing, including migration (scratch assays with live-cell imaging), proliferation (Ki67 qPCR, IF staining, and live-cell imaging), and inflammatory response (chemokine expression), using both gain- and loss-of-function approaches (Figure 9). Of note, many candidate miRNAs identified in this study have been shown to regulate wound healing in previous studies with in vitro and animal models (Table S3 and Figure 10), supporting the robustness and reproducibility of our profiling study.
