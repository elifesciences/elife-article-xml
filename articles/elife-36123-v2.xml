Optimal feedback theory suggests that such transitions require the disengagement of one motor control policy before the implementation of another. To test this possibility, we investigated the continuity of the vestibular control of balance during transitions between quiet standing and locomotion and between two standing postures. Healthy subjects initiated and terminated locomotion or shifted the distribution of their weight between their feet, while exposed to electrical vestibular stimuli (EVS). The relationship between EVS and ground reaction forces was quantified using time-frequency analyses. Discontinuities corresponding to null coherence periods were observed preceding the onset of movement initiation and during the step preceding locomotion termination. These results show humans interrupt the vestibular balance stabilizing mechanisms to transition between motor states, suggesting a discrete change between motor control policies, as predicted by optimal feedback theory.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.36123.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Crossing Abbey Road is something of a paradox in neuroscientific terms. As you stand waiting to cross, tiny movements of your body – such as those due to breathing – cause you to sway by small amounts. To prevent you from falling over, your brain makes active corrections to your posture. These posture-correcting mechanisms oppose movements such as sway and keep you standing upright. But what happens when you want to cross the road?</p><p>To get you moving, your brain has two options. It could temporarily suppress the posture-correcting mechanisms. Or it could reconfigure them so that they work in a different way. The posture-correcting mechanisms rely upon sensory input from various sources. These include the vestibular system of the inner ear. The vestibular system tells the brain about the position and movement of the head in space and relative to gravity. Monitoring vestibular system activity as a person starts to move should thus reveal what is happening to the posture-correcting mechanisms.</p><p>Tisserand et al. asked healthy volunteers to transition between standing still and walking, or to shift their weight from one foot to the other. At the same time, small non-painful electric currents were applied to the bones behind the volunteers' ears. These currents induced small changes in vestibular system activity. Sensors in the floor measured the forces the volunteers generated while standing or walking, thereby revealing how they adjusted their balance. The results showed that the brain suppresses its posture-correcting mechanisms before people start or stop moving.</p><p>These findings have implications for robotics. They could make it easier to program robots to show smooth transitions into and out of movement. The findings are also relevant to movement disorders such as Parkinson's disease. One common symptom of this disorder is freezing of gait, in which patients suddenly feel as though their feet are glued to the ground. Understanding how the brain controls movement transitions may reveal how such symptoms arise.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>vestibular signal</kwd><kwd>motor control policy</kwd><kwd>transition</kwd><kwd>locomotion</kwd><kwd>posture</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000038</institution-id><institution>Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>356026–13</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Blouin</surname><given-names>Jean-Sébastien</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Down regulation of the gain from the vestibular sensory sources prior to the initiation of movement is a motor control solution to overcome the reflex-stabilizing mechanisms to enable motion from a postural orientation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The initiation of movement from a stable posture is a central issue in neuroscience because of the need to overcome reflex-stabilizing mechanisms to enable motion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">von Holst and Mittelstaedt, 1950</xref>). Navigating our world involves frequent transitions between posture (e.g. quiet stance) and movement (e.g. locomotion), representing an ideal model to explore this issue. Indeed, balance correcting responses may hinder locomotor initiation and the transitions that are essential to safely navigate our environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ostry and Feldman, 2003</xref>).</p><p>Optimal feedback control theory (OFC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Todorov and Jordan, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Scott, 2004</xref>), a prominent motor control theory, proposes that the brain implements the optimal means of performing a task by adjusting the appropriate feedback gains to reach the goal. Specific postural configurations and movement patterns are considered separate control policies, one of which must be disengaged (i.e. by decreasing sensory feedback gains) prior to the engagement of another (i.e. by adjusting and increasing sensory feedback gains) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cluff and Scott, 2016</xref>). In this respect, OFC seems to diverge from other motor control theories, such as referent (threshold) control theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Asatryan and Feldman, 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ostry and Feldman, 2003</xref>). This latter theory suggests that a transition between postures involves a monotonic shift in the referent body orientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Feldman et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mullick et al., 2018</xref>), transforming posture-stabilizing mechanisms into movement-inducing ones. To determine whether transition between motor states is comprised of discrete events or is a continuous process, we examined the temporal dynamics of sensory feedback gains prior to and during the transition between two motor states. Specifically, we examined the contribution of vestibular sensory signals to the control of balance during transition between quiet standing and locomotion as well as between two standing postures.</p><p>The vestibular system encodes motion of the head in space, and is vital to our ability to maintain stability during both quiet standing and locomotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Angelaki and Cullen, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Goldberg et al., 2012</xref>). Vestibular signals influence the activation of muscles engaged in the control of posture. This influence depends on the muscles’ active engagement in balance control, and the alignment of the muscles’ mechanical action with both the plane of instability and the direction of the vestibular disturbance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lund and Broberg, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Britton et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fitzpatrick et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Luu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mian and Day, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Forbes et al., 2016</xref>). Contextually-dependent vestibular responses have been observed during both quiet standing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lund and Broberg, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fitzpatrick et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Marsden et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Son et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Luu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mian and Day, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Forbes et al., 2016</xref>) and locomotion, where the magnitude of vestibular-evoked muscle responses are modulated further during the phase of the gait cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Orlovsky, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Matsuyama and Drew, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blouin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dakin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Forbes et al., 2017</xref>). The vestibular control of balance during locomotor or posture-to-posture transitions can be monitored by continuously quantifying the magnitude of vestibular-evoked balance responses over the transition. A similar approach has been used previously to monitor the time course of engagement and disengagement of the vestibular control of balance between self- and externally-driven states of balance control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Luu et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Here, the continuity of the vestibular influence on postural control during transitions was assessed to determine whether a discrete change in balance correcting mechanisms accompanies transitions between two motor states. We hypothesized that a discrete suspension in the vestibular control of balance would occur prior to the transition, due to the disengagement of the current control policy prior to the implementation of the next control policy, as predicted under OFC theory.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>In the first study, ten healthy young males completed two blocks of 105 trials where they were instructed to stand quietly, then initiate locomotion, walking at their preferred speed for ~3.5 m, and then to turn around and walk back to their initial position where they were instructed to stand quietly again (defined as the ‘locomotor transition’ experiment). During each trial, subjects performed two transitions: once at the initiation of locomotion and again at the termination of locomotion. Participants performed one block with the head facing forward and another block with the head turned 90° over the left shoulder (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Participants received 30 s of a non-painful electrical vestibular stimulus (EVS) behind the ears (Materials and methods) which lasted the duration of each trial. Forceplates were imbedded in the floor on which participants stood and walked, in order to record the ground reaction forces (GRF) generated during the trials. The GRF were used to identify the different phases of movement: quiet standing, transition and walking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The vestibular contribution to balance control was quantified using a time-frequency coherence analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blouin et al., 2011</xref>) between the EVS and GRF signals for each of the three phases of the movement (Materials and methods). Coherence analysis measures the linear relationship between the EVS and GRF signals and is bounded between 0 and 1. In the second study, six additional subjects (young adults, three females) completed one block of 105 trials where they were instructed to stand quietly, then shift their body-weight laterally to redistribute their weight so that 90% was supported by their preferred leg and only 10% by their non-preferred leg (defined as the ‘posture-to-posture transition’ experiment). Once participants redistributed their body-weight, they were asked to maintain this uneven weight distribution. In this task, participants received EVS for the duration of each trial (15 s).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.36123.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Experimental set-up and the signals recorded during the experiment used to detect the movement phases.</title><p>The left panel is a subject in the initial posture before locomotion initiation in the head left condition.

This suspension of the contribution of vestibular feedback to the control of balance provides critical evidence that balance correcting responses are down-regulated to allow the transition between motor states and is suggestive of the disengagement of one control policy prior to the implementation of another, supporting predictions by OFC theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cluff and Scott, 2016</xref>).</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Balance correcting responses are down regulated to enable a transition</title><p>In order to transition between two motor states, balance correcting responses are disrupted. Indeed, prior to the transitions tested, the vestibular influence on whole-body balance responses is suspended. The suspension of vestibular-evoked responses at movement initiation starts while subjects are still maintaining quiet upright stance, well before the transition onset (vertical red line, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>). At locomotion termination, the suspension begins during the final step and ends after the transition onset (vertical grey line, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1 and 5</xref>). Thus, changes in vestibulo-motor control occur <italic>before</italic> overt markers of the biomechanical transition. In addition, inhibition of ankle plantar flexor muscular activity during locomotion initiation occurs 150 ms before the first change in vertical GRF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Herman et al., 1973</xref>), suggesting that balance correcting responses are down regulated 100 to 300 ms before the step-related modulation in muscle activity. These results partly confirm and extend previous work that reported a decrease in vestibular influence at locomotion initiation but increased vestibular influence at locomotor termination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bent et al., 2002</xref>). The apparent contradiction between these two studies is likely due to the near continuous approach we used, which improves upon the resolution with which vestibulo-motor responses can be observed compared to the discrete stimuli used by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bent et al. (2002)</xref>.</p><p>The period of null coherence preceding the transition was robust and observed in all individual subjects (n = 16), and it provides insight into the neural control of stabilizing mechanisms that enable motion from a stable posture. From an OFC perspective, distinct neural processes govern the control of posture and movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Scott, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kurtzer et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cluff and Scott, 2016</xref>). To transition from quiet standing to movement, or another relatively stable posture, the current motor policy associated with quiet standing must be disengaged to permit the implementation of a new control policy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cluff and Scott, 2016</xref>). In the locomotor transition task, the control policy regulating standing balance is disengaged to allow implementation of the locomotor control policy, and reversely when terminating locomotion. For the posture-to-posture transition, the motor control policy associated with standing balance is disengaged to permit the shift to a new posture. These periods of null coherence preceding transition thus illustrate <italic>when</italic> the brain disengages the current control policy. Furthermore, this vestibular disengagement solves the classic problem formulated by von Holst and Mittelstaedt regarding the opposing action from stabilizing reflexes when initiating motion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">von Holst and Mittelstaedt, 1950</xref>). From a biomechanical point of view, the disengagement of vestibular influence on the whole-body postural responses may also be necessary for the transition process, and thus incorporated into motor planning. The disruption in vestibular contribution to balance during transitions appears to contradict a key prediction from referent control theory: a monotonic shift in referent body orientation during shifts in postures while standing upright (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mullick et al., 2018</xref>). Our data show the intermittent use of vestibular feedback during transition between standing postures but it is unclear if a shift in referent body configuration is associated with such a transition.</p><p>The period of suspension of vestibular-evoked responses appears related to the different relative sensory feedback gains needed to control whole-body movements by the quiet standing and locomotor control policies. During quiet standing, whole-body accelerations (and related GRF) and oscillations within the limits of the base of support are small. An adaptive feedback controller (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fitzpatrick et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">van der Kooij and de Vlugt, 2007</xref>) to which vestibular feedback contributes, can generate the appropriate muscular torques required to maintain upright stance. When initiating movement, whole-body accelerations larger than those observed during quiet stance are needed to move the whole-body center of mass towards the base of support limits or outside the base of support. If the gain of the vestibular channel in the adaptive controller remained unchanged during the transition, the vestibular-evoked whole-body responses would increase due simply to the larger whole-body accelerations, potentially challenging the limits of postural stability or countering the intended motion of the body. Consequently, an adaptive controller would need to adjust the gain of the vestibular channel to maintain upright stability during this transition period. Based on our results, it appears that the transition in gains between the initial and the final policies is preceded by a suppression of vestibular gain. Vestibular gain is increased once again following the transition, but in a context-dependent manner. For example, in the event of a transition from quiet standing to locomotion, vestibular gain is increased during locomotion to control lateral stability, primarily (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Similarly, it appears that the locomotor control policy is interrupted preceding locomotion termination (i.e. during the last step) to allow the implementation of the quiet standing control policy. Lastly, an alternative interpretation is that the brain abruptly switches policies and starts predicting the whole-body’s future state whilst the body briefly remains in the previous state. Thus, for a short period of time, there is a discrepancy between the predicted and the actual sensory feedback that might result in a reduction in the size of the vestibular-evoked responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Luu et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Significant coherence between EVS and the GRF were limited primarily to the 0–10 Hz bandwidth despite using EVS up to 20 Hz. These observations are in line with previous studies that characterized vestibular-evoked responses when humans are standing and walking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dakin et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">2010</xref>). As vestibular signals cascade from the nervous system to muscle activation and from muscle activation to whole-body accelerations, the vestibular signals are low-pass filtered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dakin et al., 2010</xref>). Presumably, the inertia of the limb segments and whole-body impose mechanical constraints that limit the frequencies at which their motion can remain in phase with, and thus correlate with, the EVS. These low frequency responses observed in the GRF to the vestibular stimuli are thought to reflect neural processing underlying an organised balance correcting response to a craniocentric vestibular error signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Reynolds, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mian and Day, 2014</xref>).</p><p>Although the exact anatomical regions associated with the suppression of vestibular-evoked responses are unclear, putative regions that may contribute to control policy changes have been proposed. Primary motor cortex neurons responding to externally applied mechanical loads were found active only during the maintenance of postural orientation while others only during movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kurtzer et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Herter et al., 2009</xref>). For certain cortical neurons, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kurtzer et al. (2005)</xref> observed an abrupt switch in the pattern of neural processing ~0.3 s before the transition from a stationary posture to a reaching movement. Our results appear to mirror this behavior and extend the framework to a balance-locomotor context. In the brainstem, selective attenuation of ‘vestibular only’ neurons might change the response of vestibular nuclei neurons during self-generated locomotor movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Roy and Cullen, 2001</xref>). However, these neuronal responses are largely related to the predictable nature of the feedback and would therefore be ineffective at selectively suppressing an unpredictable EVS-induced perturbation signal. Although this mechanism may contribute to the attenuation of EVS-GRF responses, recent findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brooks and Cullen, 2014</xref>) indicate that it is likely insufficient to suppress the vestibular-evoked responses observed in this study.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Active control of locomotion using vestibular feedback in the mediolateral direction</title><p>Whole-body balance responses evoked by EVS are craniocentric and thus the direction of the error can be manipulated by actively maintaining the head in different orientations (Materials and methods, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lund and Broberg, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dalton et al., 2014</xref>). In the frontal plane, our upright posture is normally unstable during locomotion because the whole-body centre of mass is always medial to the propulsive foot (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Winter, 1995</xref>). Stability in the sagittal plane, on the other hand, is enhanced by the forward momentum of the body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sparrow and Tirosh, 2005</xref>) and the long base of support during double-support phases. This difference in stability between the frontal and the sagittal planes may explain the small (or absent) vestibular-evoked responses observed during locomotion when the head is turned to the left (i.e. vestibular error directed in the anteroposterior direction). The reduced coherence between EVS and anteroposterior GRF further support the hypothesis that the anteroposterior control of whole-body balance during locomotion requires less feedback-driven control than in the frontal plane, and may instead be largely passively controlled. Thus, our results agree with the assumption that sagittal plane stability is passively controlled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bauby and Kuo, 2000</xref>).</p><p>We further showed that vestibular-evoked whole-body responses in the frontal plane are phasically modulated during locomotion, exhibiting larger coherence during the double-support phase (excluding the last step at termination, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>). Vestibulo-muscular coherence also exhibits phasic behavior for single muscles during locomotion with the head facing forward (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blouin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dakin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Forbes et al., 2017</xref>), however it was not clear from summing coherence over several muscles whether the whole-body response is also phasically modulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dakin et al., 2013</xref>). From a biomechanical point of view, the double-support phase is important for stability: the base of support is larger in the mediolateral direction compared to single-support phase, the swing foot lands and body weight is transferred from one foot to another (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Winter, 1995</xref>). Not surprisingly, EVS applied during either locomotor transition or walking leads to increased upper body roll and modified lateral foot placement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bent et al., 2002</xref>). This could result in an inefficient mediolateral transfer of body weight and to steps placed more laterally than usual, raising energy consumption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kuo, 2002</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The disruption in the vestibular control of balance observed prior to biomechanical transition indicates that the brain first down regulates balance-correcting mechanisms to enable the transition. This disruption in the vestibular control of balance reduces counteracting effects of vestibular balance correcting responses that could prohibit movement initiation, thus supporting a prediction from current OFC models. Importantly, the suppression of vestibular balance stabilizing mechanisms is not specific to one type of transition, suggesting it represents a general control process that occurs during transitions between standing balance and other motor states. Thus, our results demonstrate that humans ‘stop balancing’ before they start moving and ‘stop moving’ before they start balancing again.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Population</title><p>Sixteen healthy young subjects without any history of neurological nor muscular disorders participated in our experimental protocol approved by the University of British Columbia Clinical Research Ethics Committee and conforms to the <italic>Declaration of Helsinki</italic>.

During the experiment, the stimulation unit remained in a torso-pack worn by the subject. The stimulus bandwidth (0–20 Hz) was chosen to characterize the entire frequency response of vestibular-induced modulation in lower limb muscle and whole-body force production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dakin et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mian et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Reynolds, 2010</xref>).

Subjects self-selected both the position and orientation of their feet, to ensure their comfort, but were encouraged to choose a foot width close to their pelvis width, because support width influences the magnitude of EVS-evoked responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Day et al., 1997</xref>). Once chosen, the position and orientation of the feet were marked on the ground, to ensure a reproducible starting position across trials.</p><p>Subjects wore a head-mounted laser pointer and were instructed to maintain the projected position of this laser at a specific point on the wall, which was 4 m in front of them at the start of the trial. We determined the target for the laser by positioning participant’s head nose up from the floor, with their Frankfurt plane (the auriculo-orbital plane) approximately 18° up from horizontal, to maximize the EVS-evoked balance responses (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fitzpatrick and Day, 2004</xref>, for a review). Participants were required to maintain this head orientation for the duration of the trial. The experimenter visually monitored the inclination angle of the head during the trial.</p><p>To control the modulating effect of head orientation on the vestibular-induced instability during locomotor transition, participants completed trials in one of two head orientations. During this experiment, subjects repeated blocks of 105 trials with the head facing forward or turned 90° over the left shoulder (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). During the posture-to-posture experiment, subjects performed only one block of 105 trials with the head facing forward. When the head is facing forward, EVS induces a postural response along the mediolateral whole-body axis. When the head is turned 90° to the left, postural responses are directed along the anteroposterior whole-body axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lund and Broberg, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fitzpatrick et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Forbes et al., 2016</xref>). Subjects participating in the locomotor transition experiment performed blocks of trials on separate days and we randomly assigned the order of the two blocks for each subject. During each block, the first five trials were used to collect the subject's kinetic and kinematic data in absence of EVS. These trials served as a control to determine if EVS modified the movement pattern. We provided EVS for the remaining 100 trials. Statistical analysis of the movement patterns between trials with and without EVS were performed using two-sided <italic>t-tests</italic> for each head position condition. In the locomotor transition experiment, the analysis did not reveal any major behavioral difference between these two conditions, except at locomotion termination, for a significantly decreased transition period (Δ = −0.094 ± 0.070 s, t<sub>(54)</sub> = −4.93, p&lt;0.001 and Δ = −0.330 ± 0.123 s, t<sub>(51)</sub> = −7.49, p&lt;0.001) and an increased walking velocity (Δ = 0.044 ± 0.013 m/s, t<sub>(50)</sub> = −15.79, p&lt;0.001 and Δ = 0.113 ± 0.070 m/s, t<sub>(51)</sub> = 73.82, p&lt;0.001), respectively in the head forward and head left conditions. In the posture-to-posture experiment, we did not find any significant behavioral differences between the trials with and without EVS.</p><sec id="s4-3-1"><title>Locomotor transition experiment</title><p>The beginning of each trial was indicated by a short (250 ms) vibration pulse (20 Hz) applied at waist level by a vibrator (FG-142, Labworks Inc., Costa Mesa, CA, USA) secured on a waist band. During trials with EVS, EVS started simultaneously with the vibration pulse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). We instructed subjects to ‘stand as naturally as possible and maintain a quiet standing posture’ at the start of the trial. About five seconds after the trial onset (vibration pulse), the experimenter verbally informed subjects that they could ‘initiate locomotion whenever they wanted’. After this go cue, subjects could initiate locomotion with their preferred foot at their own discretion. Subjects walked straight and at their preferred speed, across the length of four forceplates, and continued until they were 1 m past the last forceplates (FP4 and FP8, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). At this point (~3.5 m from their starting point), subjects were instructed to stop, turn around to face the opposite direction, and, at the same speed, return toward their starting position. We chose the walking distance to allow subjects sufficient space to reach their preferred locomotion speed, which occurs on average after the second step (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jian et al., 1993</xref>). Subjects terminated their locomotion once they had reached the same start position with their feet (i.e. one foot on FP1 and one on FP5, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). We instructed subjects to stand upright, as naturally as possible, after terminating locomotion, until they received a second vibration pulse (250 ms, 20 Hz) indicating the end of the trial. During trials with EVS, EVS stopped simultaneously with the second vibration pulse. Trials lasted 30 s and therefore the two vibration pulses occurred 30 s apart. In total, each trial consisted of at least five seconds of quiet standing data before the initiation of locomotion, locomotion for 3.5 m forward and back, and at least five seconds of quiet standing data following the termination of locomotion. During this experiment, a trial was considered invalid if the subjects (i) did not use the same foot to initiate locomotion, (ii) did not use the same foot to terminate locomotion, (iii) terminated locomotion with part of the feet outside of the forceplates or (iv) changed their head position before the end of the trial while being on the forceplates. In total, only 50 out of 2100 trials performed were considered invalid (2.3%). To account for this possibility and ensure each subject completed the 100 trials necessary for the analysis, we asked subjects to complete ten additional walking with EVS trials (110 trials with EVS total).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-2"><title>Posture-to-posture experiment</title><p>The experimental protocol was similar to the locomotor transition experiment. Briefly, we instructed subjects to maintain equal weight distribution beneath their feet and then shift their weight laterally, in order to move 90% of their whole-body weight towards their preferred leg, without changing their feet position. A vibration pulse (20 Hz, 250 ms) applied to the subjects’ waist indicated trial initiation. At least five seconds following this vibration pulse, subjects were verbally informed that they could ‘shift their weight whenever they wanted’. Following this verbal start cue, subjects shifted their weight to their preferred leg with a 90–10% weight distribution, and then they were asked to maintain this position until a second vibration pulse (20 Hz, 250 ms) indicated the end of the trial and corresponded to the end of the EVS stimulus. The two vibrations pulses occurred 15 s apart and therefore each trial lasted 15 s. Weight distribution underneath the feet was monitored by an experimenter at all times. During this experiment, a trial was considered invalid if the subjects (i) did not shift their weight to their preferred leg, (ii) stabilized themselves with a load on the preferred leg more or less than the preferred range of 85–95% of body weight, or (iii) changed their head position before the end of the trial. In total, only 6 out of 600 trials performed were considered invalid (1%). We asked subjects to complete five additional trials with EVS (105 trials total) to account for this possibility and ensure each subject completed the 100 trials necessary for the analysis.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Instrumentation</title><p>To quantify the effect of the vestibular stimulus on subjects' behaviour, we recorded the ground reaction forces (GRF) applied to their body as well as linear acceleration and angular velocity of their head over the duration of each trial.

GRF were digitized using a sampling rate of 1000 Hz (PXI-8108, National Instruments, Austin, TX, USA) and saved offline, with the vestibular stimulus and the vibration pulse signals.</p><p>We measured the linear acceleration and angular velocity of the head and waist using two inertial measurement units (Shimmer2R w450/mAH Battery, 5.1 × 3.4 × 1.4 cm, Shimmer Sensing, Dublin, Ireland) positioned on the forehead and the sacrum. The inertial measurement units were secured to the head and waist using Velcro belts. During trials, data from the inertial measurement units were sampled at 256 Hz and streamed to a personal computer for storage and future analysis. Because we used two separate computers to save the forceplate and inertial measurement units’ data, the two were synchronized in post-processing using the onset of the first vibration pulse.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Data reduction and signal analysis</title><p>After identifying the biomechanical markers of the transitions phases, we analyzed the vestibular responses during the transition between standing balance and locomotion and between the two standing postures to determine if vestibular feedback is disrupted as predicted by the OFC theory.

Following identification of the toe-offs and heel-strikes, the data were cut from first vibration pulse to the third heel-strike (segment of data for initiation trials) and from the third-to-last toe-off to second vibration pulse (segment of data for termination trials). In the cut data, the absolute value of the horizontal velocity of the centre of pressure was computed from the first time derivative of its trajectory, after being filtered with a zero-phase, second-order Butterworth digital filter at a 20 Hz cut-off frequency. Using this variable, the onset of the transition phase at locomotion initiation and the end of the transition phase at locomotion termination were identified as the first and last instants when the horizontal velocity of the centre of pressure was greater than three standard deviations from baseline. Baseline was defined as the first five seconds of the quiet standing period at the onset of each trial, and the last five seconds of the quiet standing period at the end of each trial. The end of the transition phase between quiet standing and locomotion at locomotion initiation was identified as the first toe-off (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The onset of the transition phase between locomotion and quiet standing at locomotion termination was identified as the last heel-strike. The transition from quiet standing to locomotion (between the red and grey lines, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) was characterized by a loading (increase in vertical force resulting in movement of the centre of pressure toward the swing leg and increase in shear force moving the CoM toward the stance leg) and then unloading of the swing leg (decrease of vertical force moving the centre of pressure away from the swing leg and reversed increase in the shear force to slow the center-of-mass’s fall toward the stance leg).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6-2"><title>Posture-to-posture transition</title><p>We used the first instant when the horizontal velocity of the centre of pressure was greater than three standard deviations from baseline to determine the onset of the transition period between the two standing postures.

Each segment was saved in two separate time-scale formats: movement-time normalized and non-normalized. In the movement-time normalized format, we stretched or compressed the length of the movement time (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf23"><mml:mi>τ</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>) to account for variability in the timings of toe-off, heel-strike and step duration, within each trial, between trials, and between subjects. To normalize <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf24"><mml:mi>τ</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> in each segment at locomotion initiation, we identified the time from the onset of the transition to the third toe-off (duration D illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Then, we extracted that data, with additional data from the quiet standing period prior to the transition of twice the length of the transition onset to third toe-off period. Similarly, to normalize <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf25"><mml:mi>τ</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> for each segment at locomotion termination, we extracted data from the third-to-last toe-off to the end of the transition (duration D illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>) with data of twice that length from the quiet standing period immediately following the end of the transition period. We decomposed the data on a trial-by-trial basis using a wavelet transformation, with a frequency resolution of 1 Hz and limited to the 0-20 Hz bandwidth, and with a lag time of 200 ms to maximize the correlation associated with the vestibular correcting responses (often referred to as the medium latency response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dalton et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mian and Day, 2014</xref>]). To confirm this choice, we explored the EVS-GRFs coherence using lag times in the 200-500 ms range (covering the duration of the vestibular balance correcting response) and observed minimal effect of these lags on the coherence results. We then interpolated or down-sampled the auto-spectra and cross-spectrum of these segments to a common length, their average length across all trials (repetitions, conditions and subjects) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blouin et al., 2011</xref>). For each head orientation and locomotor transition combination, we calculated the coherence spectrum between EVS and the GRF in each subject (100 segments) as well as on data pooled across all subjects (1000 segments). In order to characterize the changes in the vestibular-evoked balance responses over an interpretable time scale (s), we also performed the analysis without stretching or compressing <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf26"><mml:mi>τ</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> (i.e. the non-normalized time-scale format). We cut the data from both initiation and termination of locomotion to place the onset of the transition period at initiation and the end of the transition period at termination in the middle of a three-second data window. We then estimated the EVS-GRF coherence spectrum on this un-normalized data using the same procedure described previously. This analysis was performed both on the data for each subject (100 segments) as well as on the data pooled across all subjects (1000 segments) for each head orientation and locomotor transition combination. To cancel the shift in coherence timing induced by the 200 ms lag used in the time-frequency analyses, results and figures are presented with a 200 ms time-shift in the non-normalized time-scale analyses and an equivalent 200 ms time-shift in the normalized time-scale analyses.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7-2"><title>Posture-to-posture transition</title><p>We extracted 100 data segments per subject, which we analyzed using only the non-normalized time format. For these analyses, the onset of the transition was placed in the middle of a 7 s window. Similar to the locomotor transition analyses, data were decomposed on a trial-by-trial basis using a wavelet transformation. Coherence between EVS and the GRF was then calculated for each subject (100 segments) as well as on data pooled across all subjects (600 segments).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Significant whole-body responses to the EVS were identified on a subject-by-subject basis when coherence exceeded a 99% confidence limit determined by the number of trials completed (n = 100). This confidence limit corresponds to a coherence magnitude threshold of 0.045, and better represents an α-level of 0.05 because of the two-dimensional (time and frequency) nature of the measures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blouin et al., 2011</xref>). For illustrative purposes, we also computed the coherence for all subjects using the same procedure (n = 1000 for the locomotor transition or n = 600 for the posture-to-posture transition). Coherence crossed the 99% confidence limit in these pooled data at a magnitude of 0.005 (locomotor transition) or 0.008 (posture-to-posture transition). Under OFC theory, we expected a discontinuity in time-frequency coherence prior to the different transitions which should be reflective of the disengagement of either the balance, or (loco)motor control policies. To test this hypothesis, using the non-normalized time-scale format, we determined whether the magnitude of time-frequency coherence was significant or not (i.e. above or below the 99% confidence interval, respectively) over the transition period. To identify state-dependent changes in vestibular control of balance over the locomotor transition period, the magnitude of the peak time-dependent coherence and its corresponding frequency were extracted from the movement-time normalized data in each subject and for the three phases of the balance-locomotor transitions: quiet standing (from first vibration pulse to transition onset for initiation and from end of transition to last vibration pulse for termination), transition (from transition onset to first foot-off for initiation and from last foot-strike to transition end for termination) and the first/last step (from first foot-off to second foot-off for initiation and from second last foot-strike to last foot-strike for termination) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The same procedure was repeated for the posture-to-posture transition (but for the non-normalized time format) for the three following steps: quiet standing (from first vibration pulse to transition onset, i.e. vertical red line), transition (from transition onset to transition end, i.e. between the two vertical lines) and the new posture (from transition end, i.e. the vertical grey line, to the end of the trial) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Peak magnitude and/or frequency were used to determine whether coherence changed between the three phases, relative to the direction of vestibular-evoked responses. To test for significant differences across the three phases of each transition tested, we used repeated-measures multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA). To decompose the main effect, we used a multivariate <italic>post hoc</italic> analysis consisting of paired Hotelling’s <italic>t-</italic>square tests (Bonferroni corrected). For each multivariate <italic>post hoc</italic> test providing a significant result, we tested whether the significant result was caused by differences in magnitude peak coherence, peak coherence frequency, or both by performing a Bonferroni corrected paired <italic>t-</italic>test. In the locomotor transition, this whole procedure was repeated independently for each head orientation within each transition (initiation and termination). Coherence confidence limits were computed using Matlab software (2015a version, Mathworks, Natick, MA, USA). All other statistical tests were performed using R Studio software (version 3.3.1) with an α level of p&lt;0.05 serving as the threshold for significance.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"> <title>Acknowledgments</title> <p>Authors thank Cole Shin for technical support and Dr. David Bolton, Dr. Patrick Forbes and Dr. Aaron Palmer for relevant comments on the manuscript.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Richard Staines as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Richard Ivry as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This paper investigates the neural control of transitions between posture and movement. The interaction of vestibular information and balance-correcting mechanisms was investigated during transitions between quiet standing and locomotion. Electrical vestibular stimuli (EVS) were applied during stance and locomotion and the relationship between the vestibular stimuli and ground reaction forces were assessed using a time-frequency analysis as coherence between the two. The results show a clear low frequency coupling between EVS and ground reaction force during standing and a phase-dependent coupling observed only during the stance-phase of locomotion. The coupling disappeared approximately 200-300 ms before the transition phase from standing to the onset of locomotion, and rotating the head 90 degrees switched the coupling from mediolateral to frontoposterior directions, as expected based on the directional influence of EVS. The experimental design was developed to compare and contrast predictions from two general theories of motor control, Optimal feedback control (OFC) and equilibrium models. Overall, the experimental design is clever and highlights clear changes in the motor response to vestibular input from quiet stance to the transition of locomotion, phasic use of vestibular input during locomotion and changes again from locomotion to quiet stance. The data provides compelling support that feedback is context-dependent, suggesting control policies abruptly change as one switches between different types of behaviors, as expected within the OFC framework. Interestingly, the fact that the phase-dependent vestibular influence stops early before the last step suggests the last step may be kinematically similar to previous steps but the underlying control is quite distinct.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The primary concern is the lack of a control experiment that differentiates between transitions to pure walking (as tested) and adjustment for expectation of a new posture. One argument is that during the transition periods, the control system might be preparing for new posture before the walking actually begins. Specifically, it is unclear whether the observed change in the coherence is specific to the transition between posture to walking or/and it is more general control process of changes between different states (posture&lt;-&gt;new posture or posture&lt;-&gt;walking). A possible control for this would be testing participants while they switch between two/more postures that doesn't require walking (i.e., a single step to a new posture or simply a shift of weight largely from one leg to the other while maintaining constant balance). The main point here is the demonstration of this in a different transition to strengthen and generalize the important conclusion of this manuscript.</p><p>2) The experiments in this manuscript show that vestibular feedback is task dependent and turns off before the transition to initiate gait, is phasically involved in control during locomotion (only during double stance), and turned off for the last step before movement. Although this is good evidence that the entire motor system appears to be changing control policies, the degree to which the data is evidence against equilibrium models is less clear. Those that espouse the equilibrium-point framework may argue that the referent body configuration is maintained from quiet standing to locomotion and back again, and what this data shows is intermittent use of vestibular feedback. Unless you can find some argument about the continuous influence of non-proprioceptive feedback for the equilibrium point framework, you should probably acknowledge this alternative interpretation in the discussion and alter the introduction accordingly. It is suggested that the authors downplay the equilibrium theory and focus on flexible feedback processing with a focus on the novelty of task-dependent vestibular feedback processing related to posture, locomotion and transitions.</p><p>3) The quantitative description of the time-frequency analysis for the coherence measure is well described from previous work from this group and the results clear. However, more discussion as to the importance of this interaction between EVS-GRF in the frequency range of 0-10 Hz reflected by the coherence would be helpful. Specifically, a brief description of the neural mechanisms that contribute to this measure should be included.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.36123.017</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The primary concern is the lack of a control experiment that differentiates between transitions to pure walking (as tested) and adjustment for expectation of a new posture.

We performed a control experiment, using the same protocol as we did for locomotion but, according to the reviewers’ recommendation, we asked participants to shift their weight from 50% on each leg to 90% on their preferred leg without lifting the feet at any time. Because this movement involves a lateral displacement, we tested participants only in the head forward condition (EVS perturbation directed mediolaterally). The results from this experiment clearly show that the vestibular stabilizing mechanisms are interrupted when participants initiate the movement necessary to adopt a new posture. The duration of this vestibular suspension (810 ms) was similar to that observed during locomotion initiation (860 ms). This control experiment strengthens our initial results about locomotion and suggests, as proposed by the reviewers and editor, that the change in vestibular control of balance is a general control process that applies to transitions between two motor states (posture-to-posture and posture to movement). These complementary results are presented in Figure 6. According to the new results from the control experiment, several changes have been made in the new manuscript:</p><p>Title: the title has been changed to “Down regulation of vestibular balance stabilizing mechanisms to enable transition between motor states”</p><p>Abstract: It is now stated that we performed two experiments: “we investigated the continuity of the vestibular control of balance during transitions between quiet standing and locomotion and between two standing postures” and “Healthy subjects initiated and terminated locomotion or shifted the distribution of their weight between their feet, while exposed to electrical vestibular stimuli (EVS)”.</p><p>Introduction: we now refer to our experiment as testing the vestibular control of balance “between (two) motor states” instead of the previous statement which was “between posture and locomotion” and we indicated that we “examined the contribution of vestibular sensory signals to the control of balance during transition between quiet standing and locomotion as well as between two standing postures”.</p><p>Results: An addition was made to the first paragraph to explain the second experiment (posture-to-posture): “In the second study, six additional subjects (young adults, 3 females) completed one block of 105 trials where they were instructed to stand quietly, then shift their body-weight laterally to redistribute their weight so that 90% was supported by their preferred leg and only 10% by their non-preferred leg (defined as the ‘posture-to-posture transition’ experiment). Once participants redistributed their body-weight, they were asked to maintain this uneven weight distribution. In this task, participants received EVS for the duration of each trial (15 s)”. Moreover, a new paragraph, entitled “A vestibulo-motor null period also preceding the transition between two standing postures”, has been added to describe the new results from the posture-to-posture experiment.</p><p>Discussion: As in the Introduction section, we now refer mostly to our results as a transition between “two motor states” and references to the new experiment have been added (e.g. “To transition from quiet standing to movement, or another relatively stable posture” or “For the posture-to-posture transition, the motor control policy associated with standing balance is disengaged to permit the shift to a new posture”.</p><p>Conclusion: the conclusion has been updated to include the results from the posture-to-posture experiment and states, as suggested by the reviewers and the editors, that the change in vestibular control of balance is a general control process that applies to transitions between two motor states: “Importantly, the suppression of vestibular balance stabilizing mechanisms is not specific to one type of transition, suggesting it represents a general control process that occurs during transitions between standing balance and other motor states”.</p><p>Materials and methods: the “Population” section has been updated to include the 6 new subjects who participated to the posture-to-posture experiment, which bring the total number of participants to 16 subjects. In both the “Experimental design”and “Data reduction and signal analysis”sections, the text has been changed to include one subsection describing what was done for the locomotor transition experiment and one subsection describing what was done for the posture-to-posture transition experiment.</p><p>Finally, the “Statistical analysis” section has been updated to report the analysis which have been performed on the results from the posture-to-posture experiment: “The same procedure was repeated for the posture-to-posture transition (but for the non-normalized time format) for the three following steps: quiet standing (from first vibration pulse to transition onset, i.e. vertical red line), transition (from transition onset to transition end, i.e. between the two vertical lines) and the new posture (from transition end, i.e. the vertical grey line, to the end of the trial) (Figure 6)”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The experiments in this manuscript show that vestibular feedback is task dependent and turns off before the transition to initiate gait, is phasically involved in control during locomotion (only during double stance), and turned off for the last step before movement. Although this is good evidence that the entire motor system appears to be changing control policies, the degree to which the data is evidence against equilibrium models is less clear. Those that espouse the equilibrium-point framework may argue that the referent body configuration is maintained from quiet standing to locomotion and back again, and what this data shows is intermittent use of vestibular feedback. Unless you can find some argument about the continuous influence of non-proprioceptive feedback for the equilibrium point framework, you should probably acknowledge this alternative interpretation in the discussion and alter the introduction accordingly. It is suggested that the authors downplay the equilibrium theory and focus on flexible feedback processing with a focus on the novelty of task-dependent vestibular feedback processing related to posture, locomotion and transitions.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers’ recommendation about the equilibrium-point framework. Thus, we modified the text in the Introduction and Discussion sections to downplay the equilibrium theory and focus more on the processing of vestibular feedback related to transition from posture to movement (locomotion) or posture. In the Discussion we point out that the vestibular null period appears to contradict a monotonic transition in the referent body configuration but that it does not necessarily conflict with the idea of a referent body configuration driving the transition.</p><p>Introduction: “In this respect, OFC seems to diverge from other motor control theories, such as referent (threshold) control theory (Asatryan and Feldman 1965; Ostry and Feldman 2003). This latter theory suggests that a transition between postures involves a monotonic shift in the referent body orientation (Feldman et al., 2011; Mullick et al., 2018), transforming posture-stabilizing mechanisms into movement-inducing ones.”</p><p>Discussion: &quot;The disruption in vestibular contribution to balance during transitions appears to contradict a key prediction from referent control theory: a monotonic shift in referent body orientation during shifts in postures while standing upright (Mullick et al., 2018). Our data show the intermittent use of vestibular feedback during transition between standing postures but it is unclear if a shift in referent body configuration is associated with such a transition”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The quantitative description of the time-frequency analysis for the coherence measure is well described from previous work from this group and the results clear. However, more discussion as to the importance of this interaction between EVS-GRF in the frequency range of 0-10 Hz reflected by the coherence would be helpful. Specifically, a brief description of the neural mechanisms that contribute to this measure should be included.</p></disp-quote><p>Following the reviewers and editors’ point, we added one paragraph in the Discussion section to clarify what the interaction between EVS and GRF reflect in the 0-10 Hz frequency range: “Significant coherence between EVS and the GRF were limited primarily to the 0 – 10 Hz bandwidth despite using EVS up to 20 Hz. […] These low frequency responses observed in the GRF to the vestibular stimuli are thought to reflect neural processing underlying an organised balance correcting response to a craniocentric vestibular error signal (Reynolds 2010; Mian and Day 2014).”</p></body></sub-article></article>
