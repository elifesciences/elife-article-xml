small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) offer a potent means to control viral infections. An essential prerequisite for their design depends on identifying conserved and functional viral RNA structures in cells. Techniques that probe RNA structures in situ have recently been developed including SHAPE-MaP, which has been helpful in the analysis of secondary structures of RNA. In this study, we report on the application of SHAPE-MaP to the porcine epidemic diarrhea virus RNA genome to categorize different functional regions, including potential quadruplex-forming sequence and target sites of siRNA. Our results show that these structures can be exploited to inhibit viral proliferation and that SHAPE-MaP is an effective method to identify secondary structures in RNA genomes.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>SHAPE-MaP</kwd><kwd>RNA</kwd><kwd>siRNA</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research

ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Ursu et al., 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Warner et al., 2018</xref>). The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved six siRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tang and Khvorova, 2024</xref>), nine antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bennett, 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2024</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Crooke et al., 2021</xref>), and the RNA-targeting compound Risdiplam (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ratni et al., 2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sheridan, 2021</xref>) for treating complicated diseases such as spinal muscular atrophies. The selection of RNAs that are functional, conserved, and accessible to be targeted in vivo is fundamental to the development of RNA-targeting drugs. Unlike RNAs in vitro, the folding of RNAs in cells is affected by the intricate intracellular environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Manfredonia et al., 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zhang et al., 2021b</xref>). Thus, in situ probing for the accessibility of viral RNAs by antivirals is essential for the identification of targetable RNAs.</p><p>In recent years, the integration of chemical probing methods and high-throughput sequencing technologies has been used to analyze the structure of the viral RNA genome in infected cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boerneke et al., 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cao et al., 2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Flynn et al., 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Huber et al., 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Huston et al., 2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lan et al., 2022</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Li et al., 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Manfredonia et al., 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mauger et al., 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pollom et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Siegfried et al., 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Smola et al., 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yang et al., 2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zhang et al., 2021a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Ziv et al., 2020</xref>). These methods have confirmed the widespread presence of structurally organized RNA elements within the viral genome, which are composed of various types of RNA structures such as stem loop structures (with double-helical stems), RNA single-strands, RNA pseudoknots, and RNA G-quadruplexes (G4s), collectively forming a complex and dynamic global genome architecture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boerneke et al., 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kwok et al., 2016</xref>). Of these, RNA G4 has shown considerable promise due to its high stability and ability for modulation by small molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zhao et al., 2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fang et al., 2023</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fleming et al., 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kwok et al., 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ruggiero and Richter, 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wang et al., 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zhang et al., 2021a</xref>). Furthermore, RNA interference (RNAi) has been shown to inhibit gene expression and viral replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bennett, 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bowden-Reid et al., 2023</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Piasecka et al., 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Qureshi et al., 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sagan et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tang and Khvorova, 2024</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Westerhout and Berkhout, 2007</xref>). Despite advances, it remains a challenge to identify RNA elements or regions that serve as targets within complex genomic structural contexts.</p><p>Selective 2’-hydroxyl acylation and primer extension mutational profile (SHAPE-MaP) stands out in ex vivo RNA structure probe technologies for its ability to quantify nucleotide flexibility and solvent accessibility at single nucleotide resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lorenz et al., 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Siegfried et al., 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Smola et al., 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lucks et al., 2011</xref>). In short, SHAPE reagents like NAI selectively modify flexible unpaired 2’-OH groups in RNA, and these modifications are detected as mutations during reverse transcription, allowing precise mapping of RNA secondary structures by sequencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Siegfried et al., 2014</xref>). In the viral long-stranded RNA genome, SHAPE reactivities are used as constraints in the prediction of RNA structures based on nearest-neighbor rules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Deigan et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mathews, 2004a</xref>), which can result in thousands of possible conformations. The pairing probability of each nucleotide derived from the SHAPE reactivities was subsequently used to calculate the Shannon entropy. Regions with high Shannon entropy can adopt alternative conformations, while those with low Shannon entropy correspond to well-defined RNA structures or persistently single-stranded regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mathews et al., 2004b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Siegfried et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore, SHAPE reactivity provides information about the pairing probability and accessibility of nucleotides, whereas Shannon entropy reflects the likelihood of alternative conformations in a given region. RNA motifs with low SHAPE reactivity and low Shannon entropy are assumed to be well-folded structures and potential targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boerneke et al., 2019</xref>). In this study, we categorized RNAs with distinct features in the viral genome according to SHAPE reactivity and Shannon entropy and investigate their potential as targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Four regions with different characteristics in the porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) genome.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of SHAPE-MaP for probing the RNA structure of the PEDV genome in situ.

However, it is challenging to identify these RNAs from the viral genome in situ. In SHAPE-MaP analysis, regions with low reactivity and low entropy values are more likely to form a single stable structure in cells and are therefore considered candidates for potential functional RNAs and targets for antiviral therapy. Novel well-defined RNA structures that are critical for viral fitness in HIV, HCV, DENV, and SINV have been identified by the analysis of low SHAPE and low entropy regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dethoff et al., 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kutchko et al., 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Siegfried et al., 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mauger et al., 2015</xref>). However, there are still no clinically approved small molecule drugs or oligonucleotides targeting stable folded RNA structures. Our data show that two compounds interacted with the well-folded 5’UTR-SL5 of PEDV in vitro at µM-level KD, but did not show antiviral activity at 50 µM in cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s13">Figure 2—figure supplements 13</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s14">14</xref>). This result suggests that, on the one hand, the low accessibility of the regions with low SHAPE reactivity makes them difficult to access by compounds in cells and may require compounds to have a better KD with RNA. However, the binding of compounds to the well-folded structure does not necessarily alter its function. In contrast, the FDA-approved compound Risdiplam exerts its biological activity by stabilizing transient RNA structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Campagne et al., 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ratni et al., 2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sheridan, 2021</xref>), suggesting that it may be possible to inhibit viral proliferation by stabilizing variable conformations. We therefore focused our attention on highly accessible regions with high SHAPE reactivity in cells.</p><p>We identified 42 low SHAPE-high Shannon regions and 49 high SHAPE-high Shannon regions in the PEDV genome by SHAPE-MaP. These regions represent conformationally variable RNAs in the viral genome. As the low SHAPE regions are highly structured, it is difficult for the G4 in these regions to outcompete the folding of long base-paired structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Therefore, we selected a potential G4 sequence (PQS1) located in the high SHAPE-high Shannon region of nsp3 (PLpro), where a G4-disrupting mutation promotes viral proliferation. We found that Braco-19 significantly stabilized the G4 structure of PQS1 in vitro and inhibited PEDV proliferation in cells. Crucially, Braco-19 showed no inhibitory activity against the PQS1-mutant strain while maintaining potent activity against the PQS3-mutant strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3C</xref>). This suggests that the compound can selectively target the PQS1 of the high SHAPE-high Shannon region in cells. This approach can be extended to other RNA viruses and potentially to DNA viruses where RNA intermediates play critical roles in the viral life cycle.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Single-stranded RNA regions in viral genomes as the targets for antiviral therapy.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) PQSs in the single strands are easier to be induced into G4s by ligands than those in the paired regions.

When screening siRNA target sequences, sequence conservation and functional importance of the target region are usually given priority. However, the RNA structure of the target region also has a significant impact on the efficiency of RNAi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cao et al., 2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Manfredonia et al., 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Piasecka et al., 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Patzel et al., 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sagan et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Szabat et al., 2020</xref>). Our approach uniquely integrates in situ RNA structural data (SHAPE reactivity and Shannon entropy) to prioritize siRNA targets within stable single-stranded regions (high SHAPE reactivity, low Shannon entropy), which are experimentally validated as accessible in infected cells. This represents a significant departure from traditional siRNA design methods that rely primarily on sequence conservation, thermodynamic rules (e.g., Tuschl rules), or in vitro structural predictions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ali Zaidi et al., 2023</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Qureshi et al., 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tang and Khvorova, 2024</xref>), which may not accurately reflect intracellular RNA accessibility. Bowden-Reid et al. designed 39 antiviral siRNAs against various SARS-CoV-2 variants based on sequence conservation, ultimately identifying 8 highly effective sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bowden-Reid et al., 2023</xref>).

This independent finding aligns perfectly with our conclusions and demonstrates that SHAPE-based siRNA design outperforms sequence/structure-agnostic approaches, at least in terms of significantly improving antiviral siRNA screening efficiency. Given the growing availability of SHAPE datasets for numerous viruses, we are confident that our methodology will facilitate a more precise design of antiviral siRNAs.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell culture and PEDV infection</title><p>Vero E6 cells were cultured in 10 cm culture plates in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37°C with 5% CO<sub>2</sub>.

While the effect of Braco-19 on PQS1 is supported by strong evidence in the manuscript, the conclusion regarding the G4 region with high SHAPE and high Shannon entropy is based on a single target, PQS1.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their positive assessment of our methodology and dataset. We propose that dynamic RNA structures in high SHAPE-high Shannon regions, when stabilized by small molecules, can serve as viable targets for antiviral therapy. Gquadruplexes represent a characteristic type of such dynamic structures that compete with local stem-loop formations in the genome. While we identified seven highly conserved PQSs in the PEDV genome, only PQS1 was located within a high SHAPEhigh Shannon region. To further validate this concept, we have supplemented the revised manuscript with Thioflavin T (ThT) fluorescence turn-on assays (Figures 3D, 3E, and Figure 3 – figure supplement 6), which provide additional evidence for the differential G4-forming capabilities of PQSs across regions with distinct structural features.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>Major Comments:</p><p>(1) It could be valuable for the authors to spend some more effort comparing their approach to siRNA target discovery and design to current methods for siRNA design. It would be good to highlight which components are novel, and which might offer superior performance with respect to other existing methods.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for highlighting this important point. In response, we have rewritten the relevant section in the discussion:</p><p>“Our approach uniquely integrates in situ RNA structural data (SHAPE reactivity and Shannon entropy) to prioritize siRNA targets within stable single-stranded regions (high SHAPE reactivity, low Shannon entropy), which are experimentally validated as accessible in infected cells. This represents a significant departure from traditional siRNA design methods that rely primarily on sequence conservation, thermodynamic rules (e.g., Tuschl rules), or in vitro structural predictions (Ali Zaidi et al., 2023; Qureshi et al., 2018; Tang and Khvorova, 2024),which may not accurately reflect intracellular RNA accessibility. Bowden-Reid et al. designed 39 antiviral siRNAs against various SARS-CoV-2 variants based on sequence conservation, ultimately identifying 8 highly effective sequences (Bowden-Reid et al., 2023). Notably, five of these effective sequences targeted regions that were located in high SHAPE-high Shannon regions according to SARS-CoV-2 SHAPE datasets (Supplementary Table 8) (Manfredonia et al., 2020). This independent finding aligns perfectly with our conclusions and demonstrates that SHAPE-based siRNA design outperforms sequence/structureagnostic approaches, at least in terms of significantly improving antiviral siRNA screening efficiency. Given the growing availability of SHAPE datasets for numerous viruses, we are confident that our methodology will facilitate more precise design of antiviral siRNAs.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The section targeting their discovered G4 structure with Braco-19 is interesting, particularly showing effects on viral proliferation; however, it's not clear to me how this compound could be used therapeutically against PEDV, as it is a non-selective binder of G4 structures. Their results are good support for the presence and functionality of a G4 structure in PEDV, but I don't see any strategy outlined in the manuscript on how this could be specifically targeted with Braco-19.</p></disp-quote><p>While Braco-19 is indeed a broad-spectrum G4 ligand, our data demonstrate that not all PQSs in the viral genome can form G4 structures under physiological conditions. Our results specifically show that Braco-19 exerts its anti-PEDV activity by targeting PQS1, which is located in a high SHAPE-high Shannon entropy region. This target specificity was further confirmed by the complete resistance of the PQS1mut strain (lacking G4-forming ability) to Braco-19 treatment in our in vitro assays.</p><p>Additionally, previous studies have reported that during rapid viral replication, viral RNA accumulates to levels that significantly exceed host RNA concentrations. This &quot;concentration advantage&quot; suggests that G4 ligands like Braco-19 would preferentially bind viral G4 structures over host targets, thereby enhancing their antiviral specificity in vivo. In summary, our data provide proof-of-concept that viral genomic regions with high G4-forming potential - particularly those in high SHAPE-high Shannon entropy regions - represent promising targets for antiviral therapy.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) The section where they proposed 3D RNA structures based on sequence similarity feels &quot;tacked on&quot; and I don't see how it adds to the overall story. The authors identify a short RNA hairpin in the PEDV genome with some sequence similarity to the CPEB3 nuclease P4 hairpin. However, they don't provide any evidence that this motif functions in a similar way or that it's important for the virus's life cycle. They also don't explain how this similarity could be exploited for antiviral drug development. It's not clear whether targeting this motif would have any effect on the virus. It's interesting that these two sequences share nucleotides, but it's unlikely that they share any homology...perhaps they convergently evolved (or were captured), but the similarity could also be coincidental.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer's insightful observation regarding this section. While our intention was to demonstrate that flexible conformations in high SHAPE-high Shannon regions could potentially be targeted, we acknowledge that extensive discussion of these motifs' functions would exceed the scope of this study, resulting in some disconnection from the main narrative. In response to this valuable feedback, we have consequentially removed it from the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) The authors should consider the optimality of the synonymous mutation (G3109A) that they introduced, as G3109A could swap a rare codon for a more optimal one. Even though the protein sequence is unaffected, the translation rate (and ability to proliferate) could be very different due to altered codon optimality. Additionally, to show the inactivity of the PQS3 mutant, the Braco-19 treatment studies performed on the PQS1 mutants could be repeated with PQS3 - using this as a control for these experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer's insightful comment regarding codon optimization. In the PEDV genome, the PQS1 mutation site encodes lysine (AAG). Since lysine has only two codons (AAG and AAA), the G3109A synonymous mutation was our only viable option. Published literature (Ding et al. 2024) confirms that neither AAG nor AAA are classified as either preferred or rare codons in mammalian cells. Therefore, this substitution should have minimal direct impact on translation efficiency. Compared to nonsynonymous mutations that would alter amino acid sequences, we believe this synonymous mutation represents the optimal approach for maintaining native protein function while introducing the desired structural modification.</p><p>REFERENCES:</p><p>Ding W, Yu W, Chen Y, et al.

In the revised manuscript, we have comprehensively strengthened the point of 'G4 stabilization' as an antiviral mechanism through the following enhancements:</p><p>(1) In the Results section: We present Thioflavin T (ThT) fluorescence assays demonstrating the G4-forming capability of PQSs in the full-length PEDV genomic RNA context:</p><p>“These findings indicate that although most PQSs can form G4 structures in vitro, PQS1—located in the high SHAPE-high Shannon entropy region—demonstrates the most robust G4-forming capability when competing with local secondary structures in the genomic context.”</p><p>(2) In the Results section: The inclusion of Braco-19 inhibition assays using PQS3 mutant virus as control provides robust evidence that Braco-19 exerts its antiviral effects specifically through PQS1 stabilization:</p><p>“Furthermore, as a control, we observed nearly identical inhibitory activity of Braco-19 against both the PQS3 mutant strain (AJ1102-PQS3mut) and wild-type virus, demonstrating the specificity of Braco-19's action on PQS1.”</p><p>(3) In the Discussion section: We have rewritten the mechanistic interpretation to emphasize:</p><p>&quot;Crucially, Braco-19 showed no inhibitory activity against the PQS1-mutant strain while maintaining potent activity against the PQS3-mutant strain (Figure 4E, Figure 4—figure supplement 3C). This suggests that the compound can selectively target the PQS1 of the high SHAPE-high Shannon region in cells.&quot;</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(13) For PQS1, it's suggested that it is indeed a competing and transient conformation that forms the G4. I wonder if using an extended PQS1 (perhaps what is shown in Figure 3E) and using fluorescence, and/or K+ vs Li+, and/or in-vitro SHAPE could tell us more about this dynamic structure. Thioflavin T or any other fluorescent molecule that binds to G4s could be easily used to show how the formation of G4 may happen or not. In addition, how Braco-19 could really lock the dynamic structure in-vitro as well. I think the field would benefit from a deeper investigation of it.</p></disp-quote><p>To address the dynamic competition between G4 and alternative RNA conformations, we performed Thioflavin T (ThT) fluorescence turn-on assay (now in Figure 3D-E and Figure 3—figure supplement 6) under physiological K<sup>+</sup> conditions (100 mM), with PRRSV-G4 RNA as a positive control. This reads as:</p><p>“To validate whether SHAPE analysis could reflect the competitive conformational folding of PQSs in the PEDV genome, we performed in vitro transcription to obtain local intact structures containing PQSs within dynamic single-stranded regions and stable double-stranded regions (Table S6). Thioflavin T (ThT) fluorescence turn-on assays were conducted under physiological K<sup>+</sup> conditions (100 mM), with the G4 sequence of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) serving as a positive control (Control-G4)(Fang et al., 2023). The results demonstrated that for short PQSs sequences containing only G4-forming motifs (Table S7), PQS1, PQS3, PQS4, and PQS6 all induced significant ThT fluorescence enhancement (Figure 3D-E, Figure 3—figure supplement 6), confirming their ability to form G4 structures. However, in long RNA fragments encompassing PQSs and their flanking sequences, only PQS1 and PQS4 exhibited pronounced ThT fluorescence responses (Figure 3DE), whereas PQS2, PQS3, and PQS6 showed negligible signals (Figure 3E, Figure 3— figure supplement 6). Notably, the PQS1-long chain displayed the strongest fluorescence signal, while its mutant counterpart (PQS1mut-long chain) exhibited the lowest background fluorescence (Figure 3D). These findings indicate that although most PQSs can form G4 structures in vitro, PQS1—located in the high SHAPE-high Shannon entropy region—demonstrates the most robust G4-forming capability when competing with local secondary structures in the genomic context. Therefore, PQS1 was selected for further structural and functional validation.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(14) Figure S29 is nice and informative.
