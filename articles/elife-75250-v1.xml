immune disorders, and cancer. Therefore, they have been identified as potential targets for novel therapeutic strategies. There are four p38 family members (p38α, p38β, p38γ, and p38δ) that are activated by MKK3 and MKK6. Here, we demonstrate that lack of MKK6 reduces the lifespan in mice. Longitudinal study of cardiac function in MKK6 KO mice showed that young mice develop cardiac hypertrophy which progresses to cardiac dilatation and fibrosis with age. Mechanistically, lack of MKK6 blunts p38α activation while causing MKK3-p38γ/δ hyperphosphorylation and increased mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling, resulting in cardiac hypertrophy. Cardiac hypertrophy in MKK6 KO mice is reverted by knocking out either p38γ or p38δ or by inhibiting the mTOR pathway with rapamycin. In conclusion, we have identified a key role for the MKK3/6-p38γ/δ pathway in the development of cardiac hypertrophy, which has important implications for the clinical use of p38α inhibitors in the long-term treatment since they might result in cardiotoxicity.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>The human heart can increase its size to supply more blood to the body’s organs. This process, called hypertrophy, can happen during exercise or be caused by medical conditions, such as high blood pressure or inherited genetic diseases. If hypertrophy is continually driven by illness, this can cause the heart to fail and no longer be able to properly pump blood around the body.</p><p>For hypertrophy to happen, several molecular changes occur in the cells responsible for contracting the heart, including activation of the p38 pathway. Within this pathway is a p38 enzyme as well as a series of other proteins which are sequentially turned on in response to stress, such as inflammatory molecules or mechanical forces that alter the cell’s shape.</p><p>There are different types of p38 enzyme which have been linked to other diseases, making them a promising target for drug development. However, clinical trials blocking individual members of the p38 family have had disappointing results. An alternative approach is to target other proteins involved in the p38 pathway, such as MKK6, but it is not known what effect this might have.</p><p>To investigate, Romero-Becerra et al. genetically modified mice to not have any MKK6 protein. As a result, these mice had a shorter lifespan, with hypertrophy developing at a young age that led to heart problems. Romero-Becerra et al. used different mice models to understand why this happened, showing that a lack of MKK6 reduces the activity of a specific member of the p38 family called p38α. However, this blockage boosted a different branch of the pathway which involved two other p38 proteins, p38γ and p38δ. This, in turn, triggered another key pathway called mTOR which also promotes hypertrophy of the heart.</p><p>These results suggest that drugs blocking MKK6 and p38α could lead to side effects that cause further harm to the heart. A more promising approach for treating hypertrophic heart conditions could be to inhibit p38γ and/or p38δ. However, before this can be fully explored, further work is needed to generate compounds that specifically target these proteins.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>p38

to hemodynamic stress that can be physiological (e.g. pregnancy or exercise) or pathological (e.g. hypertension or valvular disease). Physiological cardiac hypertrophy is accompanied by a normal or even enhanced cardiac function, while pathological forms of hypertrophy are accompanied by myocardial dysfunction and fibrosis and represent a risk factor for ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Maillet et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nakamura and Sadoshima, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Oldfield et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Initially, cardiac hypertrophy is induced as a compensatory response to preserve cardiac function under stressful conditions, a process known as adaptive cardiac hypertrophy. However, if the pathological stimulus is maintained, this adaptive cardiac hypertrophy will eventually lead to the development of pathological cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nakamura and Sadoshima, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Oldfield et al., 2020</xref>). The form of cardiac hypertrophy developed will depend on the type of the hypertrophic stimuli, the duration of the stimuli, and the downstream signaling involved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nakamura and Sadoshima, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Oldfield et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shimizu and Minamino, 2016</xref>). Several signaling pathways known to promote physiological cardiac hypertrophic growth have been found to drive pathological hypertrophy and cardiac dysfunction when persistently activated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Heineke and Molkentin, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Maillet et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nakamura and Sadoshima, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Porrello et al., 2008</xref>). For instance, IGF1 or Akt transgenic mice develop proportionately enlarged hearts with initially normal cardiac function, which over time progress to pathological hypertrophy with impaired cardiac function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Delaughter et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Shiojima et al., 2005</xref>). An essential feature of both physiological and pathological hypertrophy is increased protein synthesis, critically regulated by the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway mainly through the phosphorylation of its downstream substrates. Activation of mTOR signaling is increased during postnatal cardiac development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">González-Terán et al., 2016</xref>) as well as in the hearts of transgenic mouse models suffering from physiological cardiac hypertrophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">McMullen et al., 2004a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">McMullen et al., 2004b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Shioi et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Shioi et al., 2003</xref>). Moreover, the specific mTOR inhibitor rapamycin attenuates and reverses cardiac-overload-induced pathological hypertrophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Shioi et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>Stress-inducing stimuli in the heart activate several mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) including the p38 family. p38 kinases control a wide range of processes, and their dysregulation has been linked to numerous diseases, making them a promising pharmacological target for therapeutic use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Canovas and Nebreda, 2021</xref>). The main p38 upstream activators are the MAPK MKK3 and MKK6, which are highly selective for p38 MAPKs and do not activate c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs) or ERK1/2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cuenda et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cuenda et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dérijard et al., 1995</xref>). Mice lacking both MKK3 and MKK6 are non-viable and die in mid-gestation, associated with defects in the placenta and the embryonic vasculature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brancho et al., 2003</xref>). In contrast, mice individually lacking MKK3 or MKK6 are healthy, indicating partial functional overlap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lu et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tanaka et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wysk et al., 1999</xref>). Both MKKs are expressed in cardiac tissue and have been implicated in cardiac hypertrophy. But, this evidence is based on overexpressing dominant negative or constitutively active MKK3 and MKK6 mutants, and these non-physiological models could produce artifactual phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Braz et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Muslin, 2008</xref>). Moreover, it is not known which MKK is the main isoform required for activation of the different p38s family members (p38α, p38β, p38γ, and p38δ) during postnatal growth and in response to other hypertrophic stimuli. The heart expresses all four p38s, but protein levels are higher for p38α and p38γ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dumont et al., 2019</xref>). During embryonic development, p38α and p38β play redundant roles in the regulation of cardiac proliferation; mice lacking both kinases develop septal defects. However, mice lacking cardiac p38α or p38β alone have a normal cardiac structure and function under baseline conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">del Barco Barrantes et al., 2011</xref>). In response to cardiac overload, p38α contributes to myocyte apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nishida et al., 2004</xref>), whereas p38β might affect hypertrophic response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baines and Molkentin, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Braz et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Liao et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Petrich and Wang, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wang, 2007</xref>). We have previously shown that p38γ and p38δ have a predominant role in the regulation of the cardiac hypertrophy mediating physiological early postnatal and pathological angiotensin II-induced cardiac hypertrophy through mTOR activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">González-Terán et al., 2016</xref>). Additionally, p38γ and p38δ control the postnatal metabolic switch in the heart blocking glycogen storage by the inhibition of GYS1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Santamans et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Here, we demonstrate a not previously described specificity of MKK3 for the activation of p38γ/δ and MKK6 for the activation of p38α in the heart. Furthermore, we find that MKK3/p38γ/δ hyperactivation in MKK6 KO mice promotes cardiac hypertrophy through mTOR activation, which progresses to a pathological cardiac hypertrophy phenotype with age and development of cardiac dysfunction. In addition, using mice lacking muscle p38α, we found that this kinase inhibits MKK3 expression and activation in the heart. Our results have important implications for the clinical use of p38α inhibitors in long-term treatment since they might result in hyperactivation of MKK3/p38γ/δ axis triggering cardiotoxicity.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>MKK6-deficient mice die prematurely</title><p>Several studies have addressed the role of p38 signaling in homeostasis and disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nikolic et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Romero-Becerra et al., 2020</xref>).

This observation suggested that increased phosphorylation of p38γ and p38δ in the MKK6 KO hearts resulted from MKK3 activation. Accordingly, phosphorylation of p38γ and p38δ was strongly reduced in MKK3-deficient mice, whereas p38α phosphorylation was not changed appreciably (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). In addition, hearts of MKK3 KO mice were smaller at 9 weeks of age when compared with age-matched WT controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>), a finding consistent with the previously described roles of p38γ and p38δ in promoting postnatal cardiac hypertrophic growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">González-Terán et al., 2016</xref>). To evaluate if p38α decreased activity was involved in the MKK3 increased phosphorylation observed in MKK6 KO mice, we generated mice lacking p38α specifically in muscle (<italic>Mck-Cre; Mapk14<sup>LoxP/LoxP</sup></italic> [p38α<sup>MCK-KO</sup>]). p38α<sup>MCK-KO</sup> mice presented an increased expression and phosphorylation of MKK3 and MKK6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A</xref>). This agreed with previous evidence indicating that p38α regulates p38 upstream kinases at the transcriptional level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ambrosino et al., 2003</xref>). We then evaluated MKK3 expression in hearts from MKK6 KO mice and found that lack of p38α activation also promoted an increase in MKK3 mRNA and protein levels in these animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2B and C</xref>), indicating a negative feedback regulation of MKK3 expression and activity by p38α activation. Taken together, these observations suggest that in the heart, MKK6 primarily targets p38α and MKK3 targets p38γ and p38δ. In addition, they suggest that MKK6 deficiency leads to cardiac hypertrophy via activation of MKK3 and p38γ and p38δ.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>MKK6 is necessary for p38α phosphorylation and MKK3 for p38γ and p38δ phosphorylation in the heart.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Western blot analysis of the phosphorylation and amount of p38γ and δ immunoprecipitated from heart lysates from 9-week-old wild type WT (n=3–4) and MKK6 KO (n=3–4) mice.

The cardiac hypertrophy developed in mice lacking MKK6 seems to be physiological in young animals, with normal or even increased cardiac function at baseline. However, aging induced the development of cardiac dysfunction and premature death. Extensive analysis with different knockout mouse models shows that in the absence of MKK6, the MKK3-stimulated p38γ/δ kinases become hyperactivated and induce enhanced postnatal hypertrophic growth through the mTOR pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Our results also reveal that the two main upstream p38 activators are strongly biased toward the activation of specific p38 MAPK isoforms in the heart, with p38γ/δ mainly regulated by MKK3 and p38α by MKK6, at least in homeostatic conditions.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Model for p38γ/δ activation mediated cardiac hypertrophic growth.</title><p>In a physiological context, MKK3-p38γ/δ pathway promotes normal cardiac growth through the activation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway.

Such reports, however, have not addressed how different p38 MAPK isoforms are regulated, and the relative contributions of MKK3 and MKK6 to cardiac hypertrophic phenotypes have so far remained unclear. For instance, either overexpression of constitutively active or dominant negative forms of MKK3/6 in vitro result in cardiac hypertrophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Braz et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Streicher et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zechner et al., 1997</xref>), while in vivo transgenic overexpression of MKK6 in mouse heart did not affect cardiac hypertrophy but resulted in protection against myocardial infarction and reduced levels of markers of apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Martindale et al., 2005</xref>). Our results establish for the first time a complete in vivo description of the specific role of each p38 family member and their upstream kinases MKK3 and MKK6 in cardiac hypertrophy in young animals and their deleterious effects with aging. Our in vivo data support a model wherein MKK3 activity promotes hypertrophic growth. We show that MKK3 hyperactivation resulting from MKK6 deletion leads to cardiac hypertrophy, while MKK3 genetic ablation results in reduced postnatal cardiac growth. We also demonstrate that deficiency of MKK6 in cardiomyocytes is sufficient to result in cardiac hypertrophy, attributable to both, MKK6 direct function in inducing hypertrophy via p38-mediated signaling as well as its role as a negative regulator of MKK3 activity. Our results indicate that this negative regulation is mediated by p38α, both at the expression and the phosphorylation level of MKK3. This is in agreement with previous studies describing that p38α regulates the transcription of these kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ambrosino et al., 2003</xref>). Additionally, there is evidence indicating that p38α might negatively regulate the MKK3/6 upstream kinase MAP3K TAK1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Singhirunnusorn et al., 2005</xref>). Indeed, we have found that in other tissues, the lack of p38α induces p38γ and p38δ activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Matesanz et al., 2018</xref>). The negative feedback activity of p38α is consistent with MKK3 hyperphosphorylation identified in MKK6 KO mice and in p38α<sup>MCK-KO</sup> mice. Our results provide the first demonstration that MKK3 preferentially regulates p38γ and p38δ activation, whereas MKK6 is responsible for p38α regulation.</p><p>MKK6-deficient mice show p38γ/δ hyperactivation and impaired p38α activation, possibly implicating any of these isoforms in the observed phenotypes. Through the use of multiple in vivo models, we show that hyperphosphorylated MKK3 promotes cardiac hypertrophic growth through activation of p38γ/δ-DEPTOR-mediated mTOR signaling in the heart. This is consistent with our earlier work showing an essential role for these p38 isoforms in mTOR-dependent physiological and pathological cardiac hypertrophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">González-Terán et al., 2016</xref>), as well as with previous reports indicating that p38α does not mediate hypertrophic responses in animal models of pressure-overload cardiac hypertrophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nishida et al., 2004</xref>). This conclusion is corroborated by the reversion of cardiac hypertrophy in MKK6-deficient mice also deficient for cardiac p38γ or p38δ, and further corroboration comes from the ability of the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin to prevent cardiac hypertrophy during early postnatal cardiac development in MKK6-deficient mice. These findings correlate with impaired p38γ and p38δ activation and reduced postnatal hypertrophic growth in MKK3-deficient mice. Nevertheless, MKK3 deficiency in the context of MKK6 deletion in striated muscle produced a reduction in mTOR activation and attenuation of cardiac growth but was not able to completely rescue the normal heart size. This result suggests that, apart from mTOR activation, MKK6 deficiency might affect other signaling pathways affecting cardiac hypertrophy. For example, p38γ/δ have been implicated in the regulation of the postnatal cardiac metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Santamans et al., 2021</xref>), which is another known direct cause of cardiac hypertrophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nakamura and Sadoshima, 2018</xref>).</p><p>The p38γ- and p38δ-mediated control of cardiac hypertrophy during postnatal cardiac development resides in cardiomyocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">González-Terán et al., 2016</xref>). Accordingly, lack of MKK6 in skeletal muscle or cardiomyocytes yields the same phenotype as global MKK6 deficiency. Furthermore, the blockade of cardiac hypertrophy in MKK6-deficient mice upon deletion of p38δ specifically in striated muscle indicates that cardiac p38δ lies downstream of MKK6 in the signaling pathway controlling hypertrophic growth. Interestingly, reversion of the MKK6-deficient phenotype upon p38δ deletion was greater than that achieved upon deletion of p38γ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), consistent with the reported dominance of p38δ in regulating cardiac hypertrophic growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">González-Terán et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Young MKK6-deficient mice develop a cardiac hypertrophy that could be classified as physiological, characterized by a proportionate increase in heart size with the maintenance of a normal cardiac structure. Moreover, cardiac function was normal, with increased cardiac output and stroke volume, and there was no evidence of fibrosis or re-expression of the cardiac stress fetal gene program. Physiological cardiac hypertrophy is an adaptive response that increases ventricular mass while maintaining or enhancing cardiac function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kang, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nakamura and Sadoshima, 2018</xref>). However, it has increasingly become appreciated that sustained activation of the pathways that drive this beneficial response can ultimately result in pathological remodeling and associated sudden cardiac death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Condorelli et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lauschke and Maisch, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Matsui et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">McMullen et al., 2004a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Oldfield et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Shioi et al., 2002</xref>). In agreement with this, the cardiac hypertrophy observed in MKK6 KO mice becomes deleterious with age, compromising the cardiac function, and likely contributing to the reduced survival observed in these mice. We corroborated that cardiac dysfunction due to the deficiency of MKK6 restricted to cardiomyocytes in conditional KO mice also resulted in a reduced lifespan. Nevertheless, it cannot be discarded that dysfunction of other organs may also contribute to the premature death of MKK6 KO mice. Respiratory weakness related to kyphosis or ataxia could also contribute to the reduced survival of these mice at advanced ages. This would be in line with the phenotypic alterations observed in other disease mouse models with reduced lifespan, such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy or Huntington’s disease, in which cardiomyopathy and heart dysfunction play an important role in disease progression, and it is the leading cause of death in patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Burns et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Caravia et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>The activation of the p38α pathway has been linked to several diseases, suggesting that this pathway could represent a target for their treatment. However, the results from the clinical trials have been disappointing so far (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Canovas and Nebreda, 2021</xref>). p38α inhibitors have been the most profoundly studied. However, these studies usually do not consider the possible undesired effect of p38α inhibition upon the other p38 pathway kinases, which could be among the reasons for failure in the outcomes. Our results show an example of how p38α inhibition leads to an unexpected activation of MKK3-p38γ/δ axis, having deleterious effects on the heart in the long term. Our finding suggests that treatment strategies using longstanding p38α inhibition should consider the potential cardiovascular risk among the possible secondary effects of the treatment. Additionally, our results indicate that inhibition of p38γ/δ could be a therapeutic strategy to treat pathologies such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy that still remains unexplored due to the lack of specific inhibitors for these p38 family members.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animal preparation</title><p>MKK3 KO mice (B6.129-<italic>Map2k3<sup>tm1Flv</sup></italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lu et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wysk et al., 1999</xref>) and MKK6 KO mice (B6.129-<italic>Map2k6<sup>tm1Flv</sup></italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brancho et al., 2003</xref>) were as previously described.

Scans were conducted by two experienced researchers blinded to the mouse genotype. Measurements of left parasternal long and short axes and M-mode images (left parasternal short-axis) were obtained at a heart rate of 500–550 beats per minute. LV end-diastolic diameter (LVEDD), LV end-systolic diameter (LVESD), and wall thickness were measured from M-mode tracings, and the average of three consecutive cardiac cycles is reported. The LV fractional shortening percentage was calculated as ([LVEDD−LVESD]/LVEDD)×100. MRI of lung was performed with a 7T Agilent scanner (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA) equipped with a DD2 console and an actively shielded gradient set (205/120 insert of maximum 130 mT m<sup>−1</sup> gradient strength). To enhance the signal-to-noise ratio during image acquisition, we used a combination of a 72 mm inner diameter quadrature birdcage TX volume coil (Rapid Biomedical GmBH, Germany) and an actively detuning 30 mm flexible customized surface RX coil (Neos Biotec, Pamplona, Spain). After acquisition of a tripilot gradient-echo image, a gradient-echo sequence without gating was used to acquire oblique coronal slices (1–2 slices) and axial slices (7–10 slices covering the entire lung, 72 s acquisition time per slice) using the following parameters: TR/TE = 6.7/2.2 ms, flip angle = 10°, bandwidth = 100 kHz, field of view = 3 × 3 cm, matrix = 256 × 128, and slice thickness = 1 mm (ref. 40). These images were used to determine interventricular septum and LV posterior wall thicknesses and LV corrected mass; the short-axis M-mode quantification was chosen as the most representative. The cardiac function was estimated from the ejection fraction and fractional shortening obtained from M-mode views by a blinded echocardiography expert. For ejection fraction measurements, a long- or short-axis view of the heart was selected to obtain an M-mode registration in a line perpendicular to the left ventricular septum and posterior wall at the level of the mitral chordae tendineae.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Immunoblot analysis</title><p>Tissue extracts were prepared in Triton lysis buffer (20 mM Tris [pH 7.4], 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 137 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 25 mM β-glycerophosphate, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg ml<sup>–1</sup> aprotinin and leupeptin).

The paper also provides a mechanism for this phenomenon and demonstrate that MKK6 deletion leads to reduced p38a activation but at the same time causes MKK3-p38g/d hyperphosphorylation and increased mTOR signaling.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Mone Zaidi as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>We believe it is important to address the comments of all reviewers, specifically the following:</p><p>1. The authors recently published a review paper in International Journal of Molecular Sciences on the role of P38 MAPK pathway in the heart. It is important for the authors to better highlight the significance of their findings over what has been published in the past.</p><p>2. In figure 5, more immunoblots demonstrating reduced phosphorylation of p38g/d are needed. Since this is a major part of the conclusion, the authors need to report more than N=1.</p><p>3. In figure 7, P-eEF2K blot is not publication quality and should be repeated.</p><p>4. The experiments in Figure 7E do not make sense. Are the authors implying that rapamycin has no effect on cardiac hypertrophy in WT mice, but reduces cardiac hypertrophy in MKK6 KO mice? This interpretation is incorrect, since mTOR has an effect in cardiac hypertrophy even in WT mice. Additionally, it is hard to interpret the data in that figure, since significance between saline and rapamycin in WT mice is not provided. Finally, the authors noted a difference in WT in cardiomyocyte area in Figure 7G.</p><p>5. Although this claim is made in the paper, the authors fail to provide evidence that p38a inhibits MKK3.</p><p>6. p38 can be activated by AMPK in certain contexts, and the authors have previously shown that Mkk6 deficiency can activates AMPK. What is the status of the cardiac AMPK pathway in striated and cardiac-specific Mkk6 knockout mice? If AMPK is inhibited, is there any change in p38 status?</p><p>7. The ataxic phenotype of the Mkk6 knockout mice is striking, however the authors do not elaborate on this. How does this fit in with the age-related cardiac dysfunction? Are these separate pathologic processes or part of a unifying syndrome? Do the authors believe these mice die prematurely due to ataxia and respiratory weakness related to kyphosis, or the cardiac dysfunction, or both?</p><p>8. MKK3 data are associative. The authors should test whether MKK3 inhibition is able to attenuate p38γ/δ and mTOR activation and attenuate cardiac growth in MKK6 KO mice. Similarly, it would be important to evaluate whether cardiac overexpression of p38α is able to rescue cardiac hypertrophy and mTOR activation in MKK6 KO mice. In case the authors cannot perform these experiments, similar studies should at least be performed in primary cardiomyocytes in vitro.</p><p>9. The authors should check whether MKK3 interaction with p38γ/δ is enhanced in MKK6 KO mice. Proximity ligation assay would be useful for these experiments, also to get additional insights into the subcellular compartments in which these interactions may occur.</p><p>10. p38 α/γ/δ activity should be measured in MKK6 KO mice.</p><p>11. In the proposed mechanism (Figure 8), the authors suggest that p38α inhibits MKK3 in wild type mice. It is not clear how p38α regulates MKK3. Please address this issue.</p><p>12. The cause of death in aged systemic MKK6 KO mice should be understood. It is not clear whether these mice die because of cardiac abnormalities or through other non-cardiac issues. Do cardiomyocyte-specific MKK6 mice develop cardiac dysfunction and die prematurely?</p><p>13. The authors claim that activation of mTOR in MKK6 -/- mice is a direct consequence of p38γ/δ activation. However, this statement should be supported by additional evidence, also clarifying how p38γ/δ would regulate mTOR. DEPTOR phosphorylation and expression should be analysed, as performed in previous work from the same group (PMID: 26795633).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic>This is a well written paper and the data support the conclusion. As mentioned above, the novelty of the paper remains a major concern for this reviewer.</p><p>1. The authors recently published a review paper in International Journal of Molecular Sciences on the role of P38 MAPK pathway in the heart. It is important for the authors to better highlight the significance of their findings over what has been published in the past.</p><p>2. In figure 5, more immunoblots demonstrating reduced phosphorylation of p38g/d are needed. Since this is a major part of the conclusion, the authors need to report more than N=1.</p><p>3.

The authors recently published a review paper in International Journal of Molecular Sciences on the role of P38 MAPK pathway in the heart. It is important for the authors to better highlight the significance of their findings over what has been published in the past.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for not including a more extensive review of the current knowledge of the role of p38 pathway in heart function to highlight the novelty of our results. We have now included this view in the manuscript and highlight the significance of our findings.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. In figure 5, more immunoblots demonstrating reduced phosphorylation of p38g/d are needed. Since this is a major part of the conclusion, the authors need to report more than N=1.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for having included only one of the representative Immunoprecipitation blots. Now we have included the replicates in Figure 1 of this letter and Figure 5 —figure supplement 1A.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. In figure 7, P-eEF2K blot is not publication quality and should be repeated.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the low-quality blot. Sometimes performing immunoblots from animal cardiac tissue in homeostatic condition is challenging. We have now included a new blot with better quality (Figure 7B).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The experiments in Figure 7E do not make sense. Are the authors implying that rapamycin has no effect on cardiac hypertrophy in WT mice, but reduces cardiac hypertrophy in MKK6 KO mice? This interpretation is incorrect, since mTOR has an effect in cardiac hypertrophy even in WT mice. Additionally, it is hard to interpret the data in that figure, since significance between saline and rapamycin in WT mice is not provided. Finally, the authors noted a difference in WT in cardiomyocyte area in Figure 7G.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the comment and we are sorry to have not explained properly these results. Rapamycin treatment had, indeed, an effect on cardiac hypertrophy in WT mice. However, this was not strong enough to be significant in a Tukey’s post hoc test following the 2-way ANOVA test that corrects for the multiple comparisons. However, the comparison of the heart weight to tibia length ratio to compare WT saline vs WT rapamycin with an unpaired t-test (or with a Fisher’s Least Significant Difference (LSD) test following the 2-way ANOVA, p=0.0257) shows that rapamycin administration significantly reduced the heart growth in these animals (Figure 7E). We have included now the significance of this comparison in Figure 7 and in the source data for Figure 7.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Although this claim is made in the paper, the authors fail to provide evidence that p38a inhibits MKK3.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this excellent comment. To address this question, we have generated the conditional p38a KO mouse in striated muscle (p38a<sup>MCK-KO</sup>) to evaluate this important point. We found that lack of p38a results in increased activation of MKK3 and MKK6 in the heart, accompanied by higher levels of these proteins. These results are in agreement with previous studies describing that p38a can control their transcription (Ambrosino et al., 2003). Our results indicate that p38a regulates MKK3 in the heart by controlling its expression and activation. We have included these results in Figure 5 —figure supplement 2A.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. p38 can be activated by AMPK in certain contexts, and the authors have previously shown that Mkk6 deficiency can activates AMPK. What is the status of the cardiac AMPK pathway in striated and cardiac-specific Mkk6 knockout mice? If AMPK is inhibited, is there any change in p38 status?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that this is an interesting question. We have checked AMPK phosphorylation in heart from MKK6 KO mice to evaluate its activation and we did not find differences between WT and MKK6 deficient mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>). Our previous work shows that MKK6 deficiency can activate AMPK in adipose tissue by modulation of T3 response. The different outcomes in AMPK activation resulting from MKK6 deficiency between tissues is not surprising given the different involvement of the signaling in each tissue.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>AMPK phosphorylation is not altered in MKK6-deficient hearts.</title><p>Immunoblot analysis of AMPKa phosphorylation and protein levels in hearts from 9-week-old WT and <italic>Mkk6<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-75250-sa2-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7.

To be able to answer it, we have aged conditional KO mice lacking MKK6 specifically in cardyomyocytes (Mkk6<sup>aMHC-KO</sup>). We have found that deletion of MKK6 restricted to heart is enough to induce premature death (Figure 4—figure supplement 2A). However, we agree with the reviewer that we cannot discard that, in the whole-body KO animals, dysfunction of other tissues may also contribute to the death of the mice. We have addressed this issue in the discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. MKK3 data are associative. The authors should test whether MKK3 inhibition is able to attenuate p38γ/δ and mTOR activation and attenuate cardiac growth in MKK6 KO mice.

In case the authors cannot perform these experiments, similar studies should at least be performed in primary cardiomyocytes in vitro.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the excellent comment of the reviewer. To answer this question, we have now generated the double conditional mice lacking both, MKK6 and MKK3, as there are not good specific inhibitor for MKK3 protein and the whole-body double KO animals die during embryonic development due to defects in placenta formation and deficiencies in the development of embryonic vasculature (Brancho et al., 2003). We have found that indeed MKK3 deletion is able to reduced p38γ and mTOR activation and attenuate cardiac growth in muscle-specific MKK6 KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2</xref>).</p><p>We have had problems overexpressing p38a in animals lacking MKK6. The reason is that to overexpress proteins in the heart we inject offspring at P1 and MKK6 mothers are very nervous and usually kill the offspring. In addition, the animals have to be crossed in heterozygosis so that after having injected numerous pups, most of them were killed by the mothers and the expression of the virus was minimal. We have also generated lentivirus to overexpress p38a active in MKK6 KO cells. However, we found that the overexpression is toxic for the cell and in consequence the efficiency we obtained was too low to do any experiment.</p><p>In an attempt to answer the reviewer’s questions, we have decided to use the specifically KO mice in muscle for both MKK3 or p38a.</p><p>Our results suggest that hyperactivation of MKK3 in MKK6 KO cardiomyocytes is responsible for the mTOR activation and consequent cardiac hypertrophy. To try to elucidate the role of p38 in MKK3 hyperactivation as the referee asked, we generated the mice lacking p38a specifically in striated muscle. We found that lack of p38a induces the hyperactivation of MKK3 (Figure 5 —figure supplement 2). All these data suggest that the lack of p38a activation in MKK6 KO cardiomyocytes is responsible for the MKK3 hyperactivation and increased activation of p38g and p38d that induced cardiac hypertrophy.</p><fig id="sa2fig2" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>MKK3 deletion attenuates p38g and mTOR activation and cardiac hypertrophy in MKK6-deficient hearts.</title><p>(A) Heart weight to tibia length ratio in 9-week-old MCK-Cre (<italic>n</italic>=8), Mkk6<sup>MCK-KO</sup> (n=10) and Mkk3/6<sup>MCK-KO</sup> (<italic>n</italic>=10). 1-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s multiple comparison test. *<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05; ns: non-significant.

In fact, associated with the reduced phosphorylation of p38a in hearts from MKK6 KO mice, we observed an increased expression of MKK3 at the protein and RNA level in these animals. Our results indicate that in the heart the activation of p38a promotes a negative feedback mechanism to regulate the activity of the upstream kinases at the expression and phosphorylation level.

To answer it, we evaluated whether, similar to the whole-body MKK6 KO, conditional KO mice lacking MKK6 specifically in cardiomyocytes (Mkk6<sup>aMHC-KO</sup>) also showed a reduced lifespan.

We were able to evaluate DEPTOR phosphorylation in our previous work because it was a different context. In p38g/d<sup>-/-</sup> mice, there is a stabilization of the protein levels of DEPTOR due to the lack of p38g and p38d, and therefore we were able to address its phosphorylation.</p><p>References</p><p>Ambrosino C, Mace G, Galban S, Fritsch C, Vintersten K, Black E, Gorospe M, Nebreda AR. 2003.

As the reviewer points out, MKK3 deficiency in the context of MKK6 deletion in striated muscle produced a reduction in mTOR activation and attenuation of cardiac growth, but not was able to completely rescue the normal heart size. This result suggests that, apart from mTOR activation, MKK6 deficiency might affect other signaling pathways affecting cardiac hypertrophy. For example, p38γ/δ have been implicated in the regulation of the postnatal cardiac metabolism (Santamans <italic>et al.</italic>, 2021), which is another known direct cause of cardiac hypertrophy (Nakamura &amp; Sadoshima, 2018). We have discussed this in the manuscript.
