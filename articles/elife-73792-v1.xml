Several studies have indicated that ZIKV can damage the fetal brain directly; however, whether the ZIKV-induced maternal placental injury contributes to adverse fetal outcomes is sparsely defined. Here, we demonstrated that ZIKV causes the pyroptosis of placental cells by activating the executor gasdermin E (GSDME) in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, TNF-α release is induced upon the recognition of viral genomic RNA by RIG-I, followed by activation of caspase-8 and caspase-3 to ultimately escalate the GSDME cleavage. Further analyses revealed that the ablation of GSDME or treatment with TNF-α receptor antagonist in ZIKV-infected pregnant mice attenuates placental pyroptosis, which consequently confers protection against adverse fetal outcomes. In conclusion, our study unveils a novel mechanism of ZIKV-induced adverse fetal outcomes via causing placental cell pyroptosis, which provides new clues for developing therapies for ZIKV-associated diseases.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Zika virus </kwd><kwd>pyroptosis</kwd><kwd>gasdermin E</kwd><kwd>placental injury</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Viruses</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100012166</institution-id><institution>National Key Research and Development Program of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2021YFC2600200</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cao</surname><given-names>Shengbo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>32022082</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ye</surname><given-names>Jing</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31825025</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cao</surname><given-names>Shengbo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31972721</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ye</surname><given-names>Jing</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>32030107</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cao</surname><given-names>Shengbo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003819</institution-id><institution>Natural Science Foundation of Hubei Province</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2019CFA010</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cao</surname><given-names>Shengbo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Zika virus infection induces the gasdermin E-mediated pyroptosis in placental cells through TNF-α-caspase-8-caspase-3 signaling pathway, which contributes to adverse fetal outcomes in pregnant mouse model.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Zika virus (ZIKV), a mosquito-borne flavivirus, was initially identified in 1947 but received little concern until it posed a serious public health threat in the Pacific from 2007 to 2015 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Petersen et al., 2016</xref>). ZIKV exhibits obvious tropism and infects several immunologically privileged regions that include male and female reproductive organs, adult and fetal central/peripheral nervous system, urinary tract, and the structural and neural portions of the eye (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zimmerman et al., 2020</xref>). Clinically, most ZIKV cases are asymptomatic or mild with low-grade fever, rash, arthralgia, myalgia, and conjunctivitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Duffy et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Musso and Gubler, 2016</xref>). Nevertheless, the ZIKV infection of pregnant women still remains a major concern because the placental infection and the vertical transmission of the virus can cause adverse effects on the fetus, such as congenital ZIKV syndrome (CZS) which is characterized by microcephaly, intrauterine growth restriction, spontaneous abortion, and developmental abnormalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Miner et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Although several studies have explicitly indicated a causal relationship between ZIKV infection and CZS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brasil et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mlakar et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yockey et al., 2016</xref>), the underlying mechanism is not completely elucidated. On one hand, ZIKV can infect the fetus through the transplacental route, which can lead to CZS in all trimesters of pregnancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brasil et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hoen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Reynolds et al., 2017</xref>). Studies using the brain organoids, neurospheres, and human pluripotent stem cell-derived brain cells have identified that neural stem and progenitor cells can undergo growth and developmental aberrations upon ZIKV infection, thereby resulting in microcephaly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cugola et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Garcez et al., 2016</xref>). On the other hand, the ZIKV infection-caused placental injury also likely contributes to adverse fetal outcomes. Several studies have demonstrated that ZIKV infects placental macrophages and trophoblasts, which leads to placental insufficiency and injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Quicke et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Szaba et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brown et al., 2019</xref>). Using the mouse pregnancy models, it has been shown that ZIKV infection disrupts the architecture and function of the placenta by triggering trophoblast apoptosis and vascular endothelial cell damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Miner et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yockey et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ribeiro et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Yockey et al., 2018</xref>). Considering that placenta is infected prior to the fetus and that placenta is indispensable for the maternal-fetal nutrient exchange, it is reasonable to speculate that the placental damage during ZIKV infection could be more decisive for adverse fetal outcomes.</p><p>During ZIKV infection, the placenta can suffer from apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Miner et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Yockey et al., 2018</xref>), which is a prototype of programmed cell death (PCD) and is crucial for reproduction, embryonic development, immunity, and viral infections. Therefore, it is meaningful to explore whether other PCD processes, such as pyroptosis, are involved in the ZIKV-induced placental damage. Pyroptosis is an innate immune response against intracellular pathogens, and is featured by cell swelling and the emergence of large bubble-like structures from the plasma membrane that differentiate it from other PCDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jorgensen and Miao, 2015</xref>). Recent studies have identified gasdermin D (GSDMD) as a key pyroptosis executor, whose N-terminus domain is capable of binding to membrane lipids, phosphoinositides, and cardiolipin in order to perforate the membrane, resulting in the release of cytosolic content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ding et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Shi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kayagaki et al., 2015</xref>). Gasdermin E (GSDME), also known as DFNA5, belongs to the same superfamily as GSDMD, and was originally identified as a gene related to hearing impairment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Van Laer et al., 1998</xref>). GSDME is considered as a potential tumor suppressor gene in several types of cancers, such as gastric and hepatocellular carcinomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akino et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>) Recently, it has also been demonstrated to mediate pyroptosis via its activated N-terminus (GSDME-N) domain that is specifically cleaved by caspase-3 and granzyme B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rogers et al., 2017</xref>). GSDME can switch the caspase-3-mediated apoptosis to pyroptosis or can mediate secondary necrosis after apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wang et al., 2017</xref>), indicating an extensive crosstalk between apoptosis and GSDME-mediated pyroptosis.</p><p>In the context of viral infections, pyroptosis is one of the imperative pathogenic mechanisms that occur during flavivirus infections. For instance, dengue virus can induce the NLRP3 inflammasome-dependent pyroptosis in human macrophages via the C-type lectin 5A, which is critical for dengue hemorrhagic fever (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2008</xref>). Japanese encephalitis virus enhances the pyroptosis of peritoneal macrophages to raise the serum interleukin-1α level, which in turn promotes viral neuroinvasion and blood-brain-barrier disruption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wang et al., 2020</xref>). Particularly, a recent study demonstrated the effect of ZIKV in inducing the caspase-1- and GSDMD-mediated pyroptosis of neural progenitor cells that contributes to CZS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">He et al., 2020</xref>). In view of all these studies, it is worth exploring whether pyroptosis participates in the ZIKV-induced placental damage and adverse fetal outcomes.</p><p>Here, we report that ZIKV infection activates caspase-3 via the caspase-8-mediated extrinsic apoptotic pathway, which in turn activates GSDME to induce the pyroptosis of placental trophoblasts. This phenomenon was found to associate with the ZIKV genomic RNA, but not with the ZIKV structural or nonstructural (NS) proteins, upon its recognition by the RIG-I sensor. By establishing a mouse model of ZIKV infection, we further showed that the deletion of GSDME leads to the reduction of placental damage and associated adverse fetal outcomes in infected pregnant mice. This study provides novel insights into the mechanism of ZIKV-induced placental damage and CZS; therefore, it may lead to the development of new therapeutic options to avert adverse fetal outcomes and/or miscarriages during ZIKV infection.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>ZIKV infection induces the GSDME-mediated pyroptosis in JEG-3 cells</title><p>Previous studies have shown that ZIKV infection during the first trimester of pregnancy leads to a higher chance of CZS, but the pathogenesis is yet to be further studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Musso and Gubler, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jagger et al., 2017</xref>). Since the ZIKV-infected placenta shows obvious apoptosis of trophoblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Miner et al., 2016</xref>), it prompted us to hypothesize whether other routes of cell death are triggered in response to ZIKV infection. To this end, we chose a ZIKV-permissive human choriocarcinoma cell line JEG-3, which represents the features of trophoblasts and is considered a suitable in vitro model to study the first-trimester placental function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zachariades et al., 2011</xref>). Upon ZIKV infection, JEG-3 cells showed evident cell swelling with balloon-like structures originating from the plasma membrane that appears to be distinct from the apoptotic blebbing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), displaying a characteristic pyroptotic cell morphology. Along with decreased cell viability, the swelling cells were also found to release lactate dehydrogenase (LDH, an indicator of the lytic cell cytotoxicity) in an infection time-dependent manner, which depicts the rupture and leakage of the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). We next determined whether the pyroptosis executors, GSDMD and GSDME, were activated during the infection of JEG-3 cells with ZIKV. To this end, the infected cells were subjected to Western blot analysis, and the results revealed that infection led to the release of the N-terminal domain of GSDME (GSDME-N), whereas no cleavage of GSDMD was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), implying that ZIKV infection may induce pyroptosis through GSDME.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Zika virus (ZIKV) infection induces the gasdermin E (GSDME)-mediated pyroptosis in JEG-3 cells.</title><p>JEG-3 or GSDME-KO JEG-3 cells were infected with ZIKV at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1.

During apoptosis, caspase-3 can be activated by intrinsic and/or extrinsic pathways: the former refers to the permeabilization of the mitochondrial membrane and the assembly of apoptosome resulting in the activation of caspase-9, and the latter involves the activation of death receptors and caspase-8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Man and Kanneganti, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nagata, 2018</xref>). It has been previously demonstrated that the GSDME-dependent pyroptosis undergoes activation downstream of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway and can potentially be activated downstream of the extrinsic apoptosis pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ribeiro et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Yu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lu et al., 2018</xref>). However, the engagement of intrinsic and/or extrinsic pathways to regulate the GSDME-dependent pyroptosis during ZIKV infection remains to be studied. To delineate the molecular mechanism by which cellular pyroptosis was instigated under ZIKV infection, we detected the activation of caspase-8 and caspase-9 in infected JEG-3 cells by the Western blot analysis. As expected, ZIKV infection triggered the activation of both caspase-8 and caspase-9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>), revealing the fact that various biological processes are triggered during ZIKV infection. Next, the ZIKV-infected cells were incubated with caspase-8 inhibitor (Z-IETD-FMK) or caspase-9 inhibitor (Z-LEHD-FMK), and subsequently were subjected to the analysis of pyroptotic cell parameters. It was found that caspase-8 inhibitor remarkably inhibited the cell membrane rupture, LDH release, and GSDME cleavage in infected cells, while inhibition of caspase-9 only slightly inhibited ZIKV-induced activation of GSDME and did not significantly affect ZIKV-induced lytic cell death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D-F</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>), suggesting caspase-8 rather than caspase-9 may play a major role in the activation of caspase-3 and GSDME during ZIKV infection in JEG-3 cells.</p><p>To further confirm our findings, caspase-1, caspase-3, and caspase-8 KO JEG-3 cell lines were generated individually, followed by infection with ZIKV. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G and H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1E</xref>, the deletion of caspase-3 completely abolished the ZIKV-induced GSDME-dependent pyroptosis, while the deletion of caspase-1 did not affect the ZIKV-induced activation of GSDME and LDH release. As expected, the KO of caspase-8 significantly inhibited ZIKV-induced pyroptosis and caspase-3 activation. These findings further verified that ZIKV induces pyroptosis by activating the caspase-8-caspase-3-GSDME axis.</p><p>Given that TNF-α is crucial for activating death receptor signaling and its downstream caspase-8, it is interesting to investigate whether TNF-α is involved in ZIKV-induced pyroptosis in JEG-3 cells. To this end, the production of TNF-α in ZIKV-infected or mock-infected JEG-3 cells was determined, which showed that ZIKV infection significantly promoted the production of TNF-α (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I and J</xref>). Then, ZIKV-infected JEG-3 cells were treated with TNF-α receptor antagonist (R-7050) and the GSDME-mediated pyroptosis was examined. The results showed that blockade of the TNF-α signaling pathway significantly inhibited the ZIKV-induced LDH release and the activation of caspase-8 and GSDME (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3K and L</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1F</xref>), suggesting that the induction of TNF-α expression contributes to ZIKV-induced pyroptosis.

Therefore, whether RIG-I, TLR7, or TLR8 contributes to the onset of this was evaluated. The RIG-I-knockdown (KD), TLR7-KD, or TLR8-KD JEG-3 cell lines were generated using the CRISPR/Cas9 system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A</xref>). ZIKV infection of engineered or wild-type (WT) cells revealed that the KD of RIG-I, but not TLR7 and TLR8, conspicuously attenuated the ZIKV-induced pyroptotic cell death and GSDME cleavage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D-F</xref>), suggesting that RIG-I may play a major role in ZIKV-induced pyroptosis. To further verify the contribution of RIG-I in ZIKV-induced pyroptosis, RIG-I, MDA5, or MAVS KO JEG-3 cells were generated. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G and H</xref>, the deletion of RIG-I significantly inhibited the LDH release and the activation of GSDME, as well as its upstream caspase-3 and caspase-8 during ZIKV infection, while the KO of MDA5 or MAVS only slightly suppressed this process. Similarly, we also found that the deletion of RIG-I suppressed the lytic cell death and the activation of GSDME caused by ZIKV 5’ UTR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I and J</xref>). These results manifest that the ZIKV genome acts as a pivotal factor in inducing pyroptosis through the RIG-I pathway, and raising the possibility that GSDME-dependent pyroptosis can be launched as long as RIG-I is activated. In order to test this hypothesis, JEG-3 cells were transfected with poly(I:C) (RIG-I agonist) or human RIG-IN (the activation form of RIG-I) construct, and it was found that both poly(I:C) and RIG-IN could activate the lytic cell death and the cleavage of GSDME (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2B and C</xref>), indicating that the activation of RIG-I is sufficient to induce GSDME-dependent pyroptosis.</p><p>Given the important role of RIG-I in mediating type I interferon (IFN-I) signaling, we then investigated whether IFN-I signaling contributed to the ZIKV-induced activation of GSDME. JEG-3 cells were treated with a polyclonal antibody against IFNAR1 to block IFN-I signaling, followed by transfection with ZIKV 5’ UTR. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2D and E</xref>, blocking IFN-I signaling did not affect the 5’ UTR-induced GSDME activation, suggesting that IFN-I response may not be necessary for the activation of ZIKV-induced pyroptosis. To determine whether RIG-I mediated pyroptosis during ZIKV infection is mediated by TNF-α signaling, the production of TNF-α in ZIKV-infected RIG-I KO cells was determined. The results showed that the deletion of RIG-I prominently inhibited the ZIKV-induced production of TNF-α (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4K and L</xref>), suggesting that RIG-I signaling could promote the production of TNF-α in ZIKV-infected cells. Taken together, our findings demonstrated that RIG-I-mediated recognition of the ZIKV genome could lead to pyroptosis of JEG-3 cells through activating TNF-α expression and caspase-8-caspase-3 signaling.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>ZIKV infection of pregnant immunocompetent C57BL/6N mice results in GSDME-mediated placental pyroptosis and CZS</title><p>To further verify the role of GSDME on ZIKV-induced placental damage and adverse fetal outcomes in vivo, a pregnant mouse model was employed. Before the in vivo experiments, mouse primary trophoblast cells (MTCs) from C57BL/6N mice at embryonic day 9.5 (E9.5) of pregnancy were isolated and cultured to investigate whether ZIKV infection could also induce the GSDME-mediated pyroptosis in mouse trophoblast cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B and C</xref>, ZIKV infection significantly promoted the LDH release and the GSDME cleavage in MTCs. Consistent with our previous observations in JEG-3 cells, the upregulation of RIG-I caused by ZIKV infection was also seen in MTC, and inhibition of either caspase-3 or caspase-8 prominently blocked ZIKV-induced activation of GSDME (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>). These findings suggest that ZIKV activates pyroptosis through the same pathway in MTCs as that in JEG-3 cells.</p><p>Subsequently, WT or <italic>Gsdme<sup>-/-</sup></italic> female mice were mated with male mice of their respective genotypes. Then, the pregnant mice were infected intravenously with 1×10<sup>6</sup> PFU of ZIKV H/PF/2013 strain or with an equal volume of Vero cell culture supernatant at E9.5 of pregnancy. The mice were sacrificed at E16.5 and the morphological appearance of placentas and individual fetuses was observed (scheme outlined in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Notably, although no clinical signs of disease and weight loss were observed in both ZIKV-infected WT and <italic>Gsdme<sup>-/-</sup></italic> dams (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A</xref>), most of the WT dams infected with ZIKV showed abnormal pregnancies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2B</xref>, left panel), and their fetuses showed a variable degree of CZS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, left panel). Among all 14 ZIKV-infected WT dams, only 2 dams displayed normal pregnancies. The remaining 12 dams exhibited abnormal pregnancies, with 4 dams containing only placental residues and embryonic debris as all fetuses had undergone resorption. Other 8 infected dams carried at least one or more placental residues and morphologically abnormal fetuses. Out of 109 implantation sites carried by all 14 infected dams, 67 (61%) sites were affected, among which 52 showed fetal resorptions and 15 showed growth restriction and malformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2C</xref>, left panel). These data indicate that ZIKV infection indeed leads to CZS in our experimental model. Although ZIKV-infected <italic>Gsdme<sup>-/-</sup></italic> dams also showed a certain degree of abnormal pregnancies, the number and severity of affected dams and fetuses were markedly decreased compared to the WT dams (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B, C</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2B–2C</xref>, right panel).

While in placentas of ZIKV-infected WT dams, obvious abnormal morphological changes, including hyperplasia, necrosis, and thrombi, were observed. Specifically, the hyperplastic trophoblast labyrinth showed denser cellularity and less vascular spaces, suggesting that the placental and embryonic blood circulation may have been compromised. Otherwise, abnormal spheroid structures were found in the junctional and labyrinth zone, which contained necrotic trophoblast cells, and thrombi were observed in the labyrinth zone. However, these pathological changes were not observed in the placentas from ZIKV-infected <italic>Gsdme<sup>-/-</sup></italic> dams (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>), suggesting that GSDME is essential to ZIKV-induced placenta pathology.</p><p>To further verify the role of GSDME on placental cell pyroptosis in ZIKV-infected mice, a propidium iodide (PI) staining assay was conducted in consideration of the fact that pyroptotic cells are permeable to small molecular weight, membrane-impermeable dyes such as 7-aminoactinomycin D, ethidium bromide, and PI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jorgensen and Miao, 2015</xref>).

ZIKV NS5 and NS1 proteins, by interacting with NLRP3 and by stabilizing caspase-1, respectively, promote the NLRP3 inflammasome assembly/activation to augment the IL-1β secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zheng et al., 2018</xref>). Since the NLRP3 inflammasome functions upstream of pyroptosis executor GSDMD and IL-1β is passively released during cell lysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jorgensen and Miao, 2015</xref>), it can be assumed that pyroptosis may confer ZIKV pathogenesis. Interestingly, our data revealed a previously unrecognized mechanism of ZIKV-induced fetal adverse outcomes, which is indirectly caused by GSDME-mediated pyroptosis. Unlike the GSDMD-mediated pyroptosis driven by caspase-1 and caspase-4/5/11, we found that GSDME undergoes activation by caspase-8 and caspase-3, which is partially consistent with published studies, wherein GSDME was subjected to be cleaved and activated by caspase-3 and granzyme B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Shi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kayagaki et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lu et al., 2018</xref>). Recently, several studies have shown that GSDME-dependent pyroptosis is involved in the pathogenesis of viruses. For instance, the H7N9 influenza virus triggers GSDME-mediated pyroptosis in mouse alveolar epithelial cells, which in turn leads to a cytokine storm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wan et al., 2022</xref>). GSDME is important for the pathogenesis of enterovirus 71 via mediating the initiation of pyroptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dong et al., 2022</xref>). Also, there is evidence that GSDME-dependent pyroptosis is associated with the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2, as data has shown that the occurrence of pyroptosis in syncytia formed by fusion of SARS-CoV-2 spike and ACE2-expressing cells, which is initiated by the intrinsic apoptosis pathway and is executed by the caspase-3/7-mediated activation of GSDME (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ma et al., 2021</xref>). In addition to its role in viral pathogenesis, a study has also shown the indirect antiviral effect of GSDME. Precisely, the virus-mediated inactivation of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members promotes caspase-3-dependent activation of GSDME in barrier epithelial cells, which restricts the virus replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Orzalli et al., 2021</xref>). However, in our study, GSDME KO showed no effect on ZIKV replication both in vitro and in vivo, which excludes the possibility that the attenuated placental damage in ZIKV-infected GSDME KO mice is caused by the inhibited viral replication.</p><p>In our study, pyroptosis was not found as a universal phenomenon upon ZIKV infection, even though ZIKV can infect multiple cell lines. For instance, ZIKV-infected HeLa, HEK293T, and SH-SY5Y cells exhibited no apparent pyroptotic morphological changes, albeit some of them express GSDME in abundance. By evaluating the susceptibility of low GSDME-expressing HEK-293T and Huh-7 cells to ZIKV infection, we found that the infection susceptibility is an additional decisive factor, as Huh-7 cells, which are highly susceptible to ZIKV, were prone to pyroptosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A-C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). These findings not only highlight the important role of GSDME in the pathogenesis of ZIKV, but also raise the question of whether other ZIKV-induced symptoms are associated with GSDME-mediated pyroptosis, which could be alluring to investigate in future studies.</p><p>Recent advances in understanding the key role of caspase-3 in mediating the GSDME-dependent pyroptosis have changed the long stand notion that the activation of caspase-3 is the hallmark of apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wang et al., 2017</xref>). Through chemical inhibition and genetic KO, caspase-3 was identified to mediate the ZIKV-induced activation of GSDME, and further studies revealed that ZIKV activates caspase-3-GSDME-dependent pyroptosis through a caspase-8-dependent extrinsic apoptotic pathway. This conclusion is also supported by the observation that the blocking of TNF-α signaling inhibited ZIKV-induced pyroptosis in vitro and in vivo, as TNF-α has been known as a vital ligand to commence the caspase-8-mediated signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tummers and Green, 2017</xref>). It is worth noting that caspase-3 can not only launch pyroptosis by activating GSDME but can also specifically block pyroptosis by cleaving GSDMD at a distinct site from the inflammatory caspases, although the conditions required for this process remain to be further explored (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Taabazuing et al., 2017</xref>). In this study, the cleaved GSDMD-N was not detected in ZIKV-infected JEG-3 cells, which may be due to the different cell types used in our study. But in any case, the bidirectional crosstalk between apoptosis and pyroptosis is an issue that must be paid attention to in follow-up studies. Caspase-8 is a multifunctional effector protein related to various signaling pathways and acts as a molecular switch for apoptosis, necrosis, and pyroptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fritsch et al., 2019</xref>). In the case of pyroptosis, caspase-8 is capable of inducing the GSDMD- and GSDME-mediated pyroptosis in murine macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Orning et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sarhan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zeng et al., 2019</xref>). However, our data showed that GSDMD was not activated by caspase-8 in ZIKV-infected JEG-3 cells, inferring the possibility that some specific factors are required for inducing the GSDMD-mediated pyroptosis. In addition, caspase-8 inhibits necrosis regulated by receptor-interacting serine/threonine kinase 3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tummers and Green, 2017</xref>), which fortifies our conclusion that necrosis did not occur in ZIKV-infected JEG-3 cells. Surprisingly, in this study, caspase-8 inhibitor treatment also reduced the activation of caspase-9, and the caspase-9 inhibitor treatment slightly inhibited the activation of GSDME without any impact on the ZIKV-induced pyroptotic cell death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D-F</xref>). Recent studies demonstrate that the GSDME-N can permeabilize the mitochondrial membrane and activate the intrinsic apoptotic pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rogers et al., 2019</xref>), which implies the possibility that during ZIKV infection, the caspase-8-mediated activation of GSDME consequently induces the caspase-9-associated intrinsic apoptosis by targeting mitochondrial, thereby creating a self-amplifying feed-forward loop through consecutively activating caspase-3. Despite elusive mechanistic underpinnings, these data suggest that the extrinsic apoptotic pathway plays a key role in ZIKV-induced pyroptosis, and the potential crosstalk between pyroptosis and apoptosis during the ZIKV infection needs to be further explored.</p><p>During the viral infection of host cells, PRRs are vital for detecting the viral genomes and limiting the spread of viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brennan and Bowie, 2010</xref>). Based on our findings that the ZIKV RNA genome, rather than the ZIKV-encoded proteins, spurs pyroptosis, we asked if PPRs, including TLR7, TLR8, and RIG-I, which are well-known sensors of single-strand RNA, were involved in the occurrence of this cell death process. Using the CRISPR-Cas9-engineered KO JEG-3 cells, we observed the necessity of RIG-I to induce the GSDME-mediated pyroptosis via recognizing the ZIKV RNA genome, with a piece of further evidence that the ZIKV 5’ UTR was unable to launch the pyroptosis in RIG-I KO cells. These data are in concordance with a recent study which demonstrated that RIG-I recognizes the ZIKV 5’ UTR in human cells and the enrichment of viral.</p><p>RNA on RIG-I decreases along with the genome toward the 3’ UTR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chazal et al., 2018</xref>), hence proposing a possibility that the activation of RIG-I determines the outcome of pyroptosis. This conclusion was subsequently confirmed by the finding that the cleavage of GSDME in JEG-3 cells could be activated by transfecting cells with human RIG-IN or RIG-I agonist poly(I:C). Interestingly, we found that KO of MAVS, a downstream molecule of RIG-I, only slightly reduced the cleavage of GSDME, which indicates the possibility that ZIKV infection leads to the placental pyroptosis via the non-canonical RIG-I pathway. Moreover, our results showed that the IFN signaling pathway is not essential for ZIKV-induced pyroptosis, which highlights the role of TNF-α in this process.</p><p>Since it has been well proven that murine IFN-I response restrains ZIKV infection, immunocompromised mice or WT mice treated with IFNAR1 antibodies were employed to establish animal models of ZIKV infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Miner et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Szaba et al., 2018</xref>). However, considering the fact that utilizing immunocompromised mice may prevent us from objectively assessing the potential impact of host innate immune responses on the pathogenesis of ZIKV and that the IFN signaling was found to play a vital role in mediating fetal demise after ZIKV infection by causing abnormal placental development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Yockey et al., 2018</xref>), the pregnant immunocompetent mouse model was employed in this study. This model has been successfully established in several studies, in which pregnant immunocompetent mice were infected with ZIKV by vaginal exposure or uterine infection, etc., and a definite association between adverse fetal outcomes and ZIKV infection in placenta and embryo was observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yockey et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Vermillion et al., 2017</xref>). But considering the fact that these studies were done by exposing the placental-fetal interface to ZIKV and creating high viral loads in the vicinity of the placenta, which may not occur in the natural state of ZIKV infection. Therefore, in our study, the pregnant immunocompetent mice were infected with 1×10<sup>6</sup> PFU of ZIKV by tail vein injection, which is not lethal in WT and <italic>Gsdme<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice. Considering that ZIKV cannot replicate efficiently in immunocompetent mice, the dose we used here is much higher compared to other models using immunocompromised mice, but it is estimated to be within the range of the total amount of ZIKV that can be delivered by mosquito feeding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Styer et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cox et al., 2012</xref>). In our in vivo model, no clinical signs of disease and weight loss were observed in both ZIKV-infected WT and <italic>Gsdme<sup>-/-</sup></italic> dams. This is consistent with the results of previous studies which revealed that ZIKV infection could not lead to any clinical symptoms in immunocompetent pregnant mice except placental damage and adverse fetal outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Szaba et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barbeito-Andrés et al., 2020</xref>). This observation excludes the possibility that the effects of GSDME KO on the fetus is due to decreased pyroptosis in other tissues in the dams, but the use of conditionally deficient mice would make the conclusion more convincing.</p><p>Although the current data do support the notion that GSDME is involved in ZIKV pathogenesis, our study still exhibits some limitations. First, there is a dearth of effective antibodies to detect the cleavage of GSDME in vivo. Although we used the <italic>Gsdme<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice model to indirectly substantiate that the GSDME ablation significantly inhibited the ZIKV-induced adverse fetal outcomes and demonstrated that ZIKV could activate GSDME in mouse trophoblast primary cells, the direct evidence for ZIKV-induced activation of placental GSDME in vivo yet needs to be assessed. Moreover, the observed CZS in our study is whether contributed by the maternal and fetal GSDME remains unclear. Given that a study, which also employed the intravenously infected immunocompetent mice, as objects have shown that the placental pathology rather than the embryonic/fetal viral infection could be a stronger contributor to adverse pregnancy outcomes in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Szaba et al., 2018</xref>), we speculate that GSDME in the maternal placenta may play a more crucial role in this process. This speculation is indirectly supported by another recent study, which employed subcutaneously infected 3-day-old mouse pups as an experimental model and has demonstrated that the inhibition of caspase-3 did not affect ZIKV-induced neuropathology and brain atrophy in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">He et al., 2020</xref>). This finding implies the possibility that caspase-3- and GSDME-dependent pyroptosis is not involved in fetal brain damage due to direct ZIKV infection of the mouse brain. Ultimately discerning the maternal versus fetal contributions of GSDME would be beneficial by crossing the <italic>Gsdme</italic><sup>+/-</sup> and <italic>Gsdme<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice and by comparing pathology in +/- and -/- littermates. However, considering that the placenta is formed by the joint participation of the mother and the embryo, it is a challenge to accurately answer this question in vivo.</p><p>It is worth noting that regardless of whether placental lesions and fetal resorption occurred or not, the ZIKV RNA was infrequently detected, which suggests that placental function may be affected under a negligible quantity of viral particles or the virus had been eliminated at this stage. As the placenta acts as a crucial tissue between the gravida and embryo, preventing pathogen transmission during pregnancy and mediating the exchange of nutrients imply that any inappreciable placental damage can lead to devastating consequences. In addition, the ZIKV-infected <italic>Gsdme-/-</italic> dams still showed a certain degree of CZS, albeit the proportion of affected embryos carried by them was strikingly lower than the WT dams, highlighting that the GSDME is not the only decisive factor to regulate the ZIKV-induced pyroptosis.</p><p>Our findings in understanding the key role of TNF-α in the pathogenesis of ZIKV prompted us to explore new therapeutic strategies against ZIKV. R-7050 is a cell-permeable triazoloquinoxaline inhibitor of the TNF-α receptor complex, which has been shown to exert a therapeutic effect in multiple murine disease models, including kidney fibrosis, intracerebral hemorrhage, and ischemic stroke (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">King et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lin et al., 2021</xref>). Also, it has been revealed that the R-7050 treatment inhibits the activation of caspase-8 and caspase-3 by blocking the TNF-α signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pal et al., 2021</xref>). Our data revealed that the R-7050 treatment effectively alleviates ZIKV-induced placental damage and adverse fetal outcomes in the pregnant mouse model. Although the clinical safety and effectiveness of R-7050 need to be further tested, our study provides a potential new therapeutic strategy to overcome CZS due to ZIKV infection.</p><p>In summary, our study identified a novel mechanism of ZIKV-caused placental damage and CZS. We demonstrated that ZIKV infection could induce placental pyroptosis through the recognition of the viral genome by RIG-I followed by TNF-α release, which activates the caspase-8- and caspase-3-mediated cleavage of pyroptosis executor GSDME in placental cells. Furthermore, the ablation of GSDME or the treatment of TNF-α receptor inhibitor in infected pregnant mice attenuated placental pyroptosis and adverse fetal outcomes. These findings may provide opportunities to establish therapies that might halt placental damage and subsequent adverse fetal outcomes during ZIKV infection.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Reagents and antibodies</title><p>Mouse monoclonal anti-ZIKV NS5 antibody was generated in our lab.

Two reviewers mentioned that the pathway analysis on the role of caspases is a particularly weak part of this study. Genetic analysis of (at a minimum) casp3, casp8 and casp1 (as control) should be performed using the CRISPR KO approach used in Figure 1 for GSDME. The chemical inhibitor data present on casp3 and casp8 in Figure 3 is not sufficient and confusing.

An exciting part of the study is the interesting but surprising claim that the ZIKV genome UTRs are sufficient to induce GSDME pyroptosis in a RIG-I dependent manner. To my knowledge, no such pathway has been described. Hence, a few additional experiments to shore up that observation are merited. For example, one prediction is that other RIG-I agonists should similarly induce pyroptosis. Moreover, RIG-I, MDA5, and MAVS knockouts would allow for clear, genetic determination of whether or not the pathway in question operates similarly to known RIG-I signaling. This was mentioned by two reviewers and should be addresses with new experiments.</p><p>3. Essential details on the mouse studies are lacking especially because more conventional models are in the IFNAR KO background. Given that the authors describe pyroptosis in other cell types, it seems possible that the effects of GSDME knockout on the fetus could be indirect and due to decreased pyroptosis in elsewhere in the dams. How did GSDME knockout alter the clinical signs of disease (weight loss, histopathology) in the dams? It would be helpful if the authors contextualized their model relative to those previously published. There was also a concern that the mechanistic studies were performed in one cancer cell line (JEG3 and that the upstream pathway is not addressed at all in the in vivo model (e.g., experiments using Casp3 or RigI KOs)). Another significant issue with the in vivo work is that the mating scheme does not allow us to discern the maternal vs. fetal contributions of GSDME. Although ideally this should be addressed with new experiments, we realize that this could cause unnecessarily delay of publication.

The authors are strongly encouraged to consider a recent study (PMID: 33979579), which established GSDME as a regulator of virus-induced pyroptosis (as opposed to a role in cancer). That study showed that mitochondrial disruption during viral infection activates casp3 to cleave GSDME and promote cell death. The authors of this current study also see a role for casp3. Casp8 was not involved. Based on the weak evidence for a role of TNF and casp8 in GSDME cleavage induced by Zika, the authors are encouraged to consider alternative models.</p><p>5. The role of RIG-I in this process should be considered in the context of the fact that RIG-I can promote the activation of PKR, which shuts down translation (PMID: 25891073).

To show the chemical inhibitor data more clearly, a grayscale analysis of the Western blot results was performed. As shown in Figure 3—figure supplement 1B and 1D, compared to untreated and caspase9 inhibitor-treated cells, caspase8 inhibitor-treated cells showed significant suppression of GSDME cleavage. Moreover, we constructed caspase1, caspase3, and caspase8 knock-out (KO) JEG-3 cell lines individually according to the reviewers’ suggestion. As shown in Figure 3G and 3H, caspase1 KO did not affect the ZIKV-induced LDH release and activation of GSDME, while the deletion of caspase3 completely abolished the ZIKV-induced GSDME-dependent pyroptosis. Although ZIKV-infected caspase8 KO cells still showed a certain degree of pyroptosis, this process was significantly inhibited compared to ZIKV-infected wild-type cells. Taken together, these results demonstrated the important roles of caspase3 and caspase8 in ZIKV-induced pyroptosis, and further confirmed that the caspase1-GSDMD signaling pathway is not involved in ZIKV-induced pyroptosis in JEG-3 cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

Our study did describe for the first time that ZIKV genome UTRs are sufficient to induce GSDME pyroptosis in a RIG-I-dependent manner. To make this conclusion more reliable, some additional experiments were carried out according to the reviewers’ suggestion. Firstly, the expression of RIG-I in ZIKV-infected and uninfected cells were detected by Western blot.

Since it is too difficult to generate <italic>Ifnar<sup>-/-</sup>Gsdme<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice, we can only choose to conduct in vivo experiments by using immunocompetent mice rather than IFNAR KO mice. The pregnancy models of ZIKV infection in immunocompetent mice have been well-established in the previous studies (Szaba et al., 2018), and the <italic>Gsdme<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice used in our study were kindly provided by Dr. F Shao whose study has demonstrated that deletion of GSDME doesn’t affect the development and immune system of mice (Wang et al., 2017). In our in vivo model, no clinical signs of disease and weight loss were observed in both ZIKV-infected WT and <italic>Gsdme<sup>-/</sup></italic><sup>-</sup> dams. This is consistent with the results of previous studies which revealed that ZIKV-infection did not lead to any clinical symptoms in immunocompetent pregnant mice except placental damage and adverse fetal outcomes (Szaba et al., 2018; Barbeito-Andres et al., 2020). Our data showing extremely low viral loads in spleens, serum and brains of infected dams and no difference of viral titers in tissues between WT and <italic>Gsdme<sup>-/-</sup></italic> dams (Figure 5G) also support that GSDME knockout did not alter the clinical signs of disease. The figure showing the weight change of dams (Figure 5—figure supplement 2A) and relative discussion were added in the revised manuscript. In addition, the majority of affected embryos underwent resorption, leaving only the placental residues and embryonic debris, so it’s hard to evaluate the function of GSDME by histopathological methods in embryos. In the remaining embryo samples, no obvious clinical signs were found in both WT embryos and <italic>Gsdme<sup>-/-</sup></italic> embryos.</p><p>We also realized that our current in vivo data could not distinguish the function of GSDME on the placental side and fetal side. In fact, we crossed <italic>Gsdme</italic><sup>+/-</sup> and <italic>Gsdme</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice and hoped to address this question by comparing pathology in +/- to -/- littermates. However, the pregnancy and litter rates were too low, even though we spent a lot of time and tried many times, we still could not get enough data to draw conclusions, so we added discussion of the limitations of our in vivo experiments in revised manuscript (Line 467-486).</p><p>Considering RIG-I-deficiency has been shown to affect the replication of flaviviruses due to its important role in innate immunity (Guo et al., 2018), we decided not to evaluate the function of GSDME in RIG-I KO mice. In addition, we could not obtain enough <italic>Caspase</italic>3<sup>-/-</sup> mice in such a short time to conduct experiments. Therefore, to address the mechanism in the in vivo model, the role of TNF-α, which is known as the upstream regulator of caspase8 and was shown to be significantly upregulated in ZIKV-infected JEG-3 cells and mouse placentas, in ZIKV-induced placental pyroptosis was determined. To this end, we found that RIG-KO significantly reduced the expression of TNF-α induced by ZIKV infection (Figure 4K and 4L); blocking the TNF-α signaling by using R-7050 (a TNF-α receptor antagonist) restrained the activation of caspase8 and GSDME in ZIKV-infected JEG-3 cells (Figure 3K and 3L). Further in vivo experiments demonstrated that blocking the TNF-α signaling alleviated placental damage and inhibited abnormal pregnancy and adverse fetal outcomes caused by ZIKV infection (Figure 6). These findings suggest that ZIKV mediates the activation of caspase8 by promoting the expression of TNF-α through the RIG-I pathway, which eventually leads to the pyroptosis of placenta.</p><p>According to the reviewers’ suggestion, mouse primary trophoblast cells (MTC) were isolated followed by infection of ZIKV. As shown in Figure 5—figure supplement 1, ZIKV infection significantly upregulated the activation of GSDME and release of LDH in MTC, while inhibition of either caspase3 or caspase8 could markedly suppress this process.

We did not examine whether the expression of TNF-α would be significantly altered by ZIKV infection in other cells, since we wanted to focus our study on placenta or placenta-derived cells. Actually, we measured the expression of many inflammatory cytokines, including IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α, and only the expression of TNF-α was significantly upregulated in ZIKV-infected JEG-3 cells. Similar results were also found in ZIKV-infected mouse placentas (Figure 3I, 3J, 6A, and 6B). To further verify the role of TNF-α, a TNF-α receptor antagonist, R-7050, was used. We found that blocking the TNF-α signaling pathway by R-7050 treatment can significantly inhibit the activation of caspase8 as well as its downstream caspase3 and GSDME (Figure 3K and 3L), indicating that the upregulated expression of TNF-α caused by ZIKV infection is critical for the activation of GSDME. In addition, as suggested by the reviewer, the production of TNF-α in cell culture and placenta tissue was determined by ELISA. In consistent with RT-qPCR results, ZIKV infection increased the protein concentration of TNF-α in the supernatant of JEG-3 cells (Figure 3I and 3J) and mouse placenta (Figure 6A and 6B), while RIG-I KO restored the release of TNF-α induced by ZIKV infection (Figure 4K and 4L).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4.

The former refers to the permeabilization of the mitochondrial membrane and the assembly of apoptosome resulting in the activation of caspase-9, and the latter involves the activation of death receptors and caspase-8. By using the chemical inhibitors, we found that caspase8, but not caspase9, played a major role in regulating pyroptosis (Figure 3E, 3F, and Figure 3—figure supplement 1B). Moreover, our data showed that inhibiting the TNF-α signaling pathway by TNF-α receptor antagonist or caspase8 KO could significantly inhibit ZIKV-induced pyroptosis, which further affirmed the important role of TNF-α and caspase8 in ZIKV-induced pyroptosis (Figure 3G, 3H, 3K, and 3L). Therefore, we believe that our current data are sufficient to support the viewpoint that caspase8 plays a major role in ZIKV-induced pyroptosis. We also agree that the report (PMID: 33979579) is highly informative to us, so we have added a discussion about this article and issues related to virus-induced mitochondrial disruption in the revised manuscript (Line 378 to 381, and 415 to 425).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5.

However, I would be satisfied if the same pathway was rigorously defined in a mouse trophoblast cell line or primary cells using knockouts or inhibitors.</p></disp-quote><p>To verify whether ZIKV could induce pyroptosis via the same pathway in mouse cells as that in human cells, mouse primary trophoblast cells (MTC) were isolated followed by infection of ZIKV. It was found that ZIKV infection induced the activation of GSDME and the release of LDH in MTC, while inhibition of either caspase3 or caspase8 could markedly suppress this process (Figure 5—figure supplement 1), suggesting the same pathway contributing to ZIKV-induced pyroposis in mouse primary trophoblast cells.</p><p>For in vivo assay, given the fact that RIG-I plays a crucial role in the innate immune response against flaviviruses, and thus regulate the viral replication (Guo et al., 2018), RIG-I-deficient is likely to affect the replication of ZIKV in mice, which may contribute to the pathological signs of ZIKV infection, so this model may be not suitable for evaluating the function of GSDME in ZIKV-infected cells. Therefore, to address the mechanism in the in vivo model, the role of TNF-α which is known as the upstream regulator of caspase8 was assessed both in vitro and in vivo. Here, we found that RIG KO significantly reduced the expression of TNF-α induced by ZIKV infection (Figure 4K and 4L); blocking TNF-α signaling by using R-7050 (a TNF-α receptor antagonist) restrained the activation of caspase8 and GSDME in ZIKV-infected JEG-3 cells (Figure 3K and 3L). Further in vivo experiments demonstrated that blocking the TNF-α signaling alleviated placental damage and inhibited adverse fetal outcomes caused by ZIKV infection (Figure 6). These findings suggest that ZIKV mediates the activation of caspase8 by promoting the expression of TNF-α through the RIG-I pathway, which eventually leads to the pyroptosis of placenta.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Given the results in Figure 4, could RIG-I expression in the cell lines in Figure 2 explain differences in pyroptosis?</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the constructive suggestion. In the current study, we cannot simply determine the contribution of RIG-I expression in pyroptosis during ZIKV infection, and it is possible that a small amount of RIG-I may also play an important role in pathogen recognition. Therefore, we prefer to believe that the different levels of pyroptosis in Figure 2 are caused by the difference in the abundance of GSDME, as studies have fully demonstrated that the abundance of GSDME determines cell death pattern upon stimulation (Wang et al., 2017).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Weight measurements of fetuses would be preferable to the &quot;affected&quot; scoring system in Figure 5C and 6B (which is not described).</p></disp-quote><p>According to the suggestion, we have included data of fetal weight in Supplementary Figures (Figure 5—figure supplement 2C and Figure 6—figure supplement 1) in the revised manuscript.</p><p>References</p><p>(1) Barbeito-Andres J; Pezzuto P; Higa L M; Dias A A; Vasconcelos J M; Santos T M P; Ferreira J; Ferreira R O; Dutra F F; Rossi A D; Barbosa R V; Amorim C K N; De Souza M P C; Chimelli L; Aguiar R S; Gonzalez P N; Lara F A; Castro M C; Molnar Z; Lopes R T et al.; Congenital Zika syndrome is associated with maternal protein malnutrition, <italic>Sci Adv</italic>, 2020, 6(2): eaaw6284</p><p>(2) Cox J; Mota J; Sukupolvi-Petty S; Diamond M S; Rico-Hesse R; Mosquito bite delivery of dengue virus enhances immunogenicity and pathogenesis in humanized mice, <italic>J Virol</italic>, 2012, 86(14): 7637-7649</p><p>(3) Guo H Y; Zhang X C; Jia R Y; Toll-Like Receptors and RIG-I-Like Receptors Play Important Roles in Resisting Flavivirus, <italic>J Immunol Res</italic>, 2018, 2018: 6106582</p><p>(4) Rogers C; Fernandes-Alnemri T; Mayes L; Alnemri D; Cingolani G; Alnemri E S; Cleavage of DFNA5 by caspase-3 during apoptosis mediates progression to secondary necrotic/pyroptotic cell death, <italic>Nat Commun</italic>, 2017, 8: 14128</p><p>(5) Styer L M; Kent K A; Albright R G; Bennett C J; Kramer L D; Bernard K A; Mosquitoes inoculate high doses of West Nile virus as they probe and feed on live hosts, <italic>PLoS Pathog</italic>, 2007, 3(9): 1262-1270</p><p>(6) Szaba F M; Tighe M; Kummer L W; Lanzer K G; Ward J M; Lanthier P; Kim I J; Kuki A; Blackman M A; Thomas S J; Lin J S; Zika virus infection in immunocompetent pregnant mice causes fetal damage and placental pathology in the absence of fetal infection, <italic>PLoS Pathog</italic>, 2018, 14(4): e1006994</p><p>(7) Wang Y; Gao W; Shi X; Ding J; Liu W; He H; Wang K; Shao F; Chemotherapy drugs induce pyroptosis through caspase-3 cleavage of a gasdermin, <italic>Nature</italic>, 2017, 547(7661): 99-103</p></body></sub-article></article>
