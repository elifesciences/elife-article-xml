To understand the molecular programs underlying lung cancer initiation and maintenance, we focused on stem cell programs that are normally extinguished with differentiation but can be reactivated during oncogenesis. Here, we have used extensive genetic modeling and patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) to identify a dual role for Msi2: as a signal that acts initially to sensitize cells to transformation, and subsequently to drive tumor propagation. Using Msi reporter mice, we found that Msi2-expressing cells were marked by a pro-oncogenic landscape and a preferential ability to respond to Ras and p53 mutations. Consistent with this, genetic deletion of <italic>Msi2</italic> in an autochthonous Ras/p53-driven lung cancer model resulted in a marked reduction of tumor burden, delayed progression, and a doubling of median survival. Additionally, this dependency was conserved in human disease as inhibition of Msi2 impaired tumor growth in PDXs. Mechanistically, Msi2 triggered a broad range of pathways critical for tumor growth, including several novel effectors of lung adenocarcinoma. Collectively, these findings reveal a critical role for Msi2 in aggressive lung adenocarcinoma, lend new insight into the biology of this disease, and identify potential new therapeutic targets.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>lung cancer</kwd><kwd>Musashi-2</kwd><kwd>cancer stem cells</kwd><kwd>stem cells</kwd><kwd>cell of origin</kwd><kwd>NSCLC</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Ruth L.

While the death rate due to lung cancer has decreased over time due to a drop in the prevalence of smoking, it is still by far the leading cause of cancer-related deaths in men and women, resulting in more deaths than colon, breast, and prostate cancer combined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">American Cancer Society, 2019</xref>). Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most prevalent form of lung cancer, accounting for 84% of lung cancer cases. Within this cancer type, adenocarcinoma is the most frequent subtype, accounting for 50% of all NSCLCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Davidson et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Langer et al., 2010</xref>). Most cases of lung cancer are diagnosed at late-stage—when there is regional or distant spread of the disease—at which time treatment options are limited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Heist and Engelman, 2012</xref>). Despite advances in lung cancer therapy, the 5-year survival rates for late-stage (i.e. regional or distant) NSCLC are 37–9%, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">American Cancer Society, 2024</xref>). These survival rates highlight the critical need for improved understanding of the biology of this disease in order to develop more effective treatments.</p><p>To understand the key dependencies of lung cancer, we have focused on stem cell programs which are often co-opted to perpetuate an aggressive, undifferentiated state. The stem cell fate determinant Musashi-2 (Msi2) is one such signal that has been shown to be critical in development as well as advanced cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fox et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ito et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Koechlein et al., 2016</xref>); however, its role in lung cancer is not well understood. Msi2 has been reported to be overexpressed in human lung adenocarcinoma and regional metastases, and its inhibition in human cell lines has been shown to reduce invasive and metastatic potential in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kudinov et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Moreira et al., 2010</xref>). However, this study focused on in vitro analysis utilizing human NSCLC cell lines; thus, no evidence for a role of Msi2 in vivo using definitive genetic mouse models exist. Furthermore, whether Msi2 is a dependency for tumor initiation or required for continued propagation, and which pathways are regulated by Msi2 to drive tumor growth, also remain unknown. Here, we have utilized a combination of genetic models and patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) to determine the role of Msi2 signaling in the growth and progression of lung adenocarcinoma. Using Msi2 knock-in reporter mice and Msi2 conditional knockout mice, we show that Msi2 plays a dual role in lung adenocarcinoma, acting as a signal that not only is essential for initiation, but one that continues to be required post-establishment in both genetically engineered mouse models and in PDXs. Finally, using RNA-sequencing (RNAseq) analysis we show that Msi2 can trigger a range of pathways critical for tumor growth, including several new effectors of lung adenocarcinoma. These findings suggest that Msi2 is a critical regulator of lung adenocarcinoma and offer new insight into the signals that facilitate transformation and support disease progression.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Msi2 is expressed in normal lung and in adenocarcinoma</title><p>To determine whether Musashi regulates the growth and progression of aggressive lung cancer we first determined whether Msi2 is expressed in stem cells of the distal lung. We used a <italic>Msi2<sup>eGFP/+</sup></italic> knock-in reporter mouse to track endogenous Msi2 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fox et al., 2016</xref>), and found that Msi2 is expressed in 39% of Lin<sup>−</sup>EpCAM<sup>+</sup> lung epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) and, more specifically, in 37% of cells enriched for Club/BASC cells and 26% of cells enriched for AT2 cells—the known stem cell populations of the distal lung (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B, C</xref>). Interestingly, although Msi2 expression could only be detected in a fraction of distal lung stem cells, widespread expression of Msi2 was often observed in lung adenocarcinomas formed in <italic>Kras<sup>G12D/+</sup>; Trp53<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> (KP) mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). The expansion of Msi2 expression in lung tumors compared to normal lung epithelia suggests that normal cells expressing Msi2 are more sensitive to transformation, or that once transformed, Msi2 expression is amplified in tumor cells.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Msi2 is expressed in the stem cells of the distal lung and in lung adenocarcinoma.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Msi2 is expressed in the Lin<sup>−</sup>EpCAM<sup>+</sup> lung epithelial cells of <italic>Msi2<sup>GFP/+</sup></italic> (M2GFP) reporter mice.

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, Msi2<sup>+</sup> cells had enhanced sphere-forming capacity, with a sixfold increase in sphere-forming observed at primary passage, and this capacity was retained for up to four passages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Furthermore, spheres that were isolated and transplanted subcutaneously into the flanks of immunocompromised mice developed Msi2-expressing tumors in vivo as well as metastatic lesions in the lung, demonstrating that the observed sphere-forming capacity is reflective of tumorigenicity and not merely stem cell capacity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C–E</xref>). To understand the basis for the enhanced tumorigenic capacity of Msi2<sup>+</sup> cells, we carried out RNAseq to examine the transcriptional landscape of Msi2-expressing cells in normal lung epithelia. Interestingly, the differentially expressed gene profile showed that Msi2<sup>+</sup> cells are transcriptionally distinct from Msi2<sup>−</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) further revealed that Msi2<sup>+</sup> cells are significantly enriched for signatures related to developmental and stem cell signaling, consistent with the known role of Msi2 as a critical regulator of the stem cell state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Okano et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hope et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kharas et al., 2010</xref>), as well as signatures related to oncogenic signaling and therapy resistance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B–D</xref>) which are associated with aggressive cancers. Over 1900 differentially expressed genes were found to be enriched in the Msi2<sup>+</sup> population.

In addition to these known regulators, a number of genes not previously implicated in lung cancer were found to be significantly downregulated following Msi2 inhibition, suggesting that they may play a role in tumor growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I, J</xref>). To identify potential novel regulators of lung adenocarcinoma we focused on significantly downregulated genes that were highly expressed, which narrowed our gene list to 30 potential candidates.

Here, we have used genetically engineered and autochthonous models to show that Msi2 is critically required in the development and progression of primary lung adenocarcinoma. Msi2 signaling emerges as a key dependency at initiation and continues to be needed during tumor progression. Using the well-established <italic>Kras<sup>G12D</sup>; Trp53<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> (KP) mouse model of lung adenocarcinoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jackson et al., 2005</xref>), we created a Msi2-knockout lung adenocarcinoma model and found that deletion of Msi2 at initiation significantly impaired tumor incidence, reduced tumor burden and progression, and cumulatively led to a doubling of median survival. Furthermore, loss of Msi2 impaired propagation of established KP tumors in vitro and in vivo. In order to determine whether these findings were relevant for the human disease, we used PDXs, which have proven to be a highly valuable tool for understanding the biology of human cancers and have been shown to faithfully predict therapeutic response in a majority of patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tentler et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Siolas and Hannon, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hidalgo et al., 2014</xref>). Inhibition of Msi2 in PDXs also led to impaired tumor growth in vivo, suggesting that dependence on Msi2 is conserved in human lung adenocarcinoma.</p><p>Our finding that the loss of Msi2 prior to transformation significantly impacts tumor initiation prompts the interesting question of whether Msi2 signaling can influence early tumor growth for lung adenocarcinoma. Previous use of the KP model has illustrated how both the cellular and molecular context at the time of transformation influences subsequent cancer development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sutherland et al., 2014</xref>). Using cell-type-specific Ad-Cre to drive the expression of either <italic>Kras<sup>G12D</sup></italic> alone or <italic>Kras<sup>G12D</sup></italic> in combination with <italic>Trp53<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic>, work by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sutherland et al., 2014</xref> has shown that the cell of origin for adenocarcinoma differs based on the genetic mutations used to drive the cancer. When <italic>Kras<sup>G12D</sup></italic> alone was used as the driver, AT2 cells were able to form adenomas which then progressed to adenocarcinomas, while Club cells were only able to form adenomas which did not progress further. However, when <italic>Kras<sup>G12D</sup></italic> was used in combination with <italic>Trp53<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic>, both cell types were capable of forming adenomas which could then progress to adenocarcinomas. While both genetic drivers and the cell of origin are key components for tumor formation, whether there are signaling factors that endow the cell of origin with the capacity to transform when presented with these key drivers is an area that has been less explored. In this context, our work sheds new light on such signals required at initiation as we found that Msi2 is expressed in a subpopulation of distal lung stem cells, that cells expressing Msi2 are preferentially sensitive to transformation, and that its genetic ablation leads to a marked decrease in tumor initiation and progression. The results of our RNAseq analysis suggest that this enhanced capacity may be established through an enrichment in signaling programs involved in the maintenance of an undifferentiated state as well as those known to support aggressive tumor growth which then provides a permissive environment for early tumor growth and development. These findings identify a new role for Msi2 signaling as an enhancer of tumor growth for lung adenocarcinoma and indicate that subpopulations harboring these signals may be particularly primed for transformation.</p><p>The continued dependency on Msi2 signaling following tumor initiation illustrates the potency of Msi2 as a regulator of tumor progression; thus, defining the mechanism by which Msi2 exerts this influence in lung adenocarcinoma would be critical to understanding the molecular basis of its broad influence. Here, our RNAseq analysis suggests that Msi2 may act in part as a regulator of the stem cell state. Interestingly, this analysis also showed that the role of Msi2 may extend to the regulation of processes crucial for tumor growth, such as metabolism and DNA repair, thus placing it upstream of multiple potent oncogenic signals. This work also led to the identification of several novel effectors of lung adenocarcinoma regulated by Msi2. Our functional experiments inhibiting these genes showed that loss of <italic>Ptgds</italic>, <italic>Arl2bp</italic>, <italic>Rnf157</italic>, and <italic>Syt11</italic> can block lung cancer sphere formation. Previous work has shown that Ptgds indirectly facilitates phosphorylated Sox9 nuclear translocation via activation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Malki et al., 2005</xref>) and is important in the development of Sertoli cells. While <italic>Ptgds</italic> has been shown previously to be expressed in human lung tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ragolia et al., 2010</xref>) our work is the first to identify a functional role of Ptgds in lung adenocarcinoma. As a regulator of STAT3 signaling, Arl2bp directly binds to the STAT3 transcription factor, which maintains STAT3’s phosphorylation status and its localization in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Muromoto et al., 2008</xref>). STAT3 activity has been implicated in NSCLC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mohrherr et al., 2020</xref>), thus modulating STAT3 activity through <italic>Arl2bp</italic> inhibition may provide an alternative therapeutic strategy. Lastly, both Rnf157 and Syt11 are predominantly expressed in the brain and have been implicated in neuronal cell survival and dendrite growth and neuronal vesicular trafficking, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Matz et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Shimojo et al., 2019</xref>). Thus far, their roles have not been investigated in cancer. Our findings suggest the need for further study of these genes and raise the possibility that they could serve as future therapeutic targets.</p><p>While early treatment approaches centered principally on the use of cytotoxic agents, the treatment of lung cancer has evolved to incorporate the use of targeted therapies and immunotherapy, when appropriate, in combination with the standard cytotoxic regimen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Herbst et al., 2018</xref>). For patients with a lung cancer subtype harboring known targetable mutations, this has led to considerable improvements in the response to treatment. Yet troubling survival rates, driven largely by either late-stage detection or recurrence of the disease—even in cases for which a targeted therapy has been offered— illustrate the need for an increased understanding of the biology of lung cancer in order to inform future therapeutic approaches. The findings presented here identify a novel role for Msi2 in the growth and progression of lung adenocarcinoma and suggest that this role extends to human disease. Furthermore, these findings identify novel effectors of lung adenocarcinoma regulated by Msi2 thereby lending new insight into the mechanism by which Msi2 exerts its influence on this disease. These new insights enhance our understanding of the biology of lung adenocarcinoma and may serve to open new avenues of focus for future therapeutic strategies.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice</title><p><italic>Msi2<sup>eGFP/+</sup></italic> knock-in reporter mice were generated as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fox et al., 2016</xref>) and are heterozygous for the <italic>Msi2</italic> allele.

The following antibodies (1 µl/1 M cells) were used: rat anti-mouse EpCAM-APC (eBioscience, #17-5791-82, clone G8.8), CD45-PE (eBioscience, #12-0454-82, clone 104), CD45-PeCy7 (eBioscience, #25-0451-82, clone 30-F11), CD31-PE (eBioscience, #12-0311-83, clone 390), CD31-PeCy7 (eBioscience; #25-0311-81, clone 390), and Sca1-PeCy7 (eBioscience, #25-5981-82, clone D7). CD31 and CD45 antibodies were used to mark the Lineage<sup>+</sup> populations of the lung.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Histology, immunohistochemistry, and immunofluorescence</title><p>For the isolation of tumor-bearing lungs from KP mice, mice were anesthetized, perfused with PBS as described, and 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA; Fisher Scientific) was added to the lungs via intratracheal instillation. Lungs were then removed, placed in 4% PFA overnight at 4°C, and stored in 70% ethanol prior to processing. The fixed lung tissue was then paraffin embedded at the UCSD Histology and Immunohistochemistry Core at The Sanford Consortium for Regenerative Medicine according to standard protocols, and 5 μm sections were obtained. Paraffin embedded tissues were then deparaffinized in xylene and rehydrated in a 100%, 95%, 70%, 50%, and 30% ethanol series. For immunohistochemistry, endogenous peroxidase was quenched in 3% hydrogen peroxide (Fisher Scientific) for 30 min at room temperature prior to antigen retrieval. Antigen retrieval was performed for 30 min in 95–100 °C 1× citrate buffer, pH 6.0 (eBioscience). Sections were blocked in TBS (Tris buffered saline) or PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich), 10% goat or donkey serum (Sigma-Aldrich), and 5% bovine serum albumin. For single-cell suspensions of lung epithelia or lung tumors, Lin<sup>−</sup>EpCAM<sup>+</sup> cells were isolated via FACS in the manner described previously.

For immunofluorescence staining, incubation with Alexafluor-conjugated secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes) was performed for 1 hr at room temperature. DAPI (Molecular Probes) was used to detect DNA and images were obtained with a Confocal Leica TCS SP5 II (Leica Microsystems). For immunohistochemical staining, incubation with biotinylated secondary antibodies (Vector Laboratories) was performed for 45 min at 20–25°C. Vectastain ABC HRP Kit (Vector Laboratories) was used according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Sections were counterstained with hematoxylin. The following primary antibodies were used: chicken anti-GFP (Abcam, ab13970; 1:200), rabbit anti-Msi2 (Abcam, ab76148; clone EP1305Y, 1:500), rabbit anti-SPC (Santa Cruz, sc-13979; clone FL-197, 1:100), and goat anti-CC10 (Santa Cruz, sc-9773; clone S-20, 1:200). Whole slide imaging was used to determine the number of tumors, tumor burden, and tumor grade in the tumor-bearing lungs of KP mice. H&amp;E-stained slides were scanned using Aperio AT2 digital whole slide scanning (Leica Biosystems), and tumor analysis was performed using ImageScope (Aperio).

Cells were injected subcutaneously into the flank of non-tumor bearing (i.e. not treated with Adeno-Cre), immunocompetent KP mice. Subcutaneous tumors were measured with calipers once weekly for 6–15 weeks and did not exceed 2 cm in diameter. At endpoint, flank tumors were removed, and tumors were dissociated as described. Tumor cells were stained with CD45-PeCy7 and CD31-PeCy7, and the absolute number of tumor cells was calculated by multiplying the percentage of CD45−CD31− transduced cells by the total number of CD45−CD31− live cells. For flank transplant assays of PDXs, freshly dissociated xenografts were plated in full media [1× DMEM:F12 (Fisher Scientific) supplemented with 10% FBS, 1× pen/strep (Fisher Scientific), 1× N-2 supplement (Life Technologies), 35 µg/ml bovine pituitary extract (Fisher Scientific), 20 ng/ml recombinant human EGF (Life Technologies), 20 ng/ml recombinant human FGF-basic (Fisher Scientific)]. 500,000 cells/well were plated in a 6-well plate (Fisher Scientific) coated with Matrigel (Corning) for subsequent transplant, and 83,000 cells/well were plated in a 24-well plate (Fisher Scientific) coated with Matrigel (Corning) for subsequent determination of transduction efficiency via FACS.

Specifically, they found that Musashi-2 is important for lung cancer cells as it controls cancer cell growth, and also regulates several genes that also control cancer cell growth. Development of a new Musashi-2 mouse model is a plus, which confirmed Musashi-2 importance for lung cancer survival, and finding several genes that Musashi controls that are important for lung cancer growth. Additionally, they demonstrated that Musashi-2 overexpression which is tracked by GFP is preferred in lung adenocarcinoma cells. The data is rigorous and only minor revisions are requested.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>Authors achieved their goals, by developing new Musashi-2 mouse model, confirming Musashi-2 importance for lung cancer survival, and finding several genes that Musashi controls that are important for lung cancer growth.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The findings of Musashi-2 mouse and human lung cancer growth control are not that novel as prior publication in 2016 showed that already, again, in both human and mouse models (Kudinov et al PNAS, PMID: 27274057), and also the authors missed the point of that paper which did use both miuse and human models to show impact on inbvasion and metastasis- both in vitro and in vivo. Additionally, another publication is currently under revisions recently also generated new Musashi-2 transgenic mouse model which confirmed Musashi-2 support of lung cancer growth (Bychkov I et al, PMID: 37398283; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.06.13.544756v1">https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.06.13.544756v1</ext-link>). Another weakness is that Musashi-2 cannot be effectively targeted and the new genes the authors found that Musashi-2 regulates are likely to be also difficult therapeutic targets. Therefore, impact of this new investigation is relatively modest in the field.</p><p>Major suggestions:</p><p>(1) Figure 3: it is unclear what is the efficiency of Msi2 deletion shRNA - could you demonstrate it by at least two independent methods? (QPCR, Western, or IHC?) please quantitate the data.</p><p>(2) In Figure 4, similarly, it is unclear if Msi2 depletion was effective- and what is shRNA efficiency.

Barber et al. reports the function of Msi2 in mouse models of non-small cell lung cancer. The expression of Msi2 in normal lung was evaluated using a knockin reporter allele. Msi2 expressing cells were found to be around 30-40% in normal lung epithelium without a strong bias in subsets of lung cells. Knocking out Msi2 in a KrasG12D and P53 KO model reduced lung cancer initiation. Knocking down Msi2 in established lung cancer cells reduced in vitro sphere formation and in vivo xenograft. Finally, the authors identified several genes whose expression was downregulated by Msi2 knockdown. Knocking down four of these genes, including Ptgds, Arl2bp, hRnf157, and Syt11, each with a single shRNA, reduced lung sphere formation in vitro, suggesting their involvement in lung cancer.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>This manuscript represents an interesting advance on the role of Msi2 in lung cancer. While some of the data (for example the knockdown effect of Msi2 in established lung cancer cells) corroborated previous findings, the study of Msi2 expression in normal lung and the characterization of the KO phenotype in lung cancer initiation are new and interesting.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>Two areas can be further strengthened.

First, authors show that Msi2 is expressed in a subset of Club/BASC (37%) and AT2 (26%) cells in the normal lung and displayed a distinct transcriptional profile than non-expressing Msi2 cells. Furthermore, Msi2 is broadly expressed/activated in vivo in genetically induced lung adenocarcinoma tumors (Kras/p53 mouse model) and Msi2+ cells displayed a significantly higher ability to form tumor spheres in vitro. Authors demonstrated by in vivo and in vitro assays that Msi2 loss of function significantly impair tumor growth and progression in lung adenocarcinoma. Data showed that Msi2 function is conserved in human adenocarcinoma tumor growth in patient-derived xenograft. Lastly, novel genes regulated by Msi2 and involved in lung adenocarcinoma tumor growth were identified.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The authors provided convincing data for a key role of Msi2 in lung adenocarcinoma tumor progression and growth. Multiple evidences using Msi2 knock-out genetic mouse model and shRNA knock-down in tumor sphere formation assay are clearly demonstrated. The conservation and importance of Msi2 was further shown in human patient-derived xenograft. Although specific cell types (Club/BASC, AT2) were not isolated, authors further delved in the transcriptional difference between Msi2+ and Msi2- cells in the normal lung. Furthermore, novel genes and pathways regulated by Msi2 in lung adenocarcinoma were identified and tested for their ability to inhibit tumor growth in vitro. These 2 RNA-Seq datasets will be useful in the future and provide a basis to explore (1) potential propensity of a given cell to initiate oncogenic transformation, and (2) potential novel regulators of lung adenocarcinoma.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>Although this work strongly demonstrated the importance of Msi2 in lung adenocarcinoma tumor progression and growth, the following points remain to be clarified or addressed.</p><p>- In Figure 1, characterization of Msi2 expression in the normal mouse lung was carried out by using a Msi2-GFP Knock-in reporter and analyzed by flow cytometry followed by cytospins and immunostaining. Additional characterization of Msi2 expression by co-immunostaining with well-known markers of airway and alveolar cell types in intact lung tissue will strengthen the existing data and provide more specific information about Msi2 expression and abundancy in relevant cell types. It will be also interesting to know whether Msi2 is expressed or not in other abundant lung cell types such as ciliated and AT1 cells.</p><p>- While this set of experiments provide strong evidence that Msi2 is required for tumor progression and growth in lung adenocarcinoma, it is unclear whether normal Msi2+ lung cells are more responsive to transformation or whether Msi2 is upregulated early during the process of tumorigenesis. Future lineage tracing experiments using Msi2-CreER and mouse models of chemically-induced lung carcinogenesis will provide additional data that will fully support this claim.</p><p>- In Figure 4F, Patient-derived xenograft (PDX) assays were conducted in 2 patients only and the percentage of cells infected by shRNA-Msi2 is low in both PDX (30% and 10% for patient 1 and 2 respectively). It is surprising that Msi2 downregulation in a small percentage of tumor cells has such a dramatic effect on tumor growth and expansion. Confirmation of this finding with additional patient samples would suggest an important non-cell autonomous role for Msi2 in lung adenocarcinoma.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa4"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.97021.2.sa4</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Barber</surname><given-names>Alison G</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of California San Diego School of Medicine</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">La Jolla</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Quintero</surname><given-names>Cynthia M</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Columbia University Medical Center</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">New York</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Hamilton</surname><given-names>Michael</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of California San Diego School of Medicine</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">La Jolla</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Rajbhandari</surname><given-names>Nirakar</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of California San Diego School of Medicine</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">La Jolla</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Sasik</surname><given-names>Roman</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of California San Diego School of Medicine</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">La Jolla</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Yan</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of California San Diego</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">La Jolla</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>Carla</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Harvard Medical School</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Boston</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Husain</surname><given-names>Hatim</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of California San Diego School of Medicine</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">La Jolla</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Sun</surname><given-names>Xin</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of California San Diego</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">La Jolla</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Reya</surname><given-names>Tannishtha</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Columbia University Medical Center</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">New York</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>(1) Figure 3: it is unclear what is the efficiency of Msi2 deletion shRNA - could you demonstrate it by at least two independent methods?

In previous publications loss of Msi2 in leukemia cells has been shown to inhibit growth via arrested cell cycle progression by increasing the expression of p213. Further, loss of Msi2 was also shown to promote apoptosis in part by upregulating Bax3. These data suggest that Msi2 can have an impact via multiple distinct mechanisms including by mediating cell cycle arrest and blocking apoptosis. While these specific genes were not detectably changed after loss of Msi2 in lung cancer cells, other genes in these and other pathways will be important to study in the future.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Since Musashi-1 is a Musashi-2 paralogue that could compensate for Musashi-2 loss, please test Msi1 expression levels in matching Fig 3 and Fig 4 sections (in cells/ tumors with Msi2 deletion and in KP cells with Msi2 shRNA).

(as has been previously demonstrated in the nervous system) but also Numb RNA. This indicated that as an RNA binding protein, Msi2 also can bind and destabilize direct binding targets such as Numb; this was the reason for pursuing transcriptomic analysis. However as the reviewer suggests, proteomic studies are certainly very important to develop a complete picture of the impact of Musashi to determine which targets are controlled by Msi2 at the protein level.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>(1) It will be interesting to determine whether Msi2+ cells are a relatively stable subset or rather the Msi2+ cells in lung is a dynamic concept that is transient or interconvertible. This is relevant to the interpretation of what Msi2 positivity really means.</p></disp-quote><p>In previous unpublished work from our lab, we have found that Msi2+ cells from a GFP reporter KPf/fC mouse are readily able to become GFP negative (Msi2-), but the inverse is not true. Specifically, when Msi2+ KPf/fC pancreatic cells were transplanted into the flanks of NSG mice, Msi2+ cells formed tumors in all recipients; these tumors contained both GFP+ and GFP- cells (over 80%) recapitulating the original heterogeneity and suggesting GFP+ cells can give rise to both GFP+ and GFP- cells (Lytle and Reya, unpublished observations). In contrast only a small subset of GFP- transplanted mice formed tumors. One of the rare GFP- derived tumors was isolated and found to contain largely GFP- cells, with ~0.1% GFP+ cells. The small frequency of GFP expression could be from contaminating cells or may suggest that GFP- cells retain some ability to switch on Msi under selective pressure, and that although they pose a lower risk of driving tumorigenesis than Msi+ cells, they may nonetheless bear latent potential to become higher risk. These data may offer a possible model for projecting the potential of Msi2+ cells in the lung, but is something that needs to be further studied in this tissue.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Does Kras mutation and/or p53 loss upregulate Msi2?
