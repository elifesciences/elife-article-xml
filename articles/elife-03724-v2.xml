We show here that this restriction can be bypassed through alternative transposition, a transposition reaction that utilizes the termini of two separate, nearby transposable elements (TEs). Our results suggest that alternative transposition during S phase can induce re-replication of the TEs and their flanking sequences. The DNA re-replication can spontaneously abort to generate double-strand breaks, which can be repaired to generate Composite Insertions composed of transposon termini flanking segmental duplications of various lengths. These results show how alternative transposition coupled with DNA replication and repair can significantly alter genome structure and may have contributed to rapid genome evolution in maize and possibly other eukaryotes.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03724.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03724.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03724.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>To make accurate copies of its genome, a cell takes precautions to make sure each section of DNA is only duplicated once in every round of copying. However, there are some sections of DNA called transposons that can avoid these restrictions and be duplicated more often.</p><p>Transposons are mobile pieces of DNA: they can be ‘cut’ from one section of the genome and are able to ‘paste’ back in somewhere else. The amount of mobile DNA in a genome varies a great deal between species, and in the crop plant maize, it makes up nearly 85% of the genome.</p><p>Some transposons can move while the genome is being duplicated. If a transposon is cut out of a section of DNA that has already been copied and is pasted into a site that is yet to be copied, the transposon can be copied again. The transposon may now be present in two different places in the genome.</p><p>If two transposons are close together on a section of DNA, both transposons can move at the same time. As they move, they can carry along pieces of the genome, transferring them from one site to another. These transferred pieces can include sections of, or even entire, genes. This is called alternative transposition, but it is not clear whether this process can happen when the genome is actively being duplicated.</p><p>Here, Zhang et al. studied transposons in maize. The experiments found that alternative transposition can take place between a site that has already been copied and another site that is still waiting to be copied. Therefore, after the round of copying is completed, both transposons and the flanking DNA can be present in two places in the genome.</p><p>When single transposons move, or alternative transposition takes place, sections of the genome can be rearranged and genes can be deleted or new ones can be created. Therefore, transposons may have contributed to rapid evolution in maize and possibly other species.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03724.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03724.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>transposition</kwd><kwd>DNA replication</kwd><kwd>duplication</kwd><kwd>maize</kwd><kwd>Ac/Ds</kwd><kwd>composite insertion</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000152</institution-id><institution>Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Research Award 0923826</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Jianbo</given-names></name><name><surname>Peterson</surname><given-names>Thomas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funder had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Transposition reactions that occur during DNA replication and involve the termini of adjacent transposons can induce genome expansion by re-replication of transposon-flanking sequences.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Initiation of DNA replication in eukaryotic cells is controlled by the replication licensing system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blow, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blow and Dutta, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Truong and Wu, 2011</xref>), which ensures that each segment of the genome is replicated only once per cell cycle.

If a replicated transposon excises and reinserts into an unreplicated site, the transposon can undergo one additional replication in the same S phase; the re-replication, however, is limited to the TE itself and does not extend into the TE-flanking regions.</p><p>We and others have previously shown that a pair of <italic>Ac</italic> termini in reversed orientation can undergo transposition, generating major chromosomal rearrangements such as deletions, inversions, permutations, duplications, and reciprocal translocations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zhang and Peterson, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zhang et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Huang and Dooner, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zhang et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">2013</xref>); this transposition reaction is termed <underline>r</underline>eversed <italic>Ac</italic> <underline>e</underline>nds <underline>t</underline>ransposition (RET). All the RET-generated genome rearrangements described to date are fully explained by models in which the excised TE termini inserted into target sites that had completed DNA replication.

Here, we show that such events do occur, and that they can induce re-replication of the TE and its flanking sequences. This process generates novel structures termed Composite Insertions (CIs) that contain TE sequences and variable lengths of the flanking genomic DNA.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Model of transposition-mediated DNA re-replication</title><p>The allele <italic>P1-ovov454</italic> (GenBank accession # KM013692) carries an intact <italic>Ac</italic> element and a fractured <italic>Ac</italic> (<italic>fAc</italic>) element inserted in the second intron of the maize <italic>p1</italic> gene; the 5′ terminus of <italic>Ac</italic> and the 3′ terminus of <italic>fAc</italic> are present in reversed orientation with respect to each other and separated by an 822-bp inter-transposon segment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yu et al., 2011</xref>).

We developed and tested models in which replicated <italic>Ac/fAc</italic> termini are excised by RET and inserted into unreplicated target sites. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> (See also the animation <xref ref-type="other" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>), this type of transposition reaction places already-replicated DNA in front of a replication fork where it may undergo a second round of replication. We propose that the re-replication fork may spontaneously abort, yielding two chromatid fragments terminated by double-strand breaks (DSBs); fusion of the DSBs restores the chromosome linearity and generates CIs containing <italic>Ac</italic>/<italic>fAc</italic> and their flanking sequences at the duplication breakpoints. By comparing RET events involving insertion sites that are unreplicated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) vs replicated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), we can see that both types of events generate TDDs whose sizes are determined by the transposon insertion site. However, only events with unreplicated insertion sites also generate CIs via re-replication of the <italic>Ac/fAc</italic> and their flanking sequences; the resulting products are termed TDDCI alleles. Because the formation of TDDs was described in detail previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>), here we will focus on the origin and characterization of the CI of the TDDCI alleles.<media content-type="glencoe play-in-place height-250 width-310" id="video1" mime-subtype="mov" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-03724-media1-v2.mov"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03724.005</object-id><label>Video 1.</label><caption><title>Animation showing model for reversed <italic>Ac</italic> ends transposition during DNA replication.</title><p>See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> legend for details.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03724.005">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03724.005</ext-link></p></caption></media></p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Identification of alleles with Composite Insertions (CIs)</title><p>Both TDD and TDDCI alleles contain similar duplication structures and should exhibit similar phenotypes.

To identify the TDDCI alleles, we designed PCR primers that flank the progenitor insertion target sites for each allele (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, primers 1 and 2). Primers 1 + Ac5 can amplify a product from both TDD and TDDCI while primers 2 + Ac3 can amplify a product only from TDDCI since the latter contains an additional CI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). As expected, PCR using primers 1 + Ac5 produced bands of the expected sizes in all the 16 alleles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, upper panel; seven examples are shown here).

First, the 12.7 kb <italic>p1</italic> band is absent in the three twinned <italic>p1-ww</italic> alleles (<italic>p1-ww-T22</italic>, <italic>p1-ww-T24</italic>, and <italic>p1-ww-T21</italic>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, lanes 4, 6 and 10, respectively). This result confirms the presence of a deletion as predicted by the model shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. Second, the alleles <italic>P1-rr-T24</italic>, <italic>P1-rr-E17</italic>, and <italic>P1-rr-E340</italic> show a more intense 4.7 kb <italic>p2</italic> band in comparison with the 5.0 kb band (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, lanes 5, 7, 8). This result is also expected because these three alleles have duplications of &gt;70 kb (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>) that generate additional copies of the <italic>p2</italic> gene located ∼70 kb proximal to <italic>p1</italic>. Third, alleles <italic>P1-rr-T22</italic>, <italic>P1-rr-T21</italic>, and <italic>P1-rr-E5</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, lanes 3, 9 and 12, respectively) exhibit one or two new bands hybridizing with probe 8B.

In <italic>P1-rr-T22</italic>, the duplication/insertion breakpoint occurred in the <italic>p2</italic> band containing probe 8B, resulting in a shift of the 4.7 kb band to ∼8 kb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, lane 3).

The third repeat is not complete; its proximal side (including the <italic>bz1</italic> coding sequence) is truncated and joined to a truncated <italic>Ds</italic> sequence. This structure is similar to that of <italic>P1-rr-T22</italic>, <italic>P1-rr-E17</italic>, and <italic>P1P2-3</italic> described above: two intact Tandem Direct Duplications (<italic>p1</italic> vs <italic>bz1</italic> sequence), separated by TEs (<italic>Ac</italic> vs <italic>Ds</italic>), adjacent to a CI. In the case of <italic>bz1-m4-D6856</italic>, the CI contains the truncated copy of the tandem duplication and the truncated <italic>Ds</italic> and is flanked by 8 bp target site duplications. We propose that <italic>bz1-m4-D6856</italic> originated via a mechanism very similar to that shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>: RET of two <italic>Ds</italic> elements located distal to the <italic>bz1</italic> gene, followed by insertion of the excised <italic>Ds</italic> termini into an unreplicated target site in the <italic>bz1</italic> 5′ UTR region. The three tandem repeats would have been formed by rolling circle replication; one replication fork would have dissociated from the circle distal to the <italic>bz1</italic> coding region to generate the incomplete repeat, while the other fork would have dissociated from the <italic>Ds</italic> element to generate a truncated <italic>Ds</italic> (<xref ref-type="other" rid="video4">Video 4</xref>). This model presupposes the existence of a <italic>Ds</italic> element (the leftmost element in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>) distal to the tandem repeats in <italic>bz1-m4-D6856</italic> and its progenitor allele.

Efforts in our lab to identify a <italic>Ds</italic> element in this position in <italic>bz1-m4-D6856</italic> and related stocks have been unsuccessful. However, McClintock's description of the origin of <italic>bz1-m4-D6856</italic> (As reported in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Klein et al., 1988</xref>) indicates that the <italic>bz1-m4</italic> progenitor produced a high frequency of dicentric chromosomes, while the <italic>bz1-m4-D6856</italic> derivative exhibited low dicentric frequency. Dicentric chromosome formation is a characteristic feature of alternative transposition reactions, such as RET, involving two nearby <italic>Ac/Ds</italic> elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Huang and Dooner, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yu et al., 2010</xref>).

This pathway is initiated by transposase-induced excision of the replicated termini of nearby transposons, followed by insertion of the excised transposon ends into an unreplicated target site. Re-replication begins when chromosomal replication forks reach the transposon and may continue for considerable distances into the flanking DNA before aborting. The two resulting chromatid ends are joined together to restore chromosome linearity. This re-replication pathway is localized to the transposons and their flanking sequences and does not require origin re-initiation. In contrast, deregulating licensing factor activity results in re-firing of replication origin(s), leading to re-replication at multiple dispersed origins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Green et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>Although little is known about termination of eukaryotic DNA replication, studies in yeast indicate that termination does not require specific terminator sites, but occurs wherever two replication forks converge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">McGuffee et al., 2013</xref>). Here, we propose that alternative transposition reactions can interrupt normal fork convergence. For example, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> shows that converging replication forks α and β are separated from each other by alternative transposition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>); if not terminated by other factors, replication fork β could in principle continue until the end of the chromosome, which is ∼48 Mb from the <italic>p1</italic> locus. However, our results suggest that DNA re-replication tends to abort after relatively short distances. The re-replicated segments generated from a single replication fork range in size from 4781 bp to 18,866 bp; the structure of the insertion in <italic>P1-rr-E340</italic> is unknown, but DNA gel blotting analysis suggests a size of at least 36 kb. Thus the total extent of DNA re-replication is less than 19 kb in eight of nine alleles examined. In contrast, break-induced replication in yeast is capable of replicating from the site of a DSB to the end of the chromosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kraus et al., 2001</xref>). What causes termination of re-replication following alternative transposition in maize? One possibility is fork chasing and head-to-tail fork collision (rear-ending), which has been shown to cause fork collapse and termination of DNA re-replication in Xenopus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Davidson et al., 2006</xref>). Alternatively, re-replication may spontaneously stall and abort due to compromised fork progression as reported in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Green et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Our model proposes that DNA re-replication aborts to produce chromatids terminated by broken ends, which are joined together to restore chromosome linearity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1 fig6 fig7 fig8">Figures 1, 6, 7, and 8</xref>). If the chromatid DSBs were not repaired, the cell would die and that event would not be recovered in our screen. From a population of ∼2000 plants, we isolated 16 alleles that carry a duplication and/or insertion structure. Nine of these 16 alleles (56%) have only a duplication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>), which indicates that the target site was replicated at the time of RET (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>); whereas seven alleles have an insertion, which indicates that the target site was unreplicated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1 fig6 fig7">Figures 1, 6 and 7</xref>). The frequency of insertion into an unreplicated target site is 7/16 (44%), which is similar to a previous estimate of <italic>Ac</italic> insertion into unreplicated sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Greenblatt and Brink, 1962</xref>). Thus the products of insertion into unreplicated target sites are not significantly under-represented in our sample, suggesting that repair of re-replication-generated DSBs is quite efficient in mitotic S phase cells.</p><p>DNA lesions caused by replication fork stalling and collapse can be repaired by HR, NHEJ, MMEJ, replication slippage, FoSTeS (fork stalling and template switching), BIR (break-induced replication), MMBIR (microhomology-mediated break-induced replication), MMIR (microhomology/microsatellite-induced replication), and other mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kraus et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ma et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lee et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">McVey and Lee, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Payen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hastings et al., 2009a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">2009b</xref>). In mammalian cells, replication fork-associated DSBs are predominantly repaired via HR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arnaudeau et al., 2001</xref>). Among the six CI alleles sequenced here, three were repaired by HR and three by NHEJ, indicating that these two repair pathways have relatively similar activities during the S phase of mitosis in maize.</p><p>An important advantage of the maize system is the ability to identify genetically twinned sectors and to propagate and analyze their corresponding alleles. Because twinned alleles are the reciprocal products of a single event (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Greenblatt and Brink, 1962</xref>), their structures should reflect a single parsimonious mechanism of origin. This allows us to distinguish among a variety of possible mechanisms for formation of segmental duplications. For example, non-allelic homologous recombination (NAHR) could generate a TDD joined and flanked by <italic>Ac</italic> as observed in <italic>P1-rr-T24</italic> if there were a <italic>p1</italic>-proximal <italic>Ac</italic> element in the progenitor allele <italic>P1-ovov454</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>); however, such an NAHR event cannot explain the observed structure of the white co-twin <italic>p1-ww-T24</italic> (compare upper chromatids of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6 fig9">Figures 6F and 9C</xref>). Similarly, re-replication-induced gene amplifications (RRIGA, a mechanism that couples NAHR and DNA re-replication) can also generate chromosome structures very similar to that of <italic>P1-rr-T24</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Green et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Finn and Li, 2013</xref>). Like NAHR, RRIGA would also require a <italic>p1</italic>-proximal <italic>Ac</italic> element as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>. However, the reciprocal product of an RRIGA-generated TDD would be a chromosomal fragment that lacks a centromere and telomeres, which would be lost in subsequent cell divisions. Therefore, neither NAHR nor RRIGA can generate the white co-twin <italic>p1-ww-T24</italic>. In contrast, the actual structure of the white co-twin <italic>p1-ww-T24</italic> is exactly as predicted by the RET re-replication model shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>. The structures of the other TDDCI alleles are also inconsistent with NAHR and RRIGA: the duplicated segments are flanked by <italic>Ac</italic> on the left side and a CI on the right side (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, lower chromatid), while NAHR/RRIGA-induced duplications would be flanked by identical <italic>Ac</italic> copies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>, lower chromatid). Finally, NAHR and RRIGA generate TDDs of the same structure recurrently. In contrast, all of the TDDCI alleles we have isolated to date have different duplication breakpoints. This is consistent with their origin via alternative transposition, because the duplication endpoints are determined by the position of the transposon insertion site, which is expected to differ for each transposition event. Moreover, the RET reinsertion sites have the same characteristic features as for standard <italic>Ac/Ds</italic> transposition, including preferential insertion into nearby, hypomethylated, gene-rich regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Greenblatt and Brink, 1962</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Vollbrecht et al., 2010</xref>), and formation of 8-bp Target Site Duplications lacking sequence specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Vollbrecht et al., 2010</xref>). Taken together, our results consistently support the proposed mechanism of alternative transposition, re-replication, and repair.<fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03724.017</object-id><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>NAHR generates Tandem Direct Duplications.</title><p>All the symbols have the same meanings as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>.

The TDDs range in size from several kb to &gt;1 Mb and thus can increase the copy number of multiple linked genes and their regulatory sequences. The CIs we have discovered may be 20 kb or more in length. These are produced as a consequence of <italic>Ac</italic> transposition during DNA replication, and they exhibit a number of interesting features. First, the internal portions contain sequences that were originally flanking the donor <italic>Ac/fAc</italic> elements; the relative positions of these sequences are now switched, and they are fused together at a new junction. Because <italic>Ac/Ds</italic> elements are commonly inserted within or near genic sequences in plants, CI formation may shuffle the coding and/or regulatory sequences of the formerly flanking genes to create novel products. Moreover, the CIs are bordered by transposition-competent <italic>Ac/fAc</italic> 5′ and 3′ termini; hence, the entire CI has the structure of a macrotransposon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Huang and Dooner, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yu et al., 2010</xref>) that could subsequently transpose to new sites and increase in copy number.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Ian Baldwin (Senior editor) and 3 reviewers.</p><p>Yubin Li and Amar Klar were responsible for two of the three peer reviews of your submission and have agreed to reveal their identity.</p><p>The Senior editor and the reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and we have assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The manuscript describes a detailed analysis of an alternative transposition induced DNA re-replication in the best-studied transposon system to date, namely the Ac/Ds system of maize. A model is described of DNA re-replication mediated by the alternative transposition of Ac/fAc, which in addition to other well-documented chromosomal rearrangements caused by transposition, may have contributed to the dynamics of gene creation and genome expansion. All reviewers agreed that the manuscript was dense but well-written, and that the data supports the main conclusions of work and provides valuable insights into TE behavior. The addition of a new pathway contributing to genome dynamic by re-replication of particular chromosome regions through alternative transposition represents a significant advance in our understanding of transposon proliferation and genome evolution.</p><p>The reviewers make a number of points listed below, which if addressed would help to clarify the presentation and broaden the impact of your story. We look forward to your revision and reading how you have responded to these points in a cover letter.</p><p>1) The authors argue the generality of TDDCI in the maize genome by a previously characterized bz1-m4-D6856 allele, which was isolated by Barbara McClintock. The actual sequences of bz1-m4-D6856 allele and its progenitor line would provide more solid evidence to support the authors' arguments.</p><p>2) The authors argue about the reinsertion frequency of the excised fragment and make efforts to compare with previously reports statistically. About this issue, the reviewer has unpublished data from an enormous population and supports the lower reinsertion value as the authors present in their manuscript.

First, we requested and received seeds of the putative <italic>bz1-m4-D6856</italic> progenitor from Dr. Anita Klein, who originally published on this allele (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Klein et al., 1988</xref>). Unfortunately the seeds were very old and failed to germinate. Next we requested and received seeds of related stocks from Dr. Hugo Dooner, and these we were able to propagate; however, the results of several PCR experiments using <italic>bz1-</italic> and <italic>Ds-</italic>homologous primers were negative. This negative result is not too surprising, considering the variation in possible positions of <italic>Ds</italic>, as well as the uncertainty in identification of the actual progenitor. Moreover, the published account of the origin of <italic>bz1-m4-D6856</italic> suggests that the <italic>Ds</italic> element may have excised during or shortly after the formation of the allele. The detailed description is provided in the following excerpt from Klein, A.S., Clancy, M., Paje-Manalo, L., Furtek, D.B., Hannah, L.C., and Nelson, O.E., Jr (1988) “The mutation <italic>bronze-mutable 4 derivative 6856</italic> in maize is caused by the insertion of a novel 6.7-kilobase pair transposon in the untranslated leader region of the <italic>bronze-1</italic> gene”, Genetics <italic>120</italic>, 779-790:</p><p><italic>“The origin of bz-ml D6856 is complex (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1</italic></xref><italic>). McClintock (1952) observed that a transposable element at one locus would “spread” to adjacent loci. In the maize line she was studying, Ds, in the presence of Ac (Activator), caused chromosome breaks immediately distal to the shrunken (sh) locus. From this stock, McClintock isolated new mutable alleles of the flanking genes, C-I (dominant colorless) or Bz. The original bz-m4 allele was isolated in that study (B. McClintock, personal communication). This bz-m4 line was stably recessive for the shrunken (sh) trait. Later McClintock demonstrated that recombination between sh and bz in this stock was substantially reduced, indicating that the unstable bz-ml allele arose concommitantly with a deletion of chromosomal material in the interval between these loci (McClintock 1965; Dooner 1981). In the presence of Ac, the original bz-m4 allele formed dicentric chromosomes at a high frequency. In a subsequent generation this bz-m4 reverted to a Bz’ allele (B. McClintock, personal communication). This was unstable, indicating that a Ds element was near or at the Bz’ allele. Subsequently, again with Ac present, a gamete from a Bz’-m plant, culture #6771, mutated to an unusual dark bronze, recessive allele which also had a reduced frequency of dicentric formation. This allele was bz-ml D6856</italic>.<italic>”</italic></p><p>Revised <italic>eLife</italic> text: “This model presupposes the existence of a <italic>Ds</italic> element (the leftmost element in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>) distal to the tandem repeats in <italic>bz1-m4-D6856</italic> and its progenitor allele. No such element was reported on the original <italic>bz1-m4-D6856</italic> genomic clones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Klein et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dowe et al., 1990</xref>). Efforts in our lab to identify a <italic>Ds</italic> element in this position in <italic>bz1-m4-D6856</italic> and related stocks have been unsuccessful. However, McClintock's description of the origin of <italic>bz1-m4-D6856</italic> (as reported in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Klein et al., 1988</xref>) indicates that the <italic>bz1-m4</italic> progenitor produced a high frequency of dicentric chromosomes, while the <italic>bz1-m4-D6856</italic> derivative exhibited low dicentric frequency. Dicentric chromosome formation is a characteristic feature of alternative transposition reactions, such as RET, involving two nearby <italic>Ac/Ds</italic> elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Huang and Dooner, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yu et al., 2010</xref>). The switch from high to low dicentric frequency observed by McClintock would be consistent with excision of the “missing” <italic>Ds</italic> shortly after the formation of the <italic>bz1-m4-D6856</italic> allele.”</p><p><italic>2) The authors argue about the reinsertion frequency of the excised fragment and make efforts to compare with previously reports statistically. About this issue, the reviewer has unpublished data from an enormous population and supports the lower reinsertion value as the authors present in their manuscript. It is a bit wasteful to make big deal out of this</italic>.</p><p>We thank the reviewer for relating their unpublished data regarding reinsertion values. Per the reviewer’s suggestion we have shortened this section, while keeping the main point that the repair of broken chromatid ends is surprisingly efficient.</p><p>Revised <italic>eLife</italic> text: “Our model proposes that DNA re-replication aborts to produce chromatids terminated by broken ends, which are joined together to restore chromosome linearity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1 fig6 fig7 fig9">Figures 1, 6, 7 and 9</xref>). If the chromatid DSBs were not repaired, the cell would die and that event would not be recovered in our screen. From a population of ∼2000 plants, we isolated 16 alleles that carry a duplication and/or insertion structure. Nine of these 16 alleles (56%) have only a duplication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>), which indicates that the target site was replicated at the time of RET (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–figure supplement 1</xref>); whereas seven alleles have an insertion, which indicates the target site was unreplicated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1 fig6 fig7">Figures 1, 6 and 7</xref>). The frequency of insertion into an unreplicated target site is 7/16 (44%), which is similar to a previous estimate of <italic>Ac</italic> insertion into unreplicated sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Greenblatt and Brink, 1962</xref>). Thus the products of insertion into unreplicated target sites are not significantly under-represented in our sample, suggesting that repair of re-replication-generated DSBs is quite efficient in mitotic S phase cells.”</p><p><italic>3) Is there any commonality to the sequence context or genetic/epigenetic context of the RET insertion sites recovered?</italic></p><p>In all respects, the RET insertion sites appear to be similar to those observed for standard <italic>Ac/Ds</italic> transposition. We have included a sentence to this effect in the Discussion:</p><p>“Moreover, the RET reinsertion sites have the same characteristic features as for standard <italic>Ac/Ds</italic> transposition, including preferential insertion into nearby, hypomethylated, gene-rich regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Greenblatt and Brink, 1962</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Vollbrecht et al., 2010</xref>), and formation of 8-bp Target Site Duplications lacking sequence specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Vollbrecht et al., 2010</xref>).”</p></body></sub-article></article>
