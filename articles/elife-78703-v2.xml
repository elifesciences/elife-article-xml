While most studies have focused on the consequences of plant interspecific diversity, our mechanistic understanding of how genetic diversity within plant species affects plant productivity remains limited. Here, we use a tree species × genetic diversity experiment to disentangle the effects of species diversity and genetic diversity on tree productivity, and how they are related to tree functional diversity and trophic feedbacks. We found that tree species diversity increased tree productivity via increased tree functional diversity, reduced soil fungal diversity, and marginally reduced herbivory. The effects of tree genetic diversity on productivity via functional diversity and soil fungal diversity were negative in monocultures but positive in the mixture of the four tree species tested. Given the complexity of interactions between species and genetic diversity, tree functional diversity and trophic feedbacks on productivity, we suggest that both tree species and genetic diversity should be considered in afforestation.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Biodiversity, the richness of species in a given ecosystem, is essential for maintaining ecological functions. This is supported by many long-term biodiversity experiments where researchers manipulated the numbers of tree species they planted in a forest and then evaluated both its productivity (how much biological material the forest produced in a given timeframe) and the health of its trees. This work contributed to our understanding of forest ecology and paved the way for better reforestation approaches. The most important observation was that diverse forests, which contain several tree species, are more productive and healthier than monocultures where a single tree species dominates. However, it remained unclear what the role of genetic diversity within individual tree species is in determining productivity and health of forests.</p><p>Tang, Zhang et al. set out to improve on previous studies on tree genetic diversity and community productivity by looking at two possible mechanisms that might affect the productivity of a forest ecosystem using publicly available data. First, they looked at the diversity of traits found within a tree population, which determines what resources in the ecosystem the trees can exploit; for example, trees with varied specific leaf areas (that is the ratio between a leaf’s area and its dry mass) have more access to different intensities of sunlight for photosynthesis, allowing the whole forest to gain more biomass. Second, they considered interactions with other organisms such as herbivore animals and soil fungi that affect tree growth by either consuming their leaves or competing for the same resources.</p><p>Tang, Zhang et al. used a mathematical model to interpret a complex dataset that includes multiple parameters for each of four types of forest: a forest with a single tree species seeded from a single parent tree (which will have low species and genetic diversity), a forest with a single tree species seeded from several parent trees (low species diversity and high genetic diversity, due to the diversity of parents), a forest with four tree species each seeded from a single parent tree (high species diversity and low genetic diversity), and a forest with four tree species each seeded from several parent trees (high species and genetic diversity).</p><p>Using their model, Tang, Zhang et al. determined that species diversity promotes productivity because the increased diversity of traits allows trees to exploit more of the surrounding resources. Genetic diversity, on the other hand, did not seem to have a direct effect on overall productivity. However, greater genetic diversity did coincide with an increase in the diversity of traits in forests with a single tree species, which led to a decrease in damage to tree leaves by herbivores. This suggests that high genetic diversity in species-rich forests is likely also beneficial as herbivores are less able to damage tree foliage. As expected, in single-species forests with both low and high genetic diversity, higher soil fungi diversity was associated with a loss in productivity. Interestingly, in forests that had high species and genetic diversity, this effect was reversed, and higher genetic diversity reduced the loss of productivity caused by soil fungi, resulting in higher productivity overall.</p><p>These results should be considered in reforestation projects to promote genetic diversity of trees on top of species diversity when replanting. How genetic diversity leads to downstream mechanisms that benefit community productivity is not fully understood and future research could look at what specific genetic features matter most to help select the ideal mixture of trees to maximize productivity and increase the land’s ecological and economic value.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>BEF</kwd><kwd>functional diversity</kwd><kwd>genetic diversity</kwd><kwd>productivity</kwd><kwd>trophic feedbacks</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31870409</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tang</surname><given-names>Ting</given-names></name><name><surname>Bongers</surname><given-names>Franca J</given-names></name><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Xiaojuan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>XDB31000000</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Naili</given-names></name><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Xiaojuan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>32161123003</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Naili</given-names></name><name><surname>Liang</surname><given-names>Yu</given-names></name><name><surname>Ma</surname><given-names>Keping</given-names></name><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Xiaojuan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Younth Innovation Promotion Association CAS</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2019082</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Xiaojuan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Species and genetic diversity promote tree community productivity by increasing functional diversity and reducing herbivore damage and soil fungal diversity.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Biodiversity is essential for maintaining ecosystem functioning and nature’s contributions to people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cardinale et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Diaz et al., 2019</xref>). Ongoing biodiversity loss has received widespread concern from the international community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ceballos et al., 2015</xref>). Expanding our research focus to multiple dimensions of biodiversity helps us to better predict the consequences of biodiversity loss and prioritize the different dimensions of biodiversity in conservation efforts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cardinale et al., 2012</xref>). Whereas many studies related to biodiversity–ecosystem functioning (BEF) have focused on how interspecific diversity (e.g., the number of species) affects key ecosystem functions such as plant productivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hector et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Huang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tilman et al., 2001</xref>), relatively few have addressed the effects of intraspecific diversity (such as genetic variation within a species). Furthermore, the effects of intraspecific diversity show an inconsistent picture: genetic diversity has promoted plant community productivity in herbaceous plant communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Crutsinger et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kotowska et al., 2010</xref>) but not in forests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bongers et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fischer et al., 2017</xref>). To get a better understanding of how genetic diversity influences plant productivity in forests and thereby help guiding afforestation priorities, we need to disentangle the underlying mechanisms.</p><p>Functional trait diversity, in short functional diversity, is expected to promote community productivity because different species or genotypes with diverse traits may use resources in complementary ways and then enhance the total utilization of resources in the whole community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Diaz and Cabido, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). Thus, functional diversity, mostly quantified as the variation of species functional trait means in a plant community, has been used to explain how plant species diversity impacts plant productivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cadotte et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Diaz et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hillebrand and Matthiessen, 2009</xref>). Although genetic diversity has been shown to cause substantial trait variation within species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bongers et al., 2020</xref>), and intraspecific trait variation may have strong effects on plant productivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Des Roches et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Koricheva et al., 2018</xref>), the extent to which genetic diversity can influence tree productivity through increased functional diversity is still unclear.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Conceptual illustration of the effects of functional diversity (<bold>a</bold>) and trophic feedbacks on tree productivity (<bold>b</bold>) and the species × genetic diversity experimental design (<bold>c</bold>).</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) shows resources for plant growth or other trophic groups in complementary ways due to functional diversity: the four hypothetical species/genotypes (A, B, C, D) with different functional traits (indicated by colored leaves) are able to use a heterogeneous resource (indicated by colored segments), thereby resulting in increased plant growth or providing niche opportunities for other trophic groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Diaz and Cabido, 2001</xref>). (<bold>b</bold>) shows the mechanism of trophic feedbacks: with the increase in species diversity (SD) or genetic diversity (GD), negative feedbacks of enemies (e.g., herbivores) on tree productivity decrease due to diluted densities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Duffy, 2003</xref>) and positive feedbacks of mutualists on tree productivity increase due to increased diversity (e.g., mycorrhizal fungi; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Semchenko et al., 2018</xref>). (<bold>c</bold>) We represent tree species and genetic diversity by the number of species and seed families (all seeds from the same mother tree are defined as a single seed family), respectively. Species diversity and genetic diversity per plot were both 1 or 4, resulting in a full factorial design of species × genetic diversity. We hypothesize that the positive effects of tree genetic diversity should be stronger in tree species monocultures (Sp-mono) than mixtures (Sp-mix).</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-78703-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Trophic feedbacks, which result from the interactions of plants of different species or genotypes with other trophic groups, have been suggested as an additional mechanism underpinning positive biodiversity effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Laforest-Lapointe et al., 2017</xref>). Trophic feedbacks can enhance the performance of species or genotype mixtures either by reducing herbivore damage through enhancing the diversity of nutrient traits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wetzel et al., 2016</xref>) and chemical traits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bustos-Segura et al., 2017</xref>) or enhancing diversity of beneficial mutualists (e.g., mycorrhizal fungi; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Semchenko et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). These trophic feedbacks can be affected by plant functional diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Schuldt et al., 2019</xref>) and other factors (e.g., structural diversity; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Schuldt et al., 2019</xref>), which may provide more niche opportunities for other trophic groups. However, whereas many studies have analyzed how plant diversity influences other trophic groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Scherber et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Schuldt et al., 2019</xref>) or how trophic interactions affect plant performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Eisenhauer, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Semchenko et al., 2018</xref>), the effects of plant diversity on other trophic groups and the feedbacks of these on productivity have rarely been analyzed in combination.</p><p>In real-world ecosystems, plant species diversity and genetic diversity can hardly be expected to influence ecosystems separately (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Vellend and Geber, 2005</xref>).

Likewise, the relative extent of plant intraspecific variation in functional traits, partly due to genetic diversity, has been shown to decrease with the increase in species diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Siefert et al., 2015</xref>). Although there are few forest experimental studies in which species and genetic diversity are simultaneously manipulated, most of them only compared their relative importance on ecosystem functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abdala‐Roberts et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Koricheva et al., 2018</xref>), and we barely know their interactive effects via functional diversity and trophic feedbacks on plant productivity.</p><p>Here, we disentangle how tree species diversity and genetic diversity affect tree community productivity via the impact of tree functional diversity and trophic feedbacks.

Regarding our first hypothesis, we found that tree species diversity and genetic diversity can increase tree community productivity via increased functional diversity and trophic feedbacks as predicted. This suggests complementary resource-use and biotic niches, respectively, as mechanisms underpinning the biodiversity effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Turnbull et al., 2016</xref>). Nevertheless, compared with the effects of species diversity, the effects of genetic diversity on tree community productivity through functional diversity were weaker, whereas the effects of genetic diversity on trophic interactions were strong (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>), indicating that the mechanisms underpinning the effects of genetic diversity may in part differ from those underpinning the effects of species diversity, as we will discuss below. Regarding our second hypothesis, we found that the effects of tree genetic diversity on productivity via functional diversity and soil fungal diversity were negative in tree species monocultures but positive in the species mixture, which differed from our predictions. In the following, we discuss these results in more detail.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Tree species and genetic diversity drive tree community productivity mainly via functional diversity and trophic feedbacks</title><p>Although only species diversity but not genetic diversity was found to affect tree productivity in binary analyses, both kinds of diversity positively affected tree community productivity and trophic interactions via functional diversity according to our structural equation models (SEMs) depicted in the corresponding path-analysis diagrams (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Tree functional diversity appeared to enhance complementary resource acquisition at community level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kahmen et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Marquard et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Williams et al., 2017</xref>), which consequently enhanced tree community productivity. Meanwhile, tree functional diversity also provided more niche opportunities to benefit generalist herbivores and soil fungi, which reduced tree community productivity, as has been found for these tree species in a parallel field study nearby (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brezzi et al., 2017</xref>). It is expected that herbivory has negative effects on plant productivity via the reduction of leaf area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zvereva et al., 2012</xref>) and photosynthesis of remaining leaves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nabity et al., 2009</xref>), and via trade-offs between growth and herbivore defense (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Züst and Agrawal, 2017</xref>). The negative effects of soil fungal diversity on productivity correspond with the finding that the majority of these fungi were saprophytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app2fig1">Appendix 2—figure 1</xref>), competing with plants for resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kaye and Hart, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">van der Heijden et al., 2008</xref>). Indeed, in a related study in the same region, the diversity of saprophytic fungi had been found to decrease ecosystem multifunctionality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Schuldt et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Indirect positive effects of species and genetic diversity – remaining after accounting for paths via functional diversity – via reduced herbivory and soil fungal diversity further increased community productivity (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). This finding corresponds to previous findings that plant diversity may reduce negative feedbacks of other trophic groups by decreasing the density and diversity of specialist enemies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Duffy, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jactel and Brockerhoff, 2007</xref>).</p><p>To account for possible effects of functional diversity within seed families, we also calculated functional diversity based on measurements of individual trees (see ‘Materials and methods’). Overall, the results from this novel method still support our hypotheses that tree species diversity and genetic diversity affect community productivity via tree functional diversity and multi-trophic feedbacks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>), although compared with the typically used ‘mean’ method, the novel method includes more variation among individuals, which partly reflects responses of traits to the particular local environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sapijanskas et al., 2014</xref>); and this may have blurred the mean effects of tree genetic diversity and species diversity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). At the same time, the results indicate that the seed-family means method may bring an artifact to the effect of genetic diversity on functional diversity because of the zero value of functional diversity in genetic monocultures of single species (1.1 communities). However, excluding the path between genetic diversity and functional diversity did not affect remaining paths, indicating that the partly artificial relationship between genetic diversity and functional diversity did not distort the path model in general (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app3fig1">Appendix 3—figure 1</xref>).</p><p>Even after accounting for tree functional diversity and trophic feedbacks, we still detected a direct negative effect of tree genetic diversity on tree productivity, while the direct effect of tree species diversity was fully explained by functional diversity and trophic feedbacks. This suggests that aspects of genetic diversity that do not contribute to functional diversity or trophic interactions as measured in this study may reduce ecosystem functioning, for example, due to trade-offs between genetic diversity and species diversity. For example, it has been shown that in species-diverse grassland ecosystems, niche-complementarity between species can increase at the expense of reduced variation within species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">van Moorsel et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">van Moorsel et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zuppinger-Dingley et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zvereva et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, our experiment simulating high genetic diversity within species in mixtures might have reduced the positive effects of high species diversity. This interpretation would be compatible with the observation that in the separate path-analyses diagrams direct negative effects of genetic diversity on productivity were only found in species mixtures, whereas in the species monocultures these effects were positive (see next section). Independent of this interpretation, our finding could also imply that partly different mechanisms underpin effects of species vs. genetic diversity on ecosystem functioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barantal et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Des Roches et al., 2018</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Effects of tree genetic diversity differ between tree species monocultures and mixtures</title><p>In contrast to our second hypothesis, we found that the effects of genetic diversity via functional diversity and soil fungal diversity were negative in species monocultures but not significant via functional diversity and positive via soil fungal diversity in the species mixture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). We found that genetic diversity had positive effects on tree functional diversity and soil fungal diversity in species monocultures but negative effects in the species mixture, which supports the trade-offs between genetic and species diversity discussed in the previous section. However, the hypothesized positive effects of tree functional diversity on productivity turned negative in species monoculture. This result indicates that functional diversity may not have positive effects on the ecosystem functioning under low environmental heterogeneity, that is, species monocultures in our study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hillebrand and Matthiessen, 2009</xref>). Moreover, other aspects of tree genetic diversity seem to play an important role not only for productivity in tree species mixtures (see previous section) but also for productivity in tree species monocultures. These may include unmeasured functional traits such as root traits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bardgett et al., 2014</xref>) or unknown mechanisms underpinning effects of tree genetic diversity.</p><p>The two methods of calculating functional diversity either from seed-family means or from trait values of individual trees yielded different results regarding the indirect effects of genetic diversity on tree productivity via functional diversity. The method based on seed-family means has the advantage to be less circular, whereas the method based on trait values of individuals has the advantage of producing functional diversity values &gt;0 also for genetic monocultures of single species (1.1 communities; see ‘Materials and methods’). The weaker indirect effects of genetic diversity on tree productivity via functional diversity in the method using trait values of individuals suggest that the zero value of functional diversity in 1.1 communities in the method using seed-family means may lead to an overestimation of these indirect effects of genetic diversity in species monocultures. Nevertheless, the method using seed-family means is still useful for species monocultures with multiple seed families and for species mixtures.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In this study, we tried to disentangle the effects of tree species and genetic diversity via functional diversity and trophic feedbacks on tree community productivity in a simple experimental system with four species and multiple seed families per species. Even though this was already challenging to set up, manage, and assess by measurements on trees and soil samples, larger studies will be required to generalize results. Nevertheless, our results suggest that both partitioning of resource-use and enemy niches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Turnbull et al., 2016</xref>) between and among genotypes within tree species played a role in affecting tree community productivity. Although both tree species and genetic diversity contributed to productivity, the underpinning mechanisms differed and were harder to explain for tree genetic diversity. We suggest that trade-offs between tree species and genetic diversity may cause the latter to switch strength and direction between species monocultures and mixtures. We were not able to definitively report causality between trophic feedbacks and tree productivity because we did not experimentally manipulate herbivore leaf damage and soil fungi. However, our results do support the hypothesis that trophic feedbacks affect plant community productivity. Given the importance of afforestation projects to mitigate carbon loss and provide ecological and economic benefits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brockerhoff et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lamb et al., 2005</xref>), we strongly recommend that both tree species and genetic diversity should be considered in afforestation projects.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Study site and experimental design</title><p>This study was carried out in the species × genetic diversity experiment of the BEF-China (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.bef-china.com">https://www.bef-china.com</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bruelheide et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hahn et al., 2017</xref>). BEF-China is located close to Xingangshan, Dexing City, Jiangxi Province, China. The mean annual temperature is 16.7 °C, and the mean annual precipitation is 1821 mm. The species × genetic diversity experiment was established in 2010 and comprises 24 plots of 25.8 × 25.8 m equal to one Chinese unit of ‘mu’. Each plot was planted with 400 individual trees from a pool of four species (<italic>Alniphyllum fortunei</italic>, <italic>Cinnamomum camphora</italic>, <italic>Daphniphyllum oldhamii,</italic> and <italic>Idesia polycarpa</italic>) with the mother trees of all tree individuals known (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1—figure 1</xref>). We defined the offspring from the same mother tree as a seed family and assumed that the genetic variation was larger among seed families than within a seed family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bongers et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hahn et al., 2017</xref>). Since the offspring of a single mother tree could have been sired by different father trees, they represented anything between full- and half-sib families. Thus, in this study, we used the number of seed families per species as a measure of genetic diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bruelheide et al., 2014</xref>). Across the 24 plots, we combined species diversity (one or four species) and genetic diversity (one or four seed families per species), which resulted in four tree diversity levels: one species with one seed family (1.1), one species with four seed families (1.4), four species with one seed family per species (4.1), and four species with four seed families per species (4.4) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1—figure 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bongers et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>For each of the four species, we collected seeds from eight mother trees to allow for two replications of four-family mixtures per species. Furthermore, to avoid the effects of unequal representation of particular seed families and correlations between seed family presence and diversity treatments, we made sure that every seed family occurred the same number of times at each diversity level (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table1">Appendix 1—table 1</xref>, small deviations from the rule were required where not enough seeds from a seed family could be obtained). Due to budget limitations and the number of replicates required per single seed family, the 1.1 and 1.4 diversity treatments were applied at subplot level (0.25 mu) and replicated 32 and 8 times, respectively. The 4.1 and 4.4 diversity treatments were applied at plot level (1 mu) and were replicated eight and six times, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1—figure 1</xref>; see also Figure 1 in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bongers et al., 2020</xref>). To allow for simpler analysis, we obtained most community measures at subplot level also for the 4.1 and 4.4 diversity treatments and thereafter used the subplots for all tests of diversity effects on these community measures, including plots as error (i.e., random-effects) term for testing the diversity effects in the corresponding mixed models. In total, because one 1-mu plot could not be established due to logistic constraints, the number of subplots used was 92 (32 subplots of 1.1, 8 subplots of 1.4, 28 subplots of 4.1, and 24 subplots of 4.4 diversity treatment). Note that in biodiversity experiments lower richness levels represent more different communities and thus require more plots. For the highest richness level, where there is typically only one species composition, this same community is typically replicated multiple times, as we did here for the 4.4 diversity treatment.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Tree functional traits and functional diversity</title><p>Five leaf functional traits were measured in 2017 and 2018, including leaf area (LA), specific leaf area (SLA), chlorophyll content (CHL), leaf nitrogen content (LN), and leaf carbon content (LC). These traits can reflect the resource acquisition ability of plants and may show substantial variation not only among species but also within species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Albert et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cornelissen et al., 2003</xref>). We collected these traits on 547 individuals of all the seed families of the four species across all the species ×genetic diversity combinations (<xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table2">Appendix 1—table 2</xref>), with details described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bongers et al., 2020</xref>.</p><p>Functional leaf-trait diversity was expressed as multivariate functional dispersion (FDis), which in our case corresponds to the mean distance of individual seed families to the centroid of all seed families in the community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Laliberté and Legendre, 2010</xref>). To reduce circularity, we used the seed-family means across all species × genetic diversity combinations to calculate FDis values per subplot that did not only depend on the functional trait measures obtained in that particular subplot. Using traits measured in a particular subplot to calculate FDis for that subplot bears the risk that the measured traits reflect a response to the local environment, yet we want to use FDis as a predictor variable for the performance of that subplot. In every mixture, trait values were weighted equally across seed families and species because these were planted in equal numbers in each subplot. The mean value of FDis per species × genetic diversity level was used to fill in missing values in a few subplots with families lacking trait data (<xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table2">Appendix 1—table 2</xref>). We also calculated another frequently used functional diversity index, Rao’s Q (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rao, 1982</xref>). However, a strong positive correlation was detected between FDis and Rao’s Q in simulated data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Laliberté and Legendre, 2010</xref>) and in our study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app2fig2">Appendix 2—figure 2</xref>). Moreover, in the case of equal weighting, FDis should perform better than Rao’s Q (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Laliberté and Legendre, 2010</xref>). Therefore, we only used FDis in the analyses presented in this study. The calculations of FDis and Rao’s Q were done with the ‘dbFD’ function of the ‘FD’ package (versions 1.0–12.1) in R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Laliberté et al., 2014</xref>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.r-project.org">https://www.r-project.org</ext-link>). We further calculated FDis using traits measured on individual trees across all tree diversity treatment combinations. This alternative FDis had the advantage that it could also be calculated for subplots planted with trees of a single seed family (which had FDis values of zero when calculated with seed-family means), reflecting within seed-family functional trait diversity. The disadvantage is that this measure likely includes more response variation because every individual tree responds to a number of unknown factors in its local environment. We also calculated CWMs for the five functional traits. To obtain a multivariate equivalent, we subjected the individual traits to a varimax rotation principal component analysis (PCA) to obtain two orthogonal axes as principal-component CWMs. The two principal components captured together 64% variation of trait variation (<xref ref-type="table" rid="app2table2">Appendix 2—table 2</xref>). PC1 indicated the functional traits directly connected with growth, and PC2 indicated the functional traits connected with photosynthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app2fig3">Appendix 2—figure 3</xref>). The varimax rotation PCA was done usinh ‘psych’ R package version 2.1.9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Makowski, 2018</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Trophic interactions</title><sec id="s4-3-1"><title>Herbivory</title><p>Herbivory results from the interaction between plants and herbivores and can be recorded as leaf damage. For every individual tree, four or five damaged leaves were randomly collected and herbivory visually estimated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Johnson et al., 2016</xref>) (same 547 trees as for the traits, see above) in 2017. Thus, in this study herbivory represents the percentage of damaged area per leaf attacked by herbivores. The herbivory caused by chewers, gall formers, leaf miners, and rollers were collectively counted. Because we only collected damaged leaves in this study, we might have overestimated the herbivory per individual tree. We therefore used data from other plots of the BEF-China experiment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Schuldt et al., 2015</xref>), which did not exclude nondamaged leaves to correct the potential bias. This former study assessed herbivore damage by visually inspecting 21 leaves (7 leaves per branch) on three random branches from different parts of the canopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Schuldt et al., 2015</xref>). They used the mean percentage damage value as the overall leaf damage for each individual. We related leaf damage of corresponding tree individuals from this former study (total leaf damage) to leaf damage excluding nondamaged leaves (damage per damaged leaf) for all four species by linear regression (Pearson’s correlation = 0.86–0.96, p &lt; 0.001) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="app2table3">Appendix 2—table 3</xref>). With these regression models, we got the predicted values of herbivory for our study and used these predicted values in the final analyses. The mean value of herbivore damage per species × genetic diversity level was used to fill in missing values in a few subplots with tree individuals lacking herbivory data (<xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table2">Appendix 1—table 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-2"><title>Soil fungal diversity</title><p>Soil fungal diversity was used as a proxy of unspecified trophic interactions. To be consistent with the species and genetic diversity treatment design, soil samples were taken on subplot level for the 1.1 and 1.4 diversity treatments, but, due to feasibility constraints, on plot level for the 4.1 and 4.4 diversity treatments in 2017. In each subplot or plot, five soil samples from the top 0–5 cm soil layer were collected from the four corners and the center of each subplot or plot. The five samples were then mixed together. Each soil sample was packed with dry ice and transferred to the laboratory for storage at −80°C until DNA extraction. The total genomic DNA of the subsample was extracted using Soil Genomic DNA Kit (Tiangen Biotech Co., Beijing, China), following the manufacturer’s protocol. The DNA was extracted to perform PCR amplification. We amplified the nuclear rDNA internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) region using primers ITS3F (<named-content content-type="sequence">GCATCGATGAAGAACGCAGC</named-content>) and ITS4R (<named-content content-type="sequence">TCCTCCGCTTATTGATATGC</named-content>). We processed the raw sequences with the QIIME 2 pipeline (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://docs.qiime2.org/">https://docs.qiime2.org/</ext-link>) to cluster and assign operational taxonomic units (OTU). The fungal OTU tables were rarefied to 10,975 reads to account for the different sequencing depths. We then assigned the sequences to taxonomic groups using the UNITE database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nilsson et al., 2019</xref>). Based on the taxonomic and abundance information of every subplot or plot, the Chao1 diversity index (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chao, 1984</xref>) was used to quantify soil fungal diversity, because most fungal species in our study were relatively rare and the Chao1 index can account well for rare species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chao, 1984</xref>). The calculation of diversity of soil fungi was done using the ‘vegan’ package version 2.5–7 in R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Oksanen et al., 2019</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Tree community productivity</title><p>We measured the basal area (BA) and the height (H) of all trees in the species × genetic diversity plots in 2018 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bongers et al., 2020</xref>). Individual tree biomass (kg) was calculated using the biomass equation (H × BA × CV) of the BEF-China experiment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Huang et al., 2018</xref>) in which CV is a correction factor for stem shape and wood density. More details about the biomass equation can be found in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Huang et al., 2018</xref>. We summed the biomass of individual trees to subplot level to calculate tree community productivity (Mg ha<sup>–1</sup>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>First, we evaluated the bivariate relationships between tree diversity, trophic interactions, and tree community productivity. To determine how species and genetic diversity and their interaction affected tree functional diversity and trophic interactions, linear mixed-effects models (LMMs) were fitted with two types of contrast coding. In the first, we used the ordinary two-way analysis of variance with interaction and in the second we replaced the genetic diversity main effect and the interaction with separate genetic diversity effects for species monocultures and the species mixture (<xref ref-type="table" rid="app2table4">Appendix 2—table 4</xref>). Note that as our design was orthogonal, fitting sequence did not matter in either of the codings. However, we focused our major analysis on the second type of coding to make it consistent with our hypotheses. Main effects of genetic diversity are presented in inset panels in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>. Our second contrast coding ensured that we tested the effects of genetic diversity separately in species monocultures and species mixture, but within the same analysis. For all LMMs, we used ‘plot’ as a random variable since subplots were nested in plots. This also ensured that fixed terms whose levels did not vary within plots among subplots (specifically the four-species diversity treatments) were correctly tested against the variation among plots rather than the residual variation among subplots. LMMs were fitted in R with the ‘lmer’ function of the lme4 package version 1.1.27.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bates et al., 2015</xref>) using Kenward–Roger’s method to calculate denominator degrees of freedom and F-statistics with the lmerTest-package version 3.1.3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kuznetsova et al., 2017</xref>). To meet the assumptions of linear mixed models, the proportion of leaf damage caused by herbivores was angular transformed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Snedecor and Cochran, 1989</xref>). For the display of regression lines in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, we used linear models relating tree functional diversity, herbivore leaf damage, and soil fungal diversity for the four diversity-treatment combinations to tree community productivity (‘lm’ function in R).</p><p>Second, we fitted SEMs and displayed the results in path-analysis diagrams (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Grace, 2006</xref>) with the ‘piecewiseSEM’ package version 2.1.2 in R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lefcheck, 2016</xref>) to assess causal hypotheses about how the effects of tree species and genetic diversity on community productivity could have been mediated via tree functional diversity and trophic interactions. The initial model was constructed by the most relevant pathways derived from theoretical assumptions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). Additionally, we used separate linear regressions to assess the relationships between variables hypothesized to be related in cause–effect relationships in the SEMs. We assumed that both tree genetic diversity and species diversity could influence trophic interactions and community productivity directly or indirectly, that is, mediated via functional diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Müller et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Scherber et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Schuldt et al., 2019</xref>). Moreover, we hypothesized that tree functional diversity, herbivore leaf damage, and soil fungal diversity have direct feedbacks on community productivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Eisenhauer, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Semchenko et al., 2018</xref>). We sequentially dropped noninformative pathways if their removal reduced the AICc of the SEMs by more than 2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Grace, 2006</xref>). To detect potential distorting effects of the relationship between genetic diversity and functional diversity calculated from seed-family means, we also calculated a SEM model without the path between genetic diversity and functional diversity.</p><p>Thirdly, separate multigroup SEMs were fitted for species monocultures and mixtures since significant interactions between species and genetic diversity in the ANOVAs indicated that genetic diversity had different effects between species monocultures and the species mixtures. The initial multigroup path diagram is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>. We simplified the multigroup initial model with the same procedure as described above by comparing AICc values. For the multigroup models, we also calculated an additional one in which the path between genetic diversity and functional diversity was excluded.</p><p>Finally, to detect the robustness of our results, we used the same paths as in the above final single and multipath models to analyze the data with FDis calculated with the trait measures of individual trees.

This would be problematic since treatment plots of 1.4 have already a mix of species not just genotypes.

Your revised article has been evaluated by Detlef Weigel (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>Both reviewers find that using species family means for trait values is problematic (for example, the assigning of zero values in Rao's Q calculations seems puzzling). While you have made a case for continuing to use family means in your R1 response, we find that a new opportunity must be given to sustain using these data, and explain possible artifacts when using zero values in, for example, your SEM paths. Possible alternatives (such as a SEM without the tests/paths between genotypic diversity and FDis due to colinearity issues when using family means) should be discussed (in an Appendix?), and the Discussion should also be extended, to make it clear this is a shortcoming of your analysis.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I have reviewed this revised version of the manuscript after already reviewing the original version (reviewer 1). In my opinion, the manuscript significantly improved and is much clear now. In particular, the detailed comments of reviewer 2 must have helped to clarify the methods, which in turn helped to better understand the results and discussion. I am overall happy with the analyses and also appreciate very much the inclusion of the results with traits measured at the individual level. I understand the reason of the authors with respect to circularity, but also maintain my concerns with using species family means, that do not only eliminate the potential responses of the genotypes to the treatments (which was the goal of the authors with using species family means) but also the potential effects of the genotypes. It is basically impossible to eliminate the response of a trait without also eliminating its effect. And in this study, I think this is particularly tricky because the results turn out to be significantly different when using species family means versus individual values, with important implications for the objectives of this study. And here I am in serious doubt whether the way the authors decided to go forward is the most appropriate one. I explain this based on the key result affected:</p><p>L263ff: I find the results of negative genotype diversity effects on productivity in species monocultures puzzling. And it, in fact, only appears in the SEM and only when using the species family means of trait values but not the measured trait values in each subplot. I can't really make a conclusion out of this, but it seems weird to me, and I really wonder to what extent this is due to the assumed 0 functional diversity of genotype monocultures (1.1 communities). I can't help but think this is an artifact. Actually, the SEM with the functional traits measured on individual trees matches much better the results observed in the binary analyses, where genotype diversity doesn't have an impact on functional diversity of species monocultures nor community productivity of species monocultures (Figure 2 and its supplement 1). It seems rather that increased functional diversity in species monocultures goes along with reduced productivity (Figure 3), which is, however independent of tree genetic diversity (as there is no clear relationship between tree genetic diversity and functional diversity of species monocultures as stated above – when individual trait values are used). So, it seems to me that the negative effect of tree genetic diversity on productivity in species monocultures, as claimed by the authors, is not a genetic diversity effect but a functional diversity effect independent of genetic diversity. That would at least be my interpretation of the results.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I thank the authors for thoroughly answering all the reviewers' questions and comments. I think the present version clarifies all the points raised and shows more clarity in the design and discussion.</p><p>I am glad to read this revised version and congratulate the authors for such an impressive and interesting study that represent a step forward in our understanding of the effects of plant diversity.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.78703.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Figure 3 shows that for monocultures with one genotype there is no functional diversity, which does of course not fully reflect reality.

However, in our experiment, we hypothesized that functional diversity would be an explanatory variable that was used to explain how species and genetic diversity will affect multi-trophic interactions and community productivity. In this case, if we calculate functional diversity only based on the individuals planted in a particular subplot, trait plasticity in response to the neighborhood will be involved (see Sapijankas et al., 2014; Niklaus et al., 2017), which makes the analyses partly circular. In theory, we should use the mean trait value from common gardens to calculate functional diversity, but here we use the mean value across all the plots in our experiment to represent the realistic forest ecosystem scenery.</p><p>Lines 339–344: “To reduce circularity, we used the seed-family means across all species × genetic diversity combinations to calculate FDis values per subplot that did not only depend on the functional trait measures obtained in that particular subplot. Using traits measured in a particular subplot to calculate FDis for that subplot bears the risk that the measured traits reflect a response to the local environment, yet we want to use FDis as a predictor variable for the performance of that subplot.”</p><p>The zero functional diversity in species and genetic monoculture comes from using the mean trait value of each seed family of each species to calculate functional diversity. This method has been typically used in other studies (e.g. Craven et al., 2018; Williams et al., 2017), and we believe that it provides a proper estimation of functional diversity. However, we agree that the “real” functional diversity would not be zero even in the species and genetic monoculture, so now we have added functional diversity calculated by traits measured on individual trees across all subplots and put the results into the supplementary figures (Figure 2—figure supplement 1, Figure 3—figure supplement 1, Figure 4—figure supplement 1, Figure 5—figure supplement 1). With the “individual” functional diversity method we could calculate FDis also for subplots planted with trees of a single seed family (which had FDis values of zero when calculated with seed-family means). Overall, the results from the “individual” method still support our hypotheses that tree species diversity and genetic diversity affect community productivity via tree functional diversity and multi-trophic feedbacks (Figure 4—figure supplement 1, Figure 5—figure supplement 1). Although some effects of functional diversity disappeared or were weaker with FDis based on individuals than on seed-family means, this is understandable because FDis based on individuals includes more environmental response variation among individuals which can blur the effects of tree genetic diversity and species diversity. We added this FDis calculation to the Methods, reported the different results from the two FDis methods, and justified the weaker effects of functional diversity by this analysis in the Discussion.</p><p>Lines 354–359: “We further calculated FDis using traits measured on individual trees across all tree diversity treatment combinations. This alternative FDis had the advantage that it could also be calculated for subplots planted with trees of a single seed family (which had FDis values of zero when calculated with seed-family means), reflecting within seed-family functional trait diversity. The disadvantage is that this measure likely includes more response variation because every individual tree responds to a number of unknown factors in its local environment.”</p><p>Lines 130–133: “However, when we calculated functional diversity based on measurements taken on individual trees rather than based on seed-family means, only species diversity but not genetic diversity had effects on tree functional diversity (Figure 2—figure supplement 1), indicating additional within seed-family variation masking some of the between seed-family variation.”</p><p>Lines 140–143: “Tree functional diversity calculated using either seed-family means or individual-tree values had positive overall effects on community productivity but this effect was mainly due to an increase in functional diversity from species monocultures to mixtures (Figure 3a, Figure 3—figure supplement 1).”</p><p>Lines 164–170: “The analysis which functional diversity calculated from measurements on individual trees also showed that tree species diversity and genetic diversity affect community productivity via tree functional diversity and trophic feedbacks, although the effects of functional diversity were less pronounced (Figure 4—figure supplement 1), possibly because functional diversity calculated from individual trees included more response functional diversity (Sapijanskas et al. 2014) than did functional diversity calculated form seed-family means.”</p><p>Lines 176–178: “Similar results were found in the analyses using functional traits calculated from measurements on individual trees, except that the effects of functional diversity on tree productivity became positive (Figure 5—figure supplement 1).”</p><p>Lines 226–233: “To account for possible effects of functional diversity within seed families, we also calculated functional diversity based on measurements of individual trees (see Methods). Overall, the results from this novel method still support our hypotheses that tree species diversity and genetic diversity affect community productivity via tree functional diversity and multi-trophic feedbacks (Figure 4—figure supplement 1), although compared with the typically-used “mean” method, the novel method includes more variation among individuals which partly reflects responses of traits to the particular local environment (Sapijanskas et al. 2014); and this may have blurred the mean effects of tree genetic diversity and species diversity (Figure 4, Figure 4—figure supplement 1).”</p><p>We agree that community weighted means (CWM) of traits could also be an explanatory variable for ecosystem functioning. However, in our experiment, due to the equal representation of seed families across tree diversity treatments (Appendix 1—table 1), we assume that there must be no effects of tree species and genetic diversity on community weighted means (CWMs) of tree functional traits. Now we have calculated CWM and statistically proved that there are no significant effects of tree diversity on CWM (Appendix 2—table 1; actually, the corresponding F-values are so small that they can only be explained with the assumed constancy due to equal representation of seed families across diversity treatments).</p><p>Lines 359–366: “We also calculated community weighted means (CWMs) for the five functional traits. To obtain a multivariate equivalent we subjected the individual traits to a varimax rotation principal component analysis (PCA) to obtain two orthogonal axes as principal-component CWMs. The two principal components captured together 64% variation of trait variation (Appendix 2—table 2). PC1 indicated the functional traits directly connected with growth and PC2 indicated the functional traits connected with photosynthesis (Appendix 2—figure 3). The varimax rotation principal component analysis was done by ‘psych’ R package version 2.1.9 (Makowski, 2018).”</p><p>Lines 136–139: “Due to the equal representation of seed families across tree diversity treatments (Appendix 1—table 1), we did not find any significant effects of tree species and genetic diversity effects on community weighted means (CWMs) of tree functional traits (Appendix 2—table 1).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>L175-176: This tends to be true based on Figure 4, but not based on Figure 5. These differences suggest to me that the differences in the impact of genetic diversity on different ecosystem functions are probably not very consistent and clear. I would therefore be cautious with the interpretation of these results.</p></disp-quote><p>In this sentence, we only wanted to state the relative strength of effects of species diversity and genetic diversity which could be derived from Figure 4, which we now pointed out more clearly in the text. Meanwhile, we have further discussed the different effects of genetic diversity via functional diversity on productivity between species monocultures and mixtures in the following discussion.</p><p>Lines 190–194: “Nevertheless, compared with effects of species diversity, effects of genetic diversity on tree community productivity through functional diversity were weaker, whereas effects of genetic diversity on trophic interactions were strong (see Figure 4), indicating that mechanisms underpinning effects of genetic diversity may in part differ from those underpinning effects of species diversity, as we will discuss below.”</p><p>Lines 256–264: “However, the hypothesized positive effects of tree functional diversity on productivity turned negative in species monoculture. This result indicates that functional diversity may not have positive effects on the ecosystem functioning under low environmental heterogeneity, i.e. species monocultures in our study (Hillebrand and Matthiessen 2009). Therefore, our findings show that the different effects of genetic diversity on tree productivity between species monocultures and mixtures not only depend on the different effects of genetic diversity on functional diversity and trophic interaction, but also on the varied tree productivity consequences from functional diversity and trophic interaction on tree productivity between species monocultures and mixtures.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 5: Regarding the multi-group SEM not declared as such in the figure legend, but in the Methods (L381): I would assume that the relationships between herbivory and productivity as well as between soil fungal diversity and productivity would be the same independent of species monocultures and mixtures, meaning that those relationships could be fixed among the different groups (i.e. species monoculture vs species mixture), while all other relationships could vary between groups.</p></disp-quote><p>In our study, we hypothesized that all the paths are possible to be different between species monocultures and species mixtures.

However, we agree that the title of the section was a bit bold and thus inserted the word “mainly” in front of “via functional diversity and trophic feedbacks” (line 203).</p><p>Lines 234–242: “Even after accounting for tree functional diversity and trophic feedbacks, we still detected a direct negative effect of tree genetic diversity on tree productivity, while the direct effect of tree species diversity was fully explained by functional diversity and trophic feedbacks. This suggests that aspects of genetic diversity that do not contribute to functional diversity or trophic interactions as measured in this study may reduce ecosystem functioning, e.g. due to trade-offs between genetic diversity and species diversity. For example, it has been shown that in species-diverse grassland ecosystems niche-complementarity between species can increase at the expense of reduced variation within species (van Moorsel et al., 2018; van Moorsel et al., 2019; Zuppinger-Dingley et al., 2014; Zvereva et al., 2012).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Lines 80-84: The impact of enemies can also be reduced in a mixed community by the effects of plant trait variation, for example, higher trait variation among plants can affect herbivore performance and herbivory see: Wetzel W, et al. 2016.

This result indicates that functional diversity may not have positive effects on the ecosystem functioning under low environmental heterogeneity, i.e. species monocultures in our study (Hillebrand and Matthiessen 2009). Therefore, our findings show that the different effects of genetic diversity on tree productivity between species monocultures and mixtures not only depend on the different effects of genetic diversity on functional diversity and trophic interaction, but also on the varied tree productivity consequences from functional diversity and trophic interaction on tree productivity between species monocultures and mixtures.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Lines 188-190: Please rewrite this sentence, it is not clear what type of diversity it is referring to and some statements do not match the results.

Tree functional diversity appeared to enhance complementary resource acquisition at community level (Kahmen et al., 2006; Marquard et al., 2009; Williams et al., 2017), which consequently enhanced tree community productivity.

Is it the field as in Bongers, et al. 2020? It would be good to have the diagram here as well.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you very much for this suggestion. Now we have added a plot design diagram in the Appendix (Appendix 1—figure 1) which shows the species and seed families used in each plot. Additionally, we have added a table to better describe how many individuals of how many seed families we planted in our experiment (Appendix 1—table 1). The field is as in Bongers et al. (2020), Figure 1, which we now cite specifically in the Methods (line 314) and include here for convenience:</p><p>The side length or each plot is about 26 m (square root of 1 mu=1/15 ha), thus form the figure it can be seen that distances between plots of the same treatment were mostly more than 50 m, but distance was not controlled because treatments were allocated randomly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 268: How many families were used per plant species? If more than four were used, how were they selected for each plot?</p></disp-quote><p>In total, we used eight seed families for every species and we randomly selected the seed-family combination for different tree-diversity combinations, and made sure that every seed family occurred the same number of times at each diversity level. Now we have added this information to the Methods and a table (Appendix 1—table 1) to explain that.</p><p>Lines 309–314: “For each of the four species, we collected seeds from eight mother trees to allow for two replications of four-family mixtures per species. Furthermore, to avoid the effects of unequal representation of particular seed families and correlations between seed family presence and diversity treatments we made sure that every seed family occurred the same number of times at each diversity level (see Appendix 1—table 1, small deviations from the rule were required where not enough seeds from a seed family could be obtained).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Lines 276-279: The design is not clear. What was the replication unit, plot, or subplot? It cannot be a different one among treatments, since the scale of the replicate has to be the same to be comparable. In Bongers et al. 2020, it is shown that treatment 1.1 has the same species within the plot, and treatment 1.4 has different species within the plot. This would be problematic since treatment plots of 1.4 have already a mix of species not just genotypes. If 1.1 has the same species within the subplot but is different among subplots, then it is clear that the replication unit is the subplot, but this has to be explicitly explained.</p></disp-quote><p>As the answer to the above two questions, now we have added the plot design in the Appendix to better present the experimental design. We have different units for species monocultures and species mixtures due to budget limitations and the number of replicates required per single seed family. For treatment 1.4, the replication unit is subplot (0.25 mu).</p><p>We agree that ideally we would have wanted to grow all experimental communities in plots of 400 trees, but due to the difficulty to obtain enough seeds from a single family we used subplots. To ensure that diversity treatments were still the same at plot level, we grouped different family identities of the same species and different species identities for treatments 1.1 and 1.4, respectively. The first was to make sure we still had species monocultures per plot, which was not necessary for the second. Admittedly, it would have been better to spread diversity treatment 1.4 over more plots, but that would have required to plant subplots among the plot grid or to combine them with other treatments in neighboring subplots, and still would then not have allowed us to have diversity treatment 1.4 at plot level, a requirement which we have achieved with the current design. For testing effects of diversity treatments we of course used plot as error (random-effects term in the mixed models), so these subplots of diversity treatments 1.1 and 1.4 were not used as pseudoreplicates.</p><p>We have added more detail to the Methods, but not as much as provided in this reply as we believe it would make the description unneccessarily complicated. However, we could of course add more if requested.</p><p>Lines 314–322: “Due to budget limitations and the number of replicates required per single seed family, the 1.1 and 1.4 diversity treatments were applied at subplot level (0.25 mu) and replicated 32 and 8 times, respectively. The 4.1 and 4.4 diversity treatments were applied at plot level (1 mu) and were replicated 8 and 6 times, respectively (Appendix 1—figure 1; see also Figure 1 in Bongers et al., 2020). To allow for simpler analysis, we obtained most community measures at subplot level also for the 4.1 and 4.4 diversity treatments and thereafter used the subplots for all tests of diversity effects on these community measures, including plots as error (i.e. random-effects) term for testing the diversity effects in the corresponding mixed models.”</p><p>Lines 429–433 “For all linear mixed-effects models, we used ‘plot’ as a random variable since subplots were nested in plots. This also ensured that fixed terms whose levels did not vary within plots among subplots (specifically the four diversity treatments) were correctly tested against the variation among plots rather than the residual variation among subplots.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 277: The replication for 1.4 does not seem good enough, how is this justified? How reliable are the results for this treatment with only two plots? In addition, in Bongers et al. 2020, these two plots are shown on the same side of the land, which increases the likelihood that this is a biased result.</p></disp-quote><p>As we mentioned in the answer to the above question, due to budget limitations and the number of replicates required per single seed family, we used subplot as a replication unit for the 1.4 treatment (Appendix 1—figure 1), so here we have 8 replications for the 1.4 treatment. As we mentioned before, the plot distribution is designed to be completely random in the experiment site which is independent of the diversity treatments. Although the two 1.4 plots by chance were located only a bit more than 100 m apart, there was nothing we could do about this, and we believe that the distance was large enough to avoid biased results. As explained above, the reason for grouping the 1.4 subplots of different species in two single plots was to have this treatment also represented at plot scale.</p><p>Lines 314–316: “Due to budget limitations and the number of replicates required per single seed family, the 1.1 and 1.4 diversity treatments were applied at subplot level (0.25 mu) and replicated 32 and 8 times, respectively.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Lines 315-318: How non-damaged leaves were included? It is not clear how this regression was performed and how each variable was collected.</p></disp-quote><p>We used a data set in which all the leaves were sampled (both damaged leaves and non-damaged leaves) from the same experimental site. Then we established linear models from this dataset to relate the herbivore damage sampled from both damaged leaves and non-damaged leaves with the herbivore damage only sampled from damaged leaves. We found strong correlations of the herbivore damage results from the two sampling methods, so we used the linear models to correct the potential bias of our data which only sampled the damaged leaves. Now we have rewritten the description in the Methods section.</p><p>Lines 375–385: “Because we only collected damaged leaves in this study, we might have overestimated the herbivory per individual tree. We therefore used data from other plots of the BEF-China experiment (Schuldt et al., 2015) which did not exclude non-damaged leaves to correct the potential bias. This former study assessed herbivore damage by visually inspecting 21 leaves (7 leaves per branch) on three random branches from different parts of the canopy (Schuldt et al., 2015). They used the mean percentage damage value as the overall leaf damage for each individual. We related leaf damage of corresponding tree individuals from this former study (total leaf damage) to leaf damage excluding non-damaged leaves (damage per damaged leaf) for all four species by linear regression (Pearson's correlation = 0.86–0.96, P &lt; 0.001) (Appendix 2—table 3). With these regression models, we got the predicted values of herbivory for our study and used these predicted values in the final analyses.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 326: Were the soil samples collected at the subplot or plot level? If they were collected at different scales between treatments, it would not be something comparable.</p></disp-quote><p>As mentioned in the answer to the plot design, we collected soil samples based on the species and genetic diversity treatment-replication unit and we also used “plot” as a random factor when we tested the effects of species diversity and genetic diversity on soil fungal diversity (see above answers) to solve this problem from sampling at different scales between treatments. Now we have clarified this in the Methods section.</p><p>Lines 390–393: “Soil fungal diversity was used as a proxy of unspecified trophic interactions.

How would an ANOVA type II differ from a sequential analysis? This could be justified in the methods, but also emphasize in the results/discussion, to allow for correct interpretation.</p></disp-quote><p>Because this was a designed experiment with orthogonally crossed species and genetic diversity treatments, ANOVA type I and II yield the same results (very slight differences due to missing values). However, we used a different approach, as indicated above, to the typical two-way ANOVA with interaction. Instead of fitting genetic diversity and interaction with fitted genetic diversity separately for species monocultures and the species mixture (note that this uses exactly the same sum of squares and degrees of freedom—for further detail see above). In Figure 2 we still show the main effect of genetic richness as well. However, as we found our alternative contrast coding more biologically meaningful and used it also for the separate SEMs, we focus the analysis on this contrast coding. Of course, also these contrasts are orthogonal and thus again independent of fitting sequence. In the revised version we tried to better explain the use of this alternative contrast coding.</p><p>Lines 420–428: “To determine how species and genetic diversity and their interaction affected tree functional diversity and trophic interactions, linear mixed-effects models (LMMs) were fitted with two types of contrast coding. In the first, we used the ordinary 2-way analysis of variance with interaction and in the second we replaced the genetic diversity main effect and the interaction with separate genetic diversity effects for species monocultures and the species mixture (Appendix 2—table 4). Note that as our design was orthogonal, fitting sequence did not matter in either of the codings. However, we focused our major analysis on the second type of coding to make it consistent with our hypotheses. Main effects of genetic diversity are presented in inset panels in Figure 2.”</p><p>Lines 120–121: “Using linear mixed-model analyses, we tested the effects of species diversity and genetic diversity within species on trophic interactions and community productivity.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 1c.

While you have made a case for continuing to use family means in your R1 response, we find that a new opportunity must be given to sustain using these data, and explain possible artifacts when using zero values in, for example, your SEM paths. Possible alternatives (such as a SEM without the tests/paths between genotypic diversity and FDis due to colinearity issues when using family means) should be discussed (in an Appendix?), and the Discussion should also be extended, to make it clear this is a shortcoming of your analysis.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the positive comments on the revision. We agree that the zero values of functional diversity in genetic monocultures of single species (1.1 diversity level) can be criticized, but we also believe the mean method has the advantages we mention in cases where it is not zero by definition. We now discuss the caveats and increase focus on the new method using individual trait values to calculate functional diversity as:</p><p>“We found that tree species diversity increased tree productivity via increased tree functional diversity, reduced soil fungal diversity and marginally reduced herbivory. The effects of tree genetic diversity on productivity via functional diversity and soil fungal diversity were negative in monocultures but positive in the mixture of the four tree species tested.” (lines 41-45)</p><p>“The results obtained with functional traits calculated from measurements on individual trees showed weaker effects of genetic diversity on functional diversity (path coefficient = 0.193 vs 0.883) but did not change the significance and direction of the effects of genetic diversity on productivity via functional diversity in species monoculture. Additionally, the effects of functional diversity on tree productivity in species mixtures were positive when using functional diversity calculated from measurements on individual trees but were non-significant when using functional diversity calculated from seed-family means (Figure 5, Figure 5—figure supplement 1).” (lines 178-185)</p><p>“Using functional diversity calculated from measurements on individual trees did not change the effects of genetic diversity via trophic feedbacks, except that the effects of herbivory on productivity became non-significant from marginally significant.” (lines 188-190)</p><p>“Regarding our first hypothesis, we found that tree species diversity and genetic diversity can increase tree community productivity via increased functional diversity and trophic feedbacks as predicted. This suggests complementary resource-use and biotic niches, respectively, as mechanisms underpinning the biodiversity effects (Turnbull et al., 2016). Nevertheless, compared with effects of species diversity, effects of genetic diversity on tree community productivity through functional diversity were weaker, whereas effects of genetic diversity on trophic interactions were strong (see Figure 4, Figure 4—figure supplement 1), indicating that mechanisms underpinning effects of genetic diversity may in part differ from those underpinning effects of species diversity, as we will discuss below. Regarding our second hypothesis, we found that the effects of tree genetic diversity on productivity via functional diversity and soil fungal diversity were negative in tree species monocultures but positive in the species mixture, which differed from our predictions. In the following, we discuss these results in more detail.” (lines 200-212)</p><p>“At the same time, the results indicate that the seed-family means method may bring an artifact to the effect of genetic diversity on functional diversity because of the zero value of functional diversity in genetic monocultures of single species (1.1 communities). However, excluding the path between genetic diversity and functional diversity did not affect remaining paths, indicating that the partly artificial relationship between genetic diversity and functional diversity did not distort the path model in general (Figure 4, Appendix 3—figure 1).” (lines 244-250)</p><p>“In contrast of our second hypothesis, we found that the effects of genetic diversity via functional diversity and soil fungal diversity were negative in species monocultures but not significant via functional diversity and positive via soil fungal diversity in the species mixture (Figure 5). We found genetic diversity had positive effects on tree functional diversity and soil fungal diversity in species monocultures but negative effects in the species mixture, which supports the trade-offs between genetic and species diversity discussed in the previous section.” (lines 269-274)</p><p>“The two methods of calculating functional diversity either from seed-family means or from trait values of individual trees yielded different results regarding the indirect effects of genetic diversity on tree productivity via functional diversity. The method based on seed-family means has the advantage to be less circular whereas the method based on trait values of individuals has the advantage of producing functional diversity values &gt;0 also for genetic monocultures of single species (1.1 communities; see Methods). The weaker indirect effects of genetic diversity on tree productivity via functional diversity in the method using trait values of individuals suggests that the zero value of functional diversity in 1.1 communities in the method using seed-family means may lead to an overestimation of these indirect effects of genetic diversity in species monocultures. Nevertheless, the method using seed-family means is still useful for species monocultures with multiple seed families and for species mixtures.” (lines 283-293)</p><p>We have added SEMs without the paths between genetic diversity and functional diversity as Appendix 3 (Appendix 3—figure 1, Appendix 3—figure 2). Fortunately, the remaining path coefficients were not distorted by functional diversity and changed only little if the path from genetic diversity to functional diversity was omitted. We also added multi-group SEMs in which the path between genetic diversity and functional diversity calculated from seed-family means was excluded, the coefficients of the remaining paths also were not changed (Appendix 3—figure 2). We have included these analyses in the new version (lines 170-172, lines 190-193, lines 237 -250, lines 479-481 and lines 487-488).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>I have reviewed this revised version of the manuscript after already reviewing the original version (reviewer 1). In my opinion, the manuscript significantly improved and is much clear now. In particular, the detailed comments of reviewer 2 must have helped to clarify the methods, which in turn helped to better understand the results and discussion. I am overall happy with the analyses and also appreciate very much the inclusion of the results with traits measured at the individual level. I understand the reason of the authors with respect to circularity, but also maintain my concerns with using species family means, that do not only eliminate the potential responses of the genotypes to the treatments (which was the goal of the authors with using species family means) but also the potential effects of the genotypes. It is basically impossible to eliminate the response of a trait without also eliminating its effect. And in this study, I think this is particularly tricky because the results turn out to be significantly different when using species family means versus individual values, with important implications for the objectives of this study. And here I am in serious doubt whether the way the authors decided to go forward is the most appropriate one. I explain this based on the key result affected:</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the constructive comments on the revision. We agree that the seed-family means method is not a perfect way to show the functional variation among genotypes, especially for the 1.1 communities. However, because this is the common method used in the literature and because it has some advantages when it is not zero by definition, we would still like to use it, but now with the increased focus on the new method using trait values of individual trees to calculate functional diversity. We have extended our discussion and adjusted the interpretation by comparing the results obtained with the two methods (see the above text pieces taken from the main text in the response to the editor’s comments).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>L263ff: I find the results of negative genotype diversity effects on productivity in species monocultures puzzling. And it, in fact, only appears in the SEM and only when using the species family means of trait values but not the measured trait values in each subplot. I can't really make a conclusion out of this, but it seems weird to me, and I really wonder to what extent this is due to the assumed 0 functional diversity of genotype monocultures (1.1 communities). I can't help but think this is an artifact. Actually, the SEM with the functional traits measured on individual trees matches much better the results observed in the binary analyses, where genotype diversity doesn't have an impact on functional diversity of species monocultures nor community productivity of species monocultures (Figure 2 and its supplement 1). It seems rather that increased functional diversity in species monocultures goes along with reduced productivity (Figure 3), which is, however independent of tree genetic diversity (as there is no clear relationship between tree genetic diversity and functional diversity of species monocultures as stated above – when individual trait values are used). So, it seems to me that the negative effect of tree genetic diversity on productivity in species monocultures, as claimed by the authors, is not a genetic diversity effect but a functional diversity effect independent of genetic diversity. That would at least be my interpretation of the results.</p></disp-quote><p>In binary analyses, we did not find the overall negative effects of genetic diversity on productivity, neither in monoculture nor mixture (Figure 2a). However, we found genetic diversity had overall positive effects on functional diversity calculated from seed-family means and showed different effects between species monocultures and mixtures (Figure 2b), in part possibly because of 1.1 communities forced to have zero functional diversity. We also found that functional diversity had significant effects on tree productivity by both when calculated from seed-family means or from trait values of individual trees (Figure 3a, Figure 3a—supplementary 1). According to these binary results, we hypothesized that genetic diversity has the potential to affect productivity via functional diversity and the effects might differ between species monocultures and mixtures. So, we carried out multi-group structural equation models to test this hypothesis (Figure 5, Figure 5—supplementary 1). To show the effects of the zero value in 1.1 communities, we also calculated the structural equation model based on the functional diversity calculated by individual values. We found that the negative effects of genetic diversity on productivity in species monoculture were consistent in both methods (Figure 5 vs Figure 5—supplementary 1). According to these results, we concluded that although we did not find genetic diversity had significant effects on productivity in binary analysis, we found that it negatively affected productivity in species monocultures when we considered the indirect effect via functional diversity on productivity. Now we extended the discussion and adjusted the interpretation to make the results clearer and state the potential effects of zero values in 1.1 communities (see the above text pieces taken from the main text in the response to the editor’s comments).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>I thank the authors for thoroughly answering all the reviewers' questions and comments.
