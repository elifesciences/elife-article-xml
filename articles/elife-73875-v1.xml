Despite many years of research on Lon, only a few specific protein substrates are known in most organisms. Here, we used a quantitative proteomics approach to identify novel substrates of Lon in the dimorphic bacterium <italic>Caulobacter crescentus</italic>. We focused our study on proteins involved in polar cell differentiation and investigated the developmental regulator StaR and the flagella hook length regulator FliK as specific Lon substrates in detail. We show that Lon recognizes these proteins at their C-termini, and that Lon-dependent degradation ensures their temporally restricted accumulation in the cell cycle phase when their function is needed. Disruption of this precise temporal regulation of StaR and FliK levels in a Δ<italic>lon</italic> mutant contributes to defects in stalk biogenesis and motility, respectively, revealing a critical role of Lon in coordinating developmental processes with cell cycle progression. Our work underscores the importance of Lon in the regulation of complex temporally controlled processes by adjusting the concentrations of critical regulatory proteins. Furthermore, this study includes the first characterization of FliK in <italic>C. crescentus</italic> and uncovers a dual role of the C-terminal amino acids of FliK in protein function and degradation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Lon protease</kwd><kwd>proteolysis</kwd><kwd>cell differentiation</kwd><kwd>flagella</kwd><kwd>FliK</kwd><kwd>bacterial cell cycle</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004359</institution-id><institution>Vetenskapsrådet</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2016-03300</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jonas</surname><given-names>Kristina</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004359</institution-id><institution>Vetenskapsrådet</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2020-03545</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jonas</surname><given-names>Kristina</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001729</institution-id><institution>Swedish Foundation for Strategic Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FFL15-0005</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jonas</surname><given-names>Kristina</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100009244</institution-id><institution>Stockholm University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFO funding</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jonas</surname><given-names>Kristina</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A proteomics-based approach identifies novel substrate proteins of the Lon protease in <italic>Caulobacter crescentus</italic> and reveals a critical role of Lon in regulating flagella assembly and stalk biogenesis during the cell cycle.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Intracellular proteolysis is a critical process in all cell types that is carried out by dedicated proteases. By removing damaged and non-functional proteins, proteases are necessary for maintaining protein homeostasis, in particular under stress conditions that threaten the proteome. Additionally, proteases have important regulatory roles in precisely adjusting the amounts of specific functional proteins, thus complementing transcriptional and post-transcriptional control mechanisms. Because of their important cellular functions, human proteases are considered as promising therapeutic targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bota and Davies, 2016</xref>) and their bacterial counterparts as potential antimicrobial drug targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Culp and Wright, 2016</xref>). Hence, extending the knowledge of the substrate pools of specific proteases and the mechanisms underlying substrate selection is vital.</p><p>In prokaryotes and in the mitochondria and chloroplasts of eukaryotes, the majority of proteins is degraded by ATP-dependent proteases of the AAA+ (ATPases associated with various cellular activities) protein family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sauer and Baker, 2011</xref>). The protease Lon was the first ATP-dependent protease to be identified and is widely conserved across the three domains of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gur, 2013</xref>). Lon forms a hexameric protease complex, of which each monomer contains three functional domains: an N-terminal domain, an ATP-dependent unfoldase domain, and a peptidase domain forming the proteolytic chamber (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gur, 2013</xref>). As a heat shock protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Phillips et al., 1984</xref>), Lon is upregulated in response to protein unfolding stress, such as thermal stress, and contributes to the degradation of unfolded and misfolded proteins that accumulate under these conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gur, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gur and Sauer, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Tomoyasu et al., 2001</xref>). In addition to its role in protein quality control, Lon exerts important regulatory functions that can be traced to the degradation of specific sets of native substrate proteins involved in stress responses, metabolism, pathogenicity, and cell cycle progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Tsilibaris et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>Despite many years of research on Lon proteases, the number of validated Lon substrates is small in most organisms. Most knowledge about Lon has been obtained by studying bacterial Lon orthologs. In <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, Lon specifically degrades several stress-induced regulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Griffith et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Langklotz and Narberhaus, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mizusawa and Gottesman, 1983</xref>), metabolic enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arends et al., 2018</xref>) as well as antitoxins of toxin-antitoxin systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Muthuramalingam et al., 2016</xref>), and in several pathogenic bacteria, Lon was shown to degrade regulators of pathogenicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Joshi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Puri and Karzai, 2017</xref>), thus playing important roles in the regulation of virulence pathways. In the alpha-proteobacterium <italic>Caulobacter crescentus</italic>, the number of identified Lon substrates to date is small, however, Lon is known to impact cell cycle progression by degrading essential cell cycle regulators.</p><p>The <italic>C. crescentus</italic> cell cycle is characterized by an asymmetric cell division event and morphologically distinct cell cycle phases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Curtis and Brun, 2010</xref>). Each division yields a flagellated and piliated swarmer cell and a sessile stalked cell. While the daughter stalked cell initiates DNA replication immediately after cell division, the daughter swarmer cell must differentiate into a stalked cell before entering S-phase. Faithful progression through the <italic>C. crescentus</italic> cell cycle relies on precise coordination of the polar differentiation events that trigger flagella, pili, and stalk biosynthesis with core cell cycle events, such as DNA replication and cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Curtis and Brun, 2010</xref>). Previous work established that around one-third of all genes in <italic>C. crescentus</italic> show cell cycle-dependent fluctuations in their expression levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Laub et al., 2000</xref>). Many of the corresponding proteins have important developmental functions and peak in abundance in the cell cycle phase in which their function is most needed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Laub et al., 2000</xref>). In addition to transcriptional regulatory mechanisms, active proteolysis must occur to rapidly adjust protein concentrations to enforce these transcriptional changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Grünenfelder et al., 2001</xref>). However, only a relatively small subset of cell cycle-regulated factors with developmental functions has so far been found to be subject to proteolysis in <italic>C. crescentus</italic> and the contributions of distinct proteases in this process remain incompletely defined.</p><p>Previous work established that the ClpP protease with its unfoldases ClpA and ClpX has key roles in <italic>C. crescentus</italic> development by mediating the temporally and spatially controlled degradation of several important cell cycle regulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Joshi and Chien, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Schroeder and Jonas, 2021</xref>). In addition to ClpXP, Lon plays an important role in <italic>C. crescentus</italic> cell cycle regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Joshi and Chien, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Schroeder and Jonas, 2021</xref>). It degrades the swarmer cell-specific transcription factor SciP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gora et al., 2013</xref>), the methyltransferase and transcriptional regulator CcrM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wright et al., 1996</xref>), and the conserved replication initiator DnaA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jonas et al., 2013</xref>). Lon-dependent degradation of SciP and CcrM contributes to their cell cycle-dependent regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gora et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wright et al., 1996</xref>), while DnaA degradation by Lon ensures rapid clearance of the protein at the onset of nutritional and proteotoxic stress, preventing cell cycle progression under these conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Felletti et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jonas et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Leslie et al., 2015</xref>). Although <italic>C. crescentus</italic> cells lacking Lon are viable, they grow more slowly and show aberrant chromosome content and division defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Leslie et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wright et al., 1996</xref>), which can in part be attributed to the stabilization of DnaA, SciP, and CcrM. Interestingly, Δ<italic>lon</italic> cells exhibit also characteristic developmental defects, that is, elongated stalks and motility defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wright et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Yang et al., 2018</xref>), suggesting that Lon degrades additional substrates involved in cell differentiation.</p><p>Here, using a quantitative proteomics approach, we identified several proteins involved in the dimorphic life cycle of <italic>C. crescentus</italic> as novel Lon substrates. We studied in detail the transcriptional regulator of stalk biogenesis, StaR, and the flagella hook length regulator FliK as specific Lon substrates. We show that Lon is required to establish cell cycle-dependent fluctuations of these regulatory proteins, thereby contributing to their precise temporal accumulation during the cell cycle phase in which their function is needed. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the increased abundance of these proteins results in aberrant stalk length and motility defects. Taken together, our work revealed a critical role of Lon in coordinating cell differentiation with core cell cycle events in <italic>C. crescentus</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A quantitative proteomics approach identifies novel putative Lon substrates involved in <italic>Caulobacter</italic> development</title><p>Previous work established that Lon degrades the cell cycle regulators DnaA, CcrM, and SciP in <italic>C. crescentus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gora et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jonas et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wright et al., 1996</xref>). Absence of Lon, either in a Δ<italic>lon</italic> strain or following Lon depletion, results in increased stability and abundance of these proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–B</xref>). Conversely, <italic>lon</italic> overexpression leads to lower protein abundance of DnaA, CcrM, and SciP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Based on these results, we reasoned that it should be possible to identify novel Lon substrates by monitoring proteome-wide differences in protein stability and protein abundance in strains lacking or overexpressing <italic>lon</italic> in comparison to wild-type (WT) cells. Thus, we sampled cells from the following strain backgrounds and conditions for quantitative proteomics analysis: (1) 0, 15, and 30 min following protein synthesis shut down in the WT to assess protein stability in the presence of Lon; (2) 0, 15, and 30 min following protein synthesis shut down in Δ<italic>lon</italic> cells to examine protein stability in the absence of Lon; (3) before and after 4.5 hr of Lon depletion in a <italic>P<sub>van</sub></italic>-dependent Lon depletion strain; and (4) before and after 1 hr of inducing <italic>lon</italic> overexpression from a medium-copy plasmid. Tandem mass tag (TMT) labeling and mass spectrometrical (MS) analysis were used to detect proteome-wide differences in protein levels across these samples. We obtained signals for 2270 or 2261 proteins, respectively, in our two biological replicates and sorted the proteins with respect to four criteria (see Materials and methods for details): (1) to be more stable in Δ<italic>lon</italic> cells than in the WT after 30 min of translation inhibition, (2) to be present in higher abundance at t=0 in Δ<italic>lon</italic> cells compared to the WT, (3) to be upregulated after Lon depletion compared to non-depleting conditions, and (4) to be downregulated following xylose-induced <italic>lon</italic> overexpression compared to non-inducing conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). We identified 26 proteins that fulfilled all four criteria, one of them being DnaA. 120 proteins fulfilled three criteria, and because CcrM and SciP were in this group of proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), we considered proteins satisfying either three or four criteria as putative Lon substrates. The 146 proteins that fell into this group contained proteins from all major functional categories (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). In comparison to all detected proteins, the group of putative Lon substrates contained a lower proportion of metabolic proteins and proteins involved in core genetic information processing, whereas proteins involved in cell cycle and cell differentiation processes, signal transduction and stress responses as well as unclassified proteins showed a higher relative abundance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Notably, we did not detect FixT and HipB2 in our proteomics experiment, two other recently reported Lon substrates in <italic>C. crescentus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Stein et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Zhou et al., 2021</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>A quantitative proteomics approach identifies putative Lon substrates in <italic>Caulobacter crescentus</italic>.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) In vivo stability assays of Lon, DnaA, CcrM, and SciP in the wild-type (WT) and the ∆<italic>lon</italic> strain (LS2382).

This group included proteins involved in central cell cycle regulation, chromosome partitioning, stalk morphogenesis as well as motility and chemotaxis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Interestingly, according to previously published RNA-sequencing data, a large subset of the genes encoding these proteins are subject to cell cycle-dependent regulation and peak in their expression during a specific cell cycle phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lasker et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Schrader et al., 2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>The developmental regulator StaR is a specific Lon substrate</title><p>One of the proteins that satisfied the four criteria in our proteomics experiment most clearly was the transcriptional regulator StaR, a protein previously reported to be involved in the regulation of stalk biogenesis and holdfast production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D and F</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Biondi et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fiebig et al., 2014</xref>). Like the three known substrates DnaA, CcrM, and SciP, StaR was more stable in the Δ<italic>lon</italic> strain compared to the WT and showed increased steady-state levels in Δ<italic>lon</italic> and Lon-depleted cells, but reduced protein levels in cells overexpressing <italic>lon</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). To validate these proteomics data, we monitored the stability of StaR in WT and Δ<italic>lon</italic> cells using a StaR-specific antibody (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fiebig et al., 2014</xref>). In the WT, the levels of StaR were below the limit of detection, however, we observed a strong and stable band corresponding to StaR in the Δ<italic>lon</italic> strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), indicating that StaR is upregulated in Δ<italic>lon</italic> cells, a result that is consistent with the proteomics data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). To analyze the rate of StaR degradation in the presence of Lon, we expressed <italic>staR</italic> from a medium-copy vector to elevate its levels. In this strain, StaR was degraded with a half-life of approximately 12 min, when Lon was present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Absence of Lon resulted again in complete stabilization of StaR and increased steady-state levels, which is in line with our proteomics data, and confirms that StaR degradation depends on Lon. To directly test if StaR is a Lon substrate, we performed an in vitro degradation assay with purified StaR and Lon. This assay showed that Lon readily degrades StaR in an ATP-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Hence, StaR is a Lon substrate and no additional factors are required for recognizing and degrading StaR, at least in vitro.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>The developmental regulator StaR is a Lon substrate.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Proteomics data obtained for StaR.

Consistent with a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wright et al., 1996</xref>), we observed that the stalks of Δ<italic>lon</italic> cells are significantly elongated compared to the WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D–E</xref>). Because StaR overexpression was shown to lead to an increase of stalk length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Biondi et al., 2006</xref>), we reasoned that the abnormal stalk length of Δ<italic>lon</italic> cells might be caused by the higher abundance of StaR in these cells.

Particularly promising hits in this group of proteins were CCNA_00944 and MotD (CCNA_00945) that are encoded by partly overlapping open reading frames and showed similar changes in protein abundance and stability in the Lon deficient and Lon overproducing strains in our proteomics experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–B</xref>). While CCNA_00944 is annotated as a flagella hook length determination protein, MotD is annotated as a chemotaxis protein. According to a signature-based annotation of MotD in UniProtKB (entry A0A0H3C6R3), MotD contains a conserved Flg hook domain that is commonly present in the C-terminal portion of FliK proteins that control flagella hook length in many bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Waters et al., 2007</xref>). When we attempted to clone CCNA_00944, we repeatedly observed one additional guanosine in the cloned gene sequence that was not present in the reference genome sequence of <italic>C. crescentus</italic> NA1000, the strain that we use. This insertion, which is also present in the sequence reads of previously published RNA-sequencing data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Schrader et al., 2014</xref>), generates a frameshift that merges the CCNA_00944 gene with the downstream located <italic>motD</italic> gene, thus forming one single open reading frame, of which the 3′ portion corresponds to <italic>motD</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). This resulting gene corresponds to a single open reading frame (CC_0900) in <italic>C. crescentus</italic> CB15, the isolate from which NA1000 is derived. These observations indicate that CCNA_00944 and <italic>motD</italic> are incorrectly annotated in the reference genome of NA1000 and instead form one continuous open reading frame. Consistently, when we performed Western blot analysis with antiserum raised against the protein portion corresponding to MotD, we detected one single protein band that runs at high molecular weight (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>), confirming that CCNA_00944 and <italic>motD</italic> form together one single open reading frame.

Consistent with our proteomics data, we found that FliK abundance and stability were notably increased in Δ<italic>lon</italic> cells, consistent with FliK being a Lon substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). To investigate the sequence determinants required for Lon to interact with FliK, we expressed an N-terminally FLAG-tagged version of FliK and monitored its stability in vivo. Similar to the non-tagged FliK, 3xFLAG-FliK was efficiently degraded in WT cells but stable in cells lacking Lon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). This result led us to hypothesize that the recognition by Lon occurs via the C-terminal domain of FliK. Therefore, we monitored the stability of the C-terminal portion of FliK containing the Flg hook domain, which corresponds to the formerly annotated MotD protein. Like the full-length protein, degradation of this truncated FliK protein (FliK-C), with a FLAG-tag at the N-terminus, depended strongly on Lon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Furthermore, in vitro degradation assays showed that Lon degrades non-tagged FliK-C in an ATP-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>).

According to the MobiDB database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Piovesan et al., 2021</xref>), the C-terminal portion of FliK lists two unordered regions. We engineered FliK-C variants that lack either of these unordered regions (FliK-C∆N44 and FliK-C∆59–91) or the C-terminal part (FliK-C∆C44). In vitro degradation assays showed that deletion of the unordered regions did not influence degradation, whereas removal of the 44 C-terminal amino acids completely stabilized the protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). This result, and the fact that some of the degrons recognized by Lon are located at the very C-terminus of Lon substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Burgos et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ishii et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Puri and Karzai, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zhou et al., 2019</xref>), prompted us to determine the in vivo stability of a FliK-C variant lacking only the C-terminal five amino acids with the sequence LDIRI (3xFLAG-FliK-C∆5) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>).

Additionally, our proteomics data revealed that the levels of α-flagellins FljJ, FljK, and FljL and β-flagellins FljM and FljN, which compose the structural components of flagella, are strongly downregulated in the Δ<italic>lon</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Although a Lon-dependent effect on flagellin levels was not apparent after 4.5 hr of Lon depletion and only to a lesser extent upon <italic>lon</italic> overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>), these data point to an indirect involvement of Lon in the regulation of flagella biosynthesis. One explanation for the motility defect and the reduced flagellin levels in the Δ<italic>lon</italic> mutant might be the stabilization and higher levels of SciP in this strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gora et al., 2013</xref>), which is known to negatively affect flagellin gene expression through CtrA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gora et al., 2010</xref>). Since correct regulation of FliK levels was shown to be critical for proper flagella biosynthesis in other species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Muramoto et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Waters et al., 2007</xref>), we thought that the stabilization and thus increased abundance of FliK in the absence of Lon might contribute to the motility defect of Δ<italic>lon</italic> cells as well. To specifically study the consequences of increased FliK abundance, we overexpressed FLAG-tagged FliK, FliK-C, and FliK-CΔ5 from a medium copy vector in otherwise WT cells and assessed soft agar motility and flagellin levels. Overexpression of FliK led indeed to a reproducible reduction in swim diameter to 85% compared to the vector control strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>), indicating that elevated levels of FliK impair motility. Interestingly, while this effect was clearly exacerbated in the strain overexpressing FliK-C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E–F</xref>), it was absent in the strain overexpressing FliK-CΔ5, demonstrating that the C-terminus of FliK is critical for the FliK-dependent effect on motility. When analyzing flagellin protein levels in the different overexpression strains, we found that the motility defects of the FliK and FliK-C overexpression strains correlated with a significant downregulation of flagellin levels to 55% and 30%, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). Conversely, overexpression of the FliK-CΔ5 affected flagellin levels only mildly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>).</p><p>Taken together, our data indicate that an oversupply of FliK, which can either be caused by overexpression or absence of Lon-dependent degradation, leads to reduced motility and flagellin levels. This suggests that FliK likely contributes to the motility defects of Δ<italic>lon</italic> cells along with SciP and potentially other Lon substrates affecting flagella function that are stabilized and upregulated in the absence of Lon. Furthermore, our data revealed that the C-terminal portion of FliK is critical not only for FliK degradation, but also for its effects on motility and flagellin protein levels.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In all cells, the concentrations of specific proteins must be precisely regulated to maintain cellular functions and to orchestrate complex cellular behaviors in response to external and internal cues. This study uncovered a novel role of the highly conserved protease Lon in coordinating cell differentiation with cell cycle processes in the dimorphic bacterium <italic>C. crescentus</italic>. In this bacterium, each cell cycle phase is coupled to a distinct morphological state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Curtis and Brun, 2010</xref>). This coupling of cell differentiation with core cell cycle events requires sophisticated mechanisms that coordinate these processes in space and time. Previous work established that in <italic>C. crescentus</italic> large sets of genes are transcriptionally regulated in a cell cycle-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Laub et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">McGrath et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Schrader et al., 2016</xref>). Using a proteomics approach, we found that several proteins encoded by cell cycle-regulated genes are Lon substrates. The identified Lon substrates include important regulators and structural components required for <italic>C. crescentus</italic> development and cell cycle progression. Our results show that active proteolysis of at least some of these proteins by Lon is required to rapidly clear these proteins following a cell cycle-dependent decrease in their transcription, thus restricting their accumulation to the cell cycle phase when their function is needed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). The abundance of Lon does not change during the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wright et al., 1996</xref>) and a recent study suggested that the catalytic activity of Lon is cell cycle independent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zhou et al., 2019</xref>). However, it is possible that the degradation of Lon-dependent degradation is affected by the accessibility or functional state of Lon substrates. For example, previous work showed that degradation of both SciP and CcrM is modulated by DNA binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gora et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zhou et al., 2019</xref>), and in the case of the AAA+ ATPase DnaA, ATP binding seems to increase protein stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Liu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wargachuk and Marczynski, 2015</xref>). Future work will show if similar mechanisms modulate the degradation of the herein identified Lon substrates.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Lon ensures temporal regulation of stalk and flagella biogenesis during the <italic>Caulobacter crescentus</italic> cell cycle.</title><p>Lon specifically degrades StaR, a transcriptional regulator of stalk biogenesis and holdfast production, and FliK, a protein involved in regulating flagella hook synthesis.

Like DnaA, CcrM, and SciP, the transcriptional regulator StaR is a DNA-binding protein. It was initially identified as a positive regulator of stalk biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Biondi et al., 2006</xref>) and was later shown to regulate holdfast development by directly inhibiting the expression of the holdfast inhibitor HfiA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fiebig et al., 2014</xref>); holdfast is a polysaccharide-rich adhesin that is produced at the nascent stalked cell pole in late swarmer cells and allows <italic>C. crescentus</italic> to attach to surfaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Curtis and Brun, 2010</xref>). Stalk biogenesis and surface attachment must be tightly regulated during the cell cycle, in particular, under environmental conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fiebig et al., 2014</xref>), and our work revealed that Lon-mediated proteolysis contributes to this by regulating the stability of StaR and likely other proteins involved in this process, such as the histidine phosphotransferase ShpA and the polysaccharide biosynthesis protein CCNA_02361 that we identified as putative Lon substrates in our proteomics screen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). The gene encoding CCNA_02361 (CC_2278), which was previously shown to contribute to surface attachment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sprecher et al., 2017</xref>), shows a similar cell cycle-dependent pattern in mRNA levels and ribosome occupancy as <italic>staR</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lasker et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Schrader et al., 2016</xref>), with the highest mRNA abundance and translation rate in the swarmer state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Thus, Lon may also contribute to temporally regulating the abundance of this protein during the cell cycle.</p><p>In addition to proteins involved in stalk biogenesis and surface attachment, we identified several proteins required for flagella-mediated motility and chemotaxis as potential Lon substrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>), and investigated FliK in detail. FliK proteins are thought to function as molecular rulers that, while being exported themselves, precisely measure flagellar hook length via the N-terminal domain and mediate via the C-terminal domain a switch from export of hook protein to filament protein, once the hook has reached a certain length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Erhardt et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Minamino, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Minamino et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Moriya et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Shibata et al., 2007</xref>). Although previous work made significant progress in understanding the molecular function of this important protein in enterobacteria, proteolytic control mechanisms contributing to FliK regulation have so far not been described. Moreover, in bacteria outside the gamma-proteobacteria FliK remains poorly studied. In <italic>C. crescentus</italic>, a <italic>fliK</italic> gene has previously not been annotated, and our new data revealed that <italic>fliK</italic> corresponds to a gene that was previously annotated as two separate but overlapping genes. We demonstrate that Lon-mediated proteolysis ensures cell cycle-dependent accumulation of FliK during late S-phase, when the cell prepares for cell division by building a new flagellum and chemotaxis apparatus at the swarmer pole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). The results that overexpression of FliK results in reduced flagellin levels and impaired motility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E and G</xref>) indicate that this precise regulation of FliK abundance is critical for correct flagella biosynthesis. Based on studies in other bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Muramoto et al., 1998</xref>), we consider it possible that an excess of FliK protein causes a premature termination of hook synthesis, leading to shorter hooks, which may cause downstream effects, namely reduced flagellin levels and motility. Our observation that overexpression of FliK-C, a truncated version of FliK lacking the N-terminal domain, which is required for export in other bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hirano et al., 2005</xref>), exhibits an even stronger effect on flagellin levels and motility may be explained by a dominant-negative effect that the truncated version of FliK has over the WT. In this scenario, overexpressed FliK-C would block the normal function of native FliK, possibly by occupying binding sites on interacting proteins, for example, the export apparatus protein FlhB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kinoshita et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Minamino et al., 2009</xref>). Our result that deletion of the C-terminal five amino acids of <italic>Caulobacter</italic> FliK-C abolishes the negative overexpression effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F and G</xref>) is consistent with the finding that FliK’s export switch-inducing function depends on its C-terminal five amino acids in other bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kinoshita et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Minamino et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Williams et al., 1996</xref>). Importantly, we also uncovered a critical role of the C-terminal five amino acids of FliK for proteolytic control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>), thus, our data indicate a tight coupling between FliK function and degradation.</p><p>Interestingly, in addition to the flagella hook length regulator FliK, our data indicate that the flagella hook protein FlgE itself is regulated by Lon in <italic>C. crescentus</italic>. FlgE was among the proteins that satisfied two criteria in our proteomics approach, and we verified by Western blot analysis that FlgE degradation partly depends on Lon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). This finding is also consistent with previous work showing that Lon degrades FlgE in <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arends et al., 2018</xref>), and reinforces the previously made notion that precise regulation of the cellular concentrations of FlgE as well as FliK is an important requirement for the correct temporal order of flagella assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Inoue et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>In several other bacteria, including important human pathogens, Lon has been linked to flagella-mediated motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Ching et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Clemmer and Rather, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fuchs et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rogers et al., 2016</xref>). In many of these cases the nature of substrates mediating the observed Lon-dependent effects on motility remains unknown. However, in <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic>, it was shown that Lon specifically degrades the master regulator of flagellar biosynthesis SwrA by a mechanism requiring the adaptor SmiA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mukherjee et al., 2015</xref>). In contrast to SwrA, both StaR and FliK are robustly degraded by Lon in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). While these data suggest that no adaptors or other accessory proteins are required to mediate the interaction between these proteins and Lon, it is possible that additional factors exist that modulate the rate of Lon-mediated proteolysis of these proteins in response to specific conditions.</p><p>In conclusion, our work provides new insights into the cellular roles of Lon and emphasizes the importance of proteolysis in adjusting the amounts of regulatory proteins involved in critical cellular processes, including cell differentiation and cell cycle progression. Importantly, in addition to StaR and FliK our work identified many other proteins as putative Lon substrates and the precise role of Lon in the regulation of these proteins will be worthwhile to investigate in detail in future studies. Furthermore, our work highlights quantitative proteomics using isobaric mass tags as a powerful approach for the identification of novel protease substrates that could be exploited to identify candidate substrates under diverse growth conditions, in different species or of other proteases.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Gene (<italic>Caulobacter crescentus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>fliK-C</italic>;

The Lon protease, a component of the protein degradation machinery, is conserved in all three domains of life. Yet its protein substrates remain poorly characterised. Here the authors present a proteomic-based approach to the discovery of such substrates in the model bacterial organism <italic>Caulobacter crescentus</italic>. Two substrates have been characterised in considerable detail, highlighting Lon's role in bacterial physiology.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.73875.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Evidence, reproducibility and clarity (Required)):</p><p>The Lon protease is highly conserved across 3 domains of life, yet in most organisms very few substrates are known. In this study, the authors build on observations of Lon-dependent protein stability modifications to set up a proteomics-based screen for new Lon substrates in the model bacterium <italic>Caulobacter crescentus</italic> (in which only 3 substrates had been identified so far). They focus the rest of their work on validating and characterising further 2 Lon substrates, StaR (a transcriptional regulator important for stalk biogenesis) and FliK (a regulator of flagellar hook assembly). They were able to confirm that these two proteins are Lon substrates, both in vivo and in vitro (the latter showing that the effect of Lon on the levels of these proteins is not an indirect effect). They could also identify portions of these substrates that are required for Lon-mediated degradation. In the case of FliK, they found that the last 5 residues at the C-terminus of the protein are needed for Lon-dependent degradation and are also important for the effect of FliK on flagellins amounts in the cell. Along the way, they corrected a misannotation of the ORF encoding that protein. This suggest a hypothesis for how the Lon-dependent degradation of FliK might lead to flagellin misregulation, therefore affecting bacterial motility. In the case of StaR, the authors show that the stalk length defects previously observed in the ∆lon mutants are attributed to elevated levels of StaR during the cell cycle. Overall, this is a carefully conducted study and a clear manuscript. The text and figures are easy to understand and the story flows. The abstract and introduction are engaging for a broad audience.</p><p>Major comments:</p><p>The authors suggest the possibility that cell-cycle-dependent Lon-mediated degradation of Lon substrates might depend on their functional state, such as their DNA-bound state. This is a very attractive hypothesis considering that the 3 previously identified Lon substrates in Caulobacter are DNA-binding proteins, as well as StaR that they identified here as another Lon substrate. In the discussion, the authors also mention the possibility of accessory proteins to regulate Lon activity. However, I miss the information about Lon protein levels during a (synchronized) cell cycle (either a ref to published data or a new experiment), as this might be constitute another factor for cell cycle regulation and contribute to understanding how Lon can impact protein levels of its substrates in a cell-cycle dependent manner.</p></disp-quote><p>According to a previous study by Wright et al. 1996, Lon levels do not change in a cell cycle-dependent manner. As the reviewer suggested, we have added this information to the discussion in l. 329-335.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Related to this, the authors refer to a paper showing that Lon catalytic activity does not seem to change during the cell cycle, in the discussion part, but this could be developed a bit and presented earlier in the introduction.</p></disp-quote><p>In this mentioned study by Zhou et al. 2019, it was shown that Lon-dependent degradation of a constitutively expressed model substrate was not affected by the cell cycle phase, which led to the conclusion that Lon activity is cell cycle independent. We have modified the section about this previous work and also added a sentence to mention that future work will be dedicated to mechanisms regulating the degradation of the newly identified substrates. Given that our study was primarily focused on the identification of new Lon substrates and their contributions to Lon-dependent phenotypes, we think this information is better placed in the discussion than in the introduction.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Finally, in their legend of the model figure (Figure 6), the authors suggest that the Lon protease acts on its substrates when their expression level drops. Do the authors imply some sort of stoichiometry at play between Lon and its substrates that would determine when Lon will have an overall impact on their protein levels, or do they consider a more complex mechanism? It would be interesting to discuss this a bit more (I understand that going in this direction experimentally would be another story, and not required to support the data shown here).</p></disp-quote><p>Based on the reviewer’s comment, we realized that the figure legend might have been misleading. We do not think that Lon only acts on these substrates when their expression levels drop, but rather that Lon-mediated proteolysis in combination with regulated transcription ensures rapid clearance of the proteins. We have modified the text of this figure legend to enhance clarify (l. 1092).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor comments:</p><p>- Figure 1E: Optional: It might be informative to add the level of enrichment of these categories compared to the whole proteome content.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. In the new version of our manuscript, we included, for comparison, a graph to Figure 1E that shows how all detected proteins sort to the different functional categories. To fit both graphs into the main figure, we replaced the pie chart with stacked bar graphs. We have also modified the text (l. 125-130) to emphasize the comparison of protein factions between whole proteome content and the pool of Lon substrates.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Line 193: the ∆staR∆lon mutant phenocopies the ∆staR single mutant regarding stalk length.

They show degradation in vivo only (Figure 4G).</p></disp-quote><p>We did not test the degradation of the FliK-C∆5 mutant in vitro. However, based on our in vivo stability data of this mutant and our in vitro data of the FliK-CΔC44 mutant (which shows complete stabilization), we expect this mutant to be stable.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Line 286: at this point, I would consider that the authors have shown misregulation of flagellin protein levels, not flagellin expression (transcriptional).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that it is better to refer to “flagellin protein levels” rather than “flagellin expression” and changed the wording accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Figure 5D: results from the three different lon mutant strains seem contradicting, as Lon deletion and Lon depletion have opposite effects on flagellins protein levels, and Lon overproduction gives results similar to Lon depletion. Could it be that -van and +van labels were inadvertently swapped?</p><p>If yes, please correct.</p><p>If not:</p><p>While the authors appropriately use the term &quot;misregulated&quot; to describe the flagellins in the various lon mutants, the absence of comment on this discrepancy at that place in the text might bring confusion about their interpretation of these results. Adding a clarification here might also help introducing more clearly the experiments that come next.</p></disp-quote><p>The Lon-dependent effect on flagellin levels is indeed not apparent in the Lon depletion strain and only to a lesser extent in the Lon overexpression strain. Although we cannot fully explain this difference between the ∆<italic>lon</italic> strain and the conditional Lon strains at this point (see also our response to reviewer 4), we still think that the flagellin data, along with the motility data, support an indirect involvement of Lon in flagella regulation. As the reviewer suggested, we have described the flagellin data more explicitly in the text. Based on the comments by reviewers 3 and 4, we have also restructured this section to enhance clarity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Related to this, at lines 303-304 (Figure 5F-G), the authors conclude that the reduced flagellin levels and motility defects of ∆lon can at least in part be attributed to the stabilisation of FliK in these cells. Here as well, it might be worth giving a few words on why Lon depletion data (Figure 5D) do not fit with this idea.</p></disp-quote><p>In our new version we have improved the section describing the link between FliK, Lon and motility (see comments below). With these changes we hope that we satisfy this point by reviewer 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Figure 5E: please clarify whether a specific a-flagellin was monitored here or all of them.</p></disp-quote><p>The antiserum that we used detects all flagellins. We have modified the text and added a reference to indicate the source of this antibody.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Figure 5E: how do the authors explain that FliK-C overproduction has a stronger effect on a-flagellin levels than the full-length FliK (as both are supposed to be able to interact with FlhB – cfr their hypothesis for the importance of the last 5 aa at lines 292-294).</p></disp-quote><p>It is indeed striking that overexpression of FliK-C results in a stronger phenotype than overexpression of the full length FliK protein. We consider it possible that the truncated version of FliK has a dominant negative effect over the wild type. In this scenario, overexpressed FliK-C would block the normal function of native FliK, possibly by occupying binding sites on interacting proteins, such as the export apparatus protein FlhB (Kinoshita et al. 2017). We have added a paragraph to the discussion in which we discuss this possibility (l. 371-383)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Methods: could the authors explain how they chose the 1.1 or 1.05 ratios (lines 526-534), which may seem quite low?</p></disp-quote><p>The main reason for these low thresholds was the low dynamic range of our proteomics data that is due to technical aspects of the TMT-labeling approach as well as our experimental conditions. Even the well-studied substrates, DnaA, SciP and CcrM, that we used as positive controls, showed only small fold changes (1.1-1.7 fold) in the different strain comparisons. Because we did not want to miss promising Lon substrates when setting our filters for the individual conditions, we decided to choose the low thresholds of 1.1 in the <italic>lon</italic> deletion and depletion experiments and 1.05 in the stability assay and overexpression experiment (in these latter experiments the dynamic range was even smaller due to the early time points that we used).</p><p>Importantly, to filter out the false positives that may have passed these low thresholds in the individual conditions, we applied the additional requirement that at least three of the thresholds needed to be met in order to consider a protein a putative Lon substrate. With this multi-layered filtering approach, we were able to identify 146 proteins that included the known substrates DnaA, SciP and CcrM as well as the validated new substrates StaR and MotD/CCNA_00944. Based on these results we are confident that our group of putative Lon substrates contains a high rate of true Lon substrates. Nevertheless, we think it is important to perform follow-up experiments with the candidates generated in our study. For this reason, we were careful to call unvalidated hits “putative Lon substrates”. Furthermore, we have presented our proteomics data in a transparent and comprehensive way in dataset 1 that will allow other researchers to carefully evaluate Lon-dependent effects on other proteins of interest.</p><p>Based on this comment and the comments by reviewer 2 we have added some more explanation and details to the description of our proteomics data analysis in the Methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Significance (Required)):</p><p>The Lon protease is highly conserved across 3 domains of life, yet in most organisms very few substrates are known. This work advances the fields of protein homeostasis / bacterial cell biology by identifying new substrates of Lon, using the bacterium <italic>Caulobacter crescentus</italic> (a model for bacterial cell cycle control, development and differentiation) using an interesting proteomic approach. Two of these substrates are characterized further, StaR and FliK. This work certainly highlights yet another layer of sophistication in the complex cell cycle control mechanisms in <italic>Caulobacter crescentus</italic>. While here the authors present Lon as an important factor for regulating/coordinating cell cycle events, how exactly Lon-mediated degradation can be cell-cycle regulated in <italic>Caulobacter crescentus</italic> (at least for the substrates characterized in this study) is an important question that future studies will need to address.</p><p>In my opinion, the audience will include researchers involved in protein homeostasis (whether working directly on Lon or on other protein degradation/stability systems), bacteriologists (including the broad field of cell cycle regulation), and of course more specifically all researchers working on <italic>Caulobacter crescentus</italic>.</p><p>My field of expertise is bacterial cell biology in general, including bacterial cell cycle control, intracellular processes, live microscopy imaging and protein localisation in <italic>Caulobacter crescentus</italic> and other species.

Among candidate protease substrates revealed by large proteomic datasets, the authors focused on the developmental regulator StaR and the flagella hook length regulator FliK as direct Lon substrates. With a number of elegant follow-up experiments, their findings established a critical role of Lon in coordinating developmental processes with cell cycle progression. Overall, this work is carefully designed and well performed. The reviewer would recommend its publication upon addressing a few minor issues, which are mostly associated with the quantitative analysis of proteomics data.</p><p>1. Typically three biological replicates would be needed for proteomic experiments, thus permitting statistical analyses of differentially regulated proteins.</p></disp-quote><p>We are aware that two biological replicates are not sufficient to do sophisticated statistical analyses. Therefore, we did not perform a more in-depth analysis that would provide statistical significances on the observed changes. Instead, we treated the proteomics results as a list of potential substrate candidates that provide the basis for rigorous further investigation and validation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Line 524, some proteins are only detected in one replicate and should not be used for quantitative analyses. Given that only two replicates were considered, it is important to stay on the safe side and control the rate of false positives.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that it is important to exclude false positives, and our approach to consider only proteins as putative Lon substrates that satisfied a combination of different criteria helped us certainly to do so. Our decision to include also proteins that were detected in only one of the replicates was taken not to miss any promising Lon substrate candidates. Note that for example CCNA_00945, i.e., MotD, which turned out to correspond to FliK-C, one of the validated new Lon substrates, was detected only in one of the replicates. We also want to stress that one replicate in the proteomics analysis included in fact data points for three independent strain comparisons (1. WT/∆<italic>lon</italic> stability and steady state levels, 2. Lon depletion, depleted vs. non-depleted, 3. Lon overexpression, induced vs. uninduced). Comparing the results from these different experiments against each other gave us good indications regarding the validity of our data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Line 526, the cutoff of the protein ratio is 1.1 (or 1.05 in some cases), which is way too low to tease out the altered proteins……The author should apply the threshold of 1.5 at least.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see our response to the last comment by Reviewer #1, in which we have explained why we use these low threshold ratios in our data analysis. Applying a threshold ratio of 1.5 would exclude essentially all proteins from our list of putative Lon substrates including the known substrates DnaA, SciP, and CcrM and the validated substrates StaR, MotD, CCNA_00944. Hence, a threshold of 1.5 was not appropriate for our dataset.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. When reporting protein fold changes (in the supplemental dataset), two decimals are sufficient. The authors used eight decimals, which do not make any sense.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and have changed the column type to “Number” and set the amount of shown decimals to two decimal places, in order to preserve the full numbers while increasing readability.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Significance (Required)):</p><p>The findings should add significantly to our growing knowledge about the Lon protease, as well as the regulation of critical biological processes by intracellular proteolysis.</p><p>Reviewer #3 (Evidence, reproducibility and clarity (Required)):</p><p>In this work, the authors use a combination of proteomics to identify novel Lon substrates in the bacterium <italic>Caulobacter crescentus</italic>. They focus their search on substrates involved in cell differentiation and identified two new Lon substrates, StaR and FliK, which they show are degraded in a Lon-dependent manner in vivo and are directly proteolyzed by Lon in vitro as well. The authors go on to show that these substrates seem to be recognized by Lon from their C-termini and that Lon-mediated degradation of these substrates allows them to oscillate during the cell cycle. Finally, the authors link misregulation of these substrates in cells lacking Lon with defects in stalk biogenesis and motility. The authors also take the extra effort to clarify the annotation of the fliK gene, which is appreciated. Overall, this is a very strong manuscript, with some concerns as raised below.</p><p>1. The authors should explicitly state on line 188-191 that overexpression of StaR was shown to increase stalk length (Biondi, et al. 2006) as this is a key premise for their model that stabilization of StaR explains in the increased stalks of ∆lon. As written, it is unclear that StaR has been previously shown to be a positive inducer of stalk length.</p></disp-quote><p>We completely agree with this point and have modified the text to mention more explicitly that <italic>staR</italic> overexpression causes stalk elongation and that our experiment is based on this finding (l. 191).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>On a related note, the implication of the model is that o/exp of StaR in a ∆lon would not increase stalk length. Is that true?</p></disp-quote><p>According to our model, Lon regulates stalk length via StaR, which makes it unlikely that <italic>lon</italic> deletion would diminish the effect of StaR overexpression. Rather, we consider it possible that <italic>staR</italic> overexpression in ∆<italic>lon</italic> cells would lead to even stronger StaR accumulation, which in turn might be reflected in even longer stalks. Because we think that this experiment is not really needed to support the main conclusions of our paper, we have not included it in our study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The authors show convincing data that FliK is a Lon substrate. However, the data tying FliK stabilization to motility defects in a Δlon strain is not as compelling, especially as motility in this media is a combination of cell growth, division, and actual motility. Ideally, the authors could show that flagellar function itself is affected by using chemotaxis assays or something similar. If this cannot be experimentally addressed, then there should be a clear discussion as to the reservations with interpreting these swimming assays in light of the combination effects that change growth.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that the swim diameters in low percentage agar are likely to be affected by changes in growth rate and cell division rate. For this reason, we decided to also include the quantification of flagellin levels in the different strain backgrounds, as we thought that the observed misregulation of flagellin levels further indicates an indirect involvement of Lon in flagella regulation. However, we agree that the limitations of the motility assays should be mentioned in our manuscript and have added a sentence in l. 283 to indicate that growth and division defects may contribute to reduced motility.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Why did the authors not determine if deletion of fliK could reverse ∆lon motility defects similar to that shown for StaR?</p></disp-quote><p>Studies in other bacteria have shown that FliK is an essential regulator of motility that is critical for proper hook synthesis and filament protein secretion. The deletion of <italic>fliK</italic> or absence of functional FliK leads to elongated hooks without attached filament structure, i.e., to an immotile polyhook phenotype (e.g.<italic>,</italic> Muramoto et al. 1998, Eggenhofer et al. 2006). We consider it likely that deletion of <italic>fliK</italic> in <italic>Caulobacter</italic> will have a similar effect. Therefore, we do not expect to see a reversion of the motility defects when knocking out <italic>flik</italic> in a ∆<italic>lon</italic> strain.</p><p>To studying the link between Lon and FliK, we decided to analyze the consequences of FliK overexpression in otherwise wild type cells, thus mimicking the stabilization and higher abundance of FliK that occurs in ∆<italic>lon</italic> cells, while eliminating the effect of Lon on other substrates. Our data indicate that increased FliK abundance has a negative effect on motility and highlights the importance of precisely regulating FliK levels.</p><p>The case of StaR is different: though it is a positive regulator too, it is not essential for stalk biogenesis. The stalks of ∆<italic>staR</italic> cells are shorter than WT stalks but they are not completely absent.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. We found it surprising that there was not more description of how stabilization of SciP (a known Lon substrate) could be contributing to the flagella phenotypes, given that it seems to directly repress expression of many flagella genes. It seems likely that overabundance of SciP underlies why FliK stabilization might only partially explain the ∆lon motility defects.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that stabilization of SciP in <italic>∆lon</italic> cells likely contributes to the motility phenotype. As the reviewer suggested, we discuss this idea more explicitly in the new version of our manuscript (l. 289-292).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. In Figure 5C, the quantification of the ∆lon swim diameter should also be shown, so that it can be compared with those diameters shown in F and G, especially as the ∆lon swim diameter seems much smaller.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added the quantification including statistical analysis of the relative swim diameters to Figure 5C and modified the figure legend accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>There also should be some statistical treatment of the measurements in F and G to show they are different.</p></disp-quote><p>We have modified the graphs of Figure 5E and F (formerly Figure F and G) to include the results of the statistical analysis (see also figure legends). For consistency, we have also added statistical analysis of the data displayed in Figure 5G (formerly Figure 5E).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Finally, why were the panels in F and G taken at different days of growth?</p></disp-quote><p>The experiments shown in panels 5E and F (formerly Figure 5F and G) were not conducted side by side, hence we happened to photograph the plates after slightly different incubation times (5 or 6 days of incubation at 30°C). Both experiments include a vector control used for normalization, and the relevant experimental samples to allow comparisons and thus can stand for themselves.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. We found the connection to α and β flagellin levels in Figure 5 confusing. The authors reason that FliK overabundance reduces flagellin levels but in Figure 5D, the authors show that while flagellin levels decrease in a Δlon strain (which is likely also due to SciP stabilization as described above) this is not the case for the Lon depletion strain which would presumably have elevated FliK levels as well. At a minimum, this should be pointed out and discussed in the text.</p></disp-quote><p>As explained in our responses to reviewer 1, we have improved and restructured the text describing the data shown in Figure 5D to better explain the link between FliK, flagellins, Lon and motility.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7.

To improve our paper, we have made some larger text changes to this section and have also added a new paragraph to the discussion, in which we explain the FliK and FliK-C overexpression effects. Finally, we believe that the discovery and initial characterization of a FliK protein potentially functioning as a hook length regulator in <italic>Caulobacter</italic> is of high relevance.

Here the contribution is that StaR is regulated at the level of stability by Lon and that the StaR accumulation profile during the cell cycle (in G1 phase) matches that of its transcriptional profile (reported previously), simply because StaR is unstable protein and that this instability is mediated by Lon. If StaR levels are elevated by preventing its degradation, then cells have longer stalks. However, despite this causality,there is no new insight on StaR function in this study. StaR overexpression defects have been described before, and this work only shows that such overexpression can also arise by interfering with degradation.</p></disp-quote><p>The main goal of our study was to identify novel Lon substrates and to study the role of Lon in regulating these proteins in order to gain molecular insights into the general mechanisms by which Lon impacts critical cellular processes such as cell differentiation and development.

The two first panels of figure 5D appear inconsistent regarding the abundance of flagellins (in panel 2: why are the flagellin levels higher in Δ-lon cells harboring Pvan-lon in the absence of inducer).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the discrepancy between the <italic>∆lon</italic> and Lon depletion data is unexpected and at this point we can only speculate about the underlying reasons. Given that Lon affects flagellin protein levels most likely indirectly, it is possible that the time point of 4.5 hours that we chose in our depletion experiment was too short to detect an effect on flagellin levels. Despite this apparent inconsistency, we still think that the altered flagellin levels in the <italic>∆lon</italic> and <italic>lon</italic> overexpression strains support an indirect role of Lon in regulating flagella-based motility. In the new version of our manuscript, we describe the flagellin data in more detail.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>There is no null phenotype of FliK reported and the observed effect on flagellins could simply arise from a block of secretion caused by the absence of Lon which feeds back on flagellin expression. These effects are well known.</p></disp-quote><p>We completely agree that the changes in flagellin levels are likely caused by indirect effects that arise from problems in secretion. In the new version of our manuscript, we discuss this possibility in the discussion (l. 371-373).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It is also not clear that a 50% reduction in flagellins will block motility to the extent seen here or if this is due to other effects of Lon.

Can flagellin overexpression restore motility and what are the effects of deleting fliK also in the Lon mutant background?</p></disp-quote><p>The stabilization of FliK in <italic>∆lon</italic> cells is unlikely to be the only cause of the motility defect of these cells. As explained in our responses to reviewer 3, we think that stabilization of SciP and potentially other Lon substrates with functions in flagella assembly / regulation likely contribute to this phenotype. In our new version of this manuscript, we mention this possibility more explicitly in l. 289-292 and l- 309-310. We have also restructured the text dealing with this aspect to improve clarity.</p><p>Because we think that the altered flagellin levels in the FliK overexpression strains are an indirect consequence of defects during the flagella assembly process (i.e.<italic>,</italic> premature termination of hook length and secretion problems), we consider it unlikely that flagellin overexpression would restore motility in a ∆<italic>lon</italic> mutant.

FliK is cell cycle regulated, but this may again arise from temporal control at the level of synthesis of an unstable protein that is constitutively degraded by Lon.</p></disp-quote><p>We disagree that our work “only shows that FliK is degraded by Lon”. Our work is the first study describing a FliK protein in <italic>Caulobacter</italic> and provides an important first characterization of this protein: we show that it accumulates in a cell cycle phase-specific manner and that Lon is required for this. Furthermore, our detailed mutational analysis in combination with the study of FliK-dependent phenotypes uncovered a critical dual role of the C-terminus of FliK in Lon-dependent degradation and FliK function. We agree that our study raised many new questions regarding this interesting protein. However, answering all these questions would certainly go beyond the scope of this manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Why FliK needs to be degraded seeing that it is likely a protein that is exported by the flagellar system and whether this export and its function is important remain unclear.</p></disp-quote><p>These are indeed interesting and very relevant points. It is noteworthy that the cytoplasmic abundance of many other secreted flagella components is precisely regulated by transcriptional, translational and in some cases by proteolytic control mechanisms. It has been proposed by others (e.g., Bonifield et al. 2000, J Bact) that precise regulation of secreted flagella components ensures correct order of secretion and may help to avoid competition between secreted flagella subunits during the assembly process. It will be interesting to address these hypotheses in future studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It is also unclear how FliK would regulate flagellins and whether this can impact motility.</p></disp-quote><p>As explained above, we think that the effect of FliK on flagellin levels is a consequence of improper secretion that feedbacks to flagellin expression levels. Our data showing that FliK and FliK-C overexpression results in reduced swimming, demonstrate that FliK impacts motility. Based on FliK studies in <italic>Salmonella</italic> (e.g., Muramoto et al. 1998, JMB), we think that the main reason for this result is the premature termination of hook synthesis in the presence of excess FliK, leading to shorter hooks, which may cause downstream effects, i.e., reduced flagellin levels and motility. We have added a new paragraph to our discussion (l. 371-385) in which we discuss this possibility.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In sum, Lon constantly degrades proteins, also those that are cell cycle regulated at the level of transcription/synthesis. Lon may simply fulfill a passive role in promoting the instability of many cytoplasmic proteins, including those that are cell cycle regulated. Thus, it may serve as a factor that renders a selection of cellular proteins unstable, perhaps to ensure that their presence in the cell cycle is determined when they are transcribed, but I think this global role is not sufficiently developed here.</p></disp-quote><p>This is the essence of the model we describe in this manuscript and that is illustrated in Figure 6, however we want to emphasize that, according to our data, Lon does not “simply fulfill a passive role” but has a crucial active role in establishing the fluctuation in levels of important proteins encoded by cell cycle regulated genes. We show that in the absence of Lon-dependent proteolysis, the cell cycle-dependent transcriptional control of important cell differentiation proteins becomes completely ineffective (Figure 3C, Figure 5B), thus highlighting the importance proteolysis in complementing gene regulatory mechanisms. We have demonstrated this concept by focusing on the newly identified Lon substrates StaR and FliK. Investigating additional putative Lon substrates to establish a more “global role” for Lon will be an interesting task for the future, but would in our eyes go beyond the scope of this manuscript.</p></body></sub-article></article>
