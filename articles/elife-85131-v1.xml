known as <italic>GPR110; PGR19; KPG_012; hGPCR36</italic>) is an oncogene. The evidence is mainly based on high expression of <italic>Adgrf1</italic> in numerous cancer types, and knockdown <italic>Adgrf1</italic> can reduce the cell migration, invasion, and proliferation. <italic>Adgrf1</italic> is, however, mostly expressed in the liver of healthy individuals. The function of <italic>Adgrf1</italic> in liver has not been revealed. Interestingly, expression level of hepatic <italic>Adgrf1</italic> is dramatically decreased in obese subjects. Here, the research examined whether <italic>Adgrf1</italic> has a role in liver metabolism.</p></sec><sec id="abs2"><title>Methods:</title><p>We used recombinant adeno-associated virus-mediated gene delivery system, and antisense oligonucleotide was used to manipulate the hepatic <italic>Adgrf1</italic> expression level in diet-induced obese mice to investigate the role of <italic>Adgrf1</italic> in hepatic steatosis. The clinical relevance was examined using transcriptome profiling and archived biopsy specimens of liver tissues from non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) patients with different degree of fatty liver.</p></sec><sec id="abs3"><title>Results:</title><p>The expression of <italic>Adgrf1</italic> in the liver was directly correlated to fat content in the livers of both obese mice and NAFLD patients. Stearoyl-coA desaturase 1 (<italic>Scd1</italic>), a crucial enzyme in hepatic de novo lipogenesis, was identified as a downstream target of <italic>Adgrf1</italic> by RNA-sequencing analysis. Treatment with the liver-specific <italic>Scd1</italic> inhibitor MK8245 and specific shRNAs against <italic>Scd1</italic> in primary hepatocytes improved the hepatic steatosis of <italic>Adgrf1</italic>-overexpressing mice and lipid profile of hepatocytes, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="abs4"><title>Conclusions:</title><p>These results indicate <italic>Adgrf1</italic> regulates hepatic lipid metabolism through controlling the expression of <italic>Scd1</italic>. Downregulation of <italic>Adgrf1</italic> expression can potentially serve as a protective mechanism to stop the overaccumulation of fat in the liver in obese subjects.

NAFLD is a major global health issue affecting about 25% of the world's population and, if left untreated, can lead to liver inflammation as well as serious complications such as type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and liver cancer.</p><p>Currently, there are no medications which specifically treat NFALD. Instead, only medications which help to manage the associated health complications are available. Therefore, a better understanding of NFALD is required to help to develop new strategies for diagnosing and treating the progression of this disease.</p><p>A family of proteins known as GPCRs have crucial roles in regulating various bodily processes and are therefore commonly targeted for the treatment of disease. By identifying the GPCRs specifically involved in liver fat accumulation, new treatments for NFALD could be identified. Previous studies identified a GPCR known as Adgrf1 that is mainly found in liver cells, but its role remained unclear.</p><p>To investigate the function of Adgrf1 in the liver, Wu et al. studied obese mice and human patients with NAFLD. The experiments showed that elevated levels of Adgrf1 in human and mouse livers led to increased fat accumulation. On the other hand, livers with lower levels of Adgrf1 exhibited reduced fat levels. A technique called RNA sequencing revealed that Adgrf1 induces expression of enzymes involved in fat synthesis, including a key regulator called Scd1. Treating mice with high levels of liver fat with molecules that inhibit Scd1 decreased the symptoms of Adgrf1-mediated fatty liver disease.</p><p>These findings suggest therapies that decrease the levels of Adgrf1 may help to stop too much fat accumulating in the liver of human patients who are at risk of developing NAFLD. Further research is needed to confirm the effectiveness and safety of targeting Adgrf1 in humans and to develop suitable candidate drugs for the task.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>obesity</kwd><kwd>fatty liver</kwd><kwd>lipid metabolism</kwd><kwd>gpr110</kwd><kwd>SCD1</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>81870586</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wong</surname><given-names>Chi-Ming</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Hong Kong University Grants Committee, Area of Excellence</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AoE/M-707/18</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wong</surname><given-names>Chi-Ming</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Hong Kong University Grants Committee, General Research Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>15101520</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wong</surname><given-names>Chi-Ming</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>82270941</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sun</surname><given-names>Jia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>81974117</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sun</surname><given-names>Jia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The novel role of <italic>Adgrf1</italic> in the progression of fatty liver was revealed and targeting <italic>Adgrf1</italic> is a promising therapeutic strategy for treating NAFLD patients.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Liver is a vital organ as it is the site for undergoing a number of crucial physiological processes, including digestion, metabolism, immunity, and storage of nutrients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Younossi et al., 2016</xref>). Overstorage of lipid in the hepatocytes not caused by alcohol is known as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), which is the most common liver pathological condition with a worldwide prevalence of 25% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cotter and Rinella, 2020</xref>). The development of NAFLD is contributed by many factors such as lipid metabolism disorders, over- or mal-nutrition, inflammation, virus infection, or liver injuries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Peng et al., 2020</xref>). NAFLD usually does not entail any symptoms at early stages. However, if left untreated, NAFLD accounts for approximately 85% of all chronic non-communicable diseases (NCDs), such as type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), cardiovascular disease (CVD), and chronic kidney disease (CKD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Allen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zhou et al., 2019</xref>). In addition, NAFLD may progress to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) with fibrosis, cirrhosis, or even hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rinella and Sanyal, 2016</xref>). Therefore, NAFLD imposes high economic and social burdens in terms of work productivity, health-related life quality, and use of healthcare resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zhou et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Improvement in managing NAFLD helps to resolve at least partially the progression of these diseases. Stopping the progression of NAFLD by lifestyle modifications such as increasing physical exercise activity and reduction of hypercaloric diet is only effective during the early stages before there is fibrosis. No medication is available to reverse the excessive fat storage in the liver once NASH developed. Therefore, it is urgently needed to unravel the mechanisms of NAFLD in order to accelerate the development, implementation, and explore new targets for the development of diagnostic tests and cost-effective therapies.</p><p>G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are the largest and most diverse family of membrane receptor that play important roles in regulating most cellular and physiological processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yang et al., 2021</xref>). GPCRs are major targets for currently approved drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hauser et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sriram and Insel, 2018</xref>). A few GPCRs have been shown to play key roles in NAFLD, and modulating their activities to ameliorate liver-related metabolic syndrome was proposed as NAFLD treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yang and Zhang, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kurtz et al., 2021</xref>). However, currently proposed targets for GPCR-medicated NAFLD treatment are not exclusively expressed in hepatocytes, thus the potential side effects on other organs should be considered.</p><p>Human <italic>Adgrf1</italic> was identified by phylogenetic analysis based on highly conserved amino acid sequences of the GPCR transmembrane domains in 2002 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fredriksson et al., 2002</xref>). Mouse ortholog of h<italic>Adgrf1</italic> was identified by the same research team 2 y later (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">BjarnadÃ³ttir et al., 2004</xref>) and various splice variants were detected in deep sequencing experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">BjarnadÃ³ttir et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lum et al., 2010</xref>). So far, most <italic>Adgrf1</italic>-related studies focused on its tumorigenicity. In general, overexpression of <italic>Adgrf1</italic> was observed in various cancers, and it was required to promote cancer cell survival, proliferation, and migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Liu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zhu et al., 2019b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Shi and Zhang, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bhat et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ma et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nam et al., 2022</xref>). Therefore, it was suggested that targeting <italic>Adgrf1</italic> may represent a new therapeutic strategy for anticancer treatment. It was also reported that <italic>Adgrf1</italic> is required for proper fetal brain development and amelioration of neuroinflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lee et al., 2016a</xref>). However, <italic>Adgrf1</italic> is predominantly expressed in health adult livers. The function of hepatic <italic>Adgrf1</italic> remains unexplored.</p><p>In this study, we provide the first evidence that <italic>Adgrf1</italic> induces the expression of <italic>Scd1</italic>, which contributes to NAFLD. By HFD-induced NAFLD mouse model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nakamura and Terauchi, 2013</xref>), it is also shown that the repression of hepatic <italic>Adgrf1</italic> expression is a potential protective mechanism of preventing overaccumulation of lipid in liver. Importantly, the findings not only reveal a new mechanism regulation of the progression of NAFLD, but also proposed a novel therapeutic approach to combat NAFLD by targeting <italic>Adgrf1</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Animals</title><p>All animal procedures were approved by the Animal Subjects Ethics Sub-Committee of the Hong Kong Polytechnic University and were conducted in accordance with the guidelines of the Centralized Animals Facilities (ethics number: 19-20/78-HTI-R-OTHERS).

In the screening results, we found that <italic>Adgrf1</italic> is mainly expressed in liver and its expression is dramatically decreased in the HFD-fed mice compared to their STC-fed littermates.

The <italic>Adgrf1</italic> protein expression in those tissues were checked by western blot analysis.

The <italic>Cd11b</italic> mRNAs were used as markers for non-parenchymal cells (NPCs), and albumin mRNA for hepatocytes.

Supporting the hypothesis, it is found that the mRNA level of IL-1Î², a key mediator of low-grade inflammation during NAFLD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mirea et al., 2018</xref>), was significantly higher in NAFLD patients than in healthy obese individuals in the GEO (Profile # GDS4881) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9D</xref>).

Remarkably, after treatment with either CCl4 or STZ, the expression of IL-1Î² mRNA in their livers increased four- to fivefold compared to the respective value of untreated HFD-fed mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9E</xref>). Notably, the expression of hepatic Adgrf1 mRNA was also significantly increased after CCl4 or STZ treatment compared to the untreated HFD-fed mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9F</xref>). Additionally, the Scd1 mRNA expression level in the CCl4 or STZ-treated HFD-fed mice was significantly higher than the respective value of untreated HFD-fed mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9G</xref>). These results suggest that inflammation induced by either CCl4 or STZ treatment can increase the expression of hepatic Adgrf1, in addition to Scd1, which is known to be involved in hepatic lipid metabolism.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The present study has uncovered a previously unrecognized role of <italic>Adgrf1</italic> in regulating hepatic lipid metabolism. Firstly, we demonstrated that <italic>Adgrf1</italic> is highly expressed in liver of healthy subjects, and hepatic Adgrf1 is required for regulating lipid content in liver of diet-induced obese mice by both gain-of-function and loss-of-function approaches. Secondly, we found that the hepatic Adgrf1 expression level of healthy obese human and mouse are downregulated. The downregulation of hepatic <italic>Adgrf1</italic> expression level in obese subjects is a protective mechanism to prevent over-accumulation of lipid in liver. The argument mainly based on the findings that HFD-induced steatosis and liver injury were exacerbated in obese mice with high <italic>Adgrf1</italic> overexpression level, and knockdown hepatic <italic>Adgrf1</italic> alleviated the severity of obesity-induced NAFLD.</p><p>The pathophysiology of NAFLD is not well understood, but it is widely accepted that multiple factors, including inflammation, contribute to its acceleration and aggravation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Buzzetti et al., 2016</xref>). To explain the observation that hepatic Adgrf1 expression levels in NAFLD patients were higher than in healthy obese individuals, the expression levels of key inflammation markers in different mouse models were measured and it is found that IL-1Î² and Adgrf1 expression levels dramatically increased in subjects with more severe NAFLD conditions. It is interesting to note that the mechanism by which hepatic Adgrf1 transcription is repressed in healthy obese individuals and induced in NAFLD patients remains to be explored. In addition, although obesity is commonly associated with NAFLD, up to 19% of lean Asians can also develop NAFLD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">VanWagner and Armstrong, 2018</xref>). It would be interesting to investigate whether the expression levels of hepatic <italic>Adgrf1</italic> mRNA in these âlean NAFLDâ patients are higher than in lean healthy controls. This could provide further insights into the role of hepatic <italic>Adgrf1</italic> in NAFLD pathogenesis and help identify potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of NAFLD in lean individuals.</p><p>Subsequently, we performed RNA-sequencing analysis to investigate the mechanism of <italic>Adgrf1</italic>âs role in regulating lipogenesis and observed that the expression levels of <italic>Scd1</italic> mRNAs and protein were dramatically upregulated in the livers of rAAV-<italic>Adgrf1</italic> mice and repressed in <italic>Adgrf1</italic>-ASOs-treated rAAV-<italic>Adgrf1</italic> mice. Scd1 is the rate-limiting enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of saturated long-chain fatty acids into monounsaturated fatty acids, and its expression is tightly regulated by various parameters, including hormonal and nutrient factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mauvoisin and Mounier, 2011</xref>). A recent study demonstrated that Adgrf1 mediates palmitic acids to activate the mTor and Srebp1 pathways to promote fat synthesis in mammary gland tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zhang et al., 2023</xref>). Here, Srebp1 is the key transcription factor for regulating Scd1 gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zhu et al., 2019a</xref>). Our RNA sequencing analysis also revealed that the expression of Srebp1 mRNA was dramatically upregulated in the livers of rAAV-Adgrf1 mice and repressed in Adgrf1-ASOs-treated rAAV-Adgrf1 mice, indicating that Adgrf1 might regulate Scd1 expression via Srebp1 in the liver. Importantly, the expression of hepatic Adgrf1 and Scd1 mRNAs can be further increased in the livers of subjects with more severe NAFLD, contributing to its acceleration and aggravation.</p><p>To confirm that the upregulation of hepatic <italic>Scd1</italic> expression levels was responsible for the changes in metabolic phenotype in the rAAV-<italic>Adgrf1</italic> mice, both in vivo and in vitro experiments were carried out using <italic>Scd1</italic> shRNAs and inhibitors. We found that pharmacologically inhibiting <italic>Scd1</italic> by MK8245 was sufficient to rescue the key metabolic dysregulations caused by <italic>Adgrf1</italic> overexpression in the liver. These results strongly support the conclusion that <italic>Adgrf1</italic> induces <italic>Scd1</italic> expression, leading to an increase in de novo lipogenesis in the liver and exacerbating obese-induced NAFLD.</p><p>Previous studies reported that <italic>Scd1</italic> global knockout (KO) mice showed improved insulin sensitivity, higher-energy metabolism, and more resistant to diet-induced obesity by the activation of lipid oxidation in addition to the reduction of triglyceride synthesis and storage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ntambi et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Miyazaki et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Miyazaki et al., 2009</xref>). In addition, the <italic>ob/ob</italic> mice with <italic>Scd1</italic> mutations had significantly reduced storage of triglyceride and lower level of very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cohen et al., 2002</xref>). Remarkably, liver-specific KO of <italic>Scd1</italic> was sufficient to reduce high-carbohydrate diet-induced adiposity with a significant reduction in hepatic lipogenesis and improved glucose tolerance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Miyazaki et al., 2007</xref>). Indeed, <italic>Scd1</italic> inhibition was proposed to be a therapeutic strategy for the treatment of metabolic syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jiang et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>What are the potential advantages of targeting GRP110 rather than <italic>Scd1</italic> for the treatment of NAFLD? First of all, <italic>Scd1</italic> is highly expressed in various tissues, especially adipose tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Ascenzi et al., 2021</xref>). In addition, expression level and activity of <italic>Scd1</italic> are very tightly regulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mauvoisin and Mounier, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">ALJohani et al., 2017</xref>). Harmful consequences from inhibiting <italic>Scd1</italic> have been reported, such as the inhibition of fat mobilization in adipose tissues, and the promotion of proinflammatory and endoplasmic reticulum stress by accumulation <italic>Scd1</italic> substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brown and Rudel, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Leung and Kim, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Liu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zou et al., 2020</xref>). These findings clearly documented that optimal level of <italic>Scd1</italic> is required to maintain health. Secondly, in contrast to <italic>Scd1</italic>, according to the phenotypes of <italic>Adgrf1</italic> KO mice in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ma et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lee et al., 2016a</xref>) and a dramatic reduction in <italic>Adgrf1</italic> in the livers of HFD-fed mice and health obese subjects, the hepatic <italic>Adgrf1</italic> may be dispensable in adults. Therefore, targeting hepatic <italic>Adgrf1</italic> is a potential safe treatment of NAFLD. Thirdly, according to the RNA-sequencing analysis, repressing <italic>Adgrf1</italic> can also regulate the expression of many other lipid metabolism genes. Unfortunately, <italic>Adgrf1</italic> antagonist is not available at this moment. As demonstrated, the ASO-based strategy is an alternative approach to knockdown the expression of <italic>Adgrf1</italic> in liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dhuri et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>The current study focuses on <italic>Adgrf1</italic> in hepatic lipid metabolism. As mentioned above, <italic>Adgrf1</italic> is primarily understood to be an oncogene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lum et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Liu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zhu et al., 2019b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Shi and Zhang, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bhat et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ma et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nam et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abdulkareem et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sadras et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Espinal-EnrÃ­quez et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Harvey et al., 2010</xref>). Notably, recent study reported that deficiency of <italic>Adgrf1</italic> can decelerate carcinogen-induced hepatocarcinogenesis in adult mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ma et al., 2017</xref>). Coincidentally, high expression level of <italic>Scd1</italic> is also genetically susceptible to hepatocarcinogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Falvella et al., 2002</xref>). It is highly possible that <italic>Adgrf1</italic> also accelerates carcinogenesis by inducing <italic>Scd1</italic> expression level. Therefore, a further experiment to check the <italic>Scd1</italic> expression level in the <italic>Adgrf1</italic> induced cancers may be conducted.</p><p>In summary, we present evidence demonstrating a novel role of hepatic <italic>Adgrf1</italic> in regulating lipid metabolism and explored the mechanism partially via regulation of <italic>Scd1</italic> expression level.

To investigate the effect of our liver-specific GPR110 overexpression system on adipose GPR110 expression, RT-qPCRs were performed. The results showed that GPR110 was overexpressed in the hepatocytes of livers (Figure 2B-C and S1C), but not in adipose tissues (Supplementary Figure 3A on page 50 in the revised manuscript) in the rAAV-GPR110 mice compared to the control group. In addition, the Ct value of adipose GPR110 mRNAs were over 40. It shall be due to the liver-specific thyroxine binding globulin (TBG) promoter was used to drive the expression of GPR110 in the liver via our rAAV-mediated gene expression system.</p><p>Metabolic phenotyping using a metabolic cage system revealed no significant differences in daily pedestrian locomotion, distance in cage locomotion, energy expenditure, food intake, water intake, or the respiratory exchange ratio between the rAAV-GFP and rAAV-GPR110 groups (Figure S3C-H on page 50), indicating that these factors did not contribute to the changes in fat mass.</p><p>We believe that the increased body weight gain in HFD-fed rAAV-GPR110 mice is mainly due to dysregulation of hepatic lipid metabolism and hence subsequent accumulation of fat mass.

To investigate the effect of GPR110 expression level on de novo lipogenic activity in primary hepatocytes, we used stable isotopes <sup>3</sup>H-acetate to measure their de novo lipogenic activities.

The highest <sup>3</sup>H-total lipid activity was detected in hepatocytes isolated from the rAAV-GPR110 group compared to the control rAAV-GFP group, while the activity was decreased in hepatocytes isolated from rAAV-GPR110 mice treated with GPR110-specific ASOs compared to the control group.

A study published on March 22, 2022, has shown that GPR110 mediates palmitic acid to activate the mTOR and SREBP1 pathways, promoting milk protein and fat synthesis in mammary gland tissues [10]. Our RNA sequencing results revealed a correlation between the expression of hepatic SREBP1 and GPR110. Therefore, we added the mRNA levels of SREBP1 in our experiments, presented in Figure 5B-C on page 36 of the revised manuscript. The expression level of SREBP1 was found to be higher in the GPR110 overexpression group and decreased after using ASOs to knockdown hepatic GPR110 levels. Additionally, we discussed this potential the molecular mechanism of GPR110 in regulating hepatic lipid metabolism through the SREBP1-SCD1 pathway in the revised version of the manuscript on page 21 line 455-464.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>This is a well written and rigorously conducted project.

Is this mechanism lost in humans?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your positive feedback and for highlighting areas where we can improve. Our study hypothesized that downregulating GPR110 is a protective mechanism against fatty liver development in both mouse and human. Similar to our findings in mice, we observed downregulation of hepatic GPR110 in healthy obese humans compared to lean humans, and a significant increase or restoration of hepatic GPR110 expression levels in NAFLD patients compared to both healthy obese humans and lean humans (see Figure 9A). However, the degree of change in GPR110 expression levels in human livers was not as pronounced as in mice (see Figure 1E-F). This could be due to several potential reasons, such as: (1) it is difficult to find humans with a BMI equivalent to mice treated with more than 12 weeks of HFD [11-15]; (2) we used RT-qPCR to determine hepatic GPR110 expression in mice, while microarrays were used to determine hepatic GPR110 expression in humans in previous study; and (3) furthermore, it's worth noting that the y-axis scales for these methods are different, and the human data from the microarray analysis is presented on a log2 scale, which may affect the impression of the changes of GPR110 mRNA expression in human appear to be less obvious.</p><p>Furthermore, inspired by the comments from reviewers, we hypothesized that pathological factors such as liver damage and inflammation in the livers of NAFLD patients may induce hepatic GPR110 expression. We also observed that the key inflammation marker, IL-1Î², which mediates low-grade inflammation during NAFLD, was increased in our human study [5]. To mimic these pathological conditions, we induced liver damage and inflammation in the livers of HFD-fed mice using either CCl4 or streptozotocin (STZ) [16-20]. As shown in Figure 9 on page 44 of the revised manuscript, treatment with either CCl4 or STZ significantly increased the expression levels of the key hepatic inflammation marker IL-1Î², GPR110, and SCD1 in the livers of the CCl4- or STZ-treated HFD-fed mice compared to their controls without any CCl4 or STZ treatment (Figure 9D-G). In summary, we believe that the mechanism is conserved between humans and mice, whereby the expression of hepatic GPR110 should be repressed in healthy obese individuals to prevent or delay the development of fatty liver. Pathological factors such as inflammation and liver damage may enhance GPR110 expression in NAFLD patients, thereby accelerating lipid accumulation in their livers through the SREBP1/SCD1 pathway.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Although it is of interest that GPR110/SCD-1 axis could modulate hepatic lipid levels, the underlying mechanisms are not clear.

As mentioned in the response to your major comment #4, in line with the recent publication demonstrated that GPR110 mediates palmitic acids to activate the mTOR and SREBP1 pathways to promote milk protein and fat synthesis in mammary gland tissues, we did observe that the expression of key SCD1 transcription factor SREBP1 were correlated to the expression of GPR110. In brief, the expression level of SREBP1 level was found in the GPR110 overexpression group, and the level decreased after using ASOs to knockdown hepatic GPR110 levels. These findings suggest that GPR110 shall regulate hepatic lipid metabolism through the SREBP1-SCD1 pathway, and we added the mRNA levels of SREBP1 in my experiments in Figure 5B-C on page 36 of the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comments/typos</p><p>1.

We believe GPR110 plays a more critical role in the early stage of NAFLD, especially for the NAFLD patients beginning with inflammation or other insults that induce the NAFLD pathogenesis. Our argument mainly based on GPR110 is relative are relatively lower in the health obese subject than NAFLD patients, and one of the key differences these two groups is key inflammation marker Il-1Î² was higher detected in NAFLD patients as compared to health obese subjects. In addition, overexpression of GPR110 induced the expression of hepatic lipids and lipogenic genes and knockdown GPR110 in the rAAV-GPR110 mice can ameliorate of the progression of their NAFLD. The discussion of the important of GPR110 in NAFLD was presented on 20, lines 434-446.</p><p>References</p><p>1.
