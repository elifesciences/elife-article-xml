Based on morphological and functional differences, adipocytes have been classified into three types, that is<italic>,</italic> white, brown, and beige adipocytes. Being the most abundant type of adipocyte, white adipocytes (WAs) contain a single large lipid droplet that occupies most of their intracellular space. They are present in visceral and subcutaneous depots and their primary function is to store excess energy in the form of triglycerides. WAs also secrete a number of hormones, including leptin, adiponectin, and several others, that regulate the function of other cells in adipose tissue as well as other organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Scheja and Heeren, 2019</xref>). In contrast, brown adipocytes (BAs) contain numerous small lipid droplets and a high density of mitochondria. Their primary function is the generation of heat, that is, thermogenesis, through uncoupling of the mitochondrial electron transport chain from ATP production to produce heat. This is mediated by uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1), a BA-specific protein located at the inner mitochondrial membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cohen and Kajimura, 2021</xref>). Beige adipocytes (BeAs) are residents of subcutaneous white adipose tissue (WAT) depots that possess inducible thermogenic capacity, despite very low basal levels of UCP1 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Petrovic et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wu et al., 2012</xref>). Thanks to recent advances in single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq), transcriptomic profiling of adipocytes at single-cell resolution has become feasible. snRNA-seq analysis of mouse and human WAT depots has revealed adipocyte subpopulations that are related to lipogenesis, lipid-scavenging, and stress responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Emont et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sárvári et al., 2021</xref>). Profiling of adipocytes from interscapular brown adipose tissue (iBAT) of mouse and human has identified a subpopulation that negatively regulates thermogenesis via paracrine secretion of acetate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sun et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Visceral depots such as epididymal, mesenteric, and retroperitoneal adipose tissues are mainly made of WAs; whereas BAs and BeAs are often found in subcutaneous depots, such as iBAT and inguinal WAT (iWAT). Perirenal adipose tissue (PRAT) is bilaterally distributed around the kidney and is encapsulated by a multilayered fibrous membrane, known as the renal fascia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">de Jong et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Liu et al., 2019</xref>). The medial region of PRAT (herein termed mPRAT) is located around the hilum of the kidney, and several studies have identified UCP1-expressing BAs in this area in human PRAT, suggesting that it represents a form of visceral BAT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Betz et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Li et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nagano et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Svensson et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">van den Beukel et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Vergnes et al., 2016</xref>). In contrast, the lateral region of PRAT (herein termed lPRAT) is predominantly composed of WAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">de Jong et al., 2015</xref>). Based on morphological changes in adipocytes of human PRAT during aging, a process of continuous replacement of BAs by WAs has been proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tanuma et al., 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tanuma et al., 1975</xref>). On the other hand, analysis of PRAT collected at necropsy from people living in Siberia revealed an up to 40% BA component, indicating the potential of PRAT to respond to low environmental temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Efremova et al., 2020</xref>). Moreover, so-called ‘dormant’ BAs have been described in PRAT of adult kidney donors, characterized by unilocular morphology, high levels of UCP1 expression, and a gene expression profile that partially overlaps that of WAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jespersen et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>The process by which BAs acquire WA-like properties has been referred to as ‘whitening’, and it is characterized by the enlargement of lipid droplets and reduced expression of thermogenic genes, such as <italic>Ucp1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Shimizu et al., 2014</xref>). Brown-to-white conversion or whitening is a known complication of obesity associated with vascular rarefaction, tissue inflammation, and leptin receptor deficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kotzbeck et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rangel-Azevedo et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Shimizu et al., 2014</xref>). In addition, warm adaptation, impaired β-adrenergic signaling, and loss of adipose triglyceride lipase have also been implicated in BAT whitening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kotzbeck et al., 2018</xref>). Under normal physiological conditions, whitening of BAT has only been demonstrated in rabbit iBAT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Huang et al., 2022</xref>). With regard to PRAT, it is unclear whether the process by which the number of WAs increases at the expense of BAs during postnatal life reflects direct brown-to-white cell conversion or some other mechanisms of replacement. Moreover, the cellular and molecular properties of the newly formed WA population as well as its spatial distribution in PRAT remain unknown.</p><p>In the present study, we took advantage of snRNA-seq and genetic lineage-tracing methods to reveal the existence of a bona fide whitening process of BAs in the mPRAT during mouse postnatal development. We identified a distinct population of newly formed adipocytes derived by whitening, described its anatomical location, and characterized its molecular properties both during its formation and after cold exposure. In addition, our analysis of cells in the lPRAT revealed populations of adipocytes, ASPCs, and macrophages that are transcriptionally distinct from those found in classical visceral fat depots such as epididymal WAT (eWAT).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>snRNA-seq analysis of murine mPRAT reveals a unique adipocyte subpopulation and uncovers evidence of a brown-to-white transition during postnatal development</title><p>To explore the cellular dynamics of mPRAT and iBAT during postnatal development, we collected the tissues from 1-, 2-, and 6-month-old C57BL/6J male mice for whole-tissue snRNA-seq and performed depot-specific analysis.

After strict quality control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B and C</xref>), we profiled a total of 11,708 and 31,079 nuclei for mPRAT and iBAT, respectively.

Adipocytes in murine mPRAT were highly heterogeneous and could be separated into four interconnected subpopulations, all expressing the <italic>Plin1</italic> gene that encodes the lipid droplet protein Perilipin, which we referred to as mPRAT-ad1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G and H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1H</xref>). mPRAT-ad1 resembled classical BAs and expressed <italic>Ucp1</italic>, <italic>Cidea</italic>, <italic>Pank1,</italic> and <italic>Gk</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H and I</xref>). mPRAT-ad2 was characterized by the expression of <italic>Cidea</italic>, <italic>Pank1,</italic> and <italic>Gk</italic>, but not <italic>Ucp1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H and I</xref>).

Such gene expression pattern suggested that mPRAT-ad2 may contain BA-like cells that could be recruited by stimuli that induce thermogenesis.

Adipocytes of iBAT could also be separated into four distinct subpopulations, which we referred to as iBAT-ad1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1I</xref>). iBAT-ad1, 2, and 3 contained BAs that expressed different levels of <italic>Ucp1</italic> and <italic>Cidea,</italic> and may correspond to previously identified low- and high-thermogenic BA subpopulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Song et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1J–L</xref>). Altogether, they comprised over 90% of the total adipocyte population in iBAT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1I</xref>). On the other hand, iBAT-ad4 expressed <italic>Cyp2e1</italic>, <italic>Slit3</italic>, <italic>Slc7a10</italic>, <italic>Aldh1a1,</italic> and <italic>Lep,</italic> and module score analysis of signature genes showed it to bear close similarity to the recently identified P4 adipocyte subpopulation that regulates thermogenesis in iBAT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sun et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1M</xref>). Comparison between mPRAT and iBAT adipocyte transcriptomes using module score analysis revealed that mPRAT-ad1 was more similar to all iBAT BA subpopulations (iBAT-ad1, 2, and 3), while mPRAT-ad3 and 4 were more similar to iBAT-ad4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1N</xref>). Interestingly, we could not find a match for mPRAT-ad2 among iBAT adipocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1N</xref>), suggesting that it represents a distinct subpopulation of adipocytes specific to mPRAT, but absent in classical BAT.</p><p>Closer inspection of mPRAT adipocyte composition at 1, 2, and 6 mo revealed a gradual decrease in the proportions of mPRAT subpopulations ad1 (43.0, 34.9, and 33.1%, respectively) and ad2 (36.1, 31.2, and 23.9%, respectively), which was accompanied by a reciprocal increase in ad3 (14.7, 26.8, and 29.9%, respectively) and ad4 (6.2, 7.1, and 13.1%, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>), suggesting the existence of a progressive transition in the adipocyte composition of mPRAT during postnatal life. This possibility was further investigated by Monocle 3 trajectory analysis of these cells, which revealed a single continuous trajectory linking the four subpopulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>). Based on the pattern of composition changes observed through time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>), we defined mPRAT-ad1 subpopulation as the starting point of the trajectory uncovering pseudo-time values that increased steadily from mPRAT-ad1 to mPRAT-ad4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J and K</xref>). Along the pseudo-timeline, BA module genes such as <italic>Ucp1</italic>, <italic>Cidea</italic>, <italic>Ppargc1b</italic>, <italic>Gk,</italic> and <italic>Pank1</italic> showed decreasing expression levels, whereas WA module genes such as <italic>Npr3</italic>, <italic>Aldh1a1</italic>, <italic>Tshr</italic>, <italic>Slc7a10</italic>, <italic>Slit3,</italic> and <italic>Cyp2e1</italic> showed the opposite trend (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K</xref>). Gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis of these genes revealed a progressive transition from catabolic to anabolic processes along the pseudo-time trajectory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1L</xref>). The midpoint of the trajectory, corresponding to the mPRAT-ad2 subpopulation, coincided with the highest expression levels of lipogenic genes, including <italic>Acly</italic> and <italic>Acaca</italic>, as well as enrichment in several synthetic pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K and L</xref>). A similar analysis on iBAT adipocytes failed to reveal a distinct trajectory and its pseudo-time length of up to 12.8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1O</xref>) was much shorter than that found in mPRAT adipocytes, which reached 26.7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>), suggesting a less heterogeneous and more stable adipocyte population in iBAT. Taken together, these results suggested the occurrence of a brown-to-white transition during postnatal development in adipocytes of mouse mPRAT.</p><p>Re-clustering of mPRAT ASPC population revealed three subpopulations (referred to as mPRAT-aspc1 to 3, respectively) that shared the expression of the ASPC marker gene <italic>Pdgfra</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A–C</xref>). mPRAT-aspc1 (expressing <italic>Dpp4</italic>, <italic>Pi16</italic>, <italic>Anxa3</italic>) was identified as fibro-adipogenic progenitors (FAPs), while mPRAT-aspc2 (expressing <italic>Pdgfrb</italic> and low levels of <italic>Pparg</italic>) and mPRAT-aspc3 (expressing high levels of <italic>Pparg</italic>, <italic>Cd36</italic>, <italic>Cidea</italic>) represented preadipocytes at different stages of differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>). mPRAT-aspc1 and 2 comprised the majority of the ASPC population at all three time points and a reciprocal switch in their relative proportions was observed between 2 and 6 months of age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2D</xref>). iBAT ASPCs could also be re-clustered into three distinct subpopulations (termed iBAT-aspc1 to 3, respectively), which presented good correspondence to the three ASPCs subpopulations identified in mPRAT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2E–G</xref>). However, unlike mPRAT, iBAT ASPC subpopulations showed more dynamic changes in their relative composition during the three postnatal times examined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2H</xref>). We further investigated the apparent similarities between mPRAT and iBAT ASPCs by co-clustering the two cell populations. This revealed a high degree of overlap between them with similar marker genes and good correspondence among their different subpopulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2I–K</xref>), indicating similar transcriptomes and suggesting that they may give rise to similar types of adipocytes. Thus, the fact that PRAT-specific mPRAT-ad2 is absent in iBAT suggested to us that those cells may arise from brown-to-white conversion of adipocyte subpopulations rather than ASPC differentiation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>The cellular composition of lPRAT is significantly different from that in eWAT at the transcriptional level</title><p>Next, we explored the transcriptome of lPRAT in 2- and 6-month-old C57BL/6J male mice using snRNA-seq.

In addition, UCP1 staining was decreased in adult compared to juvenile mPRAT and absent from lPRAT, as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). In order to investigate brown-to-white conversion of mPRAT adipocytes during postnatal life, we used the <italic>Ucp1Cre;</italic>Ai14 mouse line that drives expression of tdTomato in BAs from the moment these activate the <italic>Ucp1</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kong et al., 2014</xref>). UCP1 immunostaining of mPRAT sections in 2-month-old <italic>Ucp1Cre;</italic>Ai14 mice enabled us to assess whether and to which extent tdTomato<sup>+</sup> adipocytes had lost UCP1 expression, an indication of brown-to-white conversion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). This analysis revealed that 61.8% of tdTomato<sup>+</sup> cells in puPRAT no longer expressed UCP1 by 2 months of age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>). In contrast, only 7.5% of tdTomato<sup>+</sup> cells did not express UCP1 in pvPRAT at this age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>). These results suggested a significant loss of the BA phenotype in puPRAT, consistent with brown-to-white conversion in this region. In agreement with this, many tdTomato<sup>+</sup>&amp;UCP1<sup>-</sup> adipocytes displayed one large unilocular lipid droplet, a morphological hallmark of WAs (insets in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). In line with our analysis of kidney explants, puPRAT contained a significantly lower proportion of tdTomato<sup>+</sup> adipocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>) and adipocytes that expressed UCP1 at 2 month of age (UCP1<sup>+</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>) compared to pvPRAT. A similar analysis of iBAT failed to reveal evidence of brown-to-white conversion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>), in agreement with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Huang et al., 2022</xref>). Histological analysis of tissue sections of mouse PRAT and iBAT from 1 to 6 months old revealed that the size of lipid droplets increased by around 5.5-fold in puPRAT and about 2.3-fold in pvPRAT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E and F</xref>), in agreement with a more pronounced brown-to-white transition in the puPRAT region. Immunostaining of the puPRAT region for CYP2E1 and ALDH1A1, markers of mPRAT-ad3/4 and -ad4 subpopulations of mPRAT WAs, respectively, revealed that a proportion of tdTomato<sup>+</sup>&amp;UCP1<sup>-</sup> adipocytes expressed these genes (34 and 23%, respectively, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G–I</xref>).

As expected, cold exposure caused a dramatic decrease in lipid droplet size in pvPRAT, puPRAT, iBAT, and iWAT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). After filtering (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>), a total of 7387 nuclei could be clustered into adipocytes, ASPCs, macrophages, vascular cells (endothelial cell and pericyte), and mesothelial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C and E</xref>), without apparent difference in the relative proportions of these cell types between mice exposed to cold and those kept at room temperature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Upon subclustering, the adipocyte population was separated into four subpopulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D–F</xref>) that were highly similar to the four mPRAT adipocyte subpopulations identified in our previous datasets (mPRAT-ad1-4) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1F</xref>). Interestingly, cold exposure had dramatic effects on the composition of mPRAT: the proportion of mPRAT-ad1 doubled, the mPRAT-ad2 cells all disappeared, the mPRAT-ad3 subpopulation was reduced by 30%, while the proportion of mPRAT-ad4 cells remained unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). As no enhanced cell death was observed upon cold exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1G</xref>), it is possible that the entire mPRAT-ad2 and part of the mPRAT-ad3 subpopulations were converted to the thermogenic <italic>Ucp1</italic><sup>+</sup> mPRAT-ad1 subpopulation upon a dramatic increase in <italic>Ucp1</italic> expression following cold exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>).

We also noted that the proportions of ASPC subpopulations in mPRAT remained relatively unchanged after cold exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1H and I</xref>), suggesting that precursor cells may be less sensitive to acute environmental temperature drop and have a limited contribution to mature adipocyte phenotypes through de novo adipogenesis after cold exposure.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>mPRAT-ad2 subtype is transcriptionally different from iWAT adipocytes under both room temperature and cold exposure conditions</title><p>Having demonstrated the existence of an adipocyte subpopulation in mPRAT that can be induced to express a thermogenic profile in response to cold exposure, we sought to perform a comparison with the transcriptional profiles of iBAT and iWAT adipocytes subjected to the same conditions in the same animals. In iBAT, analysis of 27,717 nuclei after filtering (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>) revealed no obvious differences in the proportions of all cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B–D</xref>) or ASPC subpopulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1H and I</xref>) between room temperature and cold exposure. Following cold exposure, all adipocyte subpopulations showed similar transcriptomes with those identified in the longitudinal datasets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1G</xref>) and experienced a dramatic increase in the expression levels of BA marker genes, including iBAT-ad4, which had not shown expression for any of those genes at room temperature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1F</xref>). Proportion of the iBAT-ad1 subpopulation was increased while that of iBAT-ad3 decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1E</xref>), indicating that cold exposure can induce cell-type conversions among <italic>Ucp1</italic><sup>+</sup> adipocyte subpopulations in iBAT, in agreement with previous observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Song et al., 2020</xref>). In iWAT, analysis of 11,486 nuclei revealed clusters of adipocytes, ASPCs, immune cells (macrophage, B cell, T cell, neutrophil and dendritic cell), and vascular cells (endothelial cell and pericyte), whose relative proportions remained unchanged after cold exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A–E</xref>). Five subclusters were identified within the adipocyte population, herein termed iWAT-ad1 to 5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2F–H</xref>). As expected, the adipocytes expressing high levels of <italic>Ucp1</italic> and <italic>Cidea</italic> (iWAT-ad1, namely BeAs) were only present in animals that were exposed to cold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2G</xref>). Surprisingly, a second adipocyte subpopulation that was almost specific to cold-exposed animals (iWAT-ad2) did not express any of the common thermogenic markers, but instead specifically expressed genes involved in lipogenesis (<italic>Acss2</italic>, <italic>Fasn,</italic> and <italic>Acly</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2G and H</xref>). This is in agreement with a recent study showing that expression of lipogenic genes is highly induced in iWAT adipocytes upon cold exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Holman et al., 2023</xref>). In contrast to iWAT-ad1 and ad2, the abundance of iWAT-ad4 cells decreased by half following cold exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2G</xref>). Similar to mPRAT and iBAT, no differences were detected in the proportions of different iWAT ASPCs subtypes following cold exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2I and J</xref>).</p><p>Surprisingly, little overlap, if at all, could be found between subpopulations of mPRAT and iWAT adipocytes in mice housed at room temperature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and B</xref>). In fact, the mPRAT and iWAT adipocytes were mostly exclusive from each other, besides the slight overlap between the two mature WA subpopulations (mPRAT-ad4 and iWAT-ad5) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and B</xref>). Thus, the cold-inducible subpopulation of mPRAT-ad2 adipocytes would appear to be quite distinct from adipocyte subpopulations found in either iBAT or iWAT under room temperature condition. Upon cold exposure, BeAs in iWAT (iWAT-ad1) showed a good correspondence with a fraction of the mPRAT-ad1 subpopulation of BAs in mPRAT (highlighted in gray in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C and D</xref>). By label transfer, we found that most of the mPRAT-ad1 adipocytes that did not overlap with iWAT BeAs were more similar to mPRAT-ad2 of the room temperature dataset (highlighted in gray in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2K</xref>), suggesting that they may be derived from mPRAT-ad2 adipocytes that had undergone brown-to-white conversion. Thus, mPRAT BAs that arise from the mPRAT-ad2 subpopulation after cold exposure have a distinct transcriptome to that of cold-induced BeAs in iWAT. Analysis of the hierarchical relationships between different adipocyte subpopulations in the three fat depots following cold exposure revealed that both the BA and WA populations of mPRAT were more closely related to iBAT than iWAT populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). As the ASPC population were rather similar in the different depots at the different temperature conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplements 1H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">2I</xref>), we performed cell–cell communication analysis on the populations of adipocyte in the three depots based on ligand, receptor, and cofactor interactions using the CellChat algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jin et al., 2021</xref>). At room temperature, mPRAT adipocyte subpopulations showed greater and stronger intercellular communication than subpopulations in iBAT or iWAT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F and G</xref>), which may be related to the ongoing brown-to-white conversion in mPRAT at room temperature. In contrast, cold exposure reverted these relationships, reducing the number and strength of interactions in mPRAT while increasing interactions in iBAT and iWAT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F and G</xref>).

On the other hand, BA whitening does not occur in mouse iBAT as shown in the present and previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Huang et al., 2022</xref>). In PRAT, a continuous replacement of BAs by WAs during aging has been suggested based on analysis of adipocyte morphology by a study on the Japanese population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tanuma et al., 1976</xref>). Also, so-called ‘dormant’ BAT has been observed throughout the PRAT depot of an adult kidney donor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jespersen et al., 2019</xref>) and habituation to low-temperature environment has been reported to result in the acquisition of BA-like morphology and UCP1 expression in human PRAT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Efremova et al., 2020</xref>). In the present study, we used snRNA-seq to explore the transcriptome dynamics of mouse PRAT, revealing the existence of brown-to-white conversion in the medial region of the tissue during postnatal development, as confirmed by the loss of UCP1 protein in genetically traced adipocytes. Non-shivering thermogenesis negatively correlates with body mass in a large number of eutherian mammals, as many of them have developed other strategies to cope with low environmental temperatures, such as hibernation and torpor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Oelkrug et al., 2015</xref>). On the other hand, small-sized mammals with large body surface to volume ratio rely more heavily on BAT for thermogenesis, which may possibly explain why iBAT whitening does not occur in mice.

On the other hand, <italic>Cidea</italic><sup>-</sup> cells in mPRAT-ad3, a small fraction of which can responsd to cold, were mostly positive for <italic>Cyp2e1</italic> and <italic>Slit3</italic>, but did not express <italic>Aldh1a1</italic> or <italic>Lep</italic>. The fact that mPRAT-ad2 cells express markers of both BA and WA, together with an absence of unique markers for this subpopulation, is in line with their intermediate and plastic phenotype. Our tracing studies showed that only a rather small fraction of adipocytes undergoing brown-to-white conversion in postnatal life expressed mPRAT-ad3 and -ad4 markers CYP2E1 and ALDH1A1, suggesting that the majority of mPRAT-ad3 and -ad4 WAs in PRAT must derive from the differentiation of ASPCs. This also agrees with them being most similar to iBAT-ad4 cells that also derive from ASPCs, given the lack of brown-to-white conversion in the iBAT depot. ASPCs in both PRAT and iBAT were also very similar. We cannot at present exclude the possibility that the limited cold responsiveness of mPRAT-ad3 could be due to inappropriate cold exposure for the induction of a robust thermogenic phenotype. We also note that, although <italic>Cyp2e1</italic> and <italic>Aldh1a1</italic> are always co-expressed in iBAT adipocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sun et al., 2020</xref>), only <italic>Aldh1a1</italic>, not <italic>Cyp2e1</italic>, distinguished cold-responsive from unresponsive adipocytes in mPRAT, indicating distinct expression patterns and possibly functions for these genes in the two fat depots.</p><p>mPRAT-ad2 cells shared with iWAT BeAs the capacity to upregulate <italic>Ucp1</italic> expression and acquire a thermogenic phenotype in response to cold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Petrovic et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wu et al., 2012</xref>). However, none of the subpopulations of iWAT adipocytes showed any similarity to mPRAT-ad2 cells at the transcriptional level. This convergent phenotype may be explained by the different origins of the two depots. Thus, while all adipocyte subpopulations in iWAT arise by differentiation from ASPCs, mPRAT-ad2 adipocytes are derived from brown-to-white conversion of BAs and thus retain a number of molecular signatures from their parental cells. Even after cold exposure, the transcriptome of thermogenic BAs in PRAT (mPRAT-ad1) are more similar to BAs in iBAT than iWAT. These BAs are likely composed of cells from three different origins: recruited mPRAT-ad2 adipocytes, pre-existing mPRAT-ad1 cells similar to iBAT BAs, and BAs that arise from cold-induced de novo adipogenesis. iWAT BeAs derived by cold induction are mainly derived from <italic>Sma</italic>-expressing precursor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berry et al., 2016</xref>), although interconversion between BeAs and WAs has also been observed after cold exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rosenwald et al., 2013</xref>). Distinct cellular and/or developmental origins may therefore explain the differences observed among cold-induced adipocytes in the three depots. Adipocytes in BAT and iWAT are known to have different developmental origins. While classical BAs from BAT depots are derived from a subpopulation of dermomyotomes that expresses <italic>Myf5</italic>, <italic>En1,</italic> and <italic>Pax7</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Atit et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lepper and Fan, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sanchez-Gurmaches et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Seale et al., 2008</xref>), iWAT BeAs emerge from multiple origins, including a <italic>Myf5</italic>-negative cell lineage derived from <italic>Myh11</italic><sup>+</sup> smooth muscle-like precursors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Long et al., 2014</xref>) and progenitors expressing <italic>Pax3</italic> and/or <italic>Myf5</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sanchez-Gurmaches and Guertin, 2014</xref>). On the other hand, BAs in PRAT arise from a lineage of <italic>Pax3</italic><sup>+</sup> but <italic>Myf5</italic><sup>-</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sanchez-Gurmaches and Guertin, 2014</xref>). Discrepancies in embryonic origin between mPRAT and iWAT beige adipocytes may have established unique transcriptome signatures that persist during postnatal life. Another possibility is that the kinetics of thermogenic induction, a.k.a. browning, may be different between the two depots such that longer cold exposure results in more similar transcriptional profiles in the two tissues.</p><p>One possible limitation of our study is that we only used mice from one genetic background (C57BL/6J), which is known to display a metabolic phenotype that is more prone to develop obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bachmann et al., 2022</xref>). The transcriptomes and trajectories of cells from fat depots of other strains may deviate from our findings. In addition, the oldest mice that we have analyzed in the present study were 6 months old, which is only equivalent to the human adult stage. Future studies should focus on older mice to investigate whether a more complete brown-to-white conversion takes place during aging as well as the effect of cold exposure on this process. Moreover, lack of specific marker genes for the mPRAT-ad2 subpopulation makes it difficult to generate Cre driver strains that can be used to specifically trace the fate of these adipocytes and visualize the whitening process in a more direct way.</p><p>In summary, our work identifies a cold-recruitable adipocyte subpopulation in mPRAT derived by brown-to-white conversion of BAs with a transcriptomic profile distinct from iWAT BeAs. The discrepancy observed in this process between pvPRAT and puPRAT could be functionally related to the idiosyncrasies of kidney blood supply and urine transport, respectively. Previous studies have demonstrated the clinical relevance of PRAT in clear cell renal cell carcinoma invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wei et al., 2021</xref>) and pathological hypertension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Li et al., 2022</xref>). Future studies should focus on exploring the physiological role of brown-to-white conversion in different regions of mPRAT and the molecular mechanisms that govern its regulation. Understanding why mPRAT has pre-existing BAs that gradually convert to WAs during postnatal development may contribute to the development of novel therapeutic strategies for renal disorders. More generally, harnessing our understanding of brown-to-white adipocyte conversion may lead to strategies to prevent or delay its course and thus enhance the thermogenic capacity of adipose tissues to mitigate the consequences of metabolic disorders, such as obesity and diabetes.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>All animal experiments were performed in compliance with the protocol approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of Peking University (Psych-XieM-2) and the Chinese Institute of Brain Research (CIBR-IACUC-035).

However, we would like to clarify two points here. First, PRAT has been reported as a visceral adipose depot that contains brown adipocytes and a process of continuous replacement of brown adipocytes by white adipocytes has been previously suggested based on histological assessment. There is no evidence that PRAT undergoes browning, unless cold exposure is involved. Second, unlike the brown-to-white conversion, white-to-beige conversion in PRAT was not observed under normal conditions. The adipocyte population that arises from brown-to-white conversion (mPRAT-ad2) can respond to cold and restore their UCP1 expression. However, the adipocytes that arise from the mPRAT-ad2 subpopulation after cold exposure have a distinct transcriptome to that of cold-induced beige adipocyte in iWAT (Figure S7K) and are more related to iBAT brown adipocytes (Figure 6E). Therefore, it is more of a white-to-brown conversion in PRAT upon cold exposure rather than white-to-beige conversion and the underlying mechanism is likely different from the white-to-beige conversion in the subcutaneous adipose tissue.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>(1) There is overall a disconnection between single nucleus RNA-seq data and the lineage chasing data. No specific markers of this population have been validated by staining.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: We are not sure what “this population” refers to. We assume that it is the Ucp1-&amp;Cidea+ mPRAT-ad2 adipocyte subpopulation. If so, we did not identify specific markers for these adipocytes as shown in Figure 1H and statements in the Discussion section. mPRAT-ad2 is negative for Ucp1 and Cyp2e1, which are markers for mPRAT-ad1 and mPRAT-ad3&amp;4, respectively. To visualize the mPRAT-ad2 adipocytes on tissue sections, we collected pvPRAT and puPRAT of Ucp1CreERT2;Ai14 mice one day after tamoxifen injection and stained with CYP2E1 antibody and BODIPY. The Tomato-&amp;CYP2E1-&amp;BODIPY+ cells represent the mPRAT-ad2 adipocytes. Based on such strategy, we revealed a significantly higher percentage of mPRAT-ad2 cells in puPRAT than pvPRAT (presented as Figure S3E in the revised manuscript).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) It would be nice to provide more evidence to support the conclusion shown in lines 243 to 245 &quot;These results indicated that new BAs induced by cold exposure were mainly derived from UCP1- adipocytes rather than de novo ASPC differentiation in puPRAT&quot;. Pdgfra-negative progenitor cells may also contribute to these new beige adipocytes.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: We stained pvPRAT and puPRAT of the PdgfraCre;Ai14 mice with the adipocyte marker Plin1 and observed a 100% overlap between the tdTomato signal and the Plin1 staining, after examining a total of 832 and 628 adipocytes in pvPRAT and puPRAT of two animals (Figure S4). Plin1 stains all adipocytes, while the endogenous tdTomato labels both the adipocytes and blood vessels. This result suggests that all adipocytes in mPRAT are derived from Pdgfra-expressing cells, which is in line with a previous study that integrated several single-cell RNA sequencing data sets and showed that Pdgfra is expressed by virtually all ASPCs (Ferrero et al., 2020).</p><p>Also, we would like to point out that the cold-induced adipocytes in mPRAT resemble more to the brown adipocytes of iBAT than the beige adipocytes of iWAT (Figure 6E and S7K).</p><p>Ferrero, R., Rainer, P., and Deplancke, B.

They also identify two populations of white adipocytes that do not undergo browning with acute cold exposure.</p><p>Anatomically distinct adipose depots display interesting functional differences, and this work contributes to our understanding of one of the few brown depots present in humans.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The most interesting aspect of this work is the identification of a highly plastic mature adipocyte population with the capacity to switch between a white and brown phenotype. The authors attempt to identify the transcriptional signature of this ad2 subpopulation, however, the limited sequencing depth of single nuclei somewhat lessens the impact of these findings. Furthermore, the lack of any form of mechanistic investigation into the regulation of mPRAT whitening limits the utility of this manuscript. However, the combination of well-executed lineage tracing with comprehensive cross-depot single-nuclei presented in this manuscript could still serve as a useful reference for the field.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: The sequencing depth of our data is comparable, if not better than previously published snRNA-seq studies on adipose tissue (Burl et al., 2022; Sarvari et al., 2021; Sun et al., 2020). Therefore, the depth of our data has reached the limit of the 3’ sequencing methods. Unfortunately, due to size limitation of the adipocytes, it is challenging to sort them for Smart-seq. We suspect that lack of specific markers for mPRAT-ad2 is partly due to its intermediate and plastic phenotype. Regarding the mechanistic regulation of mPRAT whitening, we believe that it is more suitable to leave such investigations for a separate follow-up and more in-depth study.</p><p>Burl, R.B., Rondini, E.A., Wei, H., Pique-Regi, R., and Granneman, J.G.
