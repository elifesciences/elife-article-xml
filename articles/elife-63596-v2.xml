integrating external sensory input with information about internal state to decide which movements to make next. Using machine learning approaches for high-resolution kinematic analysis, we uncover the logic of a rapid decision underlying sensory-guided locomotion in mice. After detecting obstacles with their whiskers mice select distinct kinematic strategies depending on a whisker-derived estimate of obstacle location together with the position and velocity of their body. Although mice rely on whiskers for obstacle avoidance, lesions of primary whisker sensory cortex had minimal impact. While motor cortex manipulations affected the execution of the chosen strategy, the decision-making process remained largely intact. These results highlight the potential of machine learning for reductionist analysis of naturalistic behaviors and provide a case in which subcortical brain structures appear sufficient for mediating a relatively sophisticated sensorimotor decision.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>locomotion</kwd><kwd>decision-making</kwd><kwd>whiskers</kwd><kwd>motor cortex</kwd><kwd>barrel cortex</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F31DC016816</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Warren</surname><given-names>Richard A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 NS094659</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bruno</surname><given-names>Randy</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F32 NS084768</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hong</surname><given-names>Y Kate</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006984</institution-id><institution>Irma T.

Despite the utility of this approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Gold and Shadlen, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Shenoy, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Carandini and Churchland, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Svoboda and Li, 2018</xref>), it does not capture many real-world behaviors in which perception, decision-making, and action occur rapidly and in parallel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Cisek and Kalaska, 2010</xref>). For example, in deciding how to avoid an obstacle in its path (e.g. by breaking, turning, or stepping over it), an animal must consider the size and position of the obstacle, the position and velocity of the limbs, and respond such that the obstacle is avoided while maintaining balance. The speed with which such decisions are made may preclude strategies based on the gradual accumulation of evidence that are often associated with cerebral cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Shadlen and Kiani, 2013</xref>). In terrestrial locomotion, sensorimotor decisions are further complicated by the high dimensionality of the musculoskeletal system. Whereas cognitive and perceptual decisions often have categorical or binary outcomes (e.g. which action to take or whether a stimulus is present), decisions about movement must coordinate multiple limbs in a manner that respects ongoing changes to the state of the body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Drew et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Marigold and Drew, 2017</xref>).</p><p>Sensorimotor decisions can mean life or death for animals catching prey or escaping predators. However, with some notable exceptions (see e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Branco and Redgrave, 2020</xref>), the behavioral strategies and underlying neural mechanisms are not well characterized. One bottleneck has been the technical difficulty of performing thorough behavioral analysis of sensorimotor decisions in the context of whole-body behaviors such as locomotion. Until recently, detailed kinematic descriptions of even ‘simple’ behaviors such as locomotion required elaborate tracking systems involving physical markers attached to animals' joints (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Belanger et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Austin et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kaya et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aoki et al., 2012</xref>), which is particularly challenging for small animals such as mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akay et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Setogawa et al., 2015</xref>). These hurdles have been largely overcome by modern machine learning tools such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">LeCun et al., 2015</xref>), which accurately track body pose without markers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Mathis et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Graving et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Pereira et al., 2019</xref>). Combining modern machine vision algorithms with high-speed, multi-view imaging allows automatic three-dimensional analyses with high spatial and temporal resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Machado et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Nath et al., 2019</xref>), thus facilitating comprehensive exploration of complex behaviors and their computational underpinnings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anderson and Perona, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Dell et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Krakauer et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Datta et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>We leveraged these recent advances to perform a detailed kinematic analysis of sensory-guided locomotion in head-fixed mice. We show that mice rely on whisker (rather than visual) input to shape limb trajectories while stepping over obstacles at high speeds. This behavior entails a rapid sensorimotor decision in which whisker information and locomotor state are integrated to drive distinct kinematic strategies. These strategies remain largely intact after perturbations of either primary somatosensory or primary motor cortex, suggesting that the decision is made subcortically.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Obstacle clearance during high-speed locomotion in head-fixed mice</title><p>We developed a head-fixed sensory-guided locomotion task compatible with high-throughput, three-dimensional behavioral tracking (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>).

Their running intermittently activated an illuminated cylindrical obstacle ~30 cm away that moved towards them at a speed matching that of the wheel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–B</xref>). Hence, this closed-loop setup simulates stepping over a stationary object. The obstacle was visible for several hundred milliseconds before it reached the mouse (0.67 ± 0.39 s depending on the speed of locomotion), such that mice had the opportunity to make visually driven preparatory gait modifications like those described in other species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Drew et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Higuchi, 2013</xref>). To reduce the predictability of the obstacle’s position, on each trial we randomized the obstacle height (4–10 mm), the wheel distance necessary to engage the obstacle (1.8 ± 0.1 m), and the distance of the obstacle to the mouse when it started moving (0.31 ± 0.015 m).</p><p>Some mice stepped over the obstacle from the very first trial, whereas others tended to grasp it. We therefore adopted a training regimen to discourage grasping in which contact with the obstacle triggered a break of the wheel and a loud auditory stimulus (Materials and methods). After training (~2 weeks), mice successfully cleared the obstacle on a large fraction of trials irrespective of obstacle height (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>; success defined as &lt;= 20 ms of paw contact with the obstacle in a trial).</p><p>Notably, mice maintained high running speeds even as they stepped over the obstacle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref>). In past research in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">van Hedel et al., 2002</xref>), cats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Drew et al., 1996</xref>), rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Sato et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Setogawa et al., 2015</xref>), and mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Asante et al., 2010</xref>), obstacle avoidance was studied at substantially slower speeds associated with walking gaits.

To allow direct comparison with past studies in freely moving rodents, we analyzed kinematics in ‘un-head-fixed’ coordinates by subtracting the displacement of the wheel from the positional measurements (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). Kinematics thus represent locomotion as if mice were moving forward in space. Kinematic analysis revealed that mice ran mostly in a trot pattern, wherein diagonal pairs of limbs move together but are antiphase with the opposite pair (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Bellardita and Kiehn, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Machado et al., 2015</xref>).

Moreover, the state of the body is highly variable across trials at whisker contact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>), implying that mice must rapidly integrate whisker sensory input with information about the state of the body to execute appropriate responses.</p><p>Kinematic analysis of many trials revealed distinct strategies mice use to clear the obstacle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–B</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="video4">Video 4</xref>). We focus our analysis on the forepaw in swing at whisker contact, as this paw is in the most immediate danger of colliding with the obstacle absent kinematic modifications. On some trials, this paw continues along its expected trajectory, whereas on other trials the step is shortened or lengthened relative to control steps. On shortened trials, the paw is placed in front of the obstacle such that the opposite paw can step over first, and on lengthened trials the paw usually (on 74% of trials) clears the obstacle in one large step. These step modifications were initiated rapidly. Within less than 30 ms of whisker contact the kinematic trajectory of the forepaw changed significantly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>; Materials and methods). These strategies were no longer apparent with whiskers trimmed and lights off (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>, bottom).

We identified features of the body state and obstacle position that are predictive of whether mice shortened or lengthened their step (omitting trials where no modifications were made [Materials and methods]) by sequentially adding them to logistic Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) based on their ability to improve the models’ accuracy (Materials and methods). Consistent with a deterministic decision-making process, models predicted the behavioral strategy with 73.0% accuracy using eight predictors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Artificial neural networks trained with the same predictors had comparable accuracy of 73.1%, suggesting that the decision underlying this behavior may obey a relatively simple logic. Mice were less successful on trials in which their decision violated the predictions of the model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1E</xref>; p&lt;0.001), suggesting that correct decision-making facilitates obstacle clearance.</p><p>The top features selected by the model suggest that the decision is influenced by both the state of the body and the position of the obstacle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C,D</xref>). The top two features were obstacle proximity (the horizontal position of the obstacle at whisker contact; blue) and the horizontal paw position (orange). Mice are more likely to lengthen their step when whisker contact occurs early in the swing phase (when the horizontal paw velocity [purple] is low and the horizontal paw position [orange] is further back) and when mice are running faster (yellow). Furthermore, mice are less likely to lengthen their step when the obstacle is high (magenta) and far away (blue).</p><p>To better understand why mice lengthen or shorten their step on a given trial, we plotted kinematics for the forepaw in swing at whisker contact binned by the likelihood of the step being lengthened (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). We compared these to the kinematics we would expect if no modifications were made (dashed gray traces; Materials and methods). A clear pattern emerged: the closer the paw would have landed to the obstacle, the more the step is shortened. However, when the paw would have landed very close to or beyond the obstacle, mice tend to extend the paw to clear it in one large step. This decision-making threshold can be clearly visualized by plotting the landing position probability distributions conditioned on the landing position expected if no modifications are made (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>).</p><p>The integrity of this decision-making process depends upon the whiskers. When mice have vision but no whiskers their paw no longer lands cleanly in front of or beyond the obstacle. Rather, the bimodal landing position distribution, which is characteristic of the decision-making process, becomes diffuse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). Furthermore, models trained on whiskers-only trials were less accurate when evaluated on light-only trials, suggesting that the decision-making process is meaningfully altered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1F</xref>, p&lt;0.05, ‘W’ vs. ‘W <bold>→</bold> L’ conditions). Consistent with this interpretation, mice no longer lengthen or shorten their step based on where it would have landed if no modifications were made (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>; the predicted [x axis] and actual landing distance [y axis] are similar, such that the landing position distribution clusters around the unity line). Thus, although mice still make kinematic modifications with vision only, these modifications are less accurate and no longer evince the fast decision process that occurs when whiskers are present. Although we cannot rule out the possibility that vision could be utilized in more naturalistic, head-free circumstances, these results demonstrate that whiskers are sufficient for driving a rapid, body-state dependent sensorimotor transformation.</p><p>Finally, mice with neither whiskers nor vision fail to make modifications except when their paws collide with the obstacle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G–H</xref>), and models trained on these trials have reduced accuracy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1F</xref>, p&lt;0.05), ruling out roles for other sensory modalities.

Lesions and inactivation of motor cortex impair both baseline locomotion and obstacle clearance acutely but leave the decision-making process largely intact. Finally, barrel cortex lesions have minimal effects on the behavior, consistent with a subcortical locus for a rapid whisker-based sensorimotor transformation.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>A whisker-mediated sensorimotor transformation independent of barrel cortex</title><p>Whisking is important for guiding locomotion in rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Grant et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Arkley et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Sofroniew et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Grant et al., 2018</xref>).

Our results support this hypothesis, demonstrating that mice use whiskers to detect obstacles, determine their location, and drive rapid responses to avoid collision even at high speeds.</p><p>Although mice had access to visual information several hundred milliseconds prior to whisker contact, the only visually guided anticipatory adjustment we observed was a reduction in running speed on light-on trials. Hence the strategies for obstacle avoidance adopted by mice in the present task contrast with the precise visually guided adjustments of gait, for example of the positioning of the penultimate step, observed in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Higuchi, 2013</xref>) and cats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Drew et al., 1996</xref>). We cannot rule out that head-fixation and the absence of full-field optic flow in our task disrupted the normal use of vision. Nevertheless, given that mice are largely nocturnal and have relatively poor visual spatial acuity, the rapid whisker-based gait adjustments observed here are likely to be ethologically significant.</p><p>What brain regions transmit the whisker information required for obstacle clearance? Barrel cortex neurons are capable of responding to whisker input at short latencies (as fast as 10 ms) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Crochet and Petersen, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Constantinople and Bruno, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Yu et al., 2019</xref>), exhibit locomotor-related activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ayaz et al., 2019</xref>), and send projections to subcortical motor areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Aronoff et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Bosman et al., 2011</xref>). Moreover, barrel cortex has been implicated in other forms of whisker-guided locomotion (e.g. wall-tracking) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Sofroniew et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ayaz et al., 2019</xref>). Although recent work has shown that barrel cortex is dispensable for object detection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Hong et al., 2018</xref>), obstacle clearance additionally requires determining the location of the obstacle by integrating information across multiple whiskers and rapidly adjusting motor output accordingly. Nonetheless, mice were able to perform the task without barrel cortex. Lesions caused minor decreases in success that recovered within 4 days, and the correlation between the height of the leading forepaw and that of the obstacle was unaffected. It cannot be ruled out that the initial performance decrease reflects a role for barrel cortex in the pre-lesioned state. However, control lesions also caused minor decreases in performance, suggesting that the effects of barrel cortex lesions are at least partially attributable to non-specific effects of the manipulation. Further work is needed to resolve this question fully.</p><p>The barrel cortex lesion results suggest that subcortical structures are sufficient for transmitting whisker sensory information in this task. Although whisker sensory input is widely distributed in the rodent brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kleinfeld et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Aronoff et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Bosman et al., 2011</xref>), two particularly intriguing candidate structures are the cerebellum and the spinal trigeminal nucleus (Sp5).

It is notable that while the logic underlying the decision process is relatively simple, revealing it involved the analysis of a large amount of high-dimensional data (&gt;100,000 trials and &gt;150 million video frames).

Nonetheless, cortical manipulations had minimal effects on the decision underlying obstacle clearance. A subcortical locus for the decision is consistent with its rapidity and fits with a rich body of literature supporting the view that even ‘low-level’ reflexes possess considerable sophistication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Poppele and Bosco, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Rossignol et al., 2006</xref>).

Remarkably, even the basic motor program for stepping over obstacles may be present in the spinal cord, as shown by studies of spinalized cats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Forssberg et al., 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Forssberg et al., 1977</xref>).

Similarly here, hindbrain pathways may transmit descending whisker signals that are integrated with information about the state of the body within spinal circuits. The decision-making process would thus be defined by feedback rules governing the relationship between whisker sensory input, body state, and subsequent locomotor modifications.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>All experimental protocols were approved by the Columbia University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (protocol AC-AABG4566).

This amount was increased over ~6 days to 5.4 m (nine wheel rotations), which took ~5–9 days. The position of the head was sometimes fixed further down (ventral) or back (posterior) to encourage running early in training. The head position was gradually adjusted (~1–2 mm per day) until it reached a standard position that was the same for all mice.</p><p>Obstacle training then began. Three obstacles were introduced between every reward (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The movement of the obstacle was matched to the movement of the wheel to simulate moving toward a stationary object. The three obstacles started moving 0.9, 2.7, and 4.5 m after the previous reward, but the positions were jittered ±100 mm (uniformly sampled on this interval) to prevent mice from memorizing the position at which the obstacles arrive. Obstacles were 0.31 m away from the mouse when they started moving; this distance was jittered ±15 mm (uniformly sampled on this interval). The height of the obstacle (the vertical distance between the highest point on the wheel and the highest point of the obstacle) was randomized uniformly across trials between 4 and 10 mm. The behavior occurred in darkness other than a light emitted from the inside of the obstacle that was engaged in a random 50% of trials unless otherwise stated.</p><p>To encourage mice to step over (rather than on) the obstacle, it was equipped with a capacitive touch sensor that detected when mice grabbed it.

Barrel field mapping was always conducted on the side of the brain contralateral to the remaining whiskers, and ipsilateral lesions were targeted to the same region on the opposite side of the brain. Intrinsic signal optical imaging of barrel cortex was performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Hong et al., 2018</xref>). Briefly, head-fixed mice were lightly anesthetized with isoflurane while responses to whisker deflection were imaged with a 590 nm long-pass filtered illumination through a thinned skull over barrel cortex. Whiskers were individually deflected with a piezo stimulator at 5 Hz and the corresponding active region was marked using the surface vasculature as a reference. In some cases, the barrels were instead mapped electrophysiologically in isoflurane-anesthetized mice. A ~ 2 mm diameter craniotomy was made around 1.5 mm posterior and 3.2 mm lateral to Bregma. ﻿Glass pipettes (3–4 MOhm) were filled with artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) and inserted into the craniotomy at 350–550 μm below the pial surface. Individual whiskers were manually deflected using a glass Pasteur pipette while amplified and band-pass filtered (0.3–10 kHz) signals were played on an audio monitor to determine the responsive barrel in cortex.</p><p>Lesions were performed in trained animals under isoflurane. To avoid damage to other somatosensory areas outside of the barrel fields, the medial barrel field was carefully mapped (delta and E-row) to delineate the barrel field boundaries. A 2–3 mm craniotomy was made according to the mapped barrel fields, and cortical tissue was aspirated using a blunt-tipped needle connected to a vacuum.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7-2"><title>Motor cortex</title><p>Motor cortex lesions were stereotactically targeted to the forelimb motor cortex. After the muscimol experiments described above, the same mice were trained for at least 2 days without manipulation. A ~2 mm diameter unilateral lesion was then performed over the forelimb motor cortex (centered at the location of the previous muscimol injection: 1.5 mm lateral, 0.25 mm anterior of bregma). Cortical tissue was aspirated using a blunt-tipped needle connected to a vacuum. Mice were given 200–400 µl of water during recovery before testing the following day for both motor and barrel cortex lesions.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Behavioral tracking</title><p>We used the Kinemouse Wheel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Warren and Hoffman, 2018</xref>) to capture two orthogonal views of the mouse simultaneously at 250 Hz. We trained a single DeepLabCut network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Mathis and Warren, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Mathis et al., 2018</xref>) to track the positions of body parts and the obstacle in both views, and then stitched the tracking together to reconstruct the body pose in three dimensions. In both the top and bottom view, we tracked all four paws, the base of the tail, the middle of the tail, the nose, and the obstacle.</p><p>We initially trained the model on ~200 frames that were labeled using a custom MATLAB GUI. We then manually identified frames with erroneous tracking, corrected these frames, included them in an expanded training set, and retrained the model. This process was repeated until the model was highly accurate and the training set consisted of ~1000 images. The final model’s average error was 1.02 pixels (0.27 mm) on the training set and 2.29 pixels (0.60 mm) on the test set.</p><p>To further enhance tracking performance, we (1) removed low confidence tracked locations (those beneath a threshold of 0.99), (2) removed tracking when features violated a velocity constraint (i.e. when a feature jumped a large distance in adjacent frames), (3) applied temporal median filtering with a window size of 3 frames, (4) removed tracking when the x position of a feature in the top view was not close to that of the same feature in the bottom view (the x values of the same feature should approximately match because this dimension is shared in the two views), and (5) interpolated the small number of missing values.</p><p>To allow direct comparison with freely moving mice, we analyzed kinematics in ‘un-head-fixed’ coordinates by subtracting the displacement of the wheel (as determined by a high-resolution rotary encoder [U.S. Digital S5-720-250-IE-S-B]) from the kinematic measurements. After this transformation, the position of the obstacle is constant, whereas the mouse moves forward in space.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Paw contact analysis</title><sec id="s4-9-1"><title>Overview</title><p>To detect different types of paw contacts with the obstacle, we built a custom convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithm using Python and fastai (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Howard, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F–H</xref>). First, frames were center cropped around the obstacle in the top view. A ResNet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">He, 2016</xref>)-based CNN classified each subframe as either: no touch, forepaw dorsal touch, forepaw ventral touch, hindpaw dorsal touch, hindpaw ventral (low) touch, or hindpaw ventral (high) touch.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9-2"><title>Image preprocessing</title><p>Images were normalized by statistics fitted on ImageNet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Deng, 2020</xref>) (channel-specific means: [0.485, 0.456, 0.406], standard deviation: [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9-3"><title>Labeling</title><p>Training data were labeled by three people using a custom MATLAB GUI. Approximately 30% of trials in 15 sessions were labeled, only including frames when the obstacle is visible. Labelers classified each frame according to the groups listed above.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9-4"><title>Network training</title><p>The paw contact network was trained using a transfer learning approach on ResNeXt50 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Xie, 2017</xref>) pre-trained on ImageNet. A total of 87,239 training frames were used, split into 80% training and 20% validation sets. Data augmentation was performed during training, including random rotation within 10° and lighting changes up to 5%. Training was completed in stages, beginning with scaled-down images of size 42 × 42, then 84 × 84, and ending with the full 168 × 168 images. Categorical cross-entropy loss with class weights was used. Class weights were computed based on the number of training examples per class to compensate for uneven class sizes. The paw contact classifier performed with an overall accuracy of 94.3%, an F1 score of 95%, precision of 96%, and recall of 94% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1H</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9-5"><title>Implementation</title><p>For each session, cropped images surrounding the obstacle were extracted and processed with the paw contact network. To increase accuracy, test time augmentation was used, wherein four differently augmented versions of each frame were inferenced. Final analysis results were the average of all augmented frame predictions.</p><p>The network distinguishes between fore and hind paws, but not left and right paws. To address this, we used DeepLabCut tracking results to determine which paw (left vs. right) was close to the obstacle at each contact frame. For all subsequent analyses, the hindpaw ventral (high) touch class was not used.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9-6"><title>Success determination</title><p>Successful trials were those in which there was &lt;= 20 ms of paw contact with the obstacle. When determining the success of individual paws (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>), successful trials were those in which there was no contact with the obstacle.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Whisker contact analysis</title><sec id="s4-10-1"><title>Overview</title><p>We built a custom CNN-based whisker contact algorithm using Python and Keras (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Chollet, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1I–K</xref>). Whisker contacts were determined using a high-speed camera focused on the whiskers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–C</xref>). A combination of LEAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Pereira et al., 2019</xref>) and a custom shallow CNN was used to determine the first moment of whisker contact in each trial (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1I–K</xref>). First, LEAP identified the obstacle in the whisker camera. Images cropped around the obstacle were then evaluated on contiguous sequences of 10 frames in sliding windows. For each sequence, a shallow CNN-based network classified the frame within the sequence at which whisker contact first occurred.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10-2"><title>Model description</title><p>The location of the obstacle was determined using LEAP. Images were cropped to 200 × 200 pixels around the obstacle and then down sampled to 100 × 100 pixels. The whisker contact network uses a shallow CNN to generate a 5408-dimensional feature vector for each of the 10 contiguous frames (with the same network processing each frame in parallel). These vectors are concatenated and fed into a two-layer fully connected network, which outputs a probability that each frame is the frame of first whisker contact. This analysis is performed in sliding windows across a trial, and the whisker contact frame is determined via consensus across the sliding windows (see below).</p><p>The shallow CNN in the whisker contact network is composed of the following layers: 7 × 7 kernel convolution, 32 filters, 2 × 2 stride, same padding; 3 × 3 kernel convolution, 32 filters, 1 × 1 stride, same padding; 2 × 2 kernel max pooling, 2 × 2 stride, same padding; 3 × 3 kernel convolution, 32 filters, 1 × 1 stride, same padding; and flattening (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1J</xref>). All activations are ReLU. The final fully connected network is composed of two layers: a 64-neuron hidden layer with ReLU activation, and a 10-neuron output layer with softmax activation.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10-3"><title>Labeling</title><p>A custom Python GUI was used to label the first frame of whisker contact in ~30% of trials from 13 sessions. Training images were then exported for each trial only for frames where the obstacle is visible. This yielded 44,740 training frames, which were split into 80% training and 20% validation sets.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10-4"><title>Training</title><p>The whisker contact network, consisting of both the shallow CNN and the two fully connected layers, was trained end-to-end. Inputs were given as 10 consecutive frames. Ground truth labels were encoded as 11-dimensional one-hot vectors. If the frame of first contact was present in the 10 frames, the relative position (1-10) would be set to 1. If the frame of first contact was not present, the 11th position was set to 1. Although the shallow CNN is used to process all 10 frames in parallel, the weights are shared across all instances and are trained simultaneously.</p><p>Training was conducted with a batch size of 32 for 25 epochs using the Adam optimizer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kingma and Ba, 2015</xref>) with a learning rate of 0.001. Categorical cross-entropy loss was used, with class weighting based on the number of training examples per class to compensate for uneven class sizes. Data augmentation was also applied, including vertical/horizontal translation (&lt;=10 pixels), zoom (&lt;=10%), and rotation (&lt;=10°).</p><p>Contact time predictions on the test set had a mean error of −6.6 ms (−1.6 frames at 250 fps) and a standard deviation of 14.3 ms, with negative errors corresponding to early predictions. Train and test error distributions match well, implying good generalization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1K</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-10-5"><title>Implementation</title><p>Sessions were analyzed trial-by-trial. Only frames where the obstacle was close to the mouse were included. Each frame is first passed through the shallow CNN to extract features. Next, the two-layer fully connected network is slid across all applicable frames with stride of 1. A running total of the number of times each frame is determined to be the first contact frame is kept. The frame that is selected the maximum number of times is chosen as the frame of first contact.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Whisker trimming experiment</title><p>In a subset of mice (n = 4), we assessed performance as whiskers were gradually trimmed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>). There were six conditions, beginning with all whiskers intact and ending with only the delta whisker remaining on one side (depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Specifically, mice were first tested with (1) all whiskers intact; then (2) all whiskers trimmed on one side of the face; then (3) all but columns A-E, rows 1–3, gamma, and delta trimmed; then (4) columns A-C additionally trimmed; then (5) column D additionally trimmed; and finally (6) only the delta whisker remaining. Performance was assessed for a minimum of 3 days in each condition before proceeding to the next condition.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Locomotion analysis</title><sec id="s4-12-1"><title>Stance determination</title><p>Paws were determined to be in stance when the vertical position of the paw was close to the wheel and the horizontal velocity matched that of the wheel. Specifically, for each paw stance was defined as frames were the horizontal velocity was within 0.2 m/s of the wheel velocity, and the vertical position was within 5 mm of the wheel surface. A 20 ms median filter was then applied to debounce the signal for each paw.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12-2"><title>Control steps</title><p>For each paw in each trial, control steps were defined as the two latest steps that occurred prior to whisker contact with the obstacle.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12-3"><title>Time to contact estimation</title><p>We estimated the amount of time from whisker contact until a paw would intercept the obstacle if no modifications were made (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). For each trial, we measured the most anterior x position across all paws for each frame. For the 100 frames preceding whisker contact (400 ms), we performed a linear fit for this signal as a function of time, then estimated the time at which the position would intercept that of the obstacle.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Decision-making analysis</title><p>All decision-making analyses focus on the forepaw that is in swing at whisker contact. Because the forepaws are typically out of phase with one another (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>), there is usually a single forepaw in swing at whisker contact. However, on some trials both forepaws were in swing, or both were in stance. These trials were excluded from all decision-making analyses.</p><sec id="s4-13-1"><title>Predicted landing distance</title><p>For each trial, we estimated where the forepaw in swing at whisker contact would have landed if no modifications were made. The length of steps are highly correlated with running speed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Machado et al., 2015</xref>) (<italic>r</italic> = 0.84 ± 0.01; mean ± S.E.M. for the wheel speed – forepaw length correlations across 53 sessions [n = 20 mice; 2–4 sessions per mouse]), which allowed us to predict where the paw would have landed based on the wheel velocity. For each session, we built a linear model for each paw that predicts step length based on running speed. To train the model, we used the control steps immediately preceding whisker contact. We predicted the forepaw landing position for control steps with 5.5 ± 0.11 mm mean absolute error (mean ± S.E.M. for 53 sessions [n = 20 mice]). Finally, we used this model to predict where the forepaw in swing at whisker contact would have landed based on the wheel speed and the lift-off position for this paw.</p><p>For sessions in which whiskers were fully trimmed we estimated the moment at which contact would have occurred if whiskers were present; this estimate was used to identify the forepaw in swing at ‘whisker contact’ for subsequent analyses. Relying on a modest correlation (<italic>r</italic> = 0.27) between whisker contact position and running speed, we built linear models relating trial running speed to whisker contact position for each mouse for sessions in which the whiskers were present. These models were used to approximate the times at which whisker contact would have occurred in sessions with no whiskers.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13-2"><title>Behavior modeling</title><p>We built logistic GLMs to predict whether the forepaw in swing at whisker contact was lengthened or shortened relative to the predicted landing distance. We measured eight features at the moment of whisker contact that served as inputs to the model: the vertical and horizontal position of the obstacle, the vertical and horizontal position and velocity of the forepaw in swing at contact, wheel velocity, and body angle. To focus on trials where modifications were made, we discarded those in which the paw landed in front of the obstacle and within ±2.5 mm of the predicted landing position. Steps over the obstacle require modifications in the vertical trajectory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) and were therefore considered to be modified regardless of landing position. Heatmaps (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>) and kinematic overlays (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>) included trials with and without modifications to display the overall distribution of landing positions unless otherwise stated.</p><p>For each mouse, we built one model per experimental condition, with trials pooled across sessions within a condition (e.g. one model for all muscimol sessions per mouse and another for all saline sessions per mouse). For each model, we performed 15-fold cross validation. The accuracy of the model was taken to be the average accuracy across the 15 models. We weighted trials to compensate for uneven class sizes. A final model trained on all data was evaluated on shuffled targets to establish baseline performance, which hovered around 50%, as expected. We also compared performance to fully connected artificial neural networks with a single hidden layer (100 units), but these models did not perform better than the GLMs.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13-3"><title>Forward feature selection</title><p>To determine which features to include in the models we gradually added them based on their ability to improve the models’ accuracy. Starting with single predictors, we trained models and assessed their accuracy after adding each of the remaining predictors one at a time. The predictor that caused the greatest average (across mice) increase in accuracy was then included in the model. This process was repeated until all predictors were exhausted. All eight predictors were included in all subsequent models.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Reaction time analysis</title><p>To determine the speed with which mice responded to whisker input we compared the kinematic trajectories of the forepaw in swing at whisker contact to the trajectories that would be expected if no obstacle had been presented (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>). We restricted the analysis to trials in which the paw was mid-swing.</p><p>For each trial, we used k-nearest neighbors to collect a family of 40 matched control steps that were as close as possible to the pre-contact kinematic trajectory for the trial (control steps were those occurring before contact with the obstacle). Averaging these steps yields an estimate of what the paw would have done if no obstacle were presented. Subtracting the actual trajectory from this estimate gives us a measure of kinematic change (in x, y, and z) as a function of time relative to whisker contact for each trial.</p><p>To verify that these differences did not emerge due to failures in our ability to estimate the kinematics that would have occurred if no obstacle were presented, we performed the same analysis on control steps, using the antepenultimate step to predict what would have happened in the penultimate step before whisker contact. There was very little deviation between the predicted and actual trajectories for control steps (black traces in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>).</p><p>Reaction time was estimated as the moment at which kinematics diverged from the control trajectories. For each trial, we determined the moment at which the trajectory deviates more than 2.5 standard deviations from the population of matched control steps for that trial. This yields a median latency estimate of 24 ms. We emphasize that this is only an estimate of the reaction time; errors are introduced both by the estimation of the moment of whisker contact, as well as the estimation of the kinematics that would have occurred if no obstacle were presented.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Statistics</title><p>All statistical comparisons are paired t-tests, with statistical significance denoted as *p&lt;0.05, **p&lt;0.01, and ***p&lt;0.001. To validate the use of parametric statistics, we used Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests to check distribution normality for paw heights, success rates, wheel velocity, body angle, tail height, the landing distance of the paw in swing at contact, model accuracies, and the variability of the trailing forepaw landing distance. We performed these tests on the baseline data collected for the 20 mice included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>. We failed to reject the null hypothesis that the data are normally distributed for all measures.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Tanya Tabachnik for advice on the design of the KineMouse Wheel and the behavioral apparatus; Chris Rodgers and Avner Wallach for advice on the design of the behavioral apparatus; and Caroline Yu for materials and advice used in the construction of the KineMouse Wheel.

Thus the revisions requested below only address clarity and presentation.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In their manuscript, “A Rapid Sensorimotor Decision Underlies Skilled Locomotion in Mice Largely Independent of Cerebral Cortex,” Warren et al. present a novel behavioral paradigm to study obstacle avoidance in head-fixed mice, and describe a set of experiments that test the sensory modalities involved and cortical regions important in this behavior. They show that mice modulate their step length and height to avoid obstacles, and that obstacle avoidance is dependent on whisker input, but not visual input. They discover distinct “strategies” (called a decision) for rapid, sensible paw adjustments that avoid obstacle collision by either going above or below the obstacle. Although obstacle avoidance in this task is whisker-dependent, the behavior is independent of the vibrassal primary sensory cortex. The strengths of this paper are the rigorous behavioral analysis and the execution of the task in head-fixed mice, a tractable prep. The identification of a “sensorimotor decision” related to a binary-like choice of sending the paw over or in front of the obstacle opens up opportunities to study rapid, on the fly behavioral adjustments. Even though the biological discoveries in this paper are unsurprising (see below), reviewers agreed that the paper is timely and of high quality on the behavior-side. The data in the paper support the claims and the analyses were mostly clearly presented. We thus generally support this paper for publication provided some concerns are addressed:</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>(1) Framing of the paper</p><p>(1a) The authors both implicitly and, in some cases, explicitly compare the strategies employed, and the neural mechanisms involved, in these experiments with those used in cats and humans making gait modifications on the basis of visual information. However, the important differences in the nature of the tasks is not explicitly introduced or discussed. Clearly, the experiments in cats that are referred to in this manuscript are studying the neural mechanisms underlying anticipatory changes in gait that are initiated by visual examination of the environment. Subjects have generally hundreds of milliseconds or seconds between the detection of the object to be avoided and the time that the movement is executed. As such, there is ample time for decisional processes to act. In contrast, in the current experiments, mice have to modify their gait within 63 ms of detection of an obstacle. Even when vision is used as a stimulus (as far as I can tell, see below), it is only available at the last moment. As such the strategies are reactive to the tactile stimulus. This is not to deny that the mice are able to make clearly adaptive modifications of gait in response to these stimuli. However, I think that there is a need to explicitly introduce and discuss these issues. The Discussion in particular should have a section specifically comparing strategies and the possible similarities and differences in the neural mechanisms that may underlie sensorimotor transformations in the two situations.</p><p>(1b) The discussion of the lesion results requires more nuance to allow for possible involvement of a lesioned structure when it is intact.</p><p>For instance, the authors write:</p><p>&quot;The apparent lack of barrel cortex involvement suggests that subcortical structures are responsible for transmitting whisker sensory information in this task&quot;</p><p>Strictly speaking, “responsible” should be changed to “sufficient.”</p><p>The data show that there is substantial behavioral perturbation following vS1 lesion, but that time yields recovery of behavior. In most mice with intact vS1, however, vS1 is in fact being used for this task, contrary to this statement. Moreover, if Hong / Otchy are anything to go by, transient (optogenetic/pharmacological) vS1 inactivation would presumably perturb the behavior trial-by-trial. If I were studying vS1 in the context of this task, then, I would feel comfortable interpreting its neural activity as, usually, task-relevant. Of course, something clearly happens post lesion (as in other studies, again, of this genre) that allows the animal to compensate for the loss of vS1 (and, presumably, in some animals, this is the initial state pre-lesion; see below), but I think it is very unfortunate that much of the field has interpreted experiments of this nature as demonstrating lack of involvement. The experiments show the possibility of recovery, but if they say anything about involvement in unlesioned mice. The authors do not rule out that vS1 is probably involved in the task when it is intact.</p><p>(2) Interpretation and presentation of vision-deprivation experiments</p><p>(2a) There is insufficient information in the manuscript to allow the reader to appropriately interpret the experiments involving visual information (or at least, I am unable to find it).

However, the important differences in the nature of the tasks is not explicitly introduced or discussed. Clearly, the experiments in cats that are referred to in this manuscript are studying the neural mechanisms underlying anticipatory changes in gait that are initiated by visual examination of the environment. Subjects have generally hundreds of milliseconds or seconds between the detection of the object to be avoided and the time that the movement is executed. As such, there is ample time for decisional processes to act. In contrast, in the current experiments, mice have to modify their gait within 63 ms of detection of an obstacle. Even when vision is used as a stimulus (as far as I can tell, see below), it is only available at the last moment. As such the strategies are reactive to the tactile stimulus. This is not to deny that the mice are able to make clearly adaptive modifications of gait in response to these stimuli. However, I think that there is a need to explicitly introduce and discuss these issues. The Discussion in particular should have a section specifically comparing strategies and the possible similarities and differences in the neural mechanisms that may underlie sensorimotor transformations in the two situations.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that there are important differences between this and related paradigms that were insufficiently discussed in the original manuscript. Importantly, the obstacle apparatus was designed to give mice time to incorporate visual information into their behavioral strategy. The obstacle becomes visible ~30 cm away from the mouse, giving them 672 ± 394 ms to respond (depending on the speed of locomotion). Mice nonetheless relied on whiskers to perform the task even when vision was present. Thus, the differences in strategy are more likely to reflect biological differences between mice and other species rather than differences in task design. A paragraph has been added to the Discussion specifically addressing the relationship between this and related paradigms.</p><p>Furthermore, the non-motorized wheel allows mice to determine the speed at which the task occurs. Therefore, strictly speaking, mice do not have to respond in ~63 ms. Rather, they choose to run at speeds that minimize the utility of preparatory modifications. We were surprised by this behavior initially. We built a long obstacle track to study how distal visual and proximal whisker sensory input are integrated to drive behavior. That mice perform the task at least as well in the dark is a testament to the utility of whiskers as collision detectors capable of driving fast behavioral responses.</p><p>Although visual input is made available well in advance of whisker contact, there are important differences between this visual stimulus and the visual information available in more natural settings. As the reviewers pointed out, head fixation certainly limits the usefulness of vision, as mice cannot adjust the angle of their head to focus on the obstacle (although head fixation is likely detrimental to the whisker system as well). Furthermore, in natural settings, full-field visual flow is a rich source of information that may help localize obstacles. Therefore, the sensory dependence experiments tell us more about what can be done with whiskers alone than what can be done with vision under natural circumstances. We raise this important consideration in the Results and Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(1b) The discussion of the lesion results requires more nuance to allow for possible involvement of a lesioned structure when it is intact.</p><p>For instance, the authors write:</p><p>&quot;The apparent lack of barrel cortex involvement suggests that subcortical structures are responsible for transmitting whisker sensory information in this task&quot;</p><p>Strictly speaking, “responsible” should be changed to “sufficient.”</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and have changed “responsible” to “sufficient”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The data show that there is substantial behavioral perturbation following vS1 lesion, but that time yields recovery of behavior. In most mice with intact vS1, however, vS1 is in fact being used for this task, contrary to this statement. Moreover, if Hong / Otchy are anything to go by, transient (optogenetic/pharmacological) vS1 inactivation would presumably perturb the behavior trial-by-trial. If I were studying vS1 in the context of this task, then, I would feel comfortable interpreting its neural activity as, usually, task-relevant. Of course, something clearly happens post lesion (as in other studies, again, of this genre) that allows the animal to compensate for the loss of vS1 (and, presumably, in some animals, this is the initial state pre-lesion; see below), but I think it is very unfortunate that much of the field has interpreted experiments of this nature as demonstrating lack of involvement. The experiments show the possibility of recovery, but if they say anything about involvement in unlesioned mice. The authors do not rule out that vS1 is probably involved in the task when it is intact.</p></disp-quote><p>The data strongly support the conclusion that barrel cortex is not required for the task. We agree, however, that assessing the role of barrel cortex in the pre-lesioned state is much more challenging. Generally speaking, short-term effects that recover over time could reflect some combination of (1) direct involvement of the manipulated brain region in the task followed by compensation by other brain regions, (2) changes in connected brain regions that are themselves involved in the task followed by compensation for these effects (so-called diaschisis), or (3) non-specific effects of surgical manipulation. The reviewers favor interpretation (1), referring to “substantial behavioral perturbation” and stating that for “most mice… vS1 is in fact being used for this task”. We agree that some pre-lesion involvement of vS1 cannot be ruled out, and we state as much in the revised text (subsections “Obstacle Clearance Intact After Barrel Cortex Lesions” and “A whisker-mediated sensorimotor transformation independent of barrel cortex”). However, the data suggest factors (2) and (3) are at a minimum partially responsible for the observed effects.</p><p>In the original manuscript we failed to draw attention to control lesions ipsilateral the remaining whiskers. These lesions also cause small effects that recover over time, which may account for ~50% of the decrease seen for the contralateral/bilateral lesions (Cohen’s <italic>d</italic> = 0.062 for control lesions vs. 0.133 for contralateral/bilateral lesions; compare Figure 4C and Figure 4—figure supplement 1B). Importantly, mice were tested the day after the lesion, so non-specific, short-term effects are perhaps unsurprising. The effects of barrel cortex lesions are therefore unlikely to reflect substantial involvement of vS1 even at baseline. We also note that the shaping of paw height to obstacle height, which in our view is an equally important metric of performance on the task as success, was completely unaffected by barrel cortex lesions. The text has been revised to emphasize this (subsection “Obstacle Clearance Intact After Barrel Cortex Lesions”).</p><p>The reviewers also raise the interesting possibility that animals may vary in the extent to which barrel cortex is utilized in the task, thus explaining across-mouse variability in lesion effects. Alternatively, the variability may be due to differences in the extent of the lesions or non-specific differences in the ability of mice to recover immediately from surgical manipulations. Although we cannot resolve this question with the current data (see below), we agree with the reviewers that vS1 involvement cannot be ruled out. We raise this point in both the Results and Discussion, and draw attention to the control lesions such that readers have the opportunity to draw their own conclusions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Interpretation and presentation of vision-deprivation experiments</p><p>(2a) There is insufficient information in the manuscript to allow the reader to appropriately interpret the experiments involving visual information (or at least, I am unable to find it).
