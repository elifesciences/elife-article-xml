A conserved response to DSBs is an increase in chromatin mobility that can be local, at the site of the DSB, or global, at undamaged regions of the genome. Here, we address the function of global chromatin mobility during homologous recombination (HR) of a single, targeted, controlled DSB. We set up a system that tracks HR in vivo over time and show that two types of DSB-induced global chromatin mobility are involved in HR, depending on the position of the DSB. Close to the centromere, a DSB induces global mobility that depends solely on H2A(X) phosphorylation and accelerates repair kinetics, but is not essential. In contrast, the global mobility induced by a DSB away from the centromere becomes essential for HR repair and is triggered by homology search through a mechanism that depends on H2A(X) phosphorylation, checkpoint progression, and Rad51. Our data demonstrate that global mobility is governed by chromosomal conformation and differentially coordinates repair by HR.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>chromatin

constantly challenge the eukaryotic genome. DSBs can lead to deleterious genetic alterations such as modifications of the DNA at the DSB site (insertions/deletions) or global chromosomal rearrangements (translocations). To faithfully maintain genome stability and survive DSBs, cells display a DNA damage response (DDR) involving complex networks that detect, signal, and repair DSBs. Two of the most conserved factors contributing to DSB signaling are the checkpoint kinases Tel1 and Mec1 (mammalian ATM/ATR orthologues) that catalyze the phosphorylation of histone H2A in yeast and of H2AX in mammalian cells, forming γ-H2A(X) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jackson and Bartek, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Waterman et al., 2020</xref>). γ-H2A(X) extends widely on both sides of the DSB, up to 100 kb in yeast and 1 MB in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aymard et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Caron et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Iacovoni et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rogakou et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Shroff et al., 2004</xref>). This wide spreading of γ-H2A(X) serves as a docking site for further DDR proteins such as the mediator protein Rad9 (53BP1 in mammals) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kinner et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>DSBs can be accurately repaired by homologous recombination (HR). This mode of repair, predominant in S phase, uses the sister chromatid as template (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Symington and Gautier, 2011</xref>). When homologous sequences are not found in the close vicinity of the break, a global genomic homology search may occur. Homology search starts with the formation of a presynaptic nucleoprotein filament that is composed of 3’-ssDNA overhangs coated with the recombinase protein Rad51 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kalocsay et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sugawara et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wang and Haber, 2004</xref>). The Rad51 nucleofilament enables the sampling and recognition of homology within the nucleus through base pairing reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kaniecki et al., 2018</xref>. By analyzing Rad51 distribution in haploid yeast after the induction of a single DSB by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), a study visualized ‘snapshots’ of ongoing homology search, and found Rad51 strikingly distributed over a large portion of the broken chromosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Renkawitz et al., 2013</xref>). Notably, the genome-wide Rad51 signal distribution was concomitant with that of Mec1-dependent γ-H2A(X), suggesting that Mec1 might be attached on the probing end during homology search. The resulting phosphorylation of H2A(X) could thus promote chromatin remodeling, signaling, or repair.</p><p>The non-random organization of chromosomes in the nucleus affects numerous nuclear processes including homology search. In the configuration of budding yeast chromosomes (known as the Rabl configuration), centromeres are clustered close to the yeast microtubule organizing center (spindle pole body), as evidenced by abundant <italic>trans</italic>-contacts between centromeres, and telomeres are bound to the nuclear periphery in a position that depends on the size of the chromosome arms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Duan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jin et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Schober et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Therizols et al., 2010</xref>). It was shown in yeast that DSBs recombine more efficiently in spatially proximal regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agmon et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Batté et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lee et al., 2015</xref>). Recombination between homologous sequences that lie close to centromeres is more efficient than between regions that are distantly located on chromosome arms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agmon et al., 2013</xref>). Accordingly, induction of a DSB close to a centromere triggers concomitant Rad51 and γ-H2A(X) signals within centromeric regions of all other yeast chromosomes, suggesting that homology search can efficiently occur on DNA that is located proximal to the centromere of other chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lee et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Renkawitz et al., 2013</xref>). Likewise, mammalian topologically associated domains (TADs), where chromatin contacts are enriched, promote diffusion of ATM, which allows DSB signaling and thus repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arnould et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>The search for distantly located homologous regions challenges recombination, likely requiring additional sophisticated mechanisms, such as chromatin mobility. Originally observed in yeast, increased chromatin mobility, both at the damaged locus (local mobility) and elsewhere in the undamaged genome (global mobility), is a conserved response to DSBs (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">García Fernández and Fabre, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Oshidari et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Seeber et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Smith and Rothstein, 2017</xref>). Different mechanisms have been described to explain these DSB-induced chromatin dynamics, ranging from intrinsic changes in chromatin properties, including chromatin stiffening or decompaction, to extrinsic nuclear organizing factors such as actin and microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Caridi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hauer et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Herbert et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lamm et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lawrimore et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Miné-Hattab et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Strecker et al., 2016</xref>). Functionally, the mobility of damaged and undamaged chromatin has been implicated in various DDR processes such as DSB relocation, clustering, and homology search. Several studies have proposed that both types of mobility allow homology probing in a larger nuclear volume (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dion et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Miné-Hattab and Rothstein, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Seeber et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Smith et al., 2018</xref>). During homology search, spreading of Rad51 and γ-H2A(X) take place concomitantly and the increase in local and global mobility is abolished in the absence of Rad51 or γ-H2A(X) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">García Fernández et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Miné-Hattab et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Miné-Hattab and Rothstein, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Smith et al., 2018</xref>). The role of global mobility in HR remains to be understood. Conflicting results show either a positive correlation between global mobility and recombinant products formation, or a lack of effect of global mobility on recombination in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Challa et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cheblal et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dion et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hauer et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Miné-Hattab et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Miné-Hattab and Rothstein, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Strecker et al., 2016</xref>). Similarly, mobility within a mammalian TAD, allowing ATM to reach other regions of chromatin, has also been suggested to explain the favorable environment for HR observed within a TAD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aymard et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Schrank et al., 2018</xref>). Although the mechanisms and functions of increased mobility are not fully understood, it is now considered part of the DDR.</p><p>To characterize the role of global chromatin mobility upon DNA damage during HR in yeast, we set up a system in haploid cells that allows us to simultaneously monitor HR at the single-cell level while taking into account chromosome conformation by following global chromatin dynamics upon a single DSB induction. We show that the global increase in mobility induced by a DSB is influenced by the conformation of the chromosome. In the pericentromeric region, a DSB close to the centromere induces a global mobility that we call ‘proximal’. This mobility that occurs in trans toward the DSB is dependent on γ-H2A(X), but not on the Rad9-dependent checkpoint nor on the Rad51 nucleofilament. Therefore, this ‘proximal’ mobility has little influence on the overall HR efficiency, but rather accelerates repair kinetics. In contrast, a subtelomeric DSB induces a mobility that we call ‘distal’. This distal mobility only occurs if a homologous sequence is present and if it is near the centromere. We demonstrate that the donor homologous sequence allows γ-H2A(X) spreading that is the requisite for chromatin motion. This distal mobility shares the characteristics of homology search mobility. It is indeed dependent on Rad9 and the Rad51 nucleofilament, and is necessary for HR. Our data unambiguously demonstrate the role of damage-induced global mobility due to non-random chromosome organization and unify conflicting data on its role in HR repair.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>THRIV, a system to track homologous recombination in vivo</title><p>We have recently shown that chromatin mobility favors NHEJ repair in the absence of a donor sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">García Fernández et al., 2021</xref>). Here, we asked whether global mobility has a role on DSB repair when a homologous donor sequence is present. To answer this question, we designed a system that simultaneously tracks HR at the single-cell level and measures global genome mobility away from the DSB. We chose to follow HR through fluorescent protein <italic>mCherry</italic> synthesis, using its coding sequence as both recipient and donor sequences. The recipient and donor <italic>mCherry</italic> sequences cannot be translated into functional fluorescent proteins in the absence of HR. The <italic>mCherry</italic> recipient sequence is located on a chromosome. It is under the control of the TEF constitutive promoter and contains an I-<italic>Sce</italic>I cut site (cs), followed by a stop codon that results in an mCherry truncation. The donor sequence, is on a centromeric plasmid, hereafter referred to as dCen. It contains an <italic>mCherry</italic> sequence lacking the promoter and terminator sequences, and shares 539 and 172 bp of homology upstream and downstream of the I-<italic>Sce</italic>I cs of the recipient sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The <italic>mCherry</italic> recipient sequence was integrated at three different positions: 5 kb from the centromere of chromosome IV, generating the so-called C strain; in a luminal position, 400 kb from the centromere and 1060 kb from the telomere (L strain), and in a subtelomeric position, 10 kb from the right telomere (S strain) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). All strains have similar doubling time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). These different recipient sequence positions, near and far from the characteristic anchoring features of yeast chromosomes, allow us to investigate distinct chromosome architecture contexts.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Tracks homologous recombination in vivo (THRIV), a system to follow homologous recombination (HR) in vivo.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of the two sequences used to track recombination events during time.

The lower number of red cells and the lower survival seen in serial dilutions of the S strain could be explained by the greater distance between the DSB near the telomere and the donor sequence. Indeed, the nuclear localization of the dCen plasmid is comparable to that of a pericentromeric sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>).

Altogether these results show that in the absence of homology, the spatial position of the DSB plays a key role in induction of global mobility.

To do so, we considered the two populations of cells where damage is best controlled, that is, (i) the red population that we know has been repaired 12 hr after DSB induction and, more importantly, has lost the cutting site and will not be cut again (undamaged population only) and (ii) the white population, which is blocked in G2/M because it is damaged and not repaired (damaged population only) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). These two populations show very significant differences in their median MSDs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). We artificially mixed the MSD values obtained from these two populations with 20% undamaged and 80% damaged cells. We observed that the mean MSDs of ‘damaged-only cells’ and ‘undamaged-only cells’ were significantly different. However, the mean MSD of the damaged-only cells was not statistically different from the mean MSD of the mixed cell population. Thus, the conclusions based on the mean MSD of all cells remained consistent.</p><p>To further determine whether the increased dynamics of unrepaired cells is due to their cell cycle arrest in G2/M, we measured V-Vis mobility in a <italic>rad9∆</italic> checkpoint-deficient mutant. We first verified that the I-<italic>Sce</italic>I cleavage efficiency was similar between wild-type (WT) and <italic>∆rad9</italic> strains and assessed cell survival and cell cycle progression in the <italic>∆rad9</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). As expected, <italic>RAD9</italic> deletion prevented cell cycle arrest and led to drastically altered cell growth after I-<italic>Sce</italic>I induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Surprisingly, the increase in global chromatin mobility upon DSB induction at pericentromeric site was similar between WT and <italic>∆rad9</italic> cells, regardless of whether dCen was present or not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). In contrast, no increase in global dynamics could be observed in the <italic>∆rad9</italic> mutant when DSB was induced away from the centromere, despite effective I-<italic>Sce</italic>I cleavage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). In the latter context, Rad9 is essential (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>), as observed when multiple damages were produced by Zeocin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">García Fernández et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Seeber et al., 2013</xref>). This indicates that increase in mobility in white cells is not linked to G2/M cell cycle arrest and that the DDR signaling is essential for global mobility only when long-range homology search is required.</p><p>Because Rad9 defect prevents the cell cycle arrest required for repair, induction of a DSB in either the C or S strains resulted in cell death in the absence of a donor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Furthermore, induction of a DSB resulted in poor growth even in the presence of the donor sequence in the S strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). In contrast, HR repair of the DSB generated in the pericentromeric region in the C strain was effective and 40% red cells were obtained after 24 hr of induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>).</p><p>These results show that a G2/M cell cycle arrest is not necessary for the increase in global dynamics and HR repair. Furthermore, the role of Rad9 signaling in global chromatin dynamics is specific to the position of the DSB. Indeed, only the mechanism underlying pericentromeric proximal mobility could effectively proceed without Rad9.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Enhanced global mobility is controlled by H2A phosphorylation</title><p>Phosphorylation of H2A occurs upstream of Rad9 binding after DNA damage. It is necessary and sufficient to induce global mobility when multiple damage occur and it spreads through the centromeres after a pericentromeric DSB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">García Fernández et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lee et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Li et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Renkawitz et al., 2013</xref>). H2A phosphorylation was thus an attractive candidate in explaining the mechanism by which global mobility occurred in a pericentromeric position-dependent manner. We measured the distribution of γ-H2A(X) by ChIP in <italic>cis</italic> and <italic>trans</italic> of the DSB before and after DSB induction, in the C and S strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). ChIP γ-H2A(X) signals in <italic>cis</italic> were detected by qPCR using a set of primers located 5, 50, and 100 kb from the I-<italic>Sce</italic>I cutting site. γ-H2A(X) signal on the actin gene was used as a reference control. In the absence of DSB, low-intensity γ-H2A(X) ChIP signals were detected in both the C and S strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, gray bars). After 6 hr of I-<italic>Sce</italic>I induction, ChIP levels of γ-H2A(X) increased significantly in <italic>cis</italic> at 50 and 100 kb from the I-<italic>Sce</italic>I CS by approximately 15- and 10-fold in the C and S strains, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, white bars). No increase in ChIP γ-H2A(X) levels was detected at 5 kb from the CS, likely due to 5’ to 3’ resection occurring from the DSB ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Eapen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Renkawitz et al., 2013</xref>). In the presence of the donor, the enrichment of γ-H2A(X) was comparable to that observed with the empty plasmid, except at 100 kb from the cutting site, where a decrease was observed, probably indicating repair (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, red bars). To next examine the levels of γ-H2A(X) relative to the centromere in <italic>trans</italic>, specific primers were designed at 15, 50, and 100 kb in the region between the CENV and the V-Vis locus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). In the absence of the donor, enrichment of γ-H2A(X) was observed only if DSB was induced near the centromere (C strain). ChIP levels of γ-H2A(X) increased sixfold in <italic>trans</italic> at 15 kb and twofold at 50 and 100 kb from CEN-V (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, white bars). This is consistent with γ-H2A(X) propagation occurring across centromeres that are spatially close. Notably, the V-Vis locus, located 90 kb from CENV, corresponds to a position where γ-H2A(X) ChIP signals were increased twofold, suggesting a correlation between increased V-Vis mobility and higher γ-H2A(X) levels. Strikingly, an enrichment of γ-H2A(X) ChIP levels was found in <italic>trans</italic> with a similar increase in both the C and S strains, in the presence of dCen, but not of the empty plasmid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Together, these results reveal that the presence of a donor sequence spatially close to the centromere is critical for the propagation of γ-H2A(X) in <italic>trans,</italic> independently of the genomic position of the DSB. They further support that γ-H2A(X) spreads around the break and across pericentromeric regions if the DSB is close to the centromere.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Double-strand break (DSB) induction in the presence of dCen triggers γ-H2A(X) spreading in <italic>trans</italic>.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) H2A phosphorylation spreading measured by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) around I-<italic>Sce</italic>I cutting site (cs) in strain C or S (in <italic>cis</italic>) in the absence (gray bars) or in the presence of DSB in the presence of the empty plasmid (white bars) or the dCen plasmid (red bars).

I-<italic>Sce</italic>I cleavage efficiency in these mutated strains exhibited similar levels to the WT after 6 hr of I-<italic>Sce</italic>I expression, as shown by qPCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Upon I-<italic>Sce</italic>I induction, serial dilutions of cells showed that colony formation was impaired in the C and S strains in the absence of dCen in either a WT or H2A-S129A mutant background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Yet, the H2A-S129E mutant showed better survival, as expected by its positive effect on NHEJ repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">García Fernández et al., 2021</xref>). In the presence of dCen, colonies could be formed in all strains. However, there were fewer colonies in the S strain mutated for H2A-S129A, indicating that H2A phosphorylation is required for cell survival mainly when the DSB is distant from the centromere.</p><p>We next analyzed global mobility upon DSB induction in WT and H2A-S129 mutant strains. In the H2A-S129A mutant, the increase in global chromatin mobility was similarly impaired in the C and S strains harboring or not the donor sequence dCen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A</xref>). In contrast, the MSD curves of the phosphomimetic mutant H2A-S129E showed an increase in both the C and S strains, even in the absence of DNA damage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A</xref>). These results clearly indicate that global mobility following a single DSB is primarily controlled by H2A(X) phosphorylation, presumably by spreading of this mark. This spreading may be triggered by a DSB near the pericentromeric domain, or by a centromeric donor when the DSB is induced elsewhere in the genome.</p><p>The kinetics of HR repair in H2A-S129 mutants was next assessed using the THRIV system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). After a DSB generated near the centromere, the kinetics of red cell appearance was reduced in the H2A-S129A mutant compared to the WT, but the number of cells repaired by HR after 24 hr was comparable in both strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D and C</xref>, gray bars). In contrast, in the same H2A-S129A mutant, a DSB generated in the S strain could not be repaired by HR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D and S</xref>, gray bars). HR kinetics in the S129E mutant was similar to that in WT strains, regardless of the DSB position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>, gray bars). These results show that γ-H2A(X)-mediated mobility upon DSB induction is essential to facilitate HR.

It has been proposed that the 3' single-stranded DNA extension covered by Rad51 searches for homologous sequences around the DSB and beyond within chromosomes, in a way that depends on their spatial organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Renkawitz et al., 2013</xref>). Rad51 has also been implicated in homology search in diploid cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Miné-Hattab et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Miné-Hattab and Rothstein, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Smith et al., 2018</xref>). It is further documented that γ-H2A(X) and Rad51 propagate concomitantly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Renkawitz et al., 2013</xref>). Given our observations, Rad51 might be involved differently depending on the relative positions of the donor and recipient sequences.

Here, we provide direct evidence that two types of global mobility are involved in HR in a chromosome organization-dependent manner, in part dependent on H2A phosphorylation.</p><p>We establish the critical role of chromosome organization in the response to damage by increasing global genome mobility. Hence, the position of the DSB, away from or in proximity to the centromeres, engages more or less complex mechanisms for the establishment of global mobility. This finding is coherent with previously discovered role of yeast Rabl chromosome configuration in DSB repair efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agmon et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Batté et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lee et al., 2015</xref>). In this chromosome configuration, all centromeres, anchored at one pole of the nucleus, form a region where <italic>trans</italic> contacts are enriched (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Berger et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Duan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lazar-Stefanita et al., 2017</xref>). Sequences located in territories whose spatial proximity is defined by this chromosome organization were shown to be repaired by HR more efficiently than spatially distant regions, with a striking efficient HR when DSBs were generated in the chromatin close to the centromeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agmon et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Batté et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lee et al., 2015</xref>). This pericentromeric chromatin, corresponding to a 20–50 kb region flanking the 125 bp yeast point centromere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Paldi et al., 2020</xref>), is particularly enriched in chromosome structural maintenance complexes (SMCs) that include cohesins, condensins, and Smc5/6. SMCs have a strong impact on chromatin loop formation and size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Betts Lindroos et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dauban et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lazar-Stefanita et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Piazza et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Weber et al., 2004</xref>), further suggesting a link between the particular structure of pericentromeric chromatin and HR repair efficiency. Interestingly, the recent discovery of the repeated emergence of Rabl-like configurations during evolution may point to a functional advantage to centromeric clustering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hoencamp et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>We observed a first type of global mobility, that we propose to name ‘proximal mobility’, when a DSB is induced near the centromeres. This proximal mobility correlates with and depends solely on γ-H2A(X) that can spread from the site of damage to other pericentromeric regions. This was shown by ChIP in a strain where the break is induced near the centromere (C strain), in agreement with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lee et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Li et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Renkawitz et al., 2013</xref>. Proximal mobility is not altered by the presence of a donor sequence, by checkpoint progression, or by the Rad51 nucleofilament, as evidenced by the lack of effect of <italic>RAD9</italic> (53BP1 ortholog) or RAD51 deletions on mobility, indicating that at least under these conditions, γ-H2A(X) spreading allowed by centromeres clustering is sufficient to enhance chromatin mobility.</p><p>That Rad9 is dispensable for proximal mobility is intriguing and contradicts previous evidence showing a checkpoint requirement for increased global mobility after random damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Seeber et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Smith et al., 2018</xref>). This discrepancy could be explained by the nature of the induced DSBs, as random DSBs triggered by Zeocin or γ-rays could induce high DDR, promoting both γ-H2A(X) and recruitment of the checkpoint machinery throughout the genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Seeber et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Smith et al., 2018</xref>). Furthermore, as proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hauer et al., 2017</xref>, the checkpoint machinery could trigger recruitment of INO80, a chromatin remodeler complex important in nucleosome stability, linked to global dynamics after the induction of multiple DSBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cheblal et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hauer et al., 2017</xref>). Here, the single DSB generated near a centromere induces DDR activation and H2A phosphorylation, but propagation of γ-H2A(X) through centromeric regions is sufficient to induce global mobility. Rad9 could be dispensable because its recruitment remains limited in the regions flanking the DSB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Clouaire et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ferrari et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Renkawitz et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>How does the <italic>trans</italic>-propagation of γ-H2A(X) in the pericentromeric region occur? γ-H2A(X) is primarily induced by the H2A kinase Mec1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lee et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Li et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Renkawitz et al., 2013</xref>). Our observation that proximal mobility is solely dependent on γ-H2A(X) is consistent with a model of Mec1 diffusion across centromeres. As suggested by a recent study combining experimental γ-H2A(X) ChIP in the ∆<italic>mec1</italic> mutant and mathematical modeling, Mec1 may diffuse in 3D from the site of damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Li et al., 2020</xref>). The attenuated diffusion of Mec1 along the chromatin fiber reported by Li et al. could also explain why tracking loci farther from the centromere, 340 or 650 kb from it, reveals a smaller increase in global mobility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">supplementary file 1</xref>). Consistent with the proximal mobility, cohesins or Smc5/6 – which are recruited during DSB repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Betts Lindroos et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Caridi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Ström et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Torres-Rosell et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Unal et al., 2007</xref>) – could promote H2A phosphorylation during loop extrusion, creating a functional repair unit, as has been proposed for mammalian TADs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arnould et al., 2021</xref>). Although the loop model may not match with the bending properties of yeast chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Li et al., 2020</xref>), the gradual increase in mobility we observed in the C strain is consistent with progressive phosphorylation of H2A along the chromosome over time. It would be interesting to test, using polymer models, how spreading of γ-H2A(X)-induced chromatin modifications allows mobility in chromosomal regions farther from the centromere.</p><p>Whatever the mechanism of propagation, phosphorylation could promote mobility through a stiffer chromatin, due to the repulsion of phosphate negative charges, as we have proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">García Fernández et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Herbert et al., 2017</xref>). H2A phosphorylation could also differentially modify chromatin structure by modulating the recruitment of INO80 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cheblal et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hauer et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">van Attikum et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bennett et al., 2013</xref>), and SMCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cheblal et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mirny and Dekker, 2021</xref>), or modify the links between microtubules and centromeres, although the loss of centromeric anchoring as a source of global mobility is still debated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cheblal et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Strecker et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lawrimore et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>We describe a second type of global mobility, which we propose to call ‘distal mobility’, when the damage occurred spatially far from the centromeres and donor sequence, such as in the middle or at the end of the IVR chromosome arm (L and S strains). In this case, the increased mobility of V-vis is only induced if a donor close to the centromere, either on a plasmid or on the chromosome, is present. This donor-dependent distal mobility requires a more sophisticated mechanism than simple γ-H2A(X) propagation, since it involves checkpoint progression and homology search and is thus triggered in a Rad9- and Rad51-dependent manner.</p><p>Interestingly, these genetic requirements are the same as those described for local DSB mobility, drawing for the first time a link between local and global mobility. Our observations suggest that checkpoint activation, involving Rad9 recruitment and H2A phosphorylation, initiates mobility at the damaged locus (local mobility). Likewise, Rad51 also collaborates to maintain this local mobility, preparing itself to initiate sampling within the nucleus with an elongated filament. In agreement, ChIP of γ-H2A(X), Rad51, and H2A-S129 mutants show that γ-H2A(X) signal propagation and homology search are apparently directly related (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Renkawitz et al., 2013</xref>). The fact that the presence of a donor is required to observe both H2A phosphorylation and increased distal mobility seems to confirm genome sampling by the Rad51 nucleofilament together with Mec1 as proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Renkawitz et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Renkawitz et al., 2013</xref>. Furthermore, it implicates the recombination process itself, as well as the time of residency of the Rad51 nucleofilament, in γ-H2A(X) spreading near the donor. The stability of Rad51 at the donor sequence involves Rad9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ferrari et al., 2020</xref>), further explaining the role of Rad9 in distal mobility. Our observations thus suggest that recombination would be the cause of distal mobility, in contrast to proximal mobility, which may exist independently of HR. Interestingly, Piazza et al. found that a DSB involves a cohesin-dependent scaffold of the broken chromosome, which isolates that chromosome from others and inhibits <italic>trans</italic> contacts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Piazza et al., 2021</xref>). The distal mobility we describe here could help overcome this isolation and facilitate <italic>trans</italic> homology searches when needed.</p><p>In addition to these genetic requirements shared by the local and global motions induced after DSBs, the question of the involvement of external forces due to nuclear filaments in both motions is raised. The release of centromeres from their attachment to nuclear microtubules emanating from the spindle pole body has been suggested as a source of global mobility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lawrimore et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Strecker et al., 2016</xref>). On the other hand, cytoplasmic microtubule-induced local mobility in <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> appears to be important for HR repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zhurinsky et al., 2019</xref>), and DSB-induced intranuclear microtubules have recently been implicated in directed mobility of the damaged site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Oshidari et al., 2018</xref>). Beyond yeast, directed mobilization of damaged DNA involving microtubules, nuclear actin, or nuclear motors such as myosin and kinesin has been observed in metazoans, pointing to their evolutionary conservation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Caridi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lamm et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Schrank et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zhu et al., 2020</xref>). Importantly, these directed motions were involved for the homology-directed repair of DSBs and release of replication stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Caridi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Laflamme et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lamm et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Schrank et al., 2018</xref>). Although it is not yet known whether nuclear filaments are similarly engaged in local and global movements such as those observed here, their involvement would support the idea that multiple mechanisms are required for DNA damage-induced mobility, the ultimate goal of which is repair and genomic stability.</p><p>Of note, the proximal and distal mobility described here have different roles in HR repair, as documented by directly tracking cells repaired by HR in vivo. While distal mobility is a product of HR repair, proximal mobility serves as a dispensable booster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Indeed, H2A-S129A mutants are able to form a functional mCherry by HR, and therefore red colonies, when the cut is centromere-proximal (C strain), although proximal mobility is not increased. Red cells appear more slowly than in the WT but reach a comparable level between the two strains after 24 hr. Thus, HR can take place without the increase in mobility, but proximal mobility accelerates it. Furthermore, in the C strain deleted for the <italic>RAD9</italic> checkpoint gene, red cells surprisingly appear, although there are fewer of them than in the WT strain. In the <italic>∆rad9</italic> mutant, proximal mobility is not affected but the cell cycle arrest required for HR is inefficient. This suggests that proximal mobility at least partially suppresses the recombination defects associated with the absence of Rad9. This observation is remarkably consistent with our recent findings establishing that the global mobility observed in the H2A-S129E mutant suppresses the <italic>∆rad9</italic> checkpoint defect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">García Fernández et al., 2021</xref>).</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Two types of global mobility are involved in double-strand break (DSB) repair by homologous recombination.</title><p>A proximal mobility (left) occurs in the pericentromeric region, a nuclear domain where <italic>trans</italic>-contacts are enriched. Only H2A phosphorylation is involved in this global mobility, which serves to increase the rate of homologous recombination (HR). By analogy to painting techniques, the proximal mobility could reflect the pouring technique in which oil paint is deposited on water and spreads multidirectionally. It is likely that Mec1 or Tel1 are the factors responsible for this spreading pattern. Distal mobility (right) occurs when DSB is initiated in a region far from the centromeres. The Rad51 nucleofilament is required, as well as HR to promote H2A phosphorylation. The painting analogy here would be that of a paintbrush, with the handle being the Rad51 nucleofilament and the brush being Mec1. The movement of the handle depends on Rad9, and the moving brush allows the deposition of γ-H2A(X). In the absence of Rad51 or Rad9, the brush stays still, decorating only H2A in its immediate environment. The amount of paint deposited will depend on the residence time of the Rad51-ADNsc-Mec1 filament in a given nuclear region. Chromatin decorated by γ-H2A(X) is represented by the orange shadow, at the DSB site and in the pericentromeric region. The red curves represent mobility with thickness symbolizing the amplitude of motion, thin curves for global mobility, and thick curves for local mobility.

The global chromatin mobility observed in different regions of the nucleus could thus be a way to coordinate different responses to DNA damage. The proximal mobility observed in the pericentromeric region, in particular, may be an additional mean of ensuring the essential maintenance of centromeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Yilmaz et al., 2021</xref>). Interestingly, a sophisticated biological function such as sleep has been associated with chromosome mobility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zada et al., 2019</xref>). In zebrafish, a link was found between neuronal activity, chromosome mobility, and the number of lesions, also highlighting the protective role of chromosome mobility. Universally, global mobility would be an additional warrant of genomic integrity.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Limitations of the system</title><p>Although the THRIV system used in this study is efficient in inducing DNA damage and monitoring both chromatin mobility and HR repair, it presents certain limitations. First, the continuous induction of the enzyme that leads to a persistent DSB can affect the DDR, the choice of DSB repair pathway, and probably, chromatin behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Shahar et al., 2012</xref>). To bypass this limitation, a ‘degron’ system would allow inhibiting rapidly the I-<italic>Sce</italic>I expression and thus, measuring dynamics in a context of non-persistent damage. Second, the time of induction of 6 hr is long. Despite the high efficiency of DSB generation after 3 hr of induction, we however decided to measure the mobility 6 hr after DSB induction because this time corresponds to the time required for the γ-H2A <italic>trans</italic> spreading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lee et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Renkawitz et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Third, we did not distinguish between undamaged and damaged cells. Even if we could show that repaired red cells behave differently that unrepaired white cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), at a given time, it is possible that a cell, although damaged, moves little and conversely that a cell moves more, even if not damaged, raising the important and still open question of cell to cell heterogeneity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Altschuler and Wu, 2010</xref>). Fourth, we measured the time-averaged MSDs at a short sampling rate (100 ms), which reliably detects the increase in subdiffusive motion upon DSB induction. Although powerful, this measurement method does not detect subtle changes in mobility such as directed motion that might be masked by overlapping periods of subdiffusive motion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Oshidari et al., 2018</xref>). How random and directed motions of damaged DNA intersect to help repair deserves to be interrogated. Finally, the THRIV system is based on a plasmid donor. Although the THRIV system has also been validated with a chromosomal donor, the plasmid/chromosome chromatin contexts are different, and may notably have an impact on the residence time of the nucleoprotein filament. This question opens the door to modeling approaches on the role of chromatin context in its dynamics and repair efficiency by HR.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Yeast culture</title><p>Yeast cells were grown in rich medium (yeast extract-peptone-dextrose, YPD) or synthetic complete (SC) medium lacking that appropriate amino acid at 30°C.

Cell pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mM HEPES-KOH pH 7.5, 140 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1% Triton-X100, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate) supplemented with 1 mM PMSF, phosphatase inhibitor, and anti-protease (complete Tablet, Roche, 505649001) and lysed three times by beads shaking. The lysate (WCE, Whole Cell Extract) volume was sonicated with a Q500 sonicator (Qsonica; 3 cycles: 40 s ON, 40 s OFF, amplitude medium). Twenty μL of input material were saved for qPCR. Approximately 180 μL (13 OD) of the input were incubated with 0.5% BSA, 1 μL of DNA carrier (10 mg/mL) and 2 μL of anti-γ-H2A(X) (Abcam 15083) on a rotating wheel overnight at 4°C. The day after, 30 μL of protein G Sepharose beads were washed three times and resuspended in 90 μL final of lysis buffer, which were added to the overnight culture during 2 hr on a rotating wheel at 4°C. Beads were then collected and washed on ice with cold solutions: twice with Lysis buffer (50 mM HEPES-KOH pH 7.5, 140 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate), twice with Lysis buffer added with 360 mM NaCl, twice with Washing buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 0.25 M LiCl, 0.5% IGEPAL, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate) and once with TE (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 1 mM EDTA). Antibodies were uncoupled from beads with 150 μL of Elution buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 10 mM EDTA, 1% SDS) for 20 min at 65°C. Eluates were incubated with 120 μL of TE containing 0.1% SDS at 65°C for 6 hr to de-crosslink. Then 130 μL of TE containing 60 μg RNase A (Sigma, R65-13) were added and the samples were incubated for 2 hr at 37°C. Proteins were digested by addition of 20 μL of proteinase K (Sigma, P6556) at 20 mg/mL to the samples and incubation for 2 hr at 37°C. DNA purification was completed with the QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (n28104). Finally, qPCRs were performed in a LightCycler480 (Roche). IP/input ratios were calculated and qPCR results were normalized on ChIP-qPCR Act1 for γ-H2A(X). For each strain, three independent experiments were performed with the corresponding controls.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>FACS</title><p>For cell cycle, cells were grown to mid-log-phase in liquid cultures, and treated or not with Zeocin at 250 mg/μL during 6 hr at 30°C. After incubation, samples were fixed with 70% ethanol and kept at 4°C for 48 hr. Cells were then resuspended in 50 mM sodium citrate (pH 7) containing RnaseA at 0.2 mg/mL final concentration. After incubation at 37°C for 1 hr, Sytox Green was added to a final concentration of 1 mM. A total of 10<sup>6</sup> cells were analyzed with a CANTO II flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Aggregates and dead cells were gated out, and percentages of cells with 1C and 2C DNA content were calculated using FLOWJO software.</p><p>For the kinetics of fluorescence red cells, 1–2·10<sup>7</sup> cells were removed and centrifuged. All the following steps were done in the dark. The pellet was washed once with cold PBS at 4°C. After removal of the supernatant, the pellet was resuspended in 500 μL of cold PBS and 500 μL of cold PBS with formaldehyde (to a final concentration of 1%) were added and gently mixed. The cells were incubated for 15 min at 4°C. The cells were then washed three times with sodium citrate (50 mM) and prepared at a concentration of 1.10<sup>6</sup> cells/mL for the cytometry carried out immediately after (in order to limit the loss of fluorescence). Following steps were performed as above.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Validation, Visualization, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Validation, Visualization</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Formal analysis, Validation, Visualization</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Software, Formal analysis, Visualization</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Validation, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>This work does not involve human participants or animal experimentation.</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>Compilation of values extracted from mean squared displacements (MSDs) of the analyzed strains.</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-78015-supp1-v1.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="xlsx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp2"><label>Supplementary file 2.</label><caption><title>Genotypes of the strains used in this study.</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-78015-supp2-v1.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="xlsx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp3"><label>Supplementary file 3.</label><caption><title>Oligonucleotides sequences.</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-78015-supp3-v1.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="xlsx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="transrepform"><label>Transparent reporting form</label><media xlink:href="elife-78015-transrepform1-v1.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>All data generated or analysed during this study are included in the manuscript and Source Data files.

It uses a cleverly designed new recombination assay in yeast to address the impact of DNA break position on global genome mobility. A centromere–proximal DNA double–strand break (DSB) induces an H2A(X) phosphorylation–dependent global mobility that accelerates but is not essential for DSB repair, while a centromere–distal DSB triggers global mobility that is essential for repair and which depends on H2A(X) phosphorylation, Rad9 and Rad51. Together, these data support a model where global genome mobility promotes homologous recombination repair, particularly for centromere–distal DSBs, and help settle some recent controversy in the field.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.78015.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Chiolo</surname><given-names>Irene E</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/03taz7m60</institution-id><institution>University of Southern California</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Piazza</surname><given-names>Aurèle</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/04zmssz18</institution-id><institution>ENS Lyon</institution></institution-wrap><country>France</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: (i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2022.02.03.478935">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.02.03.478935v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; (ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Kevin Struhl as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Aurèle Piazza (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers agree that experiments are well–conducted and support the claims and that the manuscript is suitable for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. They also raise some important points, most of which can be easily addressed by text changes, although some additional controls seem to be required. We highlight what we consider essential revisions here:</p><p>1. A common concern is the lack of ability to distinguish between damaged (80%) and undamaged (20%) cells for MSD experiments. Addressing this point requires additional experiments, and a possible approach to address this point is proposed by reviewer #3 (although other approaches might be used).</p><p>2. The discussion should directly focus on the proteins tested (see comments from reviewer #1). It should also highlight the limitations of the system used (caveats of a plasmid–based system).</p><p>3. Presentation of statistics, sample sizes, etc should be easy to identify within each figure (see comments from reviewer #1).</p><p>4. Reviewer #2 raises an important point that even after most of the break is likely repaired, there is still elevated mobility. While establishing mobility at even later time points might be outside the scope of this manuscript, this is a point worth discussing.</p><p>5. In the absence of Rad51, mobility still occurs in the Cen–proximal cut strain. It is important to show HR efficiency in this strain, as pointed out by reviewer #2.</p><p>6. Reviewer #3 points out interesting observations (&quot;painting model&quot;) that the authors might find helpful to integrate in the model/discussion. There are also some issues pointed out by this reviewer about consistency across experiments, which we think should be mostly addressable with text changes, and by acknowledging the different sensitivities of distinct assays. Additionally, how the HR defects of checkpoint mutants might affect</p><p>7. A discussion of the data and model fit with previous work (see point 3 by reviewer #3, and the reference to studies from the Rothstein and Gasser labs) should be provided.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>General feedback:</p><p>– Although this study focuses on global mobility effects, it is reasonable to think that the global mobility effects reported here occur in parallel to DSB site–targeted mobility. The introduction and especially the discussion would benefit from explaining how the authors envision the global mobility processes reported here intersecting with the DSB–targeted mobility that is well documented in the literature.</p><p>– In the model and discussion, highlighting Mec1 as opposed to H2A, Rad9, Rad51 is puzzling. An area for improvement for the manuscript would be to improve the discussion and model to focus on factors directly tested in the study.</p><p>– Another area for improvement centers around the presentation of error bars, sample sizes, and statistics in a manner that does not necessitate that the reader cross–reference the figure, main text, figure legend, and supplementary tables to determine exactly what was done in a given data panel. Especially complete and clarify the information on sample sizes, replicates, and statistics in the figure legends.</p><p>– The discussion should include a section on the limitations of the systems used and especially the caveats associated with the use of plasmid–based donor sequences in most experiments.</p><p>Presentation and clarity:</p><p>– Figure 2B and other MSD plots: error bars needed to interpret the MSD data accurately are absent; also, the lines in some of the MSD plots are so faded that this reviewer struggled to distinguish some of them. Please consider making the lines thicker or changing their colors.</p><p>– Figure 4A and 4B: p values are only shown for one of the four graphs when it seems that large and likely statistically significant changes were observed in the other three graphs. Please clarify.</p><p>– Callout to Figure 4E, S, grey bars near the bottom of page 9 of the text: should this refer to Figure 4D instead of 4E?</p><p>– Page 12, 2nd paragraph, 2nd line: &quot;end of the IVR chromosome,&quot; should be &quot;VR&quot;?</p><p>– Page 3, paragraph 2: &quot;that allows simultaneously tracking&quot;.</p><p>– Overall, the paper would benefit from detailed English language editing.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>It would be valuable to show in the supplemental Figure 1 the frequency of red cells at all of the timepoints with the empty vector (no repair template) both with and without DSB induction to show the false positive rate for red forming cells. In other words, what is the background level of red–forming cells that result from the reversion of the stop codon both before and after DSB induction?</p><p>Please discuss why the experiments shown in Figure 1 were not performed in the strain harboring the tetO repeats that were used for visualization and MSD analysis. The authors did a great job of classifying repair dynamics using their THRIV system, but then add another component to it (V–Vis) before performing the crucial MSD experiments. Is it because the GFP signal would interfere with the FACS analysis? Maybe the authors can at least do the spot assay as quality control?</p><p>It is not clear why 6 hours was chosen as the time to use for DSB induction. Is it due to the delay observed between the I–SceI enzyme expression and an effective cutting? If so, please state the rationale. Do 3 hours of DSB induction change the results observed in Figure 2?</p><p>The results shown in Figure 3 are a highlight of the paper. The authors do a great job utilizing the strength of their system to examine how mobility changes at different stages of the repair process (beginning vs end). However, it is surprising that even after 12 hours of DSB induction and clear evidence of completed repair (red cell), there is still elevated levels of mobility when compared to –DSB control. If repair is complete, why is there still elevated mobility? What are the results of mobility at 24 hours after DSB induction (the last timepoint taken in Figure 1)? How long does it take for the mobility response to completely return to baseline after HR is successful? Please discuss these points.</p><p>For Figure 5, were the HR kinetics examined in the rad51 mutant using the FACS assay? Does HR repair occur normally in the C strain when rad51 is deleted given that the global mobility response is shown to still occur in that strain?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>– Experiments in Figure 2C rule out that increased mobility of undamaged sites is due to a centromere detachment from the SPB, and instead suggests a spreading mechanism. Authors should spell it out clearly in the text.</p><p>– Lay out more clearly the &quot;painting&quot; model.</p><p>– Figure 3A–B: red cells have repaired, and are not in the same cell cycle phase (see figure 1D FACS and picture of the red cells), which is known to affect mobility (Cheblah Gasser 2020).</p><p>– MSDs without DSB are different in Figure 2B and in Figure 2C (0.05 vs 0.03 at 10 seconds). Why? The same thing with C–DSB and C+DSB, values are different in Figure 2B and 2C.</p><p>– Indicate at which time post–DSB induction the MSD is monitored on the figure panel.</p><p>– Inconsistent spot assays across figures for the same condition, or similar conditions (Figure 1E, Figure S3B, Figure S4B). For instance, C strain WT somewhat grows on +Gal in Figure 1E and S4B, but not in S3B. The S+dCen strain WT +DSB is dead in Figure 1E but shows excellent recovery in S3B and S4B. There are other inconsistencies within Figure S4B, with C and S strains without DSB showing different growth despite having the same genotype.

They also raise some important points, most of which can be easily addressed by text changes, although some additional controls seem to be required. We highlight what we consider essential revisions here:</p><p>1. A common concern is the lack of ability to distinguish between damaged (80%) and undamaged (20%) cells for MSD experiments. Addressing this point requires additional experiments, and a possible approach to address this point is proposed by reviewer #3 (although other approaches might be used).</p></disp-quote><p>The referees raise the important question of the heterogeneity of a population, a central challenge in biology. Here we wish to distinguish between undamaged and damaged cells. Even if a selection of the damaged cells had been made, this would not solve entirely the inherent cell to cell variation: at a given time, it is possible that a cell, although damaged, moves little and conversely that a cell moves more, even if not damaged. The question of heterogeneity is therefore important and the subject of intense research that goes beyond the framework of our work (Altschuler and Wu, 2010). However, in order to start to clarify if a bias could exist when considering a mixed population (20% undamaged and 80% damaged), we analyzed MSDs, using a scatter plot. We considered two population of cells where the damage is the best controlled, i.e. (i) the red population which we know has been repaired and, importantly, has lost the cut site and will be not cut again (undamaged - only population) and (ii) the white population, blocked in G2/M, because it is damaged and not repaired (damaged - only population). These two populations show very significant differences in their median MSDs. We artificially mixed the MSDs values obtained from these two populations at a rate of 20% of undamaged - only cells and 80% of damaged - only cells. We observed that the mean MSDs of the damaged - only and undamaged - only cells were significantly different. Yet, the mean MSD of damaged - only cells was not statistically different from the mean MSD from the 20% - 80% mixed cell population. Thus, the conclusions based on the average MSDs of all cells remain consistent.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The discussion should directly focus on the proteins tested (see comments from reviewer #1). It should also highlight the limitations of the system used (caveats of a plasmid–based system).</p></disp-quote><p>We have rewritten parts of the discussion to better reflect the proteins tested. In particular, our experiments allow drawing a parallel between the local mobility and the distal mobility because both require the Rad51 filament and the control of Rad9.</p><p>We have added a paragraph called Systems Limitations which include this particular aspect; although the THRIV system was validated also with a chromosomal donor, the plasmid/chromosome contexts are different, and may in particular impact the time or residency of the nucleoprotein filament, as suggested by Reviewer 3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Presentation of statistics, sample sizes, etc should be easy to identify within each figure (see comments from reviewer #1).</p></disp-quote><p>We have now added these data in the legend of each figure.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Reviewer #2 raises an important point that even after most of the break is likely repaired, there is still elevated mobility. While establishing mobility at even later time points might be outside the scope of this manuscript, this is a point worth discussing.</p></disp-quote><p>It is noteworthy that at 12h, red cells that have lost the cleavage site for I - SceI and thus can no longer be cut by the enzyme, still show a higher mobility than the undamaged control. The most probable hypothesis is that the H2A phosphorylation has not yet returned to normal at this time point. There are several mechanisms to loose H2A phosphorylation that include exchange of the phosphorylated histone and its possible degradation or dephosphorylation of H2A. Kinetics of H2A dephosphorylation by ChIP and/or measurement of chromatin dynamics in backgrounds mutated for H2A dephosphorylation, should be performed to confirm this hypothesis, experiments that are beyond the scope of this manuscript. However, it is known that while H2A dephosphorylation around the DSB is quite fast (~1h), H2A dephosphorylation at 20kb from the DSB requires more time (~5h) and foci of γH2A are still detectable at ~6h after damage (Keogh et al., 2006). On the other hand, kinetics of dephosphorylation in trans are not known. Interestingly, this study demonstrated that H2A dephosphorylation might not be complete even at the end of repair, which is consistent with the maintenance of γH2A on chromatin, including in red cells. These red cells could therefore, still exhibit increased mobility.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. In the absence of Rad51, mobility still occurs in the Cen–proximal cut strain. It is important to show HR efficiency in this strain, as pointed out by reviewer #2.</p></disp-quote><p>In the C strain, when the DSB is induced close to the centromere, cells deleted for Rad51 do not grow, even in the presence of the donor, although an increase in mobility is detected. Poor growth is a sign of ineffective repair that impedes FACS analyses for calculation of HR efficiency. We propose that mobility promotes recombination, but cannot supplant such essential recombination proteins as Rad51 in the recombination reaction.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. Reviewer #3 points out interesting observations (&quot;painting model&quot;) that the authors might find helpful to integrate in the model/discussion. There are also some issues pointed out by this reviewer about consistency across experiments, which we think should be mostly addressable with text changes, and by acknowledging the different sensitivities of distinct assays. Additionally, how the HR defects of checkpoint mutants might affect</p></disp-quote><p>The paintbrush model was very useful in explaining the distal mobility that indeed is linked to local mobility genetic requirements. It is also helpful to think of a different model than the paintbrush model when pericentromeric damage occurs. To stay in the terms of painting technique, this latter model would be similar to the pouring technique, when oil paint is deposited on water and spreads in a multidirectional manner. It is likely that Mec1 or Tel1 are the factors responsible for this spreading pattern. We therefore propose to maintain the notion of two distinct types of mobilities. Without going into pictorial techniques in the text, we have attempted to clarify these two models in the manuscript.</p><p>We have corrected the experimental inconsistencies noted by referee 3, mainly due to different incubation times.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. A discussion of the data and model fit with previous work (see point 3 by reviewer #3, and the reference to studies from the Rothstein and Gasser labs) should be provided.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added a new paragraph in the discussion to better account for references to previous studies by Rothstein and Gasser labs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>General feedback:</p><p>– Although this study focuses on global mobility effects, it is reasonable to think that the global mobility effects reported here occur in parallel to DSB site–targeted mobility. The introduction and especially the discussion would benefit from explaining how the authors envision the global mobility processes reported here intersecting with the DSB–targeted mobility that is well documented in the literature.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this constructive criticism, because indeed, the parameters that govern the distal mobility that we document are the same as those of the local mobility, highlighting the parallel mechanisms for both mobilities and therefore deserve to be better explained and discussed. This is now done.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– In the model and discussion, highlighting Mec1 as opposed to H2A, Rad9, Rad51 is puzzling. An area for improvement for the manuscript would be to improve the discussion and model to focus on factors directly tested in the study.</p></disp-quote><p>The mechanism of mobility around the centromere, related to the propagation of H2A phosphorylation is intriguing and could be explained by the mode of diffusion of Mec1 or Tel1. As pointed out by the reviewer, the involvement of the Rad51 nucleoprotein filament and of Rad9 in the global mobility induced when the damage is far from the centromere, according to a mechanism similar to that of the local mobility, deserves to be better highlighted with a more precise discussion of these two proteins. We have therefore added this aspect to our discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Another area for improvement centers around the presentation of error bars, sample sizes, and statistics in a manner that does not necessitate that the reader cross–reference the figure, main text, figure legend, and supplementary tables to determine exactly what was done in a given data panel.

We have added in Figure Supp.1C quantifications and examples of cells after 24h in the C and S strains in the absence of donor to illustrate our point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Please discuss why the experiments shown in Figure 1 were not performed in the strain harboring the tetO repeats that were used for visualization and MSD analysis. The authors did a great job of classifying repair dynamics using their THRIV system, but then add another component to it (V–Vis) before performing the crucial MSD experiments. Is it because the GFP signal would interfere with the FACS analysis? Maybe the authors can at least do the spot assay as quality control?</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize if our description of the strains was not sufficiently explicit. These are the same strains in Figure 1 and Figure 2.

Is it due to the delay observed between the I–SceI enzyme expression and an effective cutting? If so, please state the rationale. Do 3 hours of DSB induction change the results observed in Figure 2?</p></disp-quote><p>We chose 6h, because it is the induction time for which we have the best compromise, on the number of damaged cells and the beginning of the appearance of red cells. At 3h, as the referee pointed out, the enzyme is expressed but the cutting is not yet effective. The rationale of the long - time is now discussed in the “limitations of the system” paragraph.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The results shown in Figure 3 are a highlight of the paper. The authors do a great job utilizing the strength of their system to examine how mobility changes at different stages of the repair process (beginning vs end). However, it is surprising that even after 12 hours of DSB induction and clear evidence of completed repair (red cell), there is still elevated levels of mobility when compared to –DSB control. If repair is complete, why is there still elevated mobility? What are the results of mobility at 24 hours after DSB induction (the last timepoint taken in Figure 1)? How long does it take for the mobility response to completely return to baseline after HR is successful? Please discuss these points.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the referee for the appreciation of this difficult experiment, which was indeed very instructive. Concerning the dynamics of the red cells at 12h, the most probable hypothesis is that the H2A phosphorylation has not yet returned to normal at this time point. There are several mechanisms to loose H2A phosphorylation that include exchange of the phosphorylated histone and its possible degradation or dephosphorylation of H2A. Kinetics of H2A dephosphorylation by ChIP and/or measurement of chromatin dynamics in backgrounds mutated for H2A dephosphorylation, should be performed to confirm this hypothesis, experiments that are beyond the scope of this manuscript. However, it is known that while H2A dephosphorylation around the DSB is quite fast (~1h), H2A dephosphorylation at 20kb from the DSB requires more time (~5h) and foci of γH2A are still detectable at ~6h after damage (Keogh et al., 2006). On the other hand, kinetics of dephosphorylation in trans are not known Interestingly, this study demonstrated that H2A dephosphorylation may not be complete even at the end of repair, which is consistent with the maintenance of γH2A on chromatin, including in red cells. These red cells could therefore, still exhibit increased mobility.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>For Figure 5, were the HR kinetics examined in the rad51 mutant using the FACS assay? Does HR repair occur normally in the C strain when rad51 is deleted given that the global mobility response is shown to still occur in that strain?</p></disp-quote><p>As stated in the general comment, in the C strain, when the DSB is induced close to the centromere, cells deleted for Rad51 grow poorly, even in the presence of the donor, although an increase in mobility is detected. Poor growth is a sign of ineffective repair that impedes FACS analyses for calculation of HR efficiency. We propose that mobility promotes recombination, but cannot supplant such essential recombination proteins as Rad51 in the recombination reaction.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>– Experiments in Figure 2C rule out that increased mobility of undamaged sites is due to a centromere detachment from the SPB, and instead suggests a spreading mechanism. Authors should spell it out clearly in the text.</p></disp-quote><p>In our opinion, it is still difficult at this stage to estimate whether or not pericentromeric DSB causes microtubule detachment from kinetochores. It remains possible that the spreading of γH2A weakens this attachment, but only super - resolution microscopy experiments could perhaps resolve this point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Lay out more clearly the &quot;painting&quot; model.</p></disp-quote><p>The model related to the formation of the Rad51 filament and the probable residence time of this filament with the donor as well as the propagation pattern of γH2A are now better highlighted, in the text and mentioned in the legend of figure 6.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Figure 3A–B: red cells have repaired, and are not in the same cell cycle phase (see figure 1D FACS and picture of the red cells), which is known to affect mobility (Cheblah Gasser 2020).</p></disp-quote><p>The distinction between white cells, blocked in G2/M, and cycling red cells effectively highlights the fact that the increased dynamics may be related to a cycling defect. However, it is possible to observe an increase in dynamics in a Rad9 mutant, where the cycle is no longer blocked upon damage (Figure 3C and our study Garcia Fernandez, 2021), suggesting that G2/M block is not sufficient to explain an increase in dynamics.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– MSDs without DSB are different in Figure 2B and in Figure 2C (0.05 vs 0.03 at 10 seconds). Why? The same thing with C–DSB and C+DSB, values are different in Figure 2B and 2C.</p></disp-quote><p>The differences between MSDs experiments are a good example of biological heterogeneity.

For instance, C strain WT somewhat grows on +Gal in Figure 1E and S4B, but not in S3B. The S+dCen strain WT +DSB is dead in Figure 1E but shows excellent recovery in S3B and S4B. There are other inconsistencies within Figure S4B, with C and S strains without DSB showing different growth despite having the same genotype.

We thank the referee for his critical eye, the differences were due to the growth times and the dilution between the different figures (1:10 dilutions 48h for Figure 1, 1:5 60h for S4B, 40h for S3B) and to the different contrast of that picture. The reason for a longer time is related to the slow growth of the SA mutant. Times and dilutions are now indicated in the legend.
