essential to guiding attention and coordinating behavior within a dynamic environment. Previous researchers have modeled attention as an internal rhythm that may entrain to first-order regularity from rhythmic events to prioritize information selection at specific time points. Using the attentional blink paradigm, here we show that higher-order regularity based on rhythmic organization of contextual features (pitch, color, or motion) may serve as a temporal frame to recompose the dynamic profile of visual temporal attention. Critically, such attentional reframing effect is well predicted by cortical entrainment to the higher-order contextual structure at the delta band as well as its coupling with the stimulus-driven alpha power. These results suggest that the human brain involuntarily exploits multiscale regularities in rhythmic contexts to recompose dynamic attending in visual perception, and highlight neural entrainment as a central mechanism for optimizing our conscious experience of the world in the time dimension.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>visual attention</kwd><kwd>temporal structure</kwd><kwd>neural entrainment</kwd><kwd>attentional blink</kwd><kwd>visual awareness</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31830037</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jiang</surname><given-names>Yi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31771211</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Ying</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002367</institution-id><institution>Chinese Academy of Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>XDB32010300</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jiang</surname><given-names>Yi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002367</institution-id><institution>Chinese Academy of Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2018116</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Ying</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002855</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2020AAA0105600</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jiang</surname><given-names>Yi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The human brain involuntarily exploits multiscale regularities in rhythmic contexts to recompose the dynamic profile of visual temporal attention.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Deploying attention over time is crucial for guiding human activities within a rapidly changing environment. However, the constant influx of information goes far beyond our mental capacity, impeding even the most competent human brain from capturing every nuance of the details. How does the human brain surmount such limitations in temporal attention allocation during dynamic information processing?</p><p>One feasible solution, as that for spatial attention, is through selection, or by shining an attentional ‘spotlight’ on the most relevant information while filtering out the irrelevant regarding the task demands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Posner, 1980</xref>). When it comes to the temporal domain, people tend to utilize regularities in the sensory information flow for directing attention to the moments when a target event is expected to occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Nobre et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Nobre and van Ede, 2018</xref>). As a great example, Jones and colleagues have shown in a series of studies that after listening to a rhythmic tone sequence, auditory perception in terms of pitch judgment and time discrimination was more accurate for target tones appearing at the expected than the unexpected time points (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jones et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Large and Jones, 1999</xref>). Such facilitation effects have been extended to various aspects of visual perception and even across sensory modalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bolger et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brochard et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mathewson et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Miller et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">ten Oever et al., 2014</xref>), implicating the involvement of a general attentional selection mechanism guided by the regularity in stimulus timing.</p><p>In this line of studies, perceptual responses were significantly improved for targets appearing within a rhythmic context but not within an arrhythmic context. These findings can be interpreted by the dynamic attending theory (DAT), which assumes attention as an internal oscillatory activity (or attending rhythm) that can be entrained to rhythmic structures of the exogenous events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jones, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jones et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jones and Boltz, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Large and Jones, 1999</xref>). In line with this assumption, electrophysiological research in humans and non-human primates have found entrainment of intrinsic neural oscillations to external stimulus rhythms, and regarded such process as an instrument for selective attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Calderone et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Obleser and Kayser, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Schroeder and Lakatos, 2009</xref>). Through neural entrainment, neuronal excitability aligns with the occurrence of rhythmic events, creating ‘temporal attentional spotlights’ that attract the brain’s attentional resources toward a string of selected moments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Calderone et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Henry and Herrmann, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lakatos et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lakatos et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Schroeder and Lakatos, 2009</xref>).</p><p>The synchronization between the internal attending rhythm and the external rhythms allows us to direct attention proactively and enhance perception at the anticipated moments. With regard to forming a coherent perception of the dynamic environment, however, we should not only select information bound to the anticipated time points, but also allocate attentional resources among these points, raising the problem of dynamic attentional deployment over an information stream. For instance, when viewing a rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) stream, there is a large chance that the observer would miss the second of two temporally proximate targets, as the allocation of attention to the first target hinders the redeployment of mental resources to the second one (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Broadbent and Broadbent, 1987</xref>). This phenomenon, vividly referred to as the attentional blink (AB) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chun and Potter, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Raymond et al., 1992</xref>), has attracted much interest as it reveals the limitations of attentional allocation and memory processes that may become a bottleneck for conscious awareness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dux and Marois, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Martens and Wyble, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Shapiro et al., 1997</xref>). More intriguingly, as items in the RSVP stream are all rhythmically presented and temporally predictable, the AB effect poses a challenge in dynamic attending that cannot be circumvented solely by the anticipation built upon stimulus timing.</p><p>To address this challenge, here we propose that, the brain has to rely, as a complement to the first-order regularity in rhythmic stimulation, on regularities in the higher-order temporal structure of the information stream. More specifically, if the endogenous attentional rhythm could entrain automatically not only to the stimulus rhythm but also to the higher-order structure based on the information content, the deployment of temporal attention might be reconstructed in a way that facilitates target detection in the AB task. To test this hypothesis, we synchronized the original AB stream (stimulation rate at 10 Hz) to a hierarchical contextual stream that possessed a feature-based temporal structure—a 2.5 Hz rhythm arising from periodic changes of a physical feature, superimposed on its stimulus rhythm at 10 Hz. Using temporal structures defined by a variety of features (pitch, color, etc.), we provided converging evidence that the structured context, which was task-irrelevant and even from a different modality, could regulate the dynamic deployment of visual attention so as to alleviate the AB effect. To further unravel the neural basis of the observed attentional modulation effect, we conducted an electroencephalogram (EEG) experiment. We are particularly interested in whether neural oscillations can entrain to the contextual temporal structure of stimulus feature along with that of stimulus onset timing, and more critically, whether and how the cortical entrainment to these hierarchical structures mediates the behavioral modulation effect.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Temporal structure of contextual auditory stream recomposes visual attentional deployment</title><p>In Experiment 1a, we first explored whether feature-defined temporal structure from a contextual auditory stream could regulate visual attentional deployment during the AB task. If so, the AB effect should be modulated by the positions of the visual targets relative to the structure-defined cycles arising from periodic changes of the background sound (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, see Materials and methods for details). Above all, we found a robust AB effect for Experiment 1a, as well as for the other experiments reported in the current study. The accuracy of T1 performance was very high in both the baseline session (mean ±SE: 0.959 ± 0.008) and the context session (0.953 ± 0.006), and the overall T1 performance ranged from 0.907 to 0.972 in all experiments. By contrast, the T2 detection accuracy conditioned on correct T1 response was generally impaired in the short-SOA conditions relative to that in the long-SOA condition (mean accuracy &gt;0.9 for all experiments), during both the context session (<italic>t</italic>(15) = 5.443, p&lt;0.001, Cohen’s <italic>d</italic> = 1.361) and the baseline session (<italic>t</italic>(15) = 6.720, p&lt;0.001, Cohen’s <italic>d</italic> = 1.680).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Schematics of stimuli and results for Experiments 1a and 1b.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) In the AB task, participants were presented with rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) streams at 10 Hz (top). Each stream contained two capital letter targets embedded in fourteen number distractors. Black and gray ‘T1’ and ‘T2’ denote two alternative options for target locations in the short-SOA conditions. These targets were located either in two adjacent cycles (the between-cycle condition, displayed on violet background for illustration only) or within the same rhythmic cycle (the within-cycle condition, displayed on green background for illustration only) defined by a rhythmic auditory context in Experiment 1a (middle). Arrhythmic context was used as a control in Experiment 1b (bottom). (B and C) T2 detection accuracy conditioned on correct T1 response for the experiments using rhythmic and arrhythmic contexts.

Notably, such difference was observed only for the context session (<italic>t</italic>(15) = 2.947, p=0.010, Cohen’s <italic>d</italic> = 0.737) but not for the baseline (no sound) session (<italic>t</italic>(15) = −0.212, p=0.835, Cohen’s <italic>d</italic> = 0.053), although the target positions were completely matched between these two sessions. Meanwhile, only in the between-cycle condition, the contextual sounds enhanced T2 detection accuracy relative to the baseline (<italic>t</italic>(15) = 2.287, p=0.037, Cohen’s <italic>d</italic> = 0.572), while in the within-cycle condition, the performance kept comparable between the context and baseline sessions (<italic>t</italic>(15) = −0.271, p=0.790, Cohen’s <italic>d</italic> = 0.068). The observed dissociation was further confirmed by a two-way repeated-measures ANOVA, which yielded a significant interaction between experimental session (baseline vs. context session) and target position (between- vs. within-cycle, defined by the context) (<italic>F</italic>(1, 15)=7. 151, p=0.017, η<italic><sub>p</sub></italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.323).</p><p>Results from Experiment 1a demonstrated that feature-based temporal structure of an auditory stream, although being task-irrelevant, could systematically modulate the allocation of visual attention over the AB stream. Since the temporal structure of the contextual sounds was defined by periodic changes of pitch, when two targets were located in distinct cycles as in the between-cycle condition, they were accompanied by different tones, in contrast to that when located within the same cycle they were accompanied by the same tone. It is possible that the contrast of physical stimulation (i.e. pitch) at T1 and T2 could account for the performance improvement in the between-cycle condition. To test this possibility, in Experiment 1b, we matched the pitch of tones at target occurrence with that in Experiment 1a for the between- and within-cycle condition respectively, whereas disrupted feature-based regularity in the temporal structure of the contextual sound sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, bottom). Despite that the sounds paired with the targets were exactly the same as in Experiment 1a, the difference in T2 detection accuracy caused by the contextual sounds was no longer observed (<italic>t</italic>(15) = 0.433, p=0.671, Cohen’s <italic>d</italic> = 0.108), neither was its interaction with experimental session (<italic>F</italic>(1, 15)=2.734, p=0.119, η<italic><sub>p</sub></italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.154; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). In other words, T2 was identified with similar accuracy across all the conditions in Experiment 1b, suggesting that it is the temporal structure of the contextual sounds, not the pitch difference at target presentation, that accounts for the between-cycle facilitation effect observed in Experiment 1a.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Generalization of the modulation effect to different cycle frequencies</title><p>In Experiment 1a, the auditory context always changed its pitch value every four items, that is every 400 ms as one cycle, resulting in rhythmic cycles at 2.5 Hz. In Experiment 1 c, we tested whether the modulation effect we observed could be generalized to other cycle frequencies. We set the pitch change rate to 2 Hz (i.e. five items per cycle; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, upper) and 3.3 Hz (i.e. three items per cycle; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, lower). For both context frequencies, the T2 detection performance in the between-cycle condition was significantly higher than that in the within-cycle condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>; for 2 Hz, <italic>t</italic>(15) = 3.478, p=0.004, Cohen’s <italic>d</italic> = 0.869; for 3.3 Hz, <italic>t</italic>(15) = 2.467, p=0.030, Cohen’s <italic>d</italic> = 0.617), suggesting successful attentional modulation effects. Furthermore, a repeated-measures ANOVA on T2 accuracy revealed only a significant main effect of relative target position (i.e. between- vs. within-cycle) (<italic>F</italic>(1, 15)=23.320, p&lt;0.001, η<italic><sub>p</sub></italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.609), with a marginally significant main effect of frequency (<italic>F</italic>(1, 15)=4.337, p=0.055, η<italic><sub>p</sub></italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.224) and no interaction between these two factors (<italic>F</italic>(1, 15)=0.204, p=0.658, η<italic><sub>p</sub></italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.013).</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Stimuli and results for Experiments 1 c, 1d and 1e.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Contextual tone sequences with pitch changed every five tones (2 Hz, upper) and every three tones (3.3 Hz, lower) in Experiment 1 c.

To disentangle these factors, in Experiment 1d, we changed the pitch value of tone sequences irregularly to form auditory streams that could be grouped in varying lengths (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, upper). Although temporal grouping was reserved in this setting, no facilitation effect was observed when targets were separated in two distinct groups relative to when they were displayed within the same group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, Irreg-G). T2 detection performance was comparable in the between- and the within-group conditions (<italic>t</italic>(15) = 0.348, p=0.733, Cohen’s <italic>d</italic> = 0.087).</p><p>Compared with Experiments 1a and 1 c, the strength of temporal grouping in Experiment 1d might be attenuated due to irregular number of items in each group, which could lead to the lack of behavioral modulation effect. To solve this issue, in Experiment 1e (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, lower), we changed the pitch every four items to keep the rule of temporal grouping exactly the same as that in Experiment 1a. Nevertheless, we disrupted the regularity of stimulus timing. Such manipulation would have a detrimental impact on dynamic deployment of temporal attention in general, according to the basic assumption of the DAT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jones et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jones and Boltz, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Large and Jones, 1999</xref>). On the other hand, it would have little influence on the grouping effect. Therefore, if temporal attention rather than perceptual grouping is essential to the behavioral modulation effect observed in the current study, we should expect such effect to disappear in Experiment 1e. In line with our speculation, when the stimulus onset timing was randomized, T2 detection performance in the between-cycle condition was no longer improved relative to the within-cycle condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, Irreg-T; <italic>t</italic>(15) = 0.302, p=0.767, Cohen’s <italic>d</italic> = 0.076), despite the potential benefit of the grouping effect. Putting together, the absence of context-induced modulation effect in Experiments 1d and 1e consistently supports the idea that temporal grouping without dynamic attending guided by feature- and timing-related regularities in the auditory context is insufficient to cause the behavioral modulation effect.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Temporal regularities in color-defined rhythmic structure recompose visual attentional deployment</title><p>Information from the auditory modality, like speech and music, is inherently organized in time and provides rich sources of rhythmic structures that can be proactively tracked by the human brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arnal and Giraud, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Doelling and Poeppel, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Haegens and Zion Golumbic, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Zion Golumbic et al., 2012</xref>).

To test this idea, we designed Experiment 2 to directly investigate whether temporal structures based on the change of visual properties would exert a similar influence on temporal attentional deployment.

In both experiments, however, the switch from one feature-based rhythmic cycle to another was always accompanied by an abrupt change in physical features (pitch or color), resulting in an explicit boundary before T2 presentation in the between-cycle but not in the within-cycle condition. This abrupt change may serve as an attentional cue or alerting signal for the upcoming T2, and thus accounts for the improvement of performance in the between-cycle condition. To examine this possibility, in Experiment 3, we introduced a cyclic motion context that possessed feature-based rhythmicity identical to those contextual rhythms in previous experiments (for more details, see Materials and methods) but had no abrupt boundaries between cycles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>).

In addition to the above analysis of phase-locked neural responses, we also looked into the power spectrum based on the average of single-trial spectral transforms, that is the induced power, which puts emphasis on the intrinsic non-phase-locked activities. In line with the results of evoked power and ITPC, we found consistent patterns for the induced power (for details see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).

As the AB phenomenon is characteristic of its stimulation frequency approximately at 10 Hz within the alpha band, the brain can be in a resonant state with the AB stream at the same frequency. It has been demonstrated that an increase in alpha power at the stimulus frequency indicated attentional orienting to the stimulus stream, providing an online measure of attentional allocation over the RSVP stream (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Müller and Hübner, 2002</xref>).

We conducted the analysis in two clusters whose neural responses in both the delta band (the ITPC at 2.5 Hz) and the alpha band (10 Hz alpha power) had an established link with the attentional modulation effect: one in the parieto-occipital region (P5, PO3, PO5, O1) and the other in the frontal region (AF4, F2, F4). We calculated the modulation index (MI) of phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) between delta (1.5–3.5 Hz) and alpha band (7–13 Hz) for each cluster. The MI was stronger in the between-cycle condition than in the within-cycle condition, while the effect reached significance only in the parieto-occipital region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>; <italic>t</italic>(15) = 2.432, p=0.028) but not in the frontal region (<italic>t</italic>(15) = 1.459, p=0.165).

These results, combined with the findings from single-band analyses, indicate that cortical tracking of hierarchical temporal structures of the auditory context, as well as the coordination of such cortical tracking effects in delta and alpha bands, may play a vital role in reconstructing the deployment of visual attention in the AB task.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Temporal attention guided by time- and feature-based regularities</title><p>Dynamic information flows, such as speech and music, are composed of rhythmic structures nested across multiple timescales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ding et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gross et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Koelsch et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Peelle and Davis, 2012</xref>). These hierarchical structures are organized in time based on regularities in stimulus timing, that is, when sensory signals are emitted (time-based), as well as regularities in information content, that is, how physical or semantic features of the sensory inputs change over time (feature-based). Accrued evidence suggests that temporal structures formed by time-based regularities are effective in directing attention and enhance information selection at the expected time points (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jones et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Nobre et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Nobre and van Ede, 2018</xref>). Yet the current study demonstrates the role of feature-based temporal structures in recomposing temporal attention deployment, which optimizes the distribution of attentional resources over two temporally proximate targets in the AB task.</p><p>We modified the standard AB paradigm by introducing a contextual stream whose physical property changed periodically to form perceivable, but unattended rhythmic cycles in the background. Although this feature-based temporal structure was task-irrelevant, it modulated the deployment of attentional resources along the AB stream, as indicated by higher T2 detection performance when the two targets were located in different cycles than in the same cycle. More intriguingly, this modulation effect was observed no matter whether the contextual stream was from the auditory (Experiment 1) or the visual (Experiment 2) modality. These findings provide clear evidence that temporal structures defined by periodic changes of physical features in a dynamic context can automatically reconstruct the temporal distribution of visual attention.</p><p>In the current study, the rhythmic cycles in the contextual stream consisted of a set of temporally grouped items, some with abrupt changes in physical features across the cycle boundaries. Could the attentional modulation effect be achieved purely on the basis of transient perceptual boundaries or temporal grouping? Findings from several control experiments do not agree with these assumptions. In Experiment 3, the rhythmic cycles of contextual rhythms were defined by cyclic motion without any abrupt changes at the boundaries. Even in this case, the cyclic motion yielded a significant attentional modulation effect, excluding the possibility that the observed effect was caused simply by perceptual changes of the background. In addition, results from Experiments 1d and 1e further confirm that temporal attention guided by temporal regularities rather than perceptual grouping is key to the reduced AB effect. On the one hand, simple grouping without feature-based temporal regularities had little influence on T2 detection (as in Experiment 1d, the feature-based grouping was irregular). On the other hand, when we disrupted time-based regularities by using stochastic stimulus timing, the attentional modulation effect also vanished, even though the rule of feature-based grouping remained in force (as in Experiment 1e, every four identical tones constituted one group). Jointly, these findings point to a mechanism of temporal attentional guidance independent of transient perceptual cues and simple perceptual grouping.</p><p>It is worth noting that the attentional modulation effect did not occur in the absence of regular stimulus timing. In other words, the feature-based regularities should work in tandem with the time-based regularities to reconstruct the dynamics of visual temporal attention, at least under the current experimental settings. This finding is consistent with the emerging view concerning the role of a diversity of temporal structures in guiding adaptive behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Nobre and van Ede, 2018</xref>). It has been suggested by studies using auditory materials, mostly in speech and music perception, that temporal regularities embedded in information content can act along with the time-based anticipation in attentional guidance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Doelling and Poeppel, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Morillon et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Peelle and Davis, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Zion Golumbic et al., 2012</xref>).

Another line of research has also reported improved T2 performance when explicitly cueing the target-onset-asynchrony (TOA) on a trial-by-trial basis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Martens and Johnson, 2005</xref>) or manipulating the predictability of target onset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Tang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Visser et al., 2015</xref>). Despite implementing different approaches, all these studies tried to manipulate certain aspects of T2, regarding either its salience or predictability in time. By contrast, in our study, the salience of targets and temporal expectations about T2 onset were comparable across all experimental conditions. The only difference between the within- and between-cycle conditions was the positions of the two targets relative to the feature-defined temporal structure. Under this situation, items in the RSVP stream were no longer encoded in isolation, but treated as a part of a structured information flow that could be organized by periodic changes in the context. In particular, when T1 and T2 were separated in different cycles, the temporal relations between them were reframed, which might at least partially reduce the competition between the targets, thus improving the resolution of visual temporal attention and boosting the conscious access to T2. Instead of emphasizing the role of a given target or a certain time point, our findings highlight the significance of attentional deployment as a dynamic process in regulating visual awareness and the AB effect, which is modulated by temporal structures of the entire information flow.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Neural entrainment to hierarchical contextual rhythms modulates dynamic attending in visual perception</title><p>Neural oscillations can be entrained to external rhythms across different frequencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Calderone et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Escoffier et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Henry et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mathewson et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Schroeder et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Schroeder and Lakatos, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Thut et al., 2011</xref>), allowing the brain to encode dynamic information with multiplexed rhythmic structures across different timescales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fontolan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lakatos et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">O'Connell et al., 2015</xref>). A fine example of this comes from studies of speech processing. The linguistic structure possesses a temporal hierarchy—from smaller phonetic elements to larger syllabic and phrasal units, which correspondingly elicit neural entrainment at multiple frequency bands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arnal and Giraud, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Zion Golumbic et al., 2012</xref>). Moreover, there is growing evidence that cortical tracking of the higher-order temporal structures plays a vital role in speech comprehension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ding et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gross et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Peelle and Davis, 2012</xref>). In our EEG study, we demonstrate an analogous entrainment effect that not only keeps track of the original AB stream at 10 Hz but also represents the higher-order feature-based structure of contextual rhythms at 2.5 Hz. This effect, distinct from the hierarchical entrainment to speech signals, does not rely on previously acquired knowledge about the structured information and can be established automatically even when the higher-order structure comes from a task-irrelevant and cross-modal contextual rhythm. More importantly, the magnitude of the 2.5 Hz entrainment effect is significantly correlated with the strength of the attentional modulation effect. The scalp topographic map of correlation is lateralized and restricted to the left parietal region, which was found to be associated with temporal attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bolger et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Coull and Nobre, 1998</xref>). These findings are in good accordance with our assumption that the cortical tracking of feature-based contextual structure is critical to the redeployment of attentional resources over the AB stream and may lead to the behavioral modulation effect, which sheds fresh light on the adaptive value of the structure-based entrainment effect by expanding its role from rhythmic information (e.g. speech) perception to temporal attention deployment.</p><p>There has been a debate about whether the neural alignment to rhythmic stimulation reflects active entrainment of endogenous oscillatory processes (i.e. induced activity) or a series of passively evoked steady-state responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Keitel et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Notbohm et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zoefel et al., 2018</xref>). The latter process is also referred to as ‘entrainment in a broad sense’ by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Obleser and Kayser, 2019</xref>. Given that a presented rhythm always evokes event-related potentials, a better question might be whether the observed alignment reflects the entrainment of endogenous oscillations in addition to evoked steady-state responses. Here, we attempted to tackle this issue by measuring the induced power, which emphasizes the intrinsic non-phase-locked activity, in addition to the phase-locked evoked power. Specifically, we quantified these two kinds of neural activities with the average of single-trial EEG power spectra and the power spectra of trial-averaged EEG signals, respectively, according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Keitel et al., 2019</xref>. In addition to the observation of evoked responses to the contextual structure, we also demonstrated an attention-related neural tracking of the higher-order temporal structure based on the induced power at 2.5 Hz (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>), suggesting that the observed attentional modulation effect is at least partially derived from the entrainment of intrinsic oscillatory brain activity.</p><p>In our experiment, the 10 Hz alpha power around T2 is stronger in the between-cycle condition than in the within-cycle condition. A widely accepted function of alpha activity in attention is that alpha oscillations suppress irrelevant visual information during spatial selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kelly et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Thut et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Worden et al., 2000</xref>). However, it becomes a controversial issue when there exists rhythmic sensory stimulation at alpha-band, just like the situation in the current study where both the visual stream and the contextual auditory rhythm were emitted at 10 Hz. In such a case, alpha-band neural responses at the stimulation frequency can be interpreted as either passively evoked steady-state responses (SSR) or actively synchronized intrinsic brain rhythms. From the former perspective (i.e. the SSR view), an increase in the amplitude or power at the stimulus frequency may indicate an enhanced attentional allocation to the stimulus stream that may result in better target detection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Janson et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Keil et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Müller and Hübner, 2002</xref>). Conversely, the latter view of the inhibitory function of intrinsic alpha oscillations would produce the opposite prediction. In a previous AB study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Janson et al., 2014</xref> investigated this issue by separating the stimulus-evoked activity at 12 Hz (using the same power analysis method as ours) from the endogenous alpha oscillations ranging from 10.35 to 11.25 Hz (as indexed by individual alpha frequency, IAF). Interestingly, they found a dissociation between these two alpha-band neural responses, showing that the RSVP frequency power was higher in non-AB trials (T2 detected) than in AB trials (T2 undetected) while the IAF power exhibited the opposite pattern. According to these findings, the currently observed increase in alpha power for the between-cycle condition may reflect more of the stimulus-driven processes related to attentional enhancement. However, we do not negate the effect of intrinsic alpha oscillations in our study, as the current design is not sufficient to distinguish between these two processes.</p><p>Further analysis reveals that, in the left parieto-occipital cluster that exhibits phase-locked neural responses to both feature-based contextual structures at 2.5 Hz and first-order stimulus frequency at 10 Hz, there is an enhancement of phase-amplitude coupling between the delta and alpha oscillations for the between- relative to the within-cycle condition. Moreover, the strength of this delta-alpha coupling enhancement predicts the effect of higher-order temporal structures on dynamic attentional allocation at the individual level. These findings corroborate the idea that neural entrainment to a slower external rhythm may serve as a mechanism of attentional deployment, with the phase of delta oscillation regulating the excitability of neural activity in the alpha band (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gomez-Ramirez et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wilson and Foxe, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wöstmann et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Taken together, findings from the current study have cast new light on the classic theory of DAT and its neural implementation. The DAT assumes attention to be inherently oscillatory and can be driven by the timing pattern of external events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jones, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jones et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jones and Boltz, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Large and Jones, 1999</xref>). By taking advantage of temporal regularities of isochronous or rhythmic events, attentional synchrony can be established and thus improve perceptual accuracy and elevate response speed. Our study extends the DAT to more general cases of dynamic information processing at both the behavioral and the neural levels. Primarily, our behavioral observations suggest that to utilize regularities in a hierarchical temporal structure, the internal attentional oscillation may not only align with first-order rhythmic structures based on stimulus timing, but also with higher-order rhythmic structures defined by content-based changes of the information flow. Such a dynamic attending process necessitates the synergy between time- and content-based regularities, which could be implemented by neural entrainment to the higher-order temporal structure and its coordination with the cortical tracking of the stimulus rhythm through cross-frequency coupling.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In summary, the current study emphasizes the role of feature-defined contextual rhythms in reconstructing the deployment of visual attention along dynamic information streams. This work enriches our knowledge, as raised at the beginning of this article, about how we optimize the limited mental capacity to process successive inputs from this ever-changing world. Taking the AB phenomenon as an example, we provide a new perspective on visual temporal attention research—when examining the perception of complex dynamic information, temporal context on multiple timescales should be taken into consideration because it provides a meaningful hierarchical temporal frame for attentional deployment. This temporal frame, implemented by neural entrainment, may serve to organize attentional resources in a prospective manner and help construct our conscious experience of the world in the dimension of time.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Participants</title><p>A total of 144 volunteers (aged from 18 to 30 years, 69 females) were recruited and paid for their participation in the current study. One hundred and twenty-eight participated in the behavioral Experiments 1a-1e, 2a-2b, and 3 (16 for each experiment, with participants’ gender balanced), and 16 (5 females) in the EEG experiment. All participants had normal or corrected-to-normal vision and normal hearing and were naïve to the purpose of the experiment. Considering the individual differences in the AB effect, only participants who exhibited a typical AB effect (i.e. an impairment of T2 accuracy at short lags compared with that at long lags) during a pre-screening session were asked to take part in the formal experiments. All participants provided written informed consent in accordance with experimental procedures and protocols approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Institute of Psychology, Chinese Academy of Sciences (ethical approval number: H17028).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Stimuli</title><p>The rapid visual serial presentation (RSVP) stream used in the AB task consisted of 16 items (except in Experiments 1c and 1d). Among these items, one or two were the targets (capital letters selected from the alphabet, excluding B, D, O, I, M, Q, S, W, and Z), and the remaining were distractors (one-digit numbers, 1 and 0 excluded, without repetitions between any two of four successive digits). The items were displayed for 83 ms each and were separated by 17 ms blank intervals (except Experiment 1e), generating a 10 Hz rhythm based on stimulus presentation (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, top). Each item subtended 0.47°×0.57° of visual angle and was displayed in white within a gray square (3° × 3°) located at the center of a black screen. In each experiment, a contextual stream, which contained the same number of items as the AB stream but was organized by a feature-defined structure, was presented in synchronization with the AB stream. Stimuli were generated and displayed using MATLAB (The MathWorks Inc, Natick, MA) with the Psychophysics toolbox extension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brainard, 1997</xref>). Visual stimuli were presented on a 21-inch CRT monitor with a viewing distance of 55 cm in a dim room. Auditory stimuli were delivered binaurally over Bose QC3 headphones with the volume set to a comfortable listening level.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Procedures</title><sec id="s4-3-1"><title>Behavioral experiments</title><p>In all experiments, participants were explicitly instructed to ignore the contextual events and focused attention on the AB task. Participants initiated each trial by pressing the enter key. A white fixation cross appeared for 600 ms at the center of the screen, followed by the presentation of an AB stream (along with an auditory/visual stream in the context session). After the last item disappeared, the central fixation turned blue to remind the participant to report the identities of the target(s) in the order they detected them by typing on the keyboard.</p><p>Experiment 1a had a baseline session followed by a context session. In the baseline session, participants viewed only the AB stream and performed the typical AB task. To induce the AB effect, the second target (T2) in the AB stream was located at the second lag of the first target (T1) with a short stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA) of 200 ms, as the magnitude of AB effect is most robust around the second and the third lags. In contrast with the short-SOA condition, we introduced a long-SOA condition where T2 always appeared at the 8th lag of T1 and could rarely be missed. To measure the false alarm rate, we also included catch trials in which only one target was displayed. The context session had the same settings and task as the baseline session, except that a task-irrelevant auditory stream was presented in synchronization with the original RSVP stream. Specifically, the auditory stream was composed of 16 tones, each aligned with the onset of a visual item and displayed for 30 ms. The tone sequence changed its pitch from high (2000 Hz) to low (1200 Hz) or vice versa every four items (corresponding to 400 ms), generating four auditory cycles (i.e. 4-4-4-4) at a rate of 2.5 Hz (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, middle). To examine the regulation effect of such pitch-defined rhythmic structures, we created two experimental conditions specifically for the short-SOA trials, by varying the positions of T1 and T2 relative to the contextual cycles. In the ‘between-cycle condition’, T1 and T2 were located in two adjacent cycles; and in the ‘within-cycle condition’, the two targets were located in the same cycle. To reduce observers’ anticipation about the timing of T1 onset across trials, we introduced various T1 positions while keeping T2 located within the middle two cycles. Each session had 120 experimental trials (40 trials for the between-cycle, within-cycle, and long SOA condition each) and 20 catch trials. These trials were divided into four equal blocks, with randomized trial order within each block.</p><p>Experiment 1b-1e adopted the same procedure as Experiment 1a but with the following exceptions. In Experiment 1b, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> (bottom), we abolished the feature-based structure of the contextual streams by pseudo-randomizing the auditory tone sequences while keeping the pitch of tones at target locations the same as that in Experiment 1a. In Experiment 1 c, we changed the temporal structure of the contextual streams by altering their pitch change rate, generating two types of auditory sequences: one with four five-tone cycles displayed at 2 Hz (i.e., 5-5-5-5, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, upper), and the other with five three-tone cycles at 3.3 Hz (i.e. 3-3-3-3-3, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, lower). For both frequency conditions, T2 was located in the next to last or third from last cycles. In Experiment 1d, we varied the length of chunks in the contextual streams, generating auditory sequences with four chunks of different lengths (e.g. 5-2-4-3) but always having four tones in the third cycle where the second target appeared (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, upper). In Experiment 1e, the feature-based structure remained while the rhythm from stimulus timing was removed (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, lower). Specifically, the tone pitch changed every four items just as in Experiment 1a, whereas the stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA) of each visual item was selected randomly from a predetermined uniform distribution (50, 67, 83, 100, 100, 117, 133, 150 ms) to keep the total presentation time identical to that in Experiment 1a. In both Experiment 1d and 1e, T2 was always the second item in the 3rd cycle for the between-cycle condition and the last item in the 3rd cycle for the within-cycle condition.</p><p>Experiments 2a and 2b had a design similar to that of Experiments 1a and 1b, except that we replaced the auditory context with a visually presented contextual stream that possessed color-defined temporal structure. Specifically, in the context session of Experiment 2a, the color of the background square changed from green to red or vice versa at the same tempo as that for contextual tones in Experiment 1a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, upper). And in Experiment 2b, the background color changed in arrhythmic patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, upper). Luminance of the two colors was matched for each observer with a chromatic flicker fusion procedure before the experiments.</p><p>Experiment 3 consisted of an experimental session with a structured context as that in Experiment 2a and a control session with a random context as that in Experiment 2b. In the experimental session, the contextual rhythm was created by cyclic motion patterns in the background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, upper). Specifically, a blue right-angle (width = 0.38°, side length = 1.5°), initiating from one corner (the upper-left or the upper-right, balanced between blocks) of the background square, rotated clockwise at the same pace as the AB stream. In this way, one cycle of rotation corresponded to the appearance of four items (i.e. 400 ms), forming a 2.5 Hz structure based on the motion cycles. In the control session, no cyclic motion pattern remained but the right-angle shifted to a random quadrant under the constraint of identical initial quadrant in each ‘cycle’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, lower).</p><p>Note that in all these experiments, we also labeled the conditions in baseline and control sessions as ‘within-cycle’ or ‘between-cycle’, just to indicate that these conditions shared the same absolute target positions with the corresponding conditions in the context session. This design was adopted to control for any potential influence of the absolute position of a target within the AB stream. Specifically, for each experimental condition (within- or between-cycle), we matched the absolute positions of T1 and T2 between the context session and the baseline session without a context (Experiments 1–2), or between the experimental session and the control session with a random context (Experiments 1 and 3).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>EEG experiment</title><p>The procedure of the EEG experiment was mostly identical to that of Experiment 1a except for the following modifications. Black items were presented on a gray background and the item size was 0.59°×0.78°. In each trial, the fixation duration was 1000 ms and each item was displayed for 100 ms with no blank interval. T2 was always located within the third cycle of the contextual rhythm. After response, there was a 1.2–1.5 s blank interval. Each subject completed three baseline blocks followed by six experimental blocks with the auditory context. Each block consisted of 40 trials, with 17 short-SOA trials in each of the between- and within-cycle condition, and the remaining six as the catch trials, run in a random order.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>EEG recording</title><p>A SynAmps<sup>2</sup> Neuroscan amplifier system (Compumedics Ltd, Abbotsford, Australia) was used for data acquisition.

Vertical and horizontal eye movements were monitored with two bipolar EOG electrode pairs positioned above and below the left eye and on the outer canthus of each eye.

Power spectra was calculated as the squared amplitude and then converted to decibel scale (i.e. 10*log<sub>10</sub>). To remove unrelated background noises from the frequency response of stimulus rhythms, for each frequency, the mean power at two nearest neighboring frequencies was subtracted from the power at that center frequency.

The first and last 400 ms of the stream was discarded to avoid the edge artifacts after bandpass filtering. The resulting MI values were then averaged across trials for each condition.<disp-formula id="equ2"><label>(2)</label><mml:math id="m2"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">M</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">I</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mo>|</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mfrac><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mi>N</mml:mi></mml:mfrac><mml:munderover><mml:mo>∑</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>N</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:munderover><mml:msub><mml:mtext>A</mml:mtext><mml:mrow><mml:mi>H</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">Φ</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>L</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow><mml:mo>|</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow/></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></disp-formula>where MI is estimated for a single trial with length of N samples or time points, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf2"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>A</mml:mtext></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>H</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mfenced separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced></mml:math></inline-formula> is the amplitude of higher-frequency at time point <italic>n</italic>, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf3"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">Φ</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>L</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> is the phase of lower-frequency at time point <italic>n</italic>, and || represents the complex norm.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6-6"><title>Correlation analysis</title><p>To examine whether the above EEG indices were associated with the observed attentional modulation effect, we correlated these EEG indices with individual’s behavioral modulation index (BMI), which was determined by the following formula:<disp-formula id="equ3"><label>(3)</label><mml:math id="m3"><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">B</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">M</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">I</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal"/><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>P</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>B</mml:mi><mml:mi>E</mml:mi><mml:mi>T</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>P</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>W</mml:mi><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:mi>T</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>P</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>B</mml:mi><mml:mi>E</mml:mi><mml:mi>T</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>P</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>W</mml:mi><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:mi>T</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:math></disp-formula>where <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf4"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>P</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>B</mml:mi><mml:mi>E</mml:mi><mml:mi>T</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf5"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>P</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>W</mml:mi><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:mi>T</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> were the accuracy rate of T2 identification in the between-cycle and the within-cycle conditions in the context session, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6-7"><title>Cluster-based permutation test</title><p>To identify clusters of channels that are significant in each statistical test, we used the cluster-based permutation test, which was first stated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Maris and Oostenveld, 2007</xref> and used in a number of previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Doelling and Poeppel, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Spaak et al., 2014</xref>). Firstly, cluster-level statistics are calculated as the sum of channel-specific test statistics within every cluster. Then, the maximum of the cluster-level statistics is taken as the actual test statistic. Finally, the significance probability of the maximum cluster-level statistic is evaluated under the permutation distribution obtained with the Monte Carlo method in which the permutation cluster-level statistic is calculated by randomly swapping the conditions in participants 1000 times.</p></sec></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This research was supported by grants from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (31830037 and 31771211), the Strategic Priority Research Program (XDB32010300) and the Youth Innovation Promotion Association (2018116) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the National Key Research and Development Project (2020AAA0105600), and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities.</p></ack><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing - original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Software, Writing - original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Software</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Visualization, Methodology, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Supervision, Funding acquisition, Methodology, Writing - review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other" id="fn1"><p>Human subjects: All participants provided written informed consent in accordance with experimental procedures and protocols approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Institute of Psychology, Chinese Academy of Sciences (ethical approval number: H17028).</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec id="s6" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="transrepform"><label>Transparent reporting form</label><media mime-subtype="pdf" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-65118-transrepform-v1.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec id="s7" sec-type="data-availability"><title>Data availability</title><p>We have provided the behavioral and EEG data for individual participants as additional data files.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Floris de Lange as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>All the reviewers agree that it is a well-designed study and the results are exciting by using an innovative approach to modulate attention blink. The reviewers have raised several major concerns that need the authors to address and do additional analysis.</p><p>Evaluation Summary: This study by Wang et al. used a series of carefully designed behavioral experiments to convincingly demonstrate that the attentional blink (AB) could be modulated by higher-order rhythmic regularity. EEG results further support the link between the elicited neural entrainment and the AB modulation effect. They propose that the rhythmic context implements a second-order temporal structure to the first-order regularities posited in dynamic attention theory.</p><p>Essential Revisions:</p><p>1. The current AB behavior results lack several key aspects shown in typical AB experiments. First, typical AB effect would not just test one lag as did here. The authors should show the behavioral results for several lags, i.e., a full AB curve. The results would be informative as to how cortical entrainment affects the whole AB curve. Moreover, there is no data regarding T1 performance, and it is important to show that the better performance for T2 is not due to worse performance in detecting T1. Finally, typical AB design would examine T2 performance when T1 is ignored relative to when T1 has to be detected, but the data is not provided here.</p><p>2. About the EEG results. A general concern is whether the observed behavioral related neural index, e.g., alpha-band power, cross-frequency coupling, could be simply explained in terms of ERP response for T2. For example, when the ERP response for T2 is larger for between-chunk condition compared to within-chunk condition, the alpha-power for T2 would be also larger for between-chunk condition. Likewise, this might also explain the cross-frequency coupling results. The authors should do more control analyses to address the possibility, e.g., plotting the ERP response for the two conditions and regressing them out from the oscillatory index.</p><p>3. The alpha-band increase for T2 is indeed contradictory to the well-known inhibitory function of alpha-band in attention. How could a target that is better discriminated elicit stronger inhibitory response? Related to the above point, the observed enhancement in alpha-band power and its coupling to low-frequency oscillation might derive from an enhanced ERP response for T2 target.</p><p>4. To support that it is the context-induced entrainment that leads to the modulation in AB effect, the authors could examine pre-T2 response, e.g., alpha-power, and cross-frequency coupling, as well as its relationship to behavioral performance. The pre-stimulus response might be more convincing to support the authors' claim.</p><p>5. About the entrainment to rhythmic context and its relation to behavioral modulation index. Previous studies have demonstrated the hierarchical temporal structure in speech signals, e.g., emergence of word-level entrainment introduced by language experience. Therefore, it is well expected that imposing a second-order structure on a visual stream would elicit the corresponding steady-state response. The authors should add more discussions explaining how their findings contribute new understandings to the neural mechanism for the intriguing phenomena.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.65118.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential Revisions:</p><p>1.

To demonstrate the AB effect, we did include two T2 lag conditions in our study (Experiments 1a, 1b, 2a, and 2b) – a short-SOA condition where T2 was located at the second lag of T1 (i.e., SOA = 200 ms), and a long-SOA condition where T2 appeared at the 8th lag of T1 (i.e., SOA = 800 ms). In a typical AB effect, T2 performance at short lags is remarkably impaired compared with that at long lags. In our study, we consistently replicated this effect across the experiments, as reported in the Results section of Experiment 1 (page 5, line 106). Overall, the T2 detection accuracy conditioned on correct T1 response was significantly impaired in the short-SOA condition relative to that in the long-SOA condition (mean accuracy &gt; 0.9 for all experiments), during both the context session and the baseline session. More crucially, when looking into the magnitude of the AB effect as measured by (ACC<sub>long-SOA</sub> – ACC<sub>short-SOA</sub>)/ACC<sub>long-SOA</sub>, we still obtained a significant attentional modulation effect (for Experiment 1a, <italic>t</italic>(15) = -2.729, <italic>p</italic> = .016, Cohen’s <italic>d</italic> = 0.682; for Experiment 2a, <italic>t</italic>(15) = -4.143, <italic>p</italic> &lt;.001, Cohen’s <italic>d</italic> = 1.036) similar to that reflected by the short-SOA condition alone, further confirming that cortical entrainment effectively influences the AB effect.</p><p>Although we included both the long- and short-SOA conditions in the current study, we focused on T2 performance in the short-SOA condition rather than along the whole AB curve for the following reasons. Firstly, for the long-SOA conditions, the T2 performance is at ceiling level, making it an inappropriate baseline to probe the attentional modulation effect. We focused on Lag 2 because previous research has identified a robust AB effect around the second lag (Raymond et al., 1992), which provides a reasonable and sensitive baseline to probe the potential modulation effect of the contextual auditory and visual rhythms. Note that instead of using multiple lags, we varied the length of the rhythmic cycles (i.e., a cycle of 300 ms, 400 ms, and 500 ms corresponding to a rhythm frequency of 3.3 Hz, 2.5 Hz, and 2 Hz, respectively, all within the delta band), and showed that the attentional modulation effect could be generalized to these different delta-band rhythmic contexts, regardless of the absolute positions of the targets within the rhythmic cycles.</p><p>As to the T1 performance, the overall accuracy was very high, ranging from 0.907 to 0.972, in all of our experiments. The corresponding results have been added to the Results section of the revised manuscript (page 5, line 103). Notably, we did not find T1-T2 trade-offs in most of our experiments, except in Experiment 2a where T1 performance showed a moderate decrease in the between-cycle condition relative to that in the within-cycle condition (mean ± SE: 0.888 ± 0.026 vs. 0.933 ± 0.016, respectively; <italic>t</italic>(15) = -2.217, <italic>p</italic> = .043). However, by examining the relationship between the modulation effects (i.e., the difference between the two experimental conditions) on T1 and T2, we did not find any significant correlation (<italic>p</italic> = .403), suggesting that the better performance for T2 was not simply due to the worse performance in detecting T1.</p><p>Finally, previous studies have shown that ignoring T1 would lead to ceiling-level T2 performance (Raymond et al., 1992). Therefore, we did not include such manipulation in the current study, as in that case, it would be almost impossible for us to detect any contextual modulation effect.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. About the EEG results. A general concern is whether the observed behavioral related neural index, e.g., alpha-band power, cross-frequency coupling, could be simply explained in terms of ERP response for T2. For example, when the ERP response for T2 is larger for between-chunk condition compared to within-chunk condition, the alpha-power for T2 would be also larger for between-chunk condition. Likewise, this might also explain the cross-frequency coupling results. The authors should do more control analyses to address the possibility, e.g., plotting the ERP response for the two conditions and regressing them out from the oscillatory index.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the comments. In general, the rhythmic stimulation in the AB paradigm prevents EEG signals from returning to the baseline. Therefore, we cannot observe typical ERP components purely related to individual items, except for the P1 and N1 components related to the stream onset, which reveals no difference between the two conditions and are trailed by steady-state responses (SSRs) resonating at the stimulus rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>).</p><p>To further inspect the potential differences in the target-related ERP signals between the within- and between-cycle conditions, we plotted the target-aligned waveforms for these experimental conditions. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2</xref>, a drop of ERP amplitude occurred for both conditions around T2 onset, and the difference between these two conditions was not significant (paired <italic>t</italic>-test estimated on mean amplitude every 20 ms from 0 to 700 ms relative to T1 onset, <italic>p</italic> &gt;.05, FDR-corrected).</p><p>Since there is a trend of enhanced ERP response for the between-cycle relative to the within-cycle condition during the period of 0 to 100 ms after T2 onset (paired <italic>t</italic>-test on mean amplitude, <italic>p</italic> = .065, uncorrected), we then directly examined whether such post-T2 responses contribute to the behavioral attentional modulation effect and behavior-related neural indices. Crucially, we did not find any significant correlation of such T2-related ERP enhancement with the behavioral modulation index (BMI), or with the reported effects of alpha power and cross-frequency coupling (PAC). Furthermore, after controlling for the T2-related ERP responses, there still remains a significant correlation between the delta-alpha PAC and the BMI (<italic>r</italic><sub>partial</sub> = .596, <italic>p</italic> = .019), which is not surprising given that the PAC is calculated based on an 800-ms time window covering more pre-T2 than post-T2 periods (see the response to point #4 for details) rather than around the T2 onset. Taken together, these results clearly suggest that the T2-related ERP responses cannot explain the attentional modulation effect and the observed behavior-related neural indices.</p><fig id="sa2fig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>ERPs aligned to stream onset.</title><p>EEG signals were filtered between 1–30 Hz, baseline-corrected (-200 to 0 ms before stream onset), and averaged across the electrodes in left parieto-occipital area where 10-Hz alpha power showed attentional modulation effect.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-65118-resp-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><fig id="sa2fig2"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>ERPs aligned to T1 onset.</title><p>EEG signals were filtered between 1–30 Hz, and baseline-corrected using signals -100 to 0 ms before T1 onset.

The alpha-band increase for T2 is indeed contradictory to the well-known inhibitory function of alpha-band in attention. How could a target that is better discriminated elicit stronger inhibitory response? Related to the above point, the observed enhancement in alpha-band power and its coupling to low-frequency oscillation might derive from an enhanced ERP response for T2 target.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the comment. A widely accepted function of alpha activity in attention is that alpha oscillations suppress irrelevant visual information during spatial selection (Kelly et al., 2006; Thut et al., 2006; Worden et al., 2000). However, it becomes a controversial issue when there exists rhythmic sensory stimulation at alpha-band, just like the situation in the current study where both the visual stream and the contextual auditory rhythm were emitted at 10 Hz. In such a case, alpha-band neural responses at the stimulation frequency can be interpreted as either passively evoked steady-state responses (SSR) or actively synchronized intrinsic brain rhythms. From the former perspective (i.e., the SSR view), an increase in the amplitude or power at the stimulus frequency may indicate an enhanced attentional allocation to the stimulus stream that may result in better target detection (Janson et al., 2014; Keil et al., 2006; Müller and Hübner, 2002). Conversely, the latter view of the inhibitory function of intrinsic alpha oscillations would produce the opposite prediction. In a previous AB study, Janson and colleagues (2014) investigated this issue by separating the stimulus-evoked activity at 12 Hz (using the same power analysis method as ours) from the endogenous alpha oscillations ranging from 10.35 to 11.25 Hz (as indexed by individual alpha frequency, IAF). Interestingly, they found a dissociation between these two alpha-band neural responses, showing that the RSVP frequency power was higher in non-AB trials (T2 detected) than in AB trials (T2 undetected) while the IAF power exhibited the opposite pattern. According to these findings, the currently observed increase in alpha power for the between-cycle condition may reflect more of the stimulus-driven processes related to attentional enhancement. However, we do not negate the effect of intrinsic alpha oscillations in our study, as the current design is not sufficient to distinguish between these two processes. We have discussed this point in the revised manuscript (page 18, line 477). Also, we have to admit that “alpha power” may not be the most precise term to describe our findings of the stimulus-related results. Thus, we have specified it as “neural responses to first-order rhythms at 10 Hz” and “10 Hz alpha power” in the revised manuscript (see page 12 in the Results section and page 18 in the Discussion section).</p><p>As for the contribution of T2-related ERP response to the observed effect of 10 Hz power and cross-frequency coupling, please refer to our response to point #2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. To support that it is the context-induced entrainment that leads to the modulation in AB effect, the authors could examine pre-T2 response, e.g., alpha-power, and cross-frequency coupling, as well as its relationship to behavioral performance. The pre-stimulus response might be more convincing to support the authors' claim.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the insightful suggestion. Following this suggestion, we have examined the 10 Hz alpha power within the time window of -100–0 ms before T2 onset and found stronger activity for the between-cycle condition than for the within-cycle condition. This pre-T2 response is similar to the post-T2 response except that it is more restricted to the left parieto-occipital cluster (CP3, CP5, P3, P5, PO3, PO5, POZ, O1, OZ, <italic>t</italic>(15) = 2.774, <italic>p</italic> = .007), which partially overlaps with the cluster that exhibits a delta-alpha coupling effect significantly correlated with the BMI. We have incorporated these findings into the main text (page 12, line 315) and the Figure 5A of the revised manuscript.</p><p>As for the coupling results reported in our manuscript, the coupling index (PAC) was calculated based on the activity during the second and third cycles (i.e., 400 to 1200 ms from stream onset) of the contextual rhythm, most of which covers the pre-T2 period as T2 always appeared in the third cycle for both conditions. Together, these results on pre-T2 10 Hz alpha power and cross-frequency coupling, as well as its relationship to behavioral performance, jointly suggest that the observed modulation effect is caused by the context-induced entrainment rather than being a by-product of post-T2 processing.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. About the entrainment to rhythmic context and its relation to behavioral modulation index. Previous studies have demonstrated the hierarchical temporal structure in speech signals, e.g., emergence of word-level entrainment introduced by language experience. Therefore, it is well expected that imposing a second-order structure on a visual stream would elicit the corresponding steady-state response. The authors should add more discussions explaining how their findings contribute new understandings to the neural mechanism for the intriguing phenomena.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the suggestion. We have provided more discussion on this important issue in the revised manuscript (page 17, line 447). In brief, our study demonstrates how cortical tracking of feature-based hierarchical structure reframes the deployment of attentional resources over visual streams. This effect, distinct from the hierarchical entrainment to speech signals (Ding et al., 2016; Gross et al., 2013), does not rely on previously acquired knowledge about the structured information and can be established automatically even when the higher-order structure comes from a task-irrelevant and cross-modal contextual rhythm. On the other hand, our finding sheds fresh light on the adaptive value of the structure-based entrainment effect by expanding its role from rhythmic information (e.g., speech) perception to temporal attention deployment. To our knowledge, few studies have tackled this issue in visual or speech processing.</p><p>References:</p><p>Raymond, J. E., Shapiro, K. L., and Arnell, K. M. (1992).
