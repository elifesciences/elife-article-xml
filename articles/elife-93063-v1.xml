In addition, we observed that the module and matrix cellular motifs of the LC displayed distinct somatosensory and auditory responses. Specifically, neurons in modules demonstrated primarily offset responses to acoustic stimuli with enhancement in responses to bimodal stimuli, whereas matrix neurons showed onset response to acoustic stimuli and suppressed responses to bimodal stimulation. Thus, this new approach revealed that the repeated structural motifs of the LC permit functional integration of multimodal inputs while retaining distinct response properties.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>inferior colliculus</kwd><kwd>midbrain</kwd><kwd>auditory</kwd><kwd>multiphoton</kwd><kwd>two-photon</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000055</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01DC016599</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Llano</surname><given-names>Daniel A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000055</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01DC013073</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Llano</surname><given-names>Daniel A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000055</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R21DC021605</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Llano</surname><given-names>Daniel A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A new method to image the lateral surface of midbrain revealed novel organization of the lateral cortex of the inferior colliculus of the mouse.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Real-world listening occurs in environments cluttered by noise. To navigate these conditions, the auditory system relies on the integration of multiple sources of input. Broad integration of neural inputs, however, comes at a potential cost. Dense convergence can lead to inappropriate cross-talk between input streams, generating a processing ‘soup’, whereby individual neural pathways cannot be independently modulated. Therefore, highly connected neural systems need to preserve the specificity of inputs in the face of massive integration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Fair et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Sporns et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Tononi et al., 1994</xref>).</p><p>Several brain systems have solved the integration/segregation problem by creating repeated structural motifs that allow independent modulation of different pathways. For example, in the basal ganglia, neurochemical periodicity of the striosome and matrix regions permits the retention of functional independence of input streams in the face of massive convergence. As a result, basal ganglia direct and indirect pathways may be independently modulated, while allowing controlled cross-talk between channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Alexander et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Brimblecombe and Cragg, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Draganski et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gerfen, 1985</xref>).</p><p>In the auditory system, the integration/segregation challenge is particularly formidable in the inferior colliculus (IC). The IC serves as a specialized integration hub because of its heavy innervation by higher auditory centers as well as by nonauditory regions. Thus, the IC stands at the crossroads between multiple brain regions and is thus important for linking acoustic stimuli with non-acoustic inputs. The IC comprises a lemniscal division, the central nucleus (ICC), that receives primarily ascending auditory projections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Oliver, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Willard and Ryugo, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Willott, 2001</xref>), and two non-lemniscal divisions known as the dorsal (DC) and lateral (LC) cortices that receive massive descending auditory as well as nonauditory input (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bajo and Moore, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Coleman and Clerici, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Loftus et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Saldaña et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Schreiner and Winer, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Winer et al., 1998</xref>) as reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lesicko and Geffen, 2022</xref>.</p><p>The LC and DC appear to differ in their strategy for integrating these inputs. The DC does not contain known structural heterogeneities but has a tonotopic arrangement of neuronal responses on its surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Barnstedt et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Wong and Borst, 2019</xref>). In contrast, the LC contains repeated neurochemical motifs, here referred to as modules, that express the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA as well as other metabolic markers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Chernock et al., 2004</xref>). Areas outside the modules, referred to as matrix, stain strongly for calretinin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Dillingham et al., 2017</xref>). We and others have determined that nearly all of the long- and short-range connectivity of the LC is governed by the module/matrix organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Dillingham et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lamb-Echegaray et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lesicko et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Lesicko Alexandria et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Unfortunately, how the LC integrates these inputs while maintaining distinct paths of information flow is not known. For example, LC neurons respond to multisensory stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Jain and Shore, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Zhou and Shore, 2006</xref>), but information from different modalities enters the LC in segregated channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Lesicko Alexandria et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, integration across the module/matrix border must occur, but the mechanisms of this integration remain unknown. Traditional methods of studying the LC, such as in vivo electrophysiology, pose significant challenges in unambiguously assigning individually recorded neurons to residence in matrix or modules. Imaging approaches, such as two-photon (2P) microscopy, have proven to be enormously valuable in understanding the fine spatial structure of neural response properties in the auditory system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bandyopadhyay et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Romero et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Rothschild et al., 2010</xref>). However, because of its superficial location on the dorsal surface of the mouse midbrain, the DC is the only part of the IC that has been characterized by 2P imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Barnstedt et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ito et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Wong and Borst, 2019</xref>). Optically, it has been impossible to characterize the functions of the LC, which is laterally embedded deep in a brain sulcus.</p><p>Here, we describe a novel approach using a 45° microprism inserted into the sulcus that separates the LC from the cerebellum to investigate the fine-scale functional organization of the LC from its lateral surface through 2P imaging. The 2P images obtained from the microprism revealed the first-ever images of the LC in vivo showing its characteristic GABAergic modules. Compared to the DC imaged from the surface, the acoustically and somatosensory-evoked calcium signals obtained by the 2P imaging of the LC through the microprism revealed functional distinctions between the different cellular motifs of the LC. For instance, while modules were more responsive to somatosensory stimulation than matrix, the latter was more acoustically responsive and had a lower detection threshold for complex sounds. Additionally, modules and matrix were found to differently process the spectral and temporal features of the acoustic information. These findings suggest that the non-lemniscal divisions of the IC contain rich but distinct platforms for the processing of different features of auditory and non-auditory information.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The insertion of 45° microprism for imaging the LC from the side</title><p>GAD67-GFP knock-in mice on a Swiss Webster background were crossed with <italic>Thy1</italic>-jRGECO1a mice to produce a GAD67-GFPx jRGECO1a hybrid mouse, which was used to visualize GABAergic modules, to identify the dense network of GABAergic neurons and terminals in modules of the LC in the green channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Tamamaki et al., 2003</xref>) and the calcium indicator, jRGECO1a, in the red channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dana et al., 2018</xref>). A standard craniotomy was performed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Goldey et al., 2014</xref>) with modifications to suit the specific characteristics of the IC in terms of its location, depth, and high density of the surrounding vasculature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Xiong et al., 2017</xref>). The craniotomy (~3 × 4 mm<sup>2</sup>) did not drill directly into the sagittal and lambdoid sutures which allowed minimal disruption of the superficial sinuses below the skull (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) as indicated by the minimal bleeding near the bone flap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). During drilling, pressurized air and a cold stream of saline were used to remove the bone debris and dissipate heat. Because the IC sits deeper in the brain compared to the surrounding structures, the direct insertion of the 45° microprism was found to push the IC ventrally. Therefore, a fine diamond knife was used to separate the lateral surface of the IC from the surrounding tissues without damaging the transverse and sigmoid sinuses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>). This step was followed by a gentle retraction of the knife medially to generate a pocket to secure the microprism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). The successful insertion of the microprism was assessed by examining the reflection of the diamond knife from the microprism’s top glass surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F and G</xref>). Holding the microprism down and retracting the knife upward simultaneously resulted in securing the microprism in its pocket (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H and I</xref>). Locking the microprism down in its pocket for 10 min with the diamond knife (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>) is critical to ensure that the microprism is stabilized and to prevent bleeding. Filling the gap between the skull surface and the microprism with saline was found to generate motion artifact due to the heart pulsation, so 1% agarose was used to fill the gap to reduce the motion artifact and add more stability to the microprism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K</xref>). To compare response properties between the LC and DC, direct imaging (i.e. without a microprism) of the dorsal surface of the IC, where the DC is located, was also conducted by scanning the DC surface from the most medial to lateral regions following the convex curvature of the surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1L and M</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>A brief illustration of the surgical procedures.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A surface view of the mouse’s skull showing the landmarks of the craniotomy over the IC.

Examination of the distribution of GABAergic modules in the LC was critical in validating the target area for functional calcium imaging. Therefore, the 920 nm laser beam was initially used to scan for GFP, which is expressed in the GABAergic cells of GAD67-GFP knock-in mice. The insertion of the microprism was initially viewed by low-magnification fluorescence imaging of the GFP signals from the whole surface of the IC along with the inserted microprism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). This step validated the location of the microprism relative to the IC under the microscope and ensured there was no bleeding that could block the field of view. The 2P images of the GFP signals from the LC imaged via the microprism, or for simplicity LC<sub>(microprism)</sub>, across different animals revealed the LC characteristic GABAergic modules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and E</xref>, the irregular white lines), which were consistent with previous 3D reconstructions of modules from the coronal sections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Chernock et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Lesicko Alexandria et al., 2016</xref>). To further validate the microprism location and the ability to image the LC from the lateral surface, a laser lesion (see Materials and methods) was created via the microprism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>), which was validated histologically (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>). For comparison, the whole dorsal surface of the IC was scanned from medial to lateral borders (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, the dotted white lines). Unlike the LC, most of the dorsal surface of the IC showed a non-clustered distribution of the GABAergic cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D and F</xref>, blue boxes). However, the lateral horizon of the IC dorsal surface showed clusters of GABAergic cells and terminals that were confirmed to be modules, which comprise the prominent feature of the LC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D and F</xref>, red boxes). To further validate the presence of GABAergic modules in the dorsolateral surface of the IC, a laser lesion was created in a GABAergic module located in that area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I and J</xref>, dotted red circle), which was confirmed histologically (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K</xref>), demonstrating that it is possible to image a portion of the LC directly from its dorsal surface.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>The distribution of GABAergic cells on the LC<sub>(microprism)</sub> and DC imaged from the dorsal surface.</title><p>All images were taken for the GFP signals exclusively expressed in GABAergic cells.

Also, the IC is the first site in the ascending auditory pathway where a substantial number of neurons are rate-tuned to AM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Frisina, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Joris et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Langner, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Nelson and Carney, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Rabang et al., 2012</xref>). Even though calcium indicators do not provide a spike-by-spike readout of neural activity, their integrated signal does correlate with the number of spikes produced by a neuron over short time windows (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Vogelstein et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Yaksi and Friedrich, 2006</xref>). Thus, this integrated signal can be used to measure rate responses to AM. Using this integrated signal, we tested the ability of the cells of the LC <sub>(microprism)</sub> to respond to broadband noise at different AM rates within each cellular motif. Within the fraction of responsive cells, the LC<sub>(microprism)</sub> showed cells of different response profiles. While some cells responded only to pure tones or tone-selective (Tone-sel), other cells responded only to AM-noise or noise-selective (Noise-sel). However, some cells responded to both pure tones and AM-noise (Non-sel), when the two stimuli were individually presented. While the LC<sub>(microprism)</sub> had similar fractions of Noise-sel and Non-sel cells, both fractions were significantly higher than that of the Tone-sel cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, one-way ANOVA, p=1.6 × 10<sup>–4</sup>). We also observed that modules and matrix differentially process the spectral information. For instance, the matrix had a significantly greater fraction of Noise-sel cells compared to the modules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, Mann-Whitney test, z=–2.32, p=0.02). In contrast, both cellular motifs had similar fractions of Tone-sel and Non-sel cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, Mann-Whitney test: z=0.48, p=0.62 for Tone-sel and z=1.36, p=0.17 for Non-sel). These findings suggest that neurons in the matrix are more responsive to sounds of greater spectral and temporal complexity than those in the modules. Similar to the LC, the DC showed significantly higher fractions of Noise-sel and Non-sel cells than Tone-sel cells, but the cellular fraction of Non-sel cells was higher than that of Noise-sel cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>, one-way ANOVA, f<sub>(2,9)</sub> = 86.9, p=1.2 × 10<sup>–6</sup>).</p><p>By pooling the cells based on their response to either pure tones or AM-noise, animals showed a lower fraction of responsive neurons to the acoustic stimulation in the LC <sub>(microprism)</sub> compared to the DC regardless of the sound type (two-way ANOVA, f<sub>(1,1,18)</sub> = 9.1, 7.8, and 0.1, p=0.007, 0.01, and 0.75 for region [LC vs DC], stimulus [pure tones vs AM-noise], and interaction, respectively, n=7 animals for LC and 4 animals for DC, the % of responsive cells ± SEM = 48±7% for LC and 75 ± 2% for DC). To evaluate if any optical artifacts due to imaging through a prism could be responsible for this finding, the number of responsive cells imaged from the lateralmost dorsal surface of the IC, which we consider part of the LC because of the presence of GABAergic modules (LC imaged from the dorsal surface or LC<sub>(dorsal surface)</sub>), was quantified and compared with that obtained from the LC<sub>(microprism)</sub>. We observed that there were no significant differences between the number of tone or noise-responsive neurons between the LC<sub>(microprism)</sub> and LC<sub>(dorsal surface)</sub> (two-way ANOVA, f<sub>(1,1, 18)</sub>=0.07, 14.1, and 2.11, p=0.79, 0.001, and 0.16 for the region, stimulus [pure tones vs AM-noise], and interaction, respectively, n=7 animals for LC<sub>(microprism)</sub> and 4 animals for LC<sub>(dorsal surface)</sub>, the % of responsive cells ± SEM = 48 ± 7% for LC<sub>(microprism)</sub> and 45 ± 11% for LC<sub>(dorsal surface)</sub>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>LC and DC respond differently to spectral and temporal modulation of acoustic inputs</title><p>Given that more cells from LC <sub>(microprism)</sub> and DC had responses to AM-noise compared to pure tones, we further quantified the selectivity to spectral or temporal modulation by computing the spectral modulation index (SMI) or the temporal modulation index (TMI), respectively, as well as the number of modulated cells for all the responsive cells (see Materials and methods) across the tested sound levels.</p><p>For the LC<sub>(microprism)</sub>, the matrix has a greater proportion of spectrally modulated cells (cells responding only to pure tones and unmodulated noise) than modules.

Similarly, the matrix had more cells responsive to temporal modulation (cells responding to AM-noise) as a main effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>, two-way ANOVA, p=2.7 × 10<sup>–4</sup>, 1.0, and 0.32 for the region, sound level, and interaction, respectively), which was consistent with the above results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>).</p><p>The DC and LC imaged via microprism were found to have different profiles of modulation of responses to spectral and temporal complexity.

Previous work has shown that while somatosensory projections mostly target the modules, the auditory projections tend to target the matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Lesicko Alexandria et al., 2016</xref>), which indicates that the LC is a multisensory integration site. Therefore, we examined the somatosensory and auditory cellular responses on the surface of the LC by coupling the 2P imaging with the microprism with a whisker or acoustic stimulation (see Materials and methods). Acoustic stimulation was done with 500 ms of unmodulated broadband noise at 80 dB SPL. After the acoustic or somatosensory stimulation, evoked cellular responses were observed from the neurons of the LC<sub>(microprism)</sub> as well as the DC imaged directly from the dorsal surface. According to these cellular responses, different types of neurons were found in modules and matrix of the LC<sub>(microprism)</sub> as well as the DC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A–D</xref>). Also, the auditory response evoked by auditory stimulation was only found to be modulated (suppressed vs enhanced) when the auditory stimulation was simultaneously presented with somatosensory stimulation (bimodal stimulation) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E and F</xref>). The cells of every structure were then mapped according to their responses. Auditory and somatosensory responses were evoked in the neurons of both matrix and modules imaged via microprism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A, B, and D</xref>). Within the pool of responsive cells, the cells were categorized into cells that respond only to auditory stimulation (auditory selective cells [Aud-sel]), only to somatosensory stimulation (somatosensory selective cells [Som-sel], or nonselectively to both stimuli [Aud/Som-nonsel]) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>). Both modules and matrix showed a higher fraction of Aud-sel cells than that of Som-sel and Aud/Som-nonsel cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7H</xref>, chi-square test, χ<sup>2</sup>=33.1, p=3.5 × 10<sup>–6</sup>). Pooling the cells based on their auditory vs somatosensory responses revealed that more auditory-responsive cells (Aud-sel+Aud/Som-nonsel) were found in the matrix, while more somatosensory-responsive cells (Som-sel+Aud/Som-nonsel) were clustered in the modules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B, D, F, and I</xref>, chi-square test, χ<sup>2</sup>=26.0, p=9.3 × 10<sup>–5</sup>), which was consistent with the reported difference in inputs to modules compared to matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Lesicko Alexandria et al., 2016</xref>). Additionally, while most of the acoustically responsive cells in the matrix showed onset responses, the cells showing acoustically driven offset responses were clustered in the modules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C and J</xref>, chi-square test, χ<sup>2</sup>=120.5, p&lt;0.001). Moreover, a higher fraction of Aud/Som-nonsel cells in the modules had offset, not onset, auditory response than those located in the matrix (chi-square test, χ<sup>2</sup>=13.2, p=0.004, % of Aud/Som-nonsel cells = 57%, 15%, 8%, and 20%, for auditory offset cells in modules, auditory onset cells in modules, auditory offset cells in matrix, and auditory onset cells in the matrix, respectively), which suggests a multisensory integrative function by those cells as discussed later. Given the specific spatial location of the somatosensory-responsive cells in the modules which contain clusters of GABAergic cells, we asked if somatosensory stimulation could suppress the auditory response when both stimuli are presented simultaneously (bimodal stimulation). To test this hypothesis, we calculated and visualized the response index (RI), which was calculated as the ratio of the cellular response to bimodal stimulation to the cellular response to acoustic response alone for auditory-responsive cells. Accordingly, some cells showed suppressed (RI&lt;1) or enhanced (RI&gt;1) auditory responses in both modules and matrix following bimodal stimulation. We observed that matrix and modules have more cells with suppressed auditory responses than those having enhanced auditory responses. However, matrix had a higher fraction of cells with suppressed responses than modules, while modules had a higher fraction of cells with enhanced responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G and K</xref>, chi-square test, χ<sup>2</sup>=12.9, p=0.04).</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>The waveforms of the somatosensory vs acoustic responses of the LC<sub>(microprism)</sub> and the dorsal cortex (DC) imaged via microprism.</title><p>Examples of different cell types based on their responses to auditory or somatosensory stimulations as well as their response timing to the auditory stimulation as indicated by waveforms of the evoked calcium signals.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-93063-fig6-v1.tif"/></fig><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Types of somatosensory and auditory responses from the lateral cortex (LC) neurons imaged via microprism.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The two-photon (2P) images of GFP (green) and jRGECO1a expression (magenta) in the LC<sub>(microprism)</sub> show the modules within white irregular lines.

Imaging the LC either via microprism or from the dorsal surface revealed that it contains GABAergic modules that were embedded in a non-GABAergic matrix. Although modules and matrix were found to be activated by somatosensory and auditory stimuli, they were functionally distinct. The matrix had more auditory-responsive cells with a lower threshold for complex sound detection and had more cells responsive to complex spectral and temporal auditory features than modules. In contrast, modules had more somatosensory responsive cells, consistent with anatomical differences in input to the modules compared to matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Lesicko Alexandria et al., 2016</xref>). Somatosensory stimulation suppressed auditory responses in the matrix, suggesting that multisensory interactions exist between the matrix and modules.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>The novelty of the imaging setup and technical considerations</title><p>Microprism-based 2P microscopy has been successfully used to image the cortical layers in the somatosensory and visual cortices of mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Andermann et al., 2013</xref>) and to image other inaccessible cortical surfaces like those folded in the brain sulci such as the medial prefrontal cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Low et al., 2014</xref>) or entorhinal cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Beckmann et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Heys et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Low et al., 2014</xref>). In those studies, the glass window glued to the microprism was used, which requires significant skill and potential removal of brain regions to allow prism access (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Heys et al., 2014</xref>). Another approach is to use a micro metal or diamond-made knife to create a pocket with minimal tissue damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Andermann et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Marks and Goard, 2021</xref>). Accordingly, we combined and modified some of these procedures to improve the microprism implantation to image the sagittal surface of the LC, which is deeply embedded into the brain tissue in a highly vascular area, with minimum damage to the IC or the surrounding vasculature.</p><p>Previous work using microprisms has been done chronically for up to 60 days (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Heys et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Low et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Wenzel et al., 2017</xref>), with minimal tissue inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Andermann et al., 2013</xref>). The current study was initially done on anesthetized animals to examine and validate the new approach, which later revealed similar organizational differences between LC and DC in awake animals. Although imaging through a microprism and 1 mm cover glass appears to have minimal impact on image quality compared to direct 2P imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Chia and Levene, 2009</xref>), it was important to compare LC imaging via microprism with the direct 2P imaging of the dorsal surface to validate the new imaging method. We found no significant differences between LC response properties when imaging via microprism or imaging directly from the dorsal surface. However, we did observe significant functional differences between the LC and the DC.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Responsiveness to spectral and temporal features</title><p>While the LC showed inconsistent and fragmented tonotopy, the DC showed a consistent one, as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Barnstedt et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Wong and Borst, 2019</xref>). These data were supported by a lower R<sup>2</sup> of the best regression fit between BTFs of the LC cells and their locations compared to a higher R<sup>2</sup> obtained for the DC. The direction of the best regression fit shown by the LC was inconsistent across animals, which could be related to the fact that the microprism did not permit a full view of the LC surface. Given that microprism permits imaging of only a single area per animal, it is expected that each animal may have a different profile of cellular organization based on the location of the imaged area on the LC.</p><p>The surface of the DC was biased to lower frequencies compared to LC, consistent with previous imaging and recording studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ito et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Romand and Ehret, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Shen et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Stiebler and Ehret, 1985</xref>). Despite their response to pure tones, the DC and LC, particularly in the matrix, were more responsive to AM-noise, which fits their function as non-lemniscal divisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Chen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Faye Lund and Osen, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Loftus et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>The spectral and temporal features of animal vocalization and speech are not independent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Singh and Theunissen, 2003</xref>). We observed that LC neurons, particularly in the matrix, had greater responsiveness to spectral and temporal modulation than the DC. Given the role of inhibition in spectral and temporal processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cai et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chang et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Wehr and Zador, 2003</xref>), GABAergic cells of the modules could play an important role in increasing the SMI and TMI, especially at lower sound levels, which could be critical for localizing objects in noisy environments given the importance of spectral and temporal cues for sound localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Davis et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Goodman et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Sinex, 2005</xref>). Therefore, future work is critical to image the functional responses of the GABAergic cells of the modules and compare them with the non-GABAergic cells inside and outside the modules.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Somatosensory vs auditory responses</title><p>Consistent with the previous anatomical findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Lesicko Alexandria et al., 2016</xref>), modules showed more somatosensory responsive cells than matrix. Since modules receive somatosensory inputs from different brain regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Lesicko Alexandria et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Lohse et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Zhou and Shore, 2006</xref>), the somatosensory response shown by modules could be modulated by different types of somatosensory stimulations, which is an open area for future studies. In contrast to modules, we observed that most auditory-responsive neurons, particularly onset-responsive neurons, were found in the matrix, which receives mostly auditory inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Lesicko Alexandria et al., 2016</xref>). However, a subpopulation of acoustically driven offset-responsive neurons preferably resides in the modules compared to the matrix. Given that the offset response could be generated as a rebound to the termination of the ongoing inhibition during the sound presentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Xu et al., 2014</xref>), GABAergic cells in the modules could play an important role in the coding of sound termination as found before in the cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Solyga and Barkat, 2021</xref>). Because some of the offset acoustically driven cells inside the modules were also activated by the somatosensory stimulation, this fraction of cells could then encode the termination of somatosensory-associated sounds through the local inhibitory circuits of the modules. Under in vivo recording of the mouse IC, the offset responses were previously reported from cells that were non-GABAergic and located in the caudal and shallower parts of the IC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kasai et al., 2012</xref>). These data suggest that the module/matrix system permits the preservation of distinct multimodal response properties, which is consistent with their anatomical distinction, despite the massive integration of inputs in the LC.</p><p>Consistent with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aitkin et al., 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aitkin et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Jain and Shore, 2006</xref>), we observed that combined auditory-somatosensory stimulation generally suppressed neural responses to auditory stimuli and that this suppression was the most prominent in the LC matrix of anesthetized animals. Mechanistically, it is not known if such suppressive responses are created in the LC or are inherited from other brain regions since auditory-somatosensory interactions occur as early as in the cochlear nucleus, and are also found in the IC, thalamus, and cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aitkin et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Haenggeli et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kimura et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Li and Mizuno, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Lohse et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Shore, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Shore et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Wong et al., 2015</xref>), reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Brunelle and Llano, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Lohse et al., 2022</xref>. We note that a systematic exploration of the stimulus space was not conducted here such that other acoustic or somatosensory stimuli, different relative amplitudes, or timings could have produced enhancement rather than suppression. Future work will be needed to further explore this stimulus space to more fully understand multisensory processing in the LC.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Effect of ketamine anesthesia</title><p>The data obtained from anesthetized animals were similar to those obtained from awake animals in the findings related to the tonotopy, the preference of the cells to respond to AM-noise in the LC and DC, the increased sensitivity of matrix to detect the spectral and temporal features of sound, and the bimodal response properties of the matrix vs modules. However, anesthetized and awake animals showed some differences that could be related to the effect of ketamine. For instance, ketamine was found to broaden the RF of the auditory-responsive neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Guo et al., 2012</xref>). Consistently, the width of the RF of all DC and LC neurons was higher under ketamine anesthesia compared to awake preparation. However, the DC neurons had a wider RF than those in the LC. The relatively narrower RF of the LC could be consistent with their higher SMI (discussed below) compared to that of the DC. Both findings could be related to the degree of inhibition that may shape the inhibitory bands of the RF in the LC neurons given that the LC has prominent GABAergic modules. Also, while the average of the SMIs was negative with no difference between the LC<sub>(microprism)</sub> and the DC of awake animals, it was positive with a higher value in the LC<sub>(microprism)</sub> compared to the DC of the anesthetized animals, indicating the preference of cells to respond more to pure tones under anesthesia. Given that ketamine was reported to increase the duration of the tone-evoked response in the auditory cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Guo et al., 2012</xref>), the same effect could increase the area under the curve (AUC) for the tone-evoked response that might result in a positive average of SMI. Additionally, while LC had a higher average of TMIs than that of the DC of anesthetized animals, the LC had a lower mean of TMIs than that of the DC of awake animals, indicating that ketamine may specifically modulate the response properties of the LC via its effects on GABAergic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Behrens et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Deane et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Weckmann et al., 2019</xref>), given that GABAergic inhibition reportedly contribute to the processing of the temporally modulated signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Alluri et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Burger and Pollak, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cai et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Gourévitch et al., 2020</xref>). In both anesthetized and awake animals, matrix neurons always had a consistent ratio between the cells with suppressed (~70%) and enhanced (~30%) auditory responses induced by bimodal stimulation. However, modules had variable ratios across anesthetized and awake animals. While modules had a lower fraction of cells with enhanced responses than matrix in awake animals, they had a higher fraction of cells with enhanced responses in anesthetized animals, which could be consistent with the direct inhibitory effect of ketamine on GABAergic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Behrens et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Deane et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Weckmann et al., 2019</xref>). Given that modules are clusters of GABAergic cells and terminals, modules could be specifically modulated by ketamine anesthesia.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Here, using a novel microprism approach to image the LC in anesthetized and awake mice, we observed that (1) DC displayed tonotopic organization which was not consistently present in the LC, (2) DC neurons were generally more sound-responsive than LC neurons but that neurons in both regions had preferential responses to spectrally and temporally complex stimuli, (3) matrix regions of the LC were more responsive to spectrally and temporally complex stimuli than modules and that modules were more responsive to somatosensory stimuli, and (4) bimodal stimulation led to suppressive responses that were more prominent in the matrix. In general, these data highlight significant organizational differences between the LC and DC and between modules and matrix in the LC.

GAD67-GFP (<italic>GAD1<sup>GFP</sup></italic>) knock-in mice (developed and shared with permission from Dr. Yuchio Yanagawa at Gunma University and obtained from Dr. Douglas Oliver at the University of Connecticut), where GFP is exclusively expressed in GABAergic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Tamamaki et al., 2003</xref>), were used to visualize the GABAergic cells and LC modules. To simultaneously monitor calcium signals and visualize the GFP+ cells, Tg(<italic>Thy1</italic>-jRGECO1a)GP8.20Dkim/J mice (Jackson Laboratory, Stock# 030525) were crossed with GAD67-GFP knock-in mice to generate GAD67-GFPx<italic>Thy1</italic>-jRGECO1a hybrid mice. The mice were housed and bred at the animal research facility of The Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology. The animal care facilities are approved by the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care (AAALAC). To phenotype the GFP-positive animals, a single-photon fluorescence microscope was used for the transcranial examination of the pups at postnatal day 4 using excitation: 472/30 nm and emission 520/35 nm filters along with dichroic 505 nm long pass at low power magnification (×2.5/0.08, Olympus Objectives, MPlanFL N, Japan). The positive pups exhibited a green fluorescence in the cerebellum, the cerebral cortex, and the olfactory bulb and were only kept with their parents until weaning. The genotyping for jRGECO1a was done using a probe composed of a forward primer: <named-content content-type="sequence">GCCGCCGAGGTCAAGA</named-content> and a reverse primer: <named-content content-type="sequence">TCCAACTTGATGTCGACGATGTAG</named-content> by Transnetyx (Transnetyx, USA). Samples of the mice’s tail snips around 1 month of age were used for genotyping. All applicable guidelines for the care and use of animals were followed. All procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Surgery</title><p>The general procedures of craniotomy were previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Goldey et al., 2014</xref>), with modifications to place craniotomy over the IC. Before surgery, mice were anesthetized with a mixture of ketamine, xylazine, and acepromazine (100, 3, and 3 mg/kg, respectively) delivered intraperitoneally. The anesthesia was maintained during the surgery and imaging using only ketamine (100 mg/kg). To prevent neural edema during or after the craniotomy, an intramuscular injection of dexamethasone sodium (4.8 mg/kg) was given just before the surgery using an insulin syringe. After placing the animal in the stereotaxic apparatus (David Kopf Instruments, USA), both eyes were protected by applying Optixcare lubricant eye gel (Aventix Animal Health, Canada). The hair on the scalp was then removed by massaging the scalp with a depilatory cream (Nair) using a cotton-tipped applicator and leaving the cream on the scalp for 4–5 min. The cream was then removed by a thin plastic sheet (flexible ruler) to leave a hair-free area on the scalp. The remaining tiny hairs were then removed by alcohol swab and the area was then sterilized by applying 10% povidone-iodine (Dynarex, USA) using a sterile cotton-tipped applicator. The medial incision was made with a scalpel blade #10, and 0.2 ml of 0.5% lidocaine was injected intradermally into the scalp. The skin extending from the medial line to the temporalis muscle was completely removed using a pair of microscissors to produce a wide skinless area above the skull. Number 5/45 forceps were used to remove any remaining periosteum. The remaining dried or firmly attached pieces of periosteum were removed with a scalpel blade #10. The skull was cleaned with sterile saline and dried with gently pressurized air. Using the stereotaxic apparatus, a wide area of ~3 × 4 mm<sup>2</sup> above the left IC was made. A micro drill bit (size #80, Grainger, USA) was used to drill through the skull starting from the rostrolateral (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, yellow circle) region to lambda (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, black circle) following the border in a clockwise direction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, dotted black rectangle). To prevent overheating of the superficial brain tissues and to mitigate the occasional spurts of skull bleeding during the drilling, ice-cold sterile saline was used to intermittently irrigate the surface. A stream of pressurized air was also applied during the drilling procedures to prevent overheating and remove the debris produced by the drilling. Caution was taken not to pierce the dura when performing the craniotomy while crossing the sagittal or the lambdoid sutures to avoid damaging the underlying sinuses. After drilling, the skull was irrigated in sterile saline and the bone flap (the undrilled bone over the craniotomy area) was gently examined for complete separation from the rest of the skull (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Using a pair of no. 5/45 forceps, the bone flap was gently removed. To control the bleeding if it occurred, a piece of sterile hemostatic gel (Adsorbable Gelatin Sponge USP, Haemosponge, GBI, India), which was pre-soaked in ice-cold saline, was applied to the bleeding spot. Once the bleeding ceased, the brain was kept covered in sterile saline. In some surgeries, the dura was peeled off from the surface of the IC while removing the bone flap. In the surgeries where the dura remained intact, a Bonn microprobe (FST, Germany, Item # 10032-13) was used to pierce the dura in an area that is not above the IC and devoid of cortical vasculature (e.g. a part of exposed cerebellum). After piercing, the dura was carefully and gently lifted, and a pair of no. 5/45 forceps were used to grab the dura to gently tear it to the extent of the transverse sinus to avoid bleeding of the major venous structures.</p><p>Using the stereotaxic apparatus, a 30° diamond knife (FST, Germany, Item # 10100-30) was placed in its vertical position. From the medial line, the knife was placed at the lateral horizon of the IC. The knife was then inserted 1.5 mm ventrally. Caution was taken to avoid hitting any major blood vessels to avoid bleeding. From its position, the knife was retracted 0.3–0.5 mm medially to create an initial pocket for the insertion of the microprism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–E</xref>). The microprism (1.5 mm silver coated, Tower Optical Corporation) was then inserted, so one of its sides was parallel to the lateral surface of the diamond blade, the other side was facing up, and its hypotenuse was facing ventrally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F and G</xref>). The wooden piece of a cotton swab was carefully driven down to push the microprism until its top surface was at the same level as the IC dorsal surface. Keeping the microprism in its place with the wooden end of a swab, the diamond knife was carefully retracted upward leaving the microprism behind (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). If the retraction of the diamond knife pulled the prism up, the wooden piece would be used to push it down simultaneously with the knife movement. To control the bleeding, a piece of sterile hemostatic gel was used as before. The tip of the diamond knife was used to secure the microprism in its position for at least 10 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>). During that time, the solution of the 1% agarose was prepared for use. A pair of forceps were then used to gently place a sterile 5 mm cover glass #1 (Thomas Scientific, USA) over the skull covering the opened area above the IC. The cover glass was secured by a wooden trimmed piece of sterile cotton swab by gently pressing the cover glass from the top. Since the surface of the IC was located below the surfaces of both the cerebellum and cerebral cortex, the cover glass usually traps about a 0.7–1.0 mm thick sheet of sterile saline. The movement of the liquid medium caused by heart pulsation was found to be a source of motion artifact during imaging, so the gap between the surface of the IC and the cover glass was filled with 1% agarose gel that was made in saline at a temperature range of 33–35 °C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K</xref>). The extra agarose gel pieces were cut off and removed by the scalpel blade and the wet skull was then dried out using pressurized air. A titanium headpost as described before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Goldey et al., 2014</xref>) was glued carefully on the top of the skull to be at the same level as the cover glass. Following the manufacturer’s instructions, the C&amp;B Metabond (Parkell, Japan) was used to secure the headpost in its place. Excluding the steps of the microprism insertion, the same procedures were followed for DC imaging from the surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1L</xref>). For awake preparations, the same procedures were followed under isoflurane anesthesia starting with 4% of isoflurane as an induction dose with 1–2% isoflurane during the surgery. The animal was transferred under the microscope objective and left to recover from isoflurane anesthesia for 1 hr before imaging. To ensure the animal’s recovery, the animal was visually inspected for its breathing rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ewald et al., 2011</xref>) and ongoing limb movements.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Acoustic stimulation</title><p>Using a custom-made MATLAB (The MathWorks, Natick, MA, USA) code, either 500 ms pure tone or AM-noise was generated.

The imaging of the DC was made using a ×20 water-immersion objective (LUMPlanFI/IR, ×20, NA: 0.95, WD: 2 mm; Olympus Corporation, Tokyo, Japan), while the lateral surface of the IC was imaged by the long working distance ×16 water-immersion objective (N16XLWD-PF – CFI LWD Plan Fluorite Objective, ×16, NA: 0.8, WD: 3.0 mm; Nikon, Tokyo, Japan) to be able to reach the focal point of the microprism at its hypotenuse. For imaging both the GFP or jRGECO1a signals, the excitation light was generated by InSight X3 laser (Spectra-Physics Lasers, Mountain View, CA, USA) tuned to a wavelength of 920 or 1040 nm, respectively. A layer of a 1:1 mixture of wavelength multipurpose ultrasound gel (National Therapy, Canada) with double-deionized water was used to immerse the objective. This gel was able to trap the water and reduce its evaporation during imaging. The emitted signals were detected by a photomultiplier tube (Hamamatsu H7422PA-4, Japan) following a t565lp dichroic and a Chroma barrier et525/70m filter for GFP and et595/50m filter for jRGECO1a signals. Images (512×512 pixels) were collected at a frame rate of 29.9 Hz in the resonant galvo mode. Data were collected from the dorsal surface of the IC by scanning the surface of the IC based on the GFP and jRGECO1a signals through the medial and lateral horizons of the IC. Generally, the scanning was started by moving the ×20 objective to the most ventromedial position, where there is no ability to see any cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, medial horizon). Then, the objective was driven to slowly move dorsolaterally to get cells in focus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1M</xref>), where the average depth of the first field of view was 169 μm. The lateral movement of the objective was intended to be aligned and parallel to the curvature of the DC surface indicated by getting the superficial cells in focus to avoid any possibility of imaging the upper layers of the central nucleus of the IC, so the average depth of the most superficial point of the imaging was 92 μm. The scanning was ended by moving the objective to the most ventrolateral position of the IC, where there is no ability to see GFP laterally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, lateral horizon), where the last field of view was collected at an average depth of 225 μm. Generally, each field of view was selected based on the expression of GFP signals as an indicator for the cells in focus and being acoustically active by using a search stimulus that was 500 ms broadband noise with zero modulation at 80 dB SPL. The z-axis of the objective was determined relative to the pia surface. The relative position of each region was tracked through the micromanipulator (MP-285, Sutter Instruments) that controlled the microscope objective. The positions of imaged areas were further aligned across animals to a common coordinate using the midline, lateral extremes, and the vasculature landmarks taken via imaging of the GFP signals of the cranial window with low magnification (×4 Olympus Objectives, 4×4 binning, 50 ms frame time) using a Lumen 200 bulb (Prior Scientific Inc, USA) and CoolSNAP MYO camera (Photometrics, USA, excitation: 488 nm and emission: 515–550 nm). Imaging of the lateral surface of the IC via microprism was done similarly. In both cases, the frame timing of the scanner and the sound stimuli were both digitized and time-locked using a Digidata 1440A (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) with Clampex v. 10.3 (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Laser lesion</title><p>The laser lesion was produced using a 720 or 820 nm laser beam at 74–80 mW power at the level of the objective for 100–250 s depending on the size of the lesioned area, the speed of laser scanning (frame rate), and the depth of the lesion (z-axis length). In brief, the area of interest and the dimension of the laser lesion were initially determined using 920 nm as indicated by the GFP signals through scanning one of the GABAergic modules. The depth of the GABAergic modules was then determined by counting the optical slices starting from their superficial surface. The tunable laser was then switched from 920 nm to the shorter wavelength (720 or 820 nm) to scan the same area and depth at a rate 1–2 frames/s.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Data processing</title><sec id="s4-7-1"><title>Data collection</title><p>The data were collected as separate movies (512×512 pixels) for each pure tone or AM-noise runs in a resonant galvo mode. Depending on the amplitude and frequency combinations for each type of acoustic stimulus, 40 or 52 s periods were assigned as a movie’s length for pure tone (35 stimulus combinations) or AM-noise (45 stimulus combinations), respectively. Using ImageJ software, the z-projection was used to compute one single image representing either the sum, the standard deviation, or the median of all the image sequences in the movie. Based on these single images, the region of interest (ROI) was manually drawn around each detectable cell body. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref> represents the sum of the image sequences of the movie collected from the dorsal surface, or the lateral surface of the IC via microprism, respectively.

Based on the previous reports showing the tonotopic organization over the DC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Barnstedt et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Wong and Borst, 2019</xref>), the tonotopy was examined along the rostromedial to caudolateral axis. The x<sub>2</sub> and y<sub>2</sub> coordinates of each cell were determined. At the starting point of each axis, the x<sub>1</sub> and y<sub>1</sub> coordinates were assigned values as (0, 0). Then, the distance (d) between each cell and the starting point at each axis was calculated based on the following equation:<disp-formula id="equ6"><mml:math id="m6"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:msqrt><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>y</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mi>y</mml:mi><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:msqrt></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>For each 50 µm (bin size), the geometric average of the BTFs of all cells as well as their distances from the starting point at each axis were computed. The linear or quadratic polynomial regressions were then examined between the geometric averages of BTFs and the geometric averages of distances of cells for each animal.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Detecting the spontaneous activity from the nonresponsive cells</title><p>Movies have been recorded from the nonresponsive cells of the LC<sub>(microprism)</sub> when no stimulation was presented. The time trace of jRGECO1a signals was extracted from each cell. A polynomial fitting of the time trace was used to correct for photobleaching and to adjust for the baseline for the whole trace. The sliding average of the baseline was then calculated for 1 s (~29 frames), and the z-score was calculated for the subsequent frames. The spontaneous activity was detected when the z-score was &gt;3.0.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Statistics</title><p>All statistical analyses and graphs were made using Origin Pro software. The normality of the distributions of the data was examined using a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. The Mann-Whitney test as well as two-sample or paired t-test were used to examine the difference in data distribution or the difference between samples of non-normal and normal distribution, respectively. Either one-way or two-way ANOVA as well as Fisher as a post hoc test were used for the mean comparison between different groups of normal distribution. The chi-square (χ<sup>2</sup>) test or Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA tests were used to compare the samples based on cell numbers of their cellular population. The cumulative frequency function was computed to calculate the fraction of cells tuned at each frequency based on their best frequency. Differences were deemed significant when p-value&lt;0.05. The upper and lower borders of each box plot are at the 25th and 75th percentile, with whiskers at 95% spread.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Histology</title><p>After the 2P imaging, the mouse was transcardially perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) solution in PBS solution. The isolated brain was then placed overnight in PFA for a complete fixation. The brain was then moved from the PFA to a graded sucrose solution (10%, 20%, and 30%) until it sunk. 50 μm coronal sections were taken at the level of the IC using a Leica cryostat. The sections were then mounted on a slide, coverslipped, and imaged using a confocal microscope for imaging the GFP signals as an indicator for the GABAergic cells in the GAD67-GFP knock-in mouse (excitation: 488 nm and emissions: 515–550 nm).</p><p>For the examination of jrgeco1a expression in the IC, the mouse was transcardially perfused with saline with a high concentration of potassium and a high ratio of calcium to magnesium ([in mM] 3.5 KCl, 25 glucose, 125 NaCl, 1.2 KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 2 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.5 MgSO<sub>4</sub>) under ketamine anesthesia. The brain was then fixed by a subsequent perfusion of 4% PFA. Selected 40 μm coronal sections at the level of the IC were immunostained for NeuN using (NeuN [D4G40] XP Rabbit mAB, Cell Signaling, Cat# 62994, 1:100) primary antibody and (goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to Alexa Fluor 405, 1:200, Thermo Fisher, USA) secondary antibody following the immunostaining procedures that were previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Issa et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Vaithiyalingam Chandra Sekaran et al., 2021</xref>). Confocal images were obtained using a Confocal Zeiss LSM 710 Microscope using ×10 and ×40 objectives and tile scan functions. For NeuN, Alexa Fluor 405 signals were obtained by a 405 nm laser and emission at 415–466 nm. The GFP signals were obtained by a 488 nm laser and emission at 501–551 nm. The jRGECO1a signals were obtained by 561 nm laser and emission at 600–700 nm. All cells with somas expressing a red fluorescence of jrgeco1a were quantified in 2P-imaged areas of the DC and LC. The density of the cells expressing jrgeco1a was then calculated based on the cells expressing NeuN.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Artwork</title><p>The cartoon of the mouse brain in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C, F, and I</xref> was obtained from Brain Explorer 3D viewer Allen Mouse Brain (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://connectivity.brain-map.org/3d-viewer?v=1">https://connectivity.brain-map.org/3d-viewer?v=1</ext-link>) and modified to be suitable for illustration. All figures were designed and made using Adobe Illustrator (Adobe, San Jose, CA, USA). To keep working within the Adobe environment to avoid losing the resolution of the figures, Adobe Photoshop (Adobe, San Jose, CA, USA) was used to crop the borders of some images to save space. The color pallets were chosen to avoid the combination of the green and red colors for all maps, so they will be suitable for color-blind readers. To induce the same effect in the microscope images combining the red (jRGECO1a) and green (GFP) fluorescence, we kept the green signals of the GFP unchanged, but we substituted the red fluorescence of jRGECO1a with magenta as a pseudocolor.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Formal analysis, Visualization, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Formal analysis, Visualization, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Data curation, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>This study was performed in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health.

Dan Llano's group have previously identified gaba'ergic patches (modules) in the LC distinctly receiving inputs from somatosensory structures, surrounded by matrix regions receiving inputs from auditory cortex. They here use 2P calcium imaging combined with an implanted prism to - for the first time - get functional optical access to these subregions (modules and matrix) in the lateral cortex of IC in vivo, in order to also characterise the functional difference in these subparts of LC. They find that both DC and LC of both awake and anaesthetised appears to be more responsive to more complex sounds (amplitude modulated noise) compared to pure tones and that under anesthesia the matrix of LC is more modulated by specific frequency and temporal content compared to the gaba'ergic modules in LC. However, while both LC and DC appears to have low frequency preferences, this preference for low frequencies is more pronounced in DC. Furthermore, in both awake and anesthetized mice somatosensory inputs are capable of driving responses on its own in the modules of LC, but very little in the matrix. The authors now compare bimodal interactions under anaesthesia and awake states and find that effects are different in some cases under awake and anesthesia - particularly related to bimodal suppression and enhancement in the modules.</p><p>The paper provides new information about how subregions with different inputs and neurochemical profiles in the higher order auditory midbrain process auditory and multisensory information, and is useful for the auditory and multisensory circuits neuroscience community.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.93063.4.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Summary:</p><p>The study describes differences in responses to sounds and whisker deflections as well as combinations of these stimuli in different neurochemically defined subsections of the lateral and dorsal cortex of the inferior colliculus in anesthetised and awake mice.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>A major achievement of the work lies in obtaining the data in the first place as this required establishing and refining a challenging surgical procedure to insert a prism that enabled the authors to visualise the lateral surface of the inferior colliculus. Using this approach, the authors were then able to provide the first functional comparison of neural responses inside and outside of the GABA-rich modules of the lateral cortex. The strongest and most interesting aspects of the results, in my opinion, concern the interactions of auditory and somatosensory stimulation. For instance, the authors find that (a) somatosensory-responses are strongest inside the modules and (b) somatosensory-auditory suppression is stronger in the matrix than in the modules. This suggests that, while somatosensory inputs preferentially target the GABA-rich modules, they do not exclusively target GABAergic neurons within the modules (given that the authors record exclusively from excitatory neurons we wouldn't expect to see somatosensory responses if they targeted exclusively GABAergic neurons) and that the GABAergic neurons of the modules (consistent with previous work) preferentially impact neurons outside the modules, i.e. via long-range connections.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.93063.4.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The lateral cortex of the inferior colliculus (LC) is a region of the auditory midbrain noted for receiving both auditory and somatosensory input. Anatomical studies have established that somatosensory input primarily impinges on &quot;modular&quot; regions of the LC, which are characterized by high densities of GABAergic neurons, while auditory input is more prominent in the &quot;matrix&quot; regions that surround the modules. However, how auditory and somatosensory stimuli shape activity, both individually and when combined, in the modular and matrix regions of the LC has remained unknown.</p><p>The major obstacle to progress has been the location of the LC on the lateral edge of the inferior colliculus where it cannot be accessed in vivo using conventional imaging approaches. The authors overcame this obstacle by developing methods to implant a microprism adjacent to the LC. By redirecting light from the lateral surface of the LC to the dorsal surface of the microprism, the microprism enabled two-photon imaging of the LC via a dorsal approach in anesthetized and awake mice. Then, by crossing GAD-67-GFP mice with Thy1-jRGECO1a mice, the authors showed that they could identify LC modules in vivo using GFP fluorescence while assessing neural responses to auditory, somatosensory, and multimodal stimuli using Ca2+ imaging. Critically, the authors also validated the accuracy of the microprism technique by directly comparing results obtained with a microprism to data collected using conventional imaging of the dorsal-most LC modules, which are directly visible on the dorsal IC surface, finding good correlations between the approaches.</p><p>Through this innovative combination of techniques, the authors found that matrix neurons were more sensitive to auditory stimuli than modular neurons, modular neurons were more sensitive to somatosensory stimuli than matrix neurons, and bimodal, auditory-somatosensory stimuli were more likely to suppress activity in matrix neurons and enhance activity in modular neurons. Interestingly, despite their higher sensitivity to somatosensory stimuli than matrix neurons, modular neurons in the anesthetized prep were overall more responsive to auditory stimuli than somatosensory stimuli (albeit with a tendency to have offset responses to sounds). This suggests that modular neurons should not be thought of as primarily representing somatosensory input, but rather as being more prone to having their auditory responses modified by somatosensory input. However, this trend was different in the awake prep, where modular neurons became more responsive to somatosensory stimuli. Thus, to this reviewer, one of the most intriguing results of the present study is the extent to which neural responses in the LC changed in the awake preparation.

Dan Llano's group have previously identified gaba'ergic patches (modules) in the LC distinctly receiving inputs from somatosensory structures, surrounded by matrix regions receiving inputs from auditory cortex. They here use 2P calcium imaging combined with an implanted prism to - for the first time - get functional optical access to these subregions (modules and matrix) in the lateral cortex of IC in vivo, in order to also characterise the functional difference in these subparts of LC. They find that both DC and LC of both awake and anaesthetised appears to be more responsive to more complex sounds (amplitude modulated noise) compared to pure tones and that under anesthesia the matrix of LC is more modulated by specific frequency and temporal content compared to the gaba'ergic modules in LC. However, while both LC and DC appears to have low frequency preferences, this preference for low frequencies is more pronounced in DC. Furthermore, in both awake and anesthetized mice somatosensory inputs are capable of driving responses on its own in the modules of LC, but very little in the matrix. The authors now compare bimodal interactions under anaesthesia and awake states and find that effects are different in some cases under awake and anesthesia - particularly related to bimodal suppression and enhancement in the modules.</p><p>The paper provides new information about how subregions with different inputs and neurochemical profiles in the higher order auditory midbrain process auditory and multisensory information, and is useful for the auditory and multisensory circuits neuroscience community.</p><p>The manuscript is improved by the response to reviewers. The authors have addressed my comments by adding new figures and panels, streamlining the analysis between awake and anaesthetised data (which has led to a more nuanced, and better supported conclusion), and adding more examples to better understand the underlying data. In streamlining the analyses between anaesthetised and awake data I would probably have opted for bringing these results into merged figures to avoid repetitiveness and aid comparison, but I acknowledge that that may be a matter of style. The added discussions of differences between awake and anaesthesia in the findings and the discussion of possible reasons why these differences are present help broaden the understanding of what the data looks like and how anaesthesia can affect these circuits.</p><p>As mentioned in my previous review, the strength of this study is in its demonstration of using prism 2p imaging to image the lateral shell of IC to gain access to its neurochemically defined subdivisions, and they use this method to provide a basic description of the auditory and multisensory properties of lateral cortex IC subdivisions (and compare it to dorsal cortex of IC). The added analysis, information and figures provide a more convincing foundation for the descriptions and conclusions stated in the paper. The description of the basic functionality of the lateral cortex of the IC are useful for researchers interested in basic multisensory interactions and auditory processing and circuits. The paper provides a technical foundation for future studies (as the authors also mention), exploring how these neurochemically defined subdivisions receiving distinct descending projections from cortex contribute to auditory and multisensory based behaviour.</p><p>Minor comment:</p><p>- The authors have now added statistics and figures to support their claims about tonotopy in DC and LC. I asked for and I think allows readers to better understand the tonotopical organisation in these areas. One of the conclusions by the authors is that the quadratic fit is a better fit that a linear fit in DCIC. Given the new plots shown and previous studies this is likely true, though it is worth highlighting that adding parameters to a fitting procedure (as in the case when moving from linear to quadratic fit) will likely lead to a better fit due to the increased flexibility of the fitting procedure.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the suggestion. We have highlighted that the quadratic function allowed the regression model to include the cells tuned to higher frequencies at the rostromedial part of the DC and result in a better fit, which is consistent with the tonotopic organization that was previously described as shown in text at (lines 208-211).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>The study describes differences in responses to sounds and whisker deflections as well as combinations of these stimuli in different neurochemically defined subsections of the lateral and dorsal cortex of the inferior colliculus in anesthetised and awake mice.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>A major achievement of the work lies in obtaining the data in the first place as this required establishing and refining a challenging surgical procedure to insert a prism that enabled the authors to visualise the lateral surface of the inferior colliculus. Using this approach, the authors were then able to provide the first functional comparison of neural responses inside and outside of the GABA-rich modules of the lateral cortex. The strongest and most interesting aspects of the results, in my opinion, concern the interactions of auditory and somatosensory stimulation. For instance, the authors find that (a) somatosensory-responses are strongest inside the modules and (b) somatosensory-auditory suppression is stronger in the matrix than in the modules. This suggests that, while somatosensory inputs preferentially target the GABA-rich modules, they do not exclusively target GABAergic neurons within the modules (given that the authors record exclusively from excitatory neurons we wouldn't expect to see somatosensory responses if they targeted exclusively GABAergic neurons) and that the GABAergic neurons of the modules (consistent with previous work) preferentially impact neurons outside the modules, i.e. via long-range connections.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>While the findings are of interest to the subfield they have only rather limited implications beyond it and the writing is not quite as precise as it could be.</p><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>The lateral cortex of the inferior colliculus (LC) is a region of the auditory midbrain noted for receiving both auditory and somatosensory input. Anatomical studies have established that somatosensory input primarily impinges on &quot;modular&quot; regions of the LC, which are characterized by high densities of GABAergic neurons, while auditory input is more prominent in the &quot;matrix&quot; regions that surround the modules. However, how auditory and somatosensory stimuli shape activity, both individually and when combined, in the modular and matrix regions of the LC has remained unknown.</p><p>The major obstacle to progress has been the location of the LC on the lateral edge of the inferior colliculus where it cannot be accessed in vivo using conventional imaging approaches. The authors overcame this obstacle by developing methods to implant a microprism adjacent to the LC. By redirecting light from the lateral surface of the LC to the dorsal surface of the microprism, the microprism enabled two-photon imaging of the LC via a dorsal approach in anesthetized and awake mice. Then, by crossing GAD-67-GFP mice with Thy1-jRGECO1a mice, the authors showed that they could identify LC modules in vivo using GFP fluorescence while assessing neural responses to auditory, somatosensory, and multimodal stimuli using Ca2+ imaging. Critically, the authors also validated the accuracy of the microprism technique by directly comparing results obtained with a microprism to data collected using conventional imaging of the dorsal-most LC modules, which are directly visible on the dorsal IC surface, finding good correlations between the approaches.</p><p>Through this innovative combination of techniques, the authors found that matrix neurons were more sensitive to auditory stimuli than modular neurons, modular neurons were more sensitive to somatosensory stimuli than matrix neurons, and bimodal, auditory-somatosensory stimuli were more likely to suppress activity in matrix neurons and enhance activity in modular neurons. Interestingly, despite their higher sensitivity to somatosensory stimuli than matrix neurons, modular neurons in the anesthetized prep were overall more responsive to auditory stimuli than somatosensory stimuli (albeit with a tendency to have offset responses to sounds). This suggests that modular neurons should not be thought of as primarily representing somatosensory input, but rather as being more prone to having their auditory responses modified by somatosensory input. However, this trend was different in the awake prep, where modular neurons became more responsive to somatosensory stimuli. Thus, to this reviewer, one of the most intriguing results of the present study is the extent to which neural responses in the LC changed in the awake preparation. While this is not entirely unexpected, the magnitude and stimulus specificity of the changes caused by anesthesia highlight the extent to which higher-level sensory processing is affected by anesthesia and strongly suggests that future studies of LC function should be conducted in awake animals.</p><p>Together, the results of this study expand our understanding of the functional roles of matrix and module neurons by showing that responses in LC subregions are more complicated than might have been expected based on anatomy alone. The development of the microprism technique for imaging the LC will be a boon to the field, finally enabling much-needed studies of LC function in vivo. The experiments were well-designed and well-controlled, the limitations of two-photon imaging for tracking neural activity are acknowledged, and appropriate statistical tests were used.</p><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>- Increase font size of scale bars on figure 6.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the suggestion.
