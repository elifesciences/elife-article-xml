However, the function of Hippo in pancreatic endocrine development remains obscure. Here, we generated novel conditional genetically engineered mouse models to examine the roles of Hippo pathway-mediated YAP1/TAZ inhibition in the development stages of endocrine specification and differentiation. While YAP1 protein was localized to the nuclei in bipotent progenitor cells, Neurogenin 3 expressing endocrine progenitors completely lost YAP1 expression. Using genetically engineered mouse models, we found that inactivation of YAP1 requires both an intact Hippo pathway and Neurogenin 3 protein. Gene deletion of Lats1 and 2 kinases (<italic>Lats1&amp;2</italic>) in endocrine progenitor cells of developing mouse pancreas using <italic>Neurog3<sup>Cre</sup></italic> blocked endocrine progenitor cell differentiation and specification, resulting in reduced islets size and a disorganized pancreas at birth. Loss of <italic>Lats1&amp;2</italic> in Neurogenin 3 expressing cells activated YAP1/TAZ transcriptional activity and recruited macrophages to the developing pancreas. These defects were rescued by deletion of <italic>Yap1/Wwtr1</italic> genes, suggesting that tight regulation of YAP1/TAZ by Hippo signaling is crucial for pancreatic endocrine specification. In contrast, deletion of <italic>Lats1&amp;2</italic> using β-cell-specific Ins1<italic><sup>CreER</sup></italic> resulted in a phenotypically normal pancreas, indicating that <italic>Lats1&amp;2</italic> are indispensable for differentiation of endocrine progenitors but not for that of β-cells. Our results demonstrate that loss of YAP1/TAZ expression in the pancreatic endocrine compartment is not a passive consequence of endocrine specification. Rather, Hippo pathway-mediated inhibition of YAP1/TAZ in endocrine progenitors is a prerequisite for endocrine specification and differentiation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Hippo signaling</kwd><kwd>pancreas</kwd><kwd>endocrine progenitors</kwd><kwd>specification</kwd><kwd>differentiation</kwd><kwd>development</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004917</institution-id><institution>Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R1219</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Pei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000062</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01DK110361</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Pei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004917</institution-id><institution>Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RP170345</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nipper</surname><given-names>Michael H</given-names></name><name><surname>Yin</surname><given-names>Xue</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute of the United States</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ZIA BC011798</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Arda</surname><given-names>H Efsun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>William and Ella Owens Medical Research Foundation, and National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R21 CA218968</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Pei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>William and Ella Owens Medical Research Foundation, and National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 CA237159</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Pei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004917</institution-id><institution>CPRIT Research Training</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RP140105</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Jun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Loss of YAP1/TAZ expression in the pancreatic endocrine compartment is not a passive consequence of endocrine specification, rather, Hippo pathway-mediated inhibition of YAP1/TAZ in endocrine progenitors is a prerequisite for endocrine specification and differentiation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The mammalian pancreas is composed of exocrine and endocrine compartments, which both originate from embryonic endoderm. The exocrine pancreas is mainly comprised of acinar cells, which secrete various digestive enzymes, and ductal cells which transport these enzymes to the duodenum. The endocrine pancreas, which consists of α-, β-, δ-, PP-, and ɛ-cells, produces several hormones that are secreted into the blood with organism-wide functions. Of these functions, regulation of glucose homeostasis is predominately associated with pancreatic endocrine function. Developmental defects in the pancreas lead to devastating pathological diseases including congenital pancreas abnormalities, congenital hyperinsulinism, and neonatal diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Lu and Li, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Kamisawa et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Pohl and Uc, 2015</xref>).</p><p>Initially discovered in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, the Hippo signaling pathway is best known for its roles in regulating organ size via suppressing growth and promoting apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Pan, 2010</xref>). In mammals, this pathway has more complicated, context-dependent functions with regard to regulating tissue homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Yu et al., 2015</xref>). The mammalian Hippo pathway is comprised of a kinase signaling cascade beginning with the Ste-20-like protein kinases (MST1&amp;2), which directly phosphorylate and activate Large tumor suppressors 1&amp;2 (LATS1&amp;2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Yu et al., 2015</xref>). Upon activation, LATS1&amp;2, the final kinases in this cascade, directly phosphorylate the effectors of the Hippo pathway – the transcription coactivators Yes-Associated Protein 1 (YAP1) and WW-domain-containing transcription regulator 1 (WWTR1, also known as TAZ). The phosphorylation of YAP1 and TAZ leads to their cytosolic sequestration and/or proteasome-mediated degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Meng et al., 2015</xref>). In contrast, the inhibition of Hippo pathway stabilizes YAP1 and TAZ, enabling their cytosol-to-nucleus translocation, resulting in their association with specific transcription factors (e.g., TEAD) and initiation of related transcriptional programing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Yu et al., 2015</xref>). Prior studies have shown that compared with inactivation of upstream components of the Hippo pathway such as <italic>Mst1&amp;2</italic>, specific genetic inactivation of <italic>Lats1&amp;2</italic> more robustly facilitates YAP1 and TAZ transcriptional activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Meng et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>The Hippo signaling pathway has been shown to play a crucial role in pancreatic development, both in lineage specification and morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Wu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Panciera et al., 2016</xref>). During early-stage pancreatic development, deletion of <italic>Mst1/2</italic> in pancreatic progenitor cells results in dysregulation of acinar expansion. De-differentiation of acinar cells into ductal-like cells (also known as acinar-to-ductal metaplasia, or ADM), immune cell infiltration, and pancreatic auto-digestion have also been observed following <italic>Mst1/2</italic> deletion. However, the overall function of the islets is not affected by the loss of <italic>Mst1/2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Gao et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">George et al., 2012</xref>). <italic>Lats1&amp;2</italic> also serve vital functions in early pancreatic development before the secondary transition when endocrine differentiation reaches its peak (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Braitsch et al., 2019</xref>). Endocrine specification is driven by the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor Neurogenin 3 (Neurog3) in bipotent pancreatic progenitors at secondary transition stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gradwohl et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">McGrath et al., 2015</xref>). The <italic>Neurog3</italic> gene is a master regulator of pancreatic islet differentiation and initiates stepwise cell fate determination, delamination, and migration of differentiating endocrine cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Wang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gouzi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Rukstalis and Habener, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Duvall et al., 2022</xref>). In vitro culture experiments found that Neurog3 directly represses the transcription of the <italic>Yap1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">George et al., 2015</xref>). These observations lead to the notion that Hippo pathway-mediated YAP1 protein inhibition in Neurog3-positive endocrine progenitors is dispensable for the subsequent endocrine differentiation process, but this has not been examined with in vivo developmental models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Wu et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Here, we investigated the function of Hippo in endocrine cell development and homeostasis by inactivating <italic>Lats1&amp;2</italic> in Neurog3+ endocrine progenitor cells and β-cells. We found that Hippo activity in Neurog3+ cells is required for mouse endocrine progenitor specification and differentiation but is not necessary for pancreatic β-cell function. By further introducing <italic>Yap1/Wwtr1</italic> deletion into <italic>Lats1&amp;2</italic> null cells, we demonstrated that attenuation of YAP1/TAZ through genetic ablation rescued the observed phenotypes driven by <italic>Lats1&amp;2</italic> inactivation. Our results uncovered a context-dependent function of the Hippo signaling pathway in maintaining normal development and tissue homeostasis in the pancreas.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Inactivation of <italic>Lats1&amp;2</italic> in Neurog3+ cells led to defects in mouse postnatal growth, acinar atrophy, and ductal expansion in the pancreas</title><p>To determine the roles of <italic>Lats1</italic> and <italic>Lats2</italic> in endocrine progenitor cells and pancreas development, both genes were inactivated in the <italic>Neurog3<sup>Cre</sup></italic> transgenic mouse strain. For tracing of Cre-recombinase activity, we also crossed the <italic>Rosa26<sup>LSL-YFP</sup></italic> line. The heterozygote mice (<italic>Neurog3<sup>Cre</sup>Lats1<sup>fl/+</sup>Lats2<sup>fl/+</sup>Rosa26<sup>LSL-YFP</sup></italic>) and single knockout mice (<italic>Neurog3<sup>Cre</sup>Lats1<sup>fl/fl</sup>Lats2<sup>fl/+</sup>Rosa26<sup>LSL-YFP</sup></italic> or <italic>Neurog3<sup>Cre</sup>Lats1<sup>fl/+</sup>Lats2<sup>fl/fl</sup>Rosa26<sup>LSL-YFP</sup></italic>) from the initial F1 and F2 generations showed no abnormal phenotype. We, therefore, bred the single knockout mice with the <italic>Lats1&amp;2</italic> conditional allele line to get the <italic>Neurog3<sup>Cre</sup>Lats1<sup>fl/fl</sup>Lats2<sup>fl/fl</sup>Rosa26<sup>LSL-YFP</sup></italic> mice (abbreviated as NL mice). The <italic>Lats1</italic> single knockout littermates were used as control (Ctrl) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). NL mice were born in Mendelian ratios with no obvious differences from the littermate control. However, starting from 1 week of age, it became obvious that the NL mice were smaller in size than the control mice. By the time of postnatal day 19 (P19), the NL mice appeared smaller and weaker than their littermates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>), with a much smaller pancreas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>), and suffered from hypoglycemia. The majority of NL mice died before 3 weeks of age, exhibiting rear limb weakness or paralysis. Feeding the mice with 10% glucose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Xiao et al., 2010</xref>) or keeping them with their parents delayed, but did not prevent their death (data not shown), indicating that hypoglycemia only partially accounted for the early death. A few mice survived beyond 3 weeks with much smaller body sizes and infertility. These growth-related phenotypes could be attributed to the expression of <italic>Neurog3<sup>Cre</sup></italic> in the central nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Song et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Histological analysis with Hematoxylin and eosin stain (H&amp;E) staining showed that the acinar cells, ductal system, and islets could be clearly identified in control pancreases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), whereas remarkably disorganized structures were seen in the center of the NL pancreases including noticeable expansion of ductal cells and fewer acinar cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Immunohistochemical staining of Insulin (INS) revealed much smaller islets in NL pancreases in addition to structural disorganization, evident by immunofluorescent co-staining of Insulin and Glucagon (GCG) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). We further analyzed the mRNA expression level of lineage-specific genes in the P1 pancreas using quantitative RT-PCR (qPCR). We found that the mRNA expression of acinar-specific markers, <italic>Ptf1a</italic>, Amylase (<italic>Amy</italic>), and carboxypeptidase A1 (<italic>Cpa1</italic>), as well as endocrine-specific markers, Chromogranin A (<italic>ChrA</italic>), Insulin 1 (<italic>Ins1</italic>), and Insulin 2 (<italic>Ins2</italic>) were significantly lower in NL mice when compared with control mice (Ctrl, <italic>n</italic> = 4; NL, <italic>n</italic> = 4) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). In comparison, while the mRNA expression of two ductal-specific markers, <italic>Hnf1b</italic> and <italic>Sox9</italic>, had no significant change, <italic>Krt19</italic> was significantly higher in NL pancreases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). To pinpoint the starting time of the observed defect in NL mice, we examined the E15.5 pancreas, when expression of <italic>Neurog3</italic> reaches its peak. We did not observe any obvious differences between NL and control pancreases at E15.5 by H&amp;E staining. The expansion of central ductal structure was noted in the NL pancreas at E16.5 which became even more obvious at P1 from H&amp;E staining and KRT19 immunohistochemistry staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).

However, as described before, apparent defects in pancreatic morphology were not observed through H&amp;E staining until E16.5. Therefore, subsequent analysis was focused on the E16.5 pancreas. We monitored Cre-recombinase activity with <italic>Rosa26<sup>LSL-YFP</sup></italic> allele. Yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) expression was used as an indicator for <italic>Lats1&amp;2</italic> deletion as no viable antibodies were available for staining of LATS1&amp;2. We also performed immunofluorescent staining of pancreatic and duodenal homeobox 1 (PDX1), an early pancreatic progenitor marker and β-cell-specific transcriptional factor. YFP+ cells formed cell clusters and were co-stained with PDX1 in control pancreases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). In contrast, in NL pancreases, the majority of YFP+ cells did not form clusters, but instead formed a distinct layer next to ductal cells. In addition, there were also much fewer PDX1 and YFP double-positive cells in NL pancreases, as compared with the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), suggesting that most endocrine progenitors in the NL pancreas do not develop into β-cells at E16.5. Presence of a few double-positive cells in NL pancreases could be due to incomplete deletion of genes. At birth, control pancreases showed co-staining of YFP and PDX1 double-positive cells in the center region of islets and YFP single-positive cells in the periphery region of islets, which is consistent with the normal structure of islet of Langerhans where β-cells localize to the center of islets while α-cells localize to the periphery. In contrast, NL pancreases had much fewer PDX1-positive cells which were found in small unorganized cell clusters, while the majority of YFP+ cells did not express PDX1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). To further delineate the defect of <italic>Lats1/2</italic> null endocrine progenitor cells, we performed immunostaining on the transcription factors Islet 1 (ISL1) and NK2 homeobox 2 (NKX2.2), which are expressed after Neurog3 in endocrine pancreas development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arda et al., 2013</xref>). We found that ISL1 was widely expressed in YFP+ cells in control pancreases, but only expressed in a few small YFP+ cell clusters in NL pancreases, in which the majority of YFP+ cells did not express ISL1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). A similar expression pattern was also observed for NKX2.2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).

The new model proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Sharon et al., 2019</xref> suggests that differentiating endocrine precursor cells undergo ‘leaving the cord’ or ‘delamination’ process with lower E-cadherin (CDH1) expression. How Neurog3 mediates CDH1 downregulation and facilitates ‘leaving the cord’ is unclear. We observed that YFP+ cells were connected to epithelial cords but expressed lower CDH1 than the cord epithelial cells in control E16.5 pancreases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). YFP+ cells in the NL pancreas were connected to the epithelial cords and formed buds or sheaths similar to YFP+ cells in the control. However, they express CDH1 at a level as high as of that in the epithelial cord (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). With respect to the few escapees as previously described in PDX1 expression, the NL pancreas, too, contained a few escapees marked by lower CDH1 expression. Interestingly, we found that the YFP+ cells in NL pancreases did not stay as ‘budding’ or ‘sheath’ as development continued, and returned to single epithelial cells at P1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).

To expand on this, we interrogated the question of whether these progenitor cells returned to the ductal cell fate. To do so, we performed immunofluorescent staining and found that, similarly to the control pancreas, there was no overlap of YFP and SOX9 expression in the NL pancreas at E16.5 or P1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). In addition, we examined another known ductal cell marker, cytokeratin 19 (KRT19) in the NL pancreas. We observed that KRT19 was not present in YFP+ cells in control pancreases but was highly expressed in YFP+ cells of NL pancreases at E16.5 and P1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). In fact, at E16.5, the expression of KRT19 in YFP+ cells of NL pancreases was even higher than the ductal cells, which later became similar to ductal cells at the P1 stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). These data suggest that an early effect of <italic>Lats1&amp;2</italic> deletion in Neurog3+ cells is to activate KRT19 expression, but not SOX9 expression, further indicating that KRT19 expression is not controlled by SOX9, but instead by YAP1.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title><italic>Lats1&amp;2</italic> null cells recruit macrophages and induce pancreatitis-like phenotype in the developing pancreas</title><p>Following gene knockouts of <italic>Lats1&amp;2</italic>, we observed that NL mice died before 3 weeks of age with a much smaller pancreas.

We wondered whether a similar mechanism happened in the NL pancreas. Immunostaining showed that there was a significant increase of Vimentin-positive mesenchymal cells in the NL pancreas at E16.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Those expanded mesenchymal cells were closely associated with YFP+ <italic>Lats1&amp;2</italic> null cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). These mesenchymal cells were positive for activated PSC marker alpha smooth muscle actin (ACTA2) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Next, we determined whether there was immune cell infiltration in the NL pancreas. We observed CD45+ immune cells with large cell bodies, similar to the size of epithelial cells, in the E16.5 pancreas. We then stained tissue with macrophage marker F4/80 and found that these CD45+ cells were macrophages. The number of macrophages was increased in NL mice at E16.5, especially in the ductal area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B, D</xref>), and further dramatically increased at P1 in the whole pancreas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C, D</xref>).

We observed a similar YAP1 staining pattern in P1 pancreases of NL mice.

To study the dynamic processes of cellular development and differentiation, we performed single-cell trajectory analysis. Because the gene expression data suggested that Ductal 2 population has progenitor cell signature in developing pancreas, we set Ductal 2 population as root and traced the possible differentiation path of ductal cells into acinar, α- and β-cells using pseudotime analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6M</xref>). The Ductal 2 path split into endocrine lineage and into Ductal 4, a population specific to NL pancreas. By checking cell cycle status, NL pancreas generally has more cells in S and G2M phases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1H</xref>). Specifically, Acinar 1, the major population in control pancreas, has fewer cells in S/G2M than Acinar 2 and 3, the major ones in NL pancreas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6N</xref>). It was also shown that a large number of proliferating ductal cells were present in NL pancreas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6N</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1H</xref>). Altogether our data suggest that Lats1&amp;2 deletion results in high YAP1 and TAZ which block further differentiation of ductal lineage, resulting in fewer endocrine cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>YAP1/TAZ are downstream effectors of <italic>Lats1&amp;2</italic> in regulating endocrine specification and differentiation</title><p>To further demonstrate that YAP1 and TAZ are the downstream effectors of <italic>Lats1&amp;2</italic> in endocrine lineage development, we performed gene knockouts of <italic>Yap1</italic> and <italic>Wwtr1</italic> in addition to <italic>Lats1&amp;2</italic> in Neurog3+ endocrine progenitor cells.

First, we found that NTY mice were normal with no defect in the pancreas, suggesting that YAP1/TAZ are no longer needed in <italic>Neurog3</italic>-expressing cells for endocrine lineage development. Because NL mice showed an obvious defect in the postnatal P1 pancreas, we focused on and analyzed the P1 pancreases of NLT and NLTY mice. Histological analysis showed that, unlike NL pancreases, NLTY pancreases were similar to the control pancreas. However, NLT pancreases still showed some abnormality in the ductal network region, suggesting incomplete rescue when YAP1 expression remained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A</xref>). We further analyzed endocrine cells by staining YFP, INS, and Somatostatin (SST), and observed that only a small fraction of YFP+ cells, scattered throughout the NL pancreas, were INS- and SST-positive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B</xref>).

However, we still observed some ductal-like YFP+ cells in NLT pancreases, suggesting incomplete rescue compared to NLTY pancreases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>).

Multiple Hippo pathway genes have been investigated through specific deletion at embryonic and adult stages using different pancreatic-specific Cre lines in genetically engineered mice models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Gao et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">George et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Braitsch et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Liu et al., 2019</xref>). With the early embryonic deletion of <italic>Lats1&amp;2</italic> using <italic>Pdx1</italic>-early Cre, the developing pancreas loses cell polarity and subsequent undergoes failure of epithelial expansion/branching, indicating that early pancreatic morphogenesis requires a properly functioning Hippo signaling pathway. However, the exact role of the Hippo signaling pathway in endocrine lineage specification has been unclear. Using mice with <italic>Neurog3</italic>-driven Cre, we have revealed that the tight regulation of the Hippo pathway is required for endocrine specification and differentiation. Loss of <italic>Lats1&amp;2</italic> in endocrine progenitor cells blocks their further differentiation, resulting in much smaller pancreatic islets and fewer hormone-producing cells. Further deletion of <italic>Yap1/Wwtr1</italic> rescues the observed endocrine defects in the <italic>Lats1&amp;2</italic> null pancreas, suggesting that YAP1/TAZ transcriptional activities must be tightly controlled by LATS1&amp;2 for endocrine lineage development. Our findings, therefore, expand our understanding of the physiological functions of the Hippo pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>).</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>During endocrine progenitor specification, the Hippo pathway is required to sequester YAP1 protein in the cytosol and allow Neurog3 protein to positively regulate its own expression and suppress Sox9 and Yap1 expression.</title><p>Loss of Lats1&amp;2 leads to YAP1 activation which suppresses Neurog3 expression and induces the expression of YAP1 targets.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-84532-fig9-v2.tif"/></fig><p>In line with our histology analysis, we found differences in acinar cells between the control and NL pancreas from our snRNA-seq analysis. Compared to control acinar cells which express high levels of digestive enzyme encoding genes, the most abundant acinar population in the NL pancreas has more cells in a proliferation state. These data suggest that developing acinar cells are responsive to signals from immune and fibroblast cells in their microenvironment. In line with our observation of an increased number of ductal cells in the NL pancreas, snRNA-seq also revealed a significantly larger number of ductal cells, including endocrine progenitors, suggesting that the loss of Hippo signaling control leads to the expansion of both populations. However, it is unclear whether YAP1/TAZ activation is required for the expansion of both populations during pancreas development. High level of YAP1/TAZ in endocrine progenitor cells impedes their further differentiation into mature endocrine cells, resulting in a new population.</p><p>Accumulating evidence has shown that Hippo plays dominant roles in the developing exocrine pancreas, but not in the developing endocrine pancreas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Gao et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">George et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Duvall et al., 2022</xref>). First, deleting <italic>Mst1&amp;2</italic> with an inducible acinar cell-specific Cre or overexpressing YAP1 in the pancreas reproduced the <italic>Mst1&amp;2</italic> whole pancreas epithelial knockout phenotype – acinar atrophy, ductal expansion, and pancreatitis-like phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Gao et al., 2013</xref>). In addition, YAP1/TAZ were undetectable in both embryonic endocrine cells and adult endocrine cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">George et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Duvall et al., 2022</xref>). Overexpression of <italic>Neurog3</italic> silenced <italic>Yap1/Wwtr1</italic> at the transcriptional level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Duvall et al., 2022</xref>). Consistent with these findings, we also found that embryonic Neurog3+ cells are negative for YAP1. However, newly formed Neurog3+ cells still exhibit YAP1 expression, but mainly in the cytosol, suggesting that YAP1 is controlled at the post-translational level, most likely by LATS1&amp;2 the canonical Hippo pathway. Our data showed that Neurog3 alone is not sufficient to shut off YAP1 expression. It requires active LATS1&amp;2 to facilitate YAP1/TAZ sequestration outside of cell nuclei. Deletion of <italic>Lats1&amp;2</italic> in Neurog3-expressing cells disrupts ability of Neurog3 to suppress <italic>Yap1</italic>/<italic>Wwtr1</italic> expression. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Schreiber et al., 2021</xref> have mapped Neurog3 genome occupancy in the human pancreatic endocrine cells and found TEAD expression decreased when NEUROG3 was present. This suggests that YAP1 may regulate its own expression. Further investigation of YAP1 autoregulation and how Neurog3 shuts down YAP1 expression during endocrine differentiation is warranted.</p><p>During endocrine pancreas formation, <italic>Neurog3</italic> has to achieve high expression levels for endocrine commitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Wang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Magenheim et al., 2011</xref>). High <italic>Neurog3</italic> initiates a stepwise differentiation process including EMT and delamination of differentiating endocrine cells. The new inclusive model proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Sharon et al., 2019</xref>, using single-cell sequencing and immunostaining, suggests that islets form in a budding process. Endocrine progenitor cells with a sufficiently high level of Neurog3 expression may leave the epithelial cord, but remain attached to the cord. Sharon et al. suggested that differentiating endocrine precursors do not undergo EMT, but still express E-cadherin (CDH1) throughout the differentiation process. However, they observed downregulation of CDH1 expression during endocrine lineage formation, as previously found (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gouzi et al., 2011</xref>). ‘Leaving the cord’ or ‘delamination’ has been suggested to follow <italic>Neurog3</italic> expression. How Neurog3 mediates CDH1 downregulation and facilitates this process is unclear. We had similar observations in that Neurog3-expressing YFP+ cells were connected to epithelial cords but with lower CDH1 staining in control E16.5 pancreas. However, YFP+ cells in the NL pancreas were connected to the cords and formed buds or sheaths, similar to the control YFP cells, but their CDH1 expression level was as highly as in the epithelial cord. Our findings suggest that high YAP1 activity maintains high CDH1 expression, irrespective of <italic>Neurog3</italic> expression. TEAD1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Cebola et al., 2015</xref>) and YAP1 have been found to bind to the <italic>CDH1</italic> promoter region, suggesting that YAP1 may maintain CDH1 expression. However, it is unclear whether loss of YAP1 expression is sufficient to downregulate CDH1 expression in the endocrine lineage. Nevertheless, our findings suggest that an active Hippo pathway is required for the downregulation of CDH1 in <italic>Neurog3</italic>-expressing endocrine progenitor cells.</p><p>Notch and Hippo signaling pathways are tightly regulated to govern endocrine lineage determination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Magenheim et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Cebola et al., 2015</xref>). High Notch signaling without Hippo generates high HES1 and YAP1, which cooperate to suppress <italic>Neurog3</italic> expression, leading to ductal cell fate. Low Notch signaling with Hippo activity results in <italic>Neurog3</italic> expression mediated by SOX9. The role of SOX9 in endocrine lineage differentiation is complex. SOX9 expresses in the Notch-responsive bipotent progenitors and committed ductal cells. It is suppressed by Neurog3 in committed endocrine progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Mamidi et al., 2018</xref>). We found that newly born Neurog3+ cells sequestered YAP1 out of nuclei by the Hippo pathway. When Neurog3+ cells grow out of the epithelial cord, YAP1 expression is completely turned off. Loss of <italic>Lats1&amp;2</italic> results in high YAP1 in the nuclei of newborn Neurog3+ cells, which blocks Neurog3’s ability to turn on endocrine lineage gene expression. Mamidi et al. have shown that overexpression of YAP1 in progenitor cells can expand the ductal compartment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Magenheim et al., 2011</xref>). In this setting, <italic>Neurog3</italic> has not been turned on and SOX9 is high, implying that ductal expansion is probably mediated by both SOX9 and YAP1. In our NL mice, <italic>Neurog3</italic> and Cre-recombinase expression are induced simultaneously. Subsequently, <italic>Lats1&amp;2</italic> are deleted and result in YAP1 activation. In these mutant cells, Neurog3 has already turned off SOX9 expression. However, the ductal marker KRT19 is as high as in the ductal cells, suggesting that KRT19 is most likely regulated by YAP1, not by SOX9. Interestingly, a TEAD1- (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Yang et al., 2020</xref>) and YAP1- (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Nipper et al., 2024</xref>) binding peak was found in <italic>KRT19</italic> gene promotor region. Although the mutant cells have high CDH1 and KRT19 expression, and low SOX9 expression, they still leave the epithelial cord and form the sheath, suggesting that ‘leaving the cord’ is mediated by Neurog3. However, high YAP1 activity in the mutant cells does not support <italic>Neurog3</italic> expression, resulting in no continuous growth of the sheath. Rather, the bulged-out cells return to the epithelial cord. Interestingly, SOX9 expression remains low in these mutant cells, even if they return to simple epithelial cells.</p><p>Using human embryonic stem cells, Rosado-Olivieri et al. have showed that overexpression of constitutively active <italic>YAP1</italic> impairs endocrine differentiation while inhibition of <italic>YAP1</italic> can generate improved insulin-secreting cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Shih et al., 2012</xref>). This is consistent with our in vivo findings. Interestingly, others have found that overexpression of an active form of YAP1 greatly induces β-cell proliferation in adult human islets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Duvall et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Seymour et al., 2007</xref>). Our genetic models indicate that in adult β-cells, <italic>Yap1</italic> gene has been silenced at the transcriptional level. Loss of <italic>Lats1&amp;2</italic> has no effect on β-cell function. Direct increase of YAP1 expression may be required for expansion of β-cells in the adult pancreas. Thus, manipulating YAP1 level to increase β-cell number depends on cell types and developmental stage.</p><p>By acinar cell-specific deletion of <italic>Lats1&amp;2</italic>, we showed that PSC activation precedes macrophage activation and infiltration, resulting in extensive fibrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Liu et al., 2019</xref>). In our NL pancreas, some PSC activation is visible, but macrophage infiltration is very distinct even at E16.5 and becomes more conspicuous at P1. Braitsch et al.’s study in which they deleted <italic>Lats1&amp;2</italic> in the very early stage of pancreas development also had similar observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Braitsch et al., 2019</xref>), that is the CD45+ cells surrounded the E11.5 mutant pancreas and infiltrated the E14.5 mutant pancreas. Our snRNA-seq analysis showed that the new ductal population in NL pancreas express high level of Csf1, which may lead to recruit macrophages. The tissue-resident macrophages have been suggested to seed the tissue during embryonic development from the blood island of yolk sac and fetal hematopoietic cells in the liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Nipper et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Rosado-Olivieri et al., 2019</xref>). Given the well-known role of Hippo pathway in organ size regulation, it is possible that the abundance of tissue-resident macrophage, including microglia, which are derived from yolk sac myeloid progenitors, is linked to organ size and function. Conceivably, the Hippo pathway may influence their migration and proliferation during organ development. This warrants further investigation.</p><p>In conclusion, our study suggests that proper Hippo activity is required for the <italic>Neurog3</italic>-driven differentiation program, further expanding our fundamental understanding of Hippo pathway participation in pancreatic endocrine development.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Generation of conditional knockout mice</title><p>All animal study protocols were approved by the UT Health San Antonio Animal Care and Use Committee. <italic>Neurog3<sup>Cre</sup></italic> mice (stock number: 005667), <italic>MIP<sup>CreER</sup></italic> (stock number: 024709), and <italic>Rosa26<sup>LSL-YFP</sup></italic> mice (stock number: 006148) were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory. <italic>Neurog3<sup>Cre</sup></italic> mice were kindly provided by Dr. Andrew Leiter and Dr. Seung Kim. <italic>Lats1<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> and <italic>Lats2<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice were kindly provided by Dr. Randy L.

First, immunofluorescent staining of DAPI and F4/80 macrophage marker was performed on each pancreas section. Four randomly chosen, representative areas of each mouse pancreas were captured at ×20 objective magnification. Each fluorescent channel of the chosen areas was saved as separate images. Each of these separate channel images were then overlayed using the Image Calculator Tool in Fiji in order to visualize DAPI and F4/80 signal, together. Once combined, using the Channels Tool, each channel can be overlayed or removed as desired. The number of pixels per micrometer was calculated and defined using the Straight Line Tool and Measure Tool in Fiji. This allows for the total area of any given selection to be measured in micrometers squared. Using the DAPI image channel and Threshold tool, a threshold limit was set to 15 for the minimum and 255 for the maximum, and total DAPI-positive area (in micrometers squared) within this threshold parameter was calculated for each embryonic pancreas region. Then, each F4/80+ DAPI+ cell was hand counted within each respective region using the Multi-point tool in Fiji. Finally, the total number of counted F4/80+ macrophage cells was divided by the measured DAPI+ area. This yields the calculated macrophage density of total number of F4/80+ macrophage per micrometer squared in regions of the pancreas. For quantification of total macrophage density per image, the calculated density of each acinar- and ductal-cell region per image were averaged together. All images were captured using Microsystems DMI6000 B microscope and software (Leica Microsystems, Buffalo Grove, IL).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>All quantification results in this study except bioinformatic analysis described below were presented as the mean ± standard error of the mean.

Sample size was not calculated before the experiment. The sample size was determined based on the availability of generated conditional knockout mice to provide at least three biological replicates for a sufficient statistical power.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Single-nucleus RNA-seq sample preparation</title><p>Mouse E17.5 pancreas was flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and minced to smaller chunks on ice with sterile micro-dissection scissors. The finely minced tissues were transferred to a pre-chilled 2 ml Dounce homogenizer containing 2 ml cold 1× Homogenization Buffer (HB) which contained 0.26 M sucrose, 0.03 M KCl, 0.01 M Mg<sub>2</sub>Cl, 0.02 M Tricine–KOH pH 7.8, and Ultra-Pure Water (Thermo Fisher), with the following added on the day of tissue processing – 1 mM Dithiothreitol (DTT), 0.5 mM Spermidine (Sigma-Aldrich), 0.15 mM Spermine (Sigma-Aldrich), 0.3% NP40, 1× Roche Complete Protease Inhibitor Cocktail, 1 U/μl RNase Inhibitor (Fisher Scientific). The tissue was homogenized on ice by moving a ‘loose’ pestle up and down 10–15 times to disrupt tissue structure, followed with a ‘tight’ pestle to achieve a final homogenate. This homogenate was then strained through a 70-μm Flowmi strainer into a 2-ml DNA/RNA LoBind tube and centrifuged at 4°C at 350 rcf for 5 min. After the centrifugation, the supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was washed with 1 ml cold PBS, passed through a 40-μm Flowmi strainer, and centrifuged again. For density gradient separation, the isolated nuclei were resuspended in 400 μl of 1× HB and combined with an equal volume of 50% chilled Iodixanol solution. Subsequent layers of 30% and 40% Iodixanol solutions, diluted in 1× HB, were gently layered under the initial mixture to create a gradient. In the final step, the tube with the nuclei was centrifuged using a pre-cooled bucket-rotor centrifuge at 3000 rcf for 20 min at 4°C. After centrifugation, the top layer was carefully removed, without disrupting the ‘fuzzy’ white ring of nuclei. A narrow-bore pipette tip was used to collect no more than 200 μl of the nuclei, which were then mixed with an equal volume of 1× HB. Nuclei concentration was determined using a Countess II FL automated cell counter (Thermo Fisher Scientific), adjusting to a final concentration optimal for 10x Genomics Chromium library preparation.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Single-nucleus RNA-seq data analysis</title><p>Base calling was performed using RTA 3.4.4, demultiplexing was performed using cellranger-arc v2.0.1 (Bcl2fastq 2.20.0), and alignment was performed using cellranger-arc v2.0.1 (BWA 0.7.17-r1188). Sequenced reads were aligned to a 10x Genomics provided mouse reference sequence (refdata-cellranger-arc-mm10-2020-A-2.0.0). The subsequent analysis was performed using Seurat v.5.0.1 in R software v.4.2.0. A quality control step was performed in merged control and mutant samples to remove low-quality cells, including possible cell debris (nFeature &lt;200), cell doublets (nFeature &gt;10,000), and cells with excessive cellular stress (&gt;5% mitochondrial gene expression). The merged/filtered Seurat object was then subjected to a series of standard Seurat commands including ‘NormalizeData’, ‘FindVariableFeatures’, ‘ScaleData’, ‘RunPCA’, ‘FindNeighbors’, ‘FindClusters’, and ‘RunUMAP’, with 20 PCA dimensions (determined by elbow plot with ndims = 50) and a resolution of 0.2, in order to identify different cell populations present in the dataset. ‘FindAllMarkers’ function was performed to identify marker gene expression in each cell population identified in the previous step (only.pos = TRUE, min.pct = 0.25, logfc.threshold = 0.25). Each cell population was then assigned to a specific cell type by manually reviewing their corresponding marker gene expression with prior knowledge. Individual gene expression was visualized using ‘VlnPlot’, ‘FeaturePlot’, and ‘DotPlot’ functions in Seurat with default setting. The cell cycle status of the cells was determined using ‘CellCycleScoring’ command in Seurat with default setting. To analyze each individual cell type, the merged Seurat object was subset to smaller objects only containing cells with specific cell identities. The subset Seurat objects were then subject to similar analysis for re-clustering (including ‘FindVariableFeatures’, ‘ScaleData’, ‘RunPCA’, ‘FindNeighbors’, ‘FindClusters’, and ‘RunUMAP’) followed by further analysis. GSEA as well as individual plotting was performed using ClusterProfiler v4.4.4 in R software. In order to compensate the significant difference in reading depth between Myofibroblast 1 and 2 clusters, fold change of gene expression was calculated using the averaged gene expression of all the cells in each cluster, instead of the raw read counts. In addition, only genes with &gt;25% expression in each cluster were included in the GSEA analysis. A significant enrichment was considered with multiple-test adjusted p-value &lt;0.05.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Differential expression analysis</title><p>To identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) among the four Ductal sub-clusters, ‘FindMarkers’ Seurat function was performed to compare each pair of the four sub-clusters. The resulting genes were filtered to identify DEGs defined as log2 fold change &gt;1.5 or &lt;−1.5, and adjusted p &lt; 0.01. A pseudobulk sequencing dataset for each Ductal sub-cluster was created by manually aggregating the gene read counts of all cells in each cluster. The pseudobulk dataset was then passed to DESeq2 v.1.36.0 and ComplexHeatmap v.2.13.2, to perform <italic>K</italic>-means clustering in order to identify expression patterns of the DEGs across the four Ductal sub-clusters. After identification of <italic>K</italic>-means clustering, the information was passed back into Seurat to plot gene expression heatmap at single-cell level. Overrepresentation analysis for lists of genes was performed using the clusterProfiler v.4.4.4 package in R with default settings. A significant enrichment was considered with multiple-test adjusted p-value &lt;0.05.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Single-cell trajectory analysis</title><p>Single-cell trajectory analysis was performed using Monocle3 v.1.3.4 in R software with default setting.

pancreatic endocrine specification and differentiation. The authors demonstrate that the deletion of the Lats1 and 2 kinases (Lats1&amp;2) in endocrine progenitor cells of developing mouse pancreas with Ngn3-Cre blocked endocrine progenitor cell differentiation and specification, resulting in reduced islets size and disorganized pancreas at birth, but no effects were observed when deleting them in β cells. These results show for the first time that Hippo pathway-mediated YAP1/TAZ inhibition in endocrine progenitors is a prerequisite for endocrine specification and differentiation.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.84532.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Rovira</surname><given-names>Meritxell</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/021018s57</institution-id><institution>University of Barcelona</institution></institution-wrap><country>Spain</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>In the interests of transparency, eLife publishes the most substantive revision requests and the accompanying author responses.</p></boxed-text><p>[Editors' note: this paper was reviewed by <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.reviewcommons.org/">Review Commons</ext-link>.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Hippo pathway-mediated YAP1/TAZ inhibition is essential for proper pancreatic endocrine specification and differentiation&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

Using our genetically engineered mouse models, we reveal the pivotal role of Hippo signaling in differentiation and specification of endocrine progenitor cells. Genetic deletion of <italic>Lats1/2</italic> in pancreatic endocrine progenitor cells (NL model: <italic>Ngn3<sup>Cre</sup>Lats1<sup>fl/fl</sup>Lats2<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic>) shows significant endocrine development defects. Using our rescue mouse model containing <italic>Lats1/2</italic> and <italic>Yap1/Taz</italic> quadruple-null endocrine progenitors (NLTY: <italic>Ngn3<sup>Cre</sup>Lats1<sup>fl/fl</sup>Lats2<sup>fl/fl</sup>Yap1<sup>fl/fl</sup>Taz<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic>), we showed almost complete rescue from developmental defects observed in our NL model. Genetic ablation of <italic>Yap1/Taz</italic> in our NLTY model mimics canonical Hippo kinase cascade-mediated control of YAP1/TAZ by LATS1/2. Uncontrolled YAP1/TAZ due to genetic ablation of <italic>Lats1/2</italic> in our NL model blocked endocrine specification and differentiation, suggesting the importance of intact Hippo signaling for endocrine development. We value all the comments from reviewers and revised our manuscript to strengthen our findings by: reperforming several immunostaining experiments to obtain higher quality images, clarified terminology and explanations throughout our manuscript, and updated the details on the methods we used to obtain our results. Further details on our revisions are explained below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Point-by-point description of the revisions</p><p>Reviewer #1</p><p>CROSS-CONSULTATION COMMENTS</p><p>– All reviewers have similar doubts on quality and quantification of the IHC analyses, so I would agree to give a chance to the authors for a revision, and it is probably doable in between 3 and 6 months (I wrote &gt;6 before).</p></disp-quote><p>In our fist submission, our full PDF file did not use the high-resolution figures due to large file size of some images.

Deletion of the Hippo kinases Lats1 and 2 in Ngn3-expressing endocrine progenitor cells activated YAP1/TAZ transcriptional activity and reduced islets size and morphology and induced pancreas inflammation. This is in line with the previously established role of YAP/TAZ as regulator of viral response pathways</p><p>In contrast, deletion of Lats1&amp;2 later in development had no effect on β-cell function and morphology. The authors conclude that Hippo pathway-mediated YAP1/TAZ inhibition in endocrine progenitors is a prerequisite for β-cell maturation.</p><p>– While the effect of Lats1 and 2 in β-cell development has never been investigated, the outcome of the study is largely confirmative; namely YAP's necessity to switch off whenever an endocrine cell is formed while it also balances inflammation.</p><p>The study depends on cell-specific Lats1 and 2-KO mouse models and in-vitro assessments of mechanisms how loss of LATS leads to β-cell derangement at the time of ngn3 expression and how the inflammatory pathway is activated are missing. Observations are mostly based on stainings of quite low quality and it is unclear how authors performed quantitative evaluations and how many cells from how many mice were counted. Figures show high background, e.g. CD45 in Figure 3 which would make a robust evaluation impossible. Also YAP staining, usually well-expressed in ductal cells, shows low quality and high background. Usually the antibody is well-know for its weak performance in fluorescence and should only be used with chromogenic labels.</p></disp-quote><p>To show the co-localization of multiple proteins, immunofluorescence staining is necessary.</p><p>We added and described, in detail, how we performed macrophage quantification in the Methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Evidence, reproducibility, and clarity (Required)):</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Wu et al. examined the roles of Hippo pathway mediated YAP1/TAZ inhibition in the development stages of endocrine specification and differentiation in vitro and in vivo.

This sentence is too vague.</p><p>Previous study has already reported that Ngn3 expression and Yap loss occur in parallel within the same cell during development of the endocrine pancreas (Mol Endocrinol Baltim Md. 2015;29: 1594-607. doi:10.1210/me.2014-1375).</p></disp-quote><p>As reviewer pointed out, the previous study only reported that <italic>Ngn3</italic> expression and YAP1 loss occur in parallel within the same cells, and NGN3 can turn off <italic>Yap1</italic> transcription in cell culture setting. However, our study showed that NGN3 alone is not sufficient to turn off <italic>Yap1</italic> gene in vivo. Using our genetic model, we revealed that the Hippo pathway controling the nuclear localization of YAP1 is essential at the initiation of endocrine differentiation and allows YAP1 to be turned off at the transcriptional level.</p><p>Our rescue model (NLTY mice) confirmed that the endocrine development defects observed in NL pancreas are caused by YAP1/TAZ, suggesting the necessity of controlling YAP1/TAZ by the Hippo pathway during endocrine development.

These results indicate that both of LATS1/2 and YAP/TAZ are not essential for the normal endocrine specification and differentiation. Furthermore, these results suggest that Hippo pathway-mediated YAP1/TAZ inhibition is also unnecessary for proper pancreatic endocrine specification and differentiation. Additionally, these results suggest that just a deletion of YAP/TAZ is sufficient for endocrine specification and differentiation.

The roles of the Hippo pathway in mammals are complicated and context-dependent. Prior studies have implicated the core kinase cascade of the Hippo pathway, containing MST<sub>1/2</sub>, LATS1/2 and YAP1/TAZ, in pancreatic cell lineage differentiation and morphogenesis. However, the necessity of the Hippo pathway in the development of the endocrine pancreas in vivo remains unsettled. This study by Wu et al. demonstrates that the Hippo pathway is essential for endocrine progenitor specification and differentiation but not for pancreatic β cell function in mice. Their results are in line with prior studies, but some major issues ensue largely due to the lack of data quantification to substantiate the authors' claims, the use of ambiguous/imprecise terminologies, and making unsubstantiated claims.</p><p>Major comments:</p><p>– Immunofluorescence was used to evaluate the expression, co-localization, and subcellular localization of proteins of interest (Figures 2~7). However, except for the estimation of macrophage densities (4D and 6C), none of the other immunofluorescence experiments are accompanied by quantifications and statistical analyses to substantiate the authors' claims. In addition, the red channel in several figure panels (eg. 2A and 4A) was suboptimal making interpretations very difficult. Quantification of immunofluorescence data can be done by manual counting or automated counting using software such as ImageJ or QuPath, followed by statistical analyses to provide objective evidence.</p></disp-quote><p>We did not upload high resolution images for Bioxriv publication. We now uploaded the high resolution images. We also repeated a few immunostaining experiments and have taken confocal images to increase clarity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The endocrine component constitutes only a portion of the pancreas. The authors use whole pancreases to compare the expression levels of cell type-specific or Yap1 target genes between the knockout and control mice through qPCR. While there may be technical feasibility reasons limiting the direct assessments of gene expression in the endocrine progenitor cells, the caveats of the experiments (eg. inferring cell type-specific gene expression changes from whole organ) should be highlighted along with any inconsistent results. For example, among the three ductal genes tested in Figure 1C, only Krt19 has significantly higher mRNA expression in NL vs control, but the possible reasons for such discrepancy between ductal markers were not discussed. The authors used immunofluorescence, which is only semi-quantitative, to determine that Yap1 protein abundance is increased in Lats1&amp;2 knockout cells. qPCR should also be performed for Yap1 in addition to Yap1 target genes to augment their claim of Yap1 expression being increased. More details on how the relative mRNA expression was computed is also necessary for readers to accurately interpret the results.</p></disp-quote><p>As reviewer pointed out that there are technical feasibility reasons limiting the direct assessments of gene expression in the endocrine progenitor cells. We can only quantify gene expression level through RT-qPCR. We have discussed the high level of <italic>Krt19</italic> and unchanged level of <italic>Sox9</italic> in Figure 3B and 3C when we performed immunostaining. The results from the two experiments are consistent. We observed KRT19 positive staining but no <italic>SOX9</italic> staining in <italic>Lats1/2</italic> null <italic>Ngn3</italic>-expressing cells.

Is the increase restricted to endocrine progenitor cells or all endocrine compartments? George et al. (Mol Endocrinol. 2015) used RNA in situ hybridization and found that Yap1 mRNA expression is undetectable in the endocrine pancreas at E16.5, but here the authors observe increased Yap1 protein detected by immunofluorescence in the pancreases of animals with Lats1&amp;2 knockout at E16.5. Although the authors speculate on a possible mechanism that may explain the discrepancies, it is important to evaluate whether the knockout really results in reactivation of Yap1 transcription and whether Yap1 auto-regulates on the transcriptional level.</p></disp-quote><p>The increase of YAP1 staining is restricted to endocrine progenitor cells and blocks the endocrine differentiation. The endocrine cells in NL pancreas are escapers of <italic>Lats1/2</italic> deletion and have no YAP1 expression, which is consistent with George et al. findings. The model we proposed is that in <italic>Ngn3</italic>-expressing cells, <italic>Lats1/2</italic> are required to keep YAP1/TAZ out of nuclei so that <italic>Ngn3</italic> can repress YAP1 expression. Loss of <italic>Lats1/2</italic> led to high nuclear YAP1 which may block <italic>Ngn3</italic>’s ability to suppress YAP1. ChIP-seq or ChIP-PCR on YAP1 promoter will answer the question whether YAP1 auto-regulates on the transcriptional level.

(Nat Cell Biol 2015), which was generated from human embryonic pancreatic progenitor cells, to speculate that TEAD1 binds to the promoter regions of YAP1, CDH1 and KRT19 and therefore may promote YAP1 autoregulation or expression of CDH1 and KRT19, explaining some of their immunofluorescence observations. However, they fail to acknowledge potential differences that may ensue due to the different species examined. Co-staining of Yap1 and Cdh1/Krt19 would indicate whether co-expression of Yap1 and Cdh1/Krt19 is indeed evident in the context of their study and provide further evidence to support their speculations.</p></disp-quote><p>Reviewer is correct that the dataset of TEAD1 ChIP-seq from Cebola et al. was generated from human embryonic pancreatic progenitor cells.

We recruited Dr. Arda who is an expert on single cell analysis of pancreas. She used single nuclei RNA-seq (snRNA-seq) analysis and overcome technical issues. Based on the analysis, we found that Lats1/2 KO in Ngn3 cells forced the bipotent trunk progenitor to differentiate into a new population with ductal markers such as Onecut2 and Krt19 (new Figure 6J-K) but have their unique gene expression which was highly enriched for pathways including tissue migration, wound healing and Erk cascade (Figure S6E-F).</p></disp-quote><p>– Why is acinar differentiation affected if they floxed Lats by using Ngn3Cre?

In the NL pancreas, we observed a significant reduction in the mature population, accompanied by the emergence of a new population resembling the immature one, also characterized by lower enzyme gene expression. We hypothesize that the abundance of immune cells in the NL pancreas may lead mature cells to downregulate enzyme gene expression, mirroring the response seen in adult acinar cells during inflammation.</p></disp-quote><p>– No proof of Lats inactivation is showed in Ngn3Cre mice</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>PCR analysis on P1 NL pancreas confirmed deletions of both Lats 1 and 2.
