Targeted inhibition of NFκB through its canonical mediator IKKβ effectively mitigates loss of muscle mass across many conditions, from denervation to unloading to cancer. In this study, we used gain- and loss-of-function mouse models to examine the role of NFκB in muscle atrophy following rotator cuff tenotomy – a model of chronic rotator cuff tear. IKKβ was knocked down or constitutively activated in muscle-specific inducible transgenic mice to elicit a twofold gain or loss of NFκB signaling. Surprisingly, neither knockdown of IKKβ nor overexpression of caIKKβ significantly altered the loss of muscle mass following tenotomy. This finding was consistent across measures of morphological adaptation (fiber cross-sectional area, fiber length, fiber number), tissue pathology (fibrosis and fatty infiltration), and intracellular signaling (ubiquitin-proteasome, autophagy). Intriguingly, late-stage tenotomy-induced atrophy was exacerbated in male mice compared with female mice. This sex specificity was driven by ongoing decreases in fiber cross-sectional area, which paralleled the accumulation of large autophagic vesicles in male, but not female muscle. These findings suggest that tenotomy-induced atrophy is not dependent on NFκB and instead may be regulated by autophagy in a sex-specific manner.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Muscle atrophy – the gradual loss of muscle mass – follows injuries to our muscles, tendons, or joints. During atrophy, muscles shrink and become weaker, which can interfere with everyday activities and, ultimately, decrease quality of life.</p><p>Rotator cuff tears are a common example of such injuries. A rotator cuff is group of four muscles that come together as tendons to form a cuff that normally stabilises our shoulders and allows us to lift and move our arms over our heads. Rotator cuff tears can result from an injury or may be caused by ageing-related wear and tear of the tendon.</p><p>A signalling protein, called NFκB, is thought to be involved in muscle atrophy. When the NFκB signal is switched on, it interacts with genes that are thought to speed up the loss of muscle mass. However, NFκB’s precise role in atrophy and recovery after muscle injury is still poorly understood, particularly following injuries where a tendon is cut or torn. Meyer et al. therefore set out to determine whether or not NFκB played a role in the muscle atrophy following rotator cuff tears.</p><p>Meyer et al. used genetically engineered mice in which NFκB’s signal could be turned off at the time of rotator cuff injury, and specifically in muscle cells (but not other parts of the body).

Meyer et al. hope that this study will help guide the development of new, more effective treatments for muscle atrophy, and ultimately contribute to therapies tailored to the characteristics of the patient and the type of injury.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>rotator cuff</kwd><kwd>NF kappa beta</kwd><kwd>IKK beta</kwd><kwd>muscle wasting</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000069</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R21AR071582</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Meyer</surname><given-names>Gretchen A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000069</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AR057836</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Meyer</surname><given-names>Gretchen A</given-names></name><name><surname>Thomopoulos</surname><given-names>Stavros</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Blocking an atrophic 'master regulator' pathway following tendon tear does not affect resulting skeletal muscle atrophy.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>At the most basic level, skeletal muscle atrophy is a shift in the physiological balance between protein synthesis and breakdown. This shift can be initiated by a wide variety of stimuli, from disuse to starvation to cancer, but all eventually converge on a common result – reduced muscle mass. As expected from the diverse stimuli, atrophy can be initiated through a variety of intracellular pathways. However, studies have found surprising commonality downstream, leading to the identification of a number of ‘lynchpin’ mediators – in particular signaling through nuclear factor kappa beta (NFκB), which has been described as both necessary and sufficient for skeletal muscle atrophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jackman et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sandri, 2013</xref>).</p><p>Our current understanding of NFκB’s role in adult muscle atrophy has been reviewed in detail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jackman et al., 2013</xref>), where the reader can find illustrations of the pathway. In brief, NFκB is a family of transcription factor subunits that exist as dimers and are localized to the cytoplasm by inhibitory kinases (inhibitor of κB, IκB). Upon stimulation, IκB kinases (IKKα and IKKβ) are phosphorylated and in turn phosphorylate IκB (predominantly IκBα). This leads to cytosolic degradation of Iκβ and nuclear transport of NFκB transcription factor dimers to initiate transcription of genes involved in the atrophy program. Inhibiting IKKβ activity by muscle-specific knockout of its gene (<italic>Ikbkb</italic>) or electroporating a dominant negative form into skeletal muscle prevented approximately half the loss of muscle mass induced by denervation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mourkioti et al., 2006</xref>), unloading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Van Gammeren et al., 2009</xref>), or immobilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Reed et al., 2011</xref>). Similar results were found in the Iκβα superrepressor mouse, which displays dampened NFkB activity, in response to an inflammatory insult (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Haegens et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Langen et al., 2012</xref>) denervation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cai et al., 2004</xref>), unloading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Judge et al., 2007</xref>), nutrient deprivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lee and Goldberg, 2015</xref>), or tumor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cai et al., 2004</xref>). Assessment of NFκB activity by nuclear localization or DNA binding of its subunits confirmed that inhibition of IKKβ activity or IκBα degradation completely (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cai et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Senf et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Van Gammeren et al., 2009</xref>) or partially (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mourkioti et al., 2006</xref>) blocked NFκB translocation, demonstrating that NFκB signaling is responsible for a considerable portion of atrophy driven by these diverse stimuli.</p><p>The best-studied gene targets of NFκB in muscle are the E3 ubiquitin ligases muscle ring finger 1 (MuRF1) and muscle atrophy F-box (MAFbx; a.k.a. Atrogin-1). These genes, termed ‘atrogenes,’ are thought to control the majority of proteolysis in skeletal muscle across atrophic conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bodine et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gomes et al., 2001</xref>). Knockout of MuRF1 results in a similar extent of muscle sparing to NFκB inhibition in denervation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gomes et al., 2012</xref>), unloading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Labeit et al., 2010</xref>), glucocorticoid treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Baehr et al., 2011</xref>), and inflammatory insult (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Files et al., 2012</xref>), leading it, too, to be labeled ‘essential’ for skeletal muscle atrophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Peris-Moreno et al., 2020</xref>). While compelling, this explanation remains incomplete. First, because inhibition of NFκB or MuRF1 signaling does not completely prevent atrophy induced by these various stimuli and second because the degree of prevention varies by stimulus and muscle. For example, muscle-specific <italic>Ikbkb</italic> knockout prevented ~70% of denervation-induced decrease in mass of the soleus muscle, but only ~30% in the gastrocnemius muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mourkioti et al., 2006</xref>). Similarly, Iκβα super-repressor prevented only ~25% of the denervation-induced mass loss in the gastrocnemius and tibialis anterior muscles but ~50% of the tumor-induced loss in mass (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cai et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>Recently, tendon tears (leading to release of muscle tension and muscle retraction) have emerged as potentially employing distinctive mechanisms of muscle atrophy. A comparative study of atrophic signaling between tenotomy and immobilization found that tenotomized gastrocnemius muscle atrophy was primarily characterized by a lysosomal/autophagic signature, in contrast to the classical ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal activity signature of the immobilized gastroc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bialek et al., 2011</xref>). MuRF1 or MAFbx expression did not significantly increase with tenotomy, where dramatic increases were again shown with immobilization, denervation, and glucocorticoid-induced atrophy. This is somewhat surprising given the similarity in signaling induced by other models of unloading that remove either passive loading (e.g., hindlimb suspension and immobilization by casting) or active loading (e.g., denervation). In fact, previous to this study, tenotomy was assumed to employ the ubiquitin-mediated proteasome activity through NFκB and the atrogenes simply because of this similarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Laron et al., 2012</xref>). More recent studies have focused on tenotomy of the rotator cuff (RC) muscles (without suprascapular nerve injury) as a model to investigate the mechanisms of muscle atrophy in human chronic RC tears. These studies have confirmed no increases in MuRF1 or MAFbx following RC tenotomy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Liu et al., 2012</xref>) and have uncovered additional evidence for increased autophagic flux (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gumucio et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Joshi et al., 2014</xref>). Evidence in support of proteasomal activity in the early phase of RC tenotomy, however, also exists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Valencia et al., 2017</xref>), leaving open the possibility of coordinated action of multiple pathways.</p><p>Taken together, these prior studies suggest that although NFκB signaling is a critical component of many disparate atrophy models, it may not be ubiquitous – and in particular may not play a major role in tenotomy-induced atrophy. However, due to the complexity of NFκB signaling, its role in tenotomy-induced atrophy (or lack thereof) cannot be inferred from the lack of atrogene expression or the autophagic state of the muscle alone. First, because evidence suggests that NFκB is capable of driving atrophy independent of MuRF1 or MAFbx (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cai et al., 2004</xref>) and second, because there is a complex link between NFκB and autophagy which could cause NFκB to drive the autophagic process (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Xia et al., 2021</xref>). In this study, we sought to determine the role of NFκB signaling in tenotomy-induced atrophy of the RC muscles using muscle-specific gain- and loss-of-function IKKβ transgenic mouse models to inhibit and promote NFκB activity, respectively. We hypothesized that NFκB inhibition would ameliorate tenotomy-induced atrophy through an atrogene-independent mechanism, thus supporting NFκB inhibitors as a novel therapeutic strategy to maintain muscle mass following human chronic RC tears. However, we found that knockdown of IKKβ had no impact on the loss of muscle mass or contractile performance following tenotomy and that overexpression of constitutively active IKKβ was insufficient to drive muscle atrophy. Instead, our data point to an NFκB-independent, sex-specific mechanism driven by autophagy.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Tenotomy-induced atrophy of the rotator cuff muscles is sex-specific</title><p>Change in muscle mass was the first outcome assessed following tenotomy of the supraspinatus (SS) and infraspinatus (IS) muscles – the primary abductors in the RC. Although this study was primarily concerned with differences between genotypes (due to changes in NFκB signaling), differences were noted between males and females in the wildtype group. Specifically, at week 8 (W8) post-tenotomy, mass loss in the male SS and IS muscles outpaced that in female mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Further investigation in the other outcomes of the study suggests that these sex-specific muscle mass effects arose from sex-specific differences in the morphological mechanisms of atrophy. Atrophy is driven by three primary morphological adaptations: decreases in fiber sizes in the radial dimension (fiber atrophy), decreases in fiber numbers (hypoplasia), and decreases in fiber sizes in the longitudinal dimension (sarcomere subtraction). Only male mice demonstrated decreased fiber cross-sectional area (CSA) at W8 post- tenotomy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Conversely, only female mice decreased fiber numbers at W8 post-tenotomy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).

Overall, changes in fiber length accounted for most of the mass deficit with tenotomy in both sexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, purple). However, there were notable differences in the other sources. While changes in fiber CSA accounted for 25–30% of the mass loss in male mice at 2W and 8W, they accounted for none of the mass loss in female mice. In contrast, changes in fiber number account for 30–40% of the mass loss in females, but only 15–20% in males. To validate that our model captured the major sources of mass loss, we regressed the predicted mass deficit against the measured mass deficit for each muscle across both sexes. The measurements were significantly correlated (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.41, p=0.002; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Additionally, the slope of the regression line was close to 1, indicating that the morphological measurements were able to account for the majority of muscle mass loss following tenotomy. Given these differences, all subsequent analyses investigating the effect of IKKβ knockdown and overexpression on tenotomy-induced muscle atrophy consider sex-specific effects.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>IKKβ gain- and loss-of-function did not affect tenotomy-induced muscle atrophy</title><p>The gene encoding IKKβ (<italic>Ikbkb</italic>) was selectively deleted (IKKb<sup>MKD</sup>) or constitutively activated (IKKb<sup>MCA</sup>) in mature skeletal muscle fibers of 6–8-month-old transgenic mice.

Conversely, tamoxifen treatment of IKKb<sup>MCA</sup> mice caused a two- to threefold increase in <italic>Ikbkb</italic> expression at W8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).

This deletion efficiency measured at the whole muscle level is comparable to other tamoxifen-inducible models in which satellite and interstitial cells also express the gene of interest.

For these assays, we focused solely on the SS muscle since SS and IS responded similarly to tenotomy with regard to mass and contractile outcomes. Surprisingly, tenotomy caused relatively small changes in fiber CSA compared to other forms of atrophy for a similar mass loss. At W8 (the timepoint of maximal mass deficit), only type 2b fibers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, green) from male muscles exhibited a leftward shift in the histogram of CSA with tenotomy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, green), while type 2a fibers exhibited a rightward shift (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, blue). Analysis of mean CSA of type 2a and type 2b fibers over time further illustrated this effect. There was a main effect of time in analysis of type 2a CSA by three-way ANOVA owing to the continued increase in CSA through W8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>).

Fibrosis, assessed as the area fraction positive for Sirius Red, was elevated following tenotomy but without a main effect of genotype or sex, indicating that tenotomy induced fibrosis equally in WT and IKKβ knockdown males and females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Fatty infiltration, assessed as the area fraction positive for Oil Red-O, was also elevated following tenotomy, an effect that was exacerbated in female mice due to the overall higher levels of intramuscular fat in females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">McHale et al., 2012</xref>). However, there was no main effect of genotype, again indicating that IKKβ knockdown did not affect the progression of fatty infiltration. Fiber degeneration was assessed on hematoxylin &amp; eosin (H&amp;E)-stained sections by a blinded rater counting necrotic fibers (active degeneration) and centrally nucleated fibers (regeneration) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Across timepoints, there were no obvious necrotic fibers in tenotomized muscle, suggesting that active degeneration was either not occurring or missed at the timepoints chosen for assessment. However, there was a gradual increase in centrally nucleated fibers over time following tenotomy, which was exacerbated in males (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). A blinded rater noted the appearance of basophilic puncta (hematoxylin-positive, DAPI-negative structures) in some H&amp;E-stained sections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D and F</xref>; single arrows). These were generally more prevalent in males than females, and this difference was exacerbated at 8W, where they were increased 20-fold over W1 levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>). These puncta stained positive for LC3 and p62, suggesting that they were autophagic vesicles.

In contrast, the population of satellite cells identified by nuclear Pax7 did not change with tenotomy at week 1, suggesting minimal regenerative response in the muscle following tendon transection.

The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway may be activated during the early phase of tenotomy, consistent with a previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Valencia et al., 2017</xref>). While the typical atrogenes MuRF1 and MAFbx were not substantially elevated at W1, expression of Foxo3, an additional driver of both proteolysis and autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zhao et al., 2007</xref>), was significantly increased at W1 in female mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Expression of all three genes decreased at W8, suggesting that they are not driving late-stage atrophy. Consistent with this, protein ubiquitination, assessed by Western blot against ubiquitin, was modestly increased at W1 but not at W8 post-tenotomy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). To examine autophagy, we assessed gene expression and protein abundance of components of the autophagasome. While Becn1 and Bnip3 increased expression and Atg5 decreased expression significantly from W1 to W8, these changes were very minor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). Other components remained unchanged. Similarly, there were no differences in the LC3II/LC3I ratio or p62 at W1, but a modest increase at W8 with tenotomy, where three-way ANOVA showed a significant main effect of treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). Interestingly, three-way ANOVA of Gaparapl1, Becn1, and Bnip3 expression as well as protein levels for p62 found a main effect of sex owing to higher levels in male mice than female further supporting a sex specificity in autophagic processing. Overall, neither the ubiquitin-proteolysis nor autophagy-lysosome pathway were substantially affected by tenotomy at W1 or W8. Furthermore, knockdown of IKKβ did not impact these small effects. As the loss of muscle mass could be driven by decreased protein synthesis instead of increased protein degradation, we also assessed activation of the Akt/mTOR pathway, which can mediate increased protein synthesis in response to loading changes. We did not find any changes in phosphorylation of Akt, mTOR, or S6 ribosomal protein with tenotomy or IKKβ knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>).

While this caused a mild increase in muscle mass in general, it surprisingly had no additional effect on any outcomes following tenotomy, including muscle mass and contractile force, fiber area, length and number, and atrophic signaling through the ubiquitin-proteasome and autophagy pathways. Similarly, doubling IKKβ expression using a gain-of-function mouse model had little effect on muscle responses to tenotomy. Together, these results indicate that NFκB does not play a major role in mediating tenotomy-induced atrophy. Interestingly, this study also uncovered sex-specific mechanisms of tenotomy-induced atrophy, most evident at the later timepoints investigated. Male, but not female, mice continued to lose muscle mass between 2W and 8W post-tenotomy. The sex-specific result was likely due to ongoing type 2b fiber atrophy driven by accumulation of autophagic vesicles, which was exacerbated in males at 8W. This surprising finding warrants further investigation in naïve wildtype mice.</p><p>The finding that IKKβ knockdown had little effect on tenotomy-induced muscle atrophy aligns with the limited data in tenotomy models, but is contrary to the NFκB muscle atrophy dogma. Transgenic interference with NFκB signaling substantially reduced loss of muscle mass across nearly every model investigated, including unloading, immobilization, denervation, acute inflammatory challenge, nutrient deprivation, and cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cai et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mourkioti et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Judge et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Van Gammeren et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Reed et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Haegens et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Langen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lee and Goldberg, 2015</xref>). These models encompass diverse stimuli for atrophy that are frequently subcategorized as disuse, aging, or disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Romanick et al., 2013</xref>). Tenotomy is typically included in the disuse category, along with unloading, immobilization, and denervation. However, tenotomy is fundamentally unique in that it severs the connection of the muscle to the skeleton, eliminating passive tension and immediately changing the length of the muscle as the muscle recoils and comes to rest in a shortened position. Importantly, tenotomy alone does not involve any direct damage to the muscle or its innervation, avoiding confounding effects of denervation and extensive regeneration. While RC tenotomy is frequently paired with denervation to elicit more dramatic muscle pathology (particularly fatty infiltration), there is not strong evidence that nerve damage is a consistent feature of even massive RC tears in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Costouros et al., 2007</xref>). Similarly, extensive regeneration does not appear to be a notable feature of RC tears in humans, where only ~10% of fibers exhibit central nucleation, compared with ~3% in controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gibbons et al., 2017</xref>). In the mouse, we find no proliferation of satellite cells at W1 following tenotomy and only a minor (&lt;3%) increase in centrally nucleated fibers at later timepoints. This, combined with the lack of dilution of the NFkb knockdown at the gene and protein level, suggests that the genetically unmodified SCs are not contributing substantial additional myonuclei. However, unlike human tears, rodent models of tenotomy develop a fibrous ‘pseudo-tendon’ scar in the gap between the tendon and bone, partially restoring passive loading to the muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jamali et al., 2000</xref>). This retraction plus scarring in the shortened position induces the loss of muscle mass in the longitudinal dimension by sarcomere subtraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Ward et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Meyer, 2022</xref>); a phenomenon that does not occur in hindlimb unloading or denervation models and, to a lesser extent, in immobilization models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Heslinga and Huijing, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Van Dyke et al., 2012</xref>). Tenotomy and immobilization are also the only disuse models to demonstrate central core lesions of myofibril breakdown, hypothesized to be due to contraction in the shortened position. However, these are also exacerbated in tenotomy compared with immobilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baewer et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baewer et al., 2008</xref>). This suggests that tenotomized muscle is engaged in high levels of active remodeling, differentiating it from models reducing excess muscle mass in response to decreased use. This active remodeling could be responsible for the unique degradation signature in tenotomy compared with immobilization or denervation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bialek et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Liu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Joshi et al., 2014</xref>), where either the myofibril breakdown or selective serial sarcomere subtraction is engaging autophagic mechanisms. Our data also suggest that the mechanisms of muscle loss may vary temporally following tenotomy. IKKβ knockdown had the greatest effect on tenotomized muscle mass at W1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), which aligned with main the effects of treatment in ubiquitin protein abundance and MuRF1 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A and B</xref>). These transient effects could be due to a differential atrophic responses of the muscle pre- and post-scarring or due to the resolution of inflammatory signals following tenotomy.</p><p>Interestingly, while male mice continued to lose muscle mass between W2 and W8 post-tenotomy, the contractile deficit stabilized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Peak tetanic tension is normalized to PCSA, which theoretically accounts for changes in fiber CSA/number and serial sarcomere subtraction, but even after this normalization, a deficit remained. The source of this deficit is unknown. It could be that PCSA is not fully accounting for the impact of morphological changes on contractile force or the deficit may be attributed to another factor, such as muscle quality. The fact that contractile properties remained stable during ongoing atrophy in male mice suggests that PCSA does sufficiently account for these changes. Additionally, data in the tenotomized rat SS indicate that contractile deficits precede morphological changes and are measurable as soon as 1 day post-tenotomy, remaining stable for 2 weeks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Valencia et al., 2017</xref>). This suggests that the contractile deficit originated early in the tenotomy injury and never resolved during the subsequent process of healing. There is considerable evidence for myofibrillar disruption and fiber damage post-tenotomy (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jamali et al., 2000</xref>), and it is possible that the tenotomized muscle cannot adequately repair this damage in its unloaded state. If this is the case, it also offers an explanation for why IKKβ knockdown did not affect the contractile deficits. However, it is difficult to say whether some recovery of this initial damage occurs and is offset by the later development of structural pathology (e.g., fibrosis, fat infiltration, basophilic puncta, etc.) or whether the degree of this later structural pathology is insufficient to drive additional measurable contractile changes, as other work suggests it does (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Biltz et al., 2020</xref>). Future studies using targeted mouse models such as the lipodystrophic mouse (that does not develop fat infiltration) or pharmacologics that target accumulation of autophagic vesicles could shed some light on this question.</p><p>Expression of a constitutively active form of IKKβ doubled the concentration of IKKβ in mice, yet this increase had negligible effects on tenotomy-induced atrophy. This finding is in contrast to findings from the MIKK mouse and transfection of constitutively active IKKβ, which reportedly induced significant muscle atrophy, even in the absence of an unloading stimulus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cai et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Van Gammeren et al., 2009</xref>). However, these studies notably induced more than tenfold increases in constitutively active IKKβ, levels that may be supra-physiological. Our findings suggest that smaller increases in IKKβ may not be sufficient to drive atrophy without an additional stimulus.</p><p>Increased protein ubiquitination has been observed early (2–15 days) post-tenotomy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baewer et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Valencia et al., 2017</xref>), which could indicate coordinated action of multiple activated pathways, one of which may be regulated by NFκB. Due to this mounting evidence for autophagy due to tenotomy, it was reasonable to hypothesize in this study that NFκB might also be involved in the atrophic process. Additionally, NFκB could directly affect autophagy as several autophagic regulatory genes (Beclin 1, Atg6, and LC3) are targets of NFκB in other tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Copetti et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nivon et al., 2009</xref>). While our data strongly suggest that NFκB does <italic>not</italic> play a major role in tenotomy-induced atrophy, there are several limitations that could have masked some NFκB-driven effects. First, HSA-driven deletion of <italic>Ikbkb</italic> was only 50–60% efficient, leaving 40–50% of the endogenous levels of IKKβ to participate in NFκB signaling. Indeed, we found 40–50% of endogenous WT NFκB subunits p50 and p65 present in the nuclear fraction. By comparison, constitutive deletion of <italic>Ikbkb</italic> under control of muscle creatine kinase (MCK) was 70% efficient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mourkioti et al., 2006</xref>), and blocking IKKβ activity using the IKβα super-repressor mouse or transfection of dominant-negative IKKβ completely blocked NFκB nuclear translocation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cai et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Van Gammeren et al., 2009</xref>). The reasons for our limited efficacy are unclear, but may derive from the efficiency of tamoxifen, as ours was the only study to use an inducible transgenic model. However, our lesser impacts on the NFκB pathway are likely more translationally relevant as NFκB inhibitors have a comparable impact on the NFκB pathway as reported here (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Belova et al., 2017</xref>) and have detrimental off-target effects at high doses (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mourkioti and Rosenthal, 2008</xref>). Thus, while it is possible that residual activation of NFκB signaling is sufficient to drive tenotomy-induced atrophy in our model, our data still suggest that pharmacological inhibition of NFκB signaling is not likely to be therapeutically valuable. Furthermore, our findings in wildtype mice that IKKβ protein levels and nuclear NFκB subunits were unchanged by tenotomy provide additional evidence against NFκB driving tenotomy-induced muscle loss as both of these are increased in other models of unloading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hunter et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Van Gammeren et al., 2009</xref>). Furthermore, we also found only a very small increase in the major gene target of NFκB-induced atrophy (MuRF1) following tenotomy, consistent with other reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bialek et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Liu et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Evidence for autophagy regulating tenotomy-induced atrophy has been mounting in recent years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bialek et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gumucio et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Joshi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ning et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hirunsai and Srikuea, 2021</xref>). The evidence presented here supports this contention, but we find surprisingly small effect sizes for all markers investigated. This could be because we did not directly assess autophagic flux and so missed some temporal dynamics since synthesis and degradation are ongoing simultaneously. It could also be because autophagy is only one piece of a more complex atrophic regulation. Notably, Foxo3 regulates autophagy/lysosomal and ubiquitin/proteasomal degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zhao et al., 2007</xref>), and this master regulator was not assessed in detail here. Additionally, a number of E3 ubiquitin ligases other than MuRF1 and MAFbx regulate muscle atrophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Ye et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nagpal et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hindi et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, it is possible that NFκB-driven atrophy was affected by IKKβ knockdown, but compensation by another atrophic pathway obscured the effects on muscle mass etc. The complex interplay between these pathways warrants further investigation.</p><p>Few studies have investigated sex-specific effects in muscle atrophy, particularly in the context of tenotomy. Studies in other disuse models indicated that atrophy, and the pathways that modulate it, may vary by sex. Soleus atrophy during hindlimb unloading was exacerbated in female rats compared with male rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yoshihara et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rosa‐Caldwell et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Yoshihara et al., 2022</xref>). This was associated with increased FoxO3a activity, protein ubiquitination, and myostatin expression in females compared to males, with no differences in autophagy or Akt phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yoshihara et al., 2019</xref>). In humans, females experience greater levels of atrophy in response to disuse and aging, while males have greater loss of muscle in response to cancer (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rosa-Caldwell and Greene, 2019</xref>), suggesting that sex specificity extends to clinical populations as well. In the human RC, symptomatic tear development and progression are more prevalent in males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Yamamoto et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Song et al., 2022</xref>). Here, we find that not only do male mice lose more mass after tenotomy, they lose it uniquely through type 2b fiber atrophy, while female mice lose mass uniquely through fiber hypoplasia. It is possible that both sexes experience some fiber degeneration (as has been noted in chronic human RC tears; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gibbons et al., 2017</xref>), but males are more efficiently repairing the damaged fibers; this speculation would explain the sex specificity in central nuclei, then the load borne by fewer fibers helps maintain fiber CSA. While these differences are relatively minor, they suggest that some sex specificity in chronic tear outcomes could be intrinsically biological or an interaction between intrinsically biological and behavioral factors. To further explore the clinical relevance of these findings, it will be important to determine whether these changes affect recovery of mass and function following surgical repair and rehabilitation. This would necessitate moving to a larger animal model, but would also afford the opportunity to explore whether this sex specificity is conserved between species.</p><p>The most dramatic difference we observed between males and females was the increase in basophilic puncta positive for autophagic vesicle markers p62 and LC3 in male muscles at W8 post-tenotomy compared with female muscles. This suggests that the ongoing mass loss concurrent with their appearance may be mediated by autophagy. However, we found only mild differences in LC3 protein content between male and female muscles at this timepoint. Thus, the issue in the male mice may be dysregulated autophagic flux with accumulation of large autophagic vesicles. Proper assessment of autophagic flux cannot be done on existing samples as it requires treatment of mice with lysomotropic agents prior to muscle harvest. Additionally, it is important to note that estrous cycle was not controlled in these mice and sex hormone levels were not measured in this study. These preliminary observations, though intriguing, will require more rigorous follow-up evaluations to define the interaction between sex, tenotomy, and autophagy in naïve wildtype mice.</p><p>In conclusion, we found that a twofold gain- or loss-of-function of IKKβ did not impact tenotomy-induced muscle atrophy or contractile dysfunction. This suggests that IKKβ/NFκB inhibitors are unlikely to improve muscle outcomes through direct inhibition of atrophy in human RC tears. Given promising preclinical data suggesting that IKKβ inhibitors improve tendon-to-bone healing after RC tenotomy and repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Golman et al., 2021</xref>), and NFκB inhibitors improve muscle mass and contractile function in disease models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Messina et al., 2006</xref>), it was logical to hypothesize that they would also directly improve muscle outcomes in human rotator cuff disease. However, this hypothesis was not supported by our data, which suggest that tenotomy, and likely human RC tears, is a unique model of muscle atrophy driven by factors associated with the loss of muscle passive tension. It is important to note, however, that NFκB inhibitors still have the potential to improve muscle outcomes indirectly by targeting satellite cells, FAPs, and/or tenocytes, all of which will be involved in the development of pathology or the potential for rehabilitation and none of which were genetically modified in this study. Future work comparing these results with NFκB inhibitors could shed light on their therapeutic potential for preventing tenotomy-induced atrophy and the mechanisms of action. Intriguingly, our data also revealed a preliminary observation of sex specificity in the atrophic response following tenotomy that warrants further exploration. This aligns with sex specificity in human RC tears and could guide more effective and individualized therapies.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><table-wrap

approved by the Animal Studies Committee of the Washington University School of Medicine (IACUC 20-0459).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Experimental design</title><p>Experiments were performed on male and female muscle-specific conditional IKKβ knockdown mice (IKKb<sup>MKD</sup>), muscle-specific conditionally active IKKβ mice (IKKb<sup>MCA</sup>), and respective littermate controls at 6–8 months of age. IKKβ-MKD mice were generated by breeding Ikbkbtm2Cgn (originally generated by Manolis Pasparakis; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pasparakis et al., 2002</xref>) mice with HSA-MCM (Jackson Labs; #025750) mice such that tamoxifen delivery induced deletion of the IKKβ gene in mature muscle fibers. IKKβ-CA mice were generated by breeding Gt(Rosa26)tm4(Ikbkb)Rsky (Jackson Labs; #008242) mice with HSA-MCM mice such that tamoxifen delivery induced expression of a constitutively active form of IKKβ in mature muscle fibers. Littermate mice that did not express Cre-recombinase were used as wildtype (WT) controls. Some data from WT mice have been reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Meyer, 2022</xref>). Seven mice per group were randomly assigned in each design – IKKb<sup>MKD</sup> (three timepoints, two treatments, two genotypes, two sexes) and IKKb<sup>MCA</sup> (one timepoint, two treatments, two genotypes, two sexes) – for a total of 224 mice. Numbers per group for each outcome measure are provided for each figure and deviate from 7 in cases where muscles failed during testing, sample quality was poor or insufficient sample remained for the assay. Each mouse underwent tamoxifen treatment, bilateral tenotomy, or sham surgery followed by ex vivo muscle contractile testing and sacrifice. Muscles were then processed for additional measurements as described below: the SS from the right shoulder and the IS from the left shoulder were used for physiological testing and the SS from the left shoulder and the IS from the right shoulder were prepared for histology, qPCR, and Western blotting.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Surgical treatment</title><p>Under continuous anesthesia (2% inhaled isoflurane at 2 L/min), both shoulders were prepared for sterile surgery. In a left lateral decubitus position, an ~3 mm incision was made through the skin from the acromial arch toward the mid-belly of the deltoid muscle, exposing the proximal deltoid. An incision was then made through the deltoid to expose the humerus. The humerus was then stabilized with one set of forceps while the acromial space was expanded with another forceps. Mice in the tenotomy group then had the tendons of the SS and IS muscles transected with microscissors. Mice in the sham group had no tendon transection. All mice then had the deltoid sutured to the trapezius muscle over the acromial arch with 5-0 absorbable Vicryl suture (Ethicon) and the skin incision closed with Vetbond suture glue (3M). The mice were then turned to lie on the right side and the same procedure was repeated for a bilateral treatment. This design was chosen to avoid the effects of altered use that could confound a contralateral control in a unilateral design. Following surgery, mice were provided analgesia and allowed free cage activity until the experimental end point.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Ex vivo muscle contractile testing</title><p>Mice assigned to the 2- and 8-week post-tenotomy outcome groups were anesthetized again at the experimental end point for ex vivo contractile testing of the SS and IS muscles as previously described (JOR and JCSM). The SS muscle was excised from the right side with its connection to the scapula and humeral head left intact. All other musculature was dissected free from the scapula, including the IS, which was prepared for histology as described below. The SS was then transferred to an ex vivo physiology rig (Aurora Scientific; 1300A) where it was immersed in Mammalian Ringers solution with the scapula secured to the arm of a dual force/length transducer (Aurora Scientific; 305C-LR) and the humeral head secured to a rigid post. Contraction was elicited by stimulation through parallel plate electrodes flanking the muscle. Muscle length was increased incrementally until the force of twitch contractions began to plateau. Then optimal length was determined by further adjusting length until peak tetanic tension was achieved. Muscle optimal length was then measured with a flexible ruler and the muscle was dissected from bony attachments, blotted, weighed, and flash-frozen for qPCR. All forces were normalized to physiological CSA, which was calculated from model-predicted fiber length and pennation angle values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Meyer, 2022</xref>). A similar procedure was then repeated on the left side for contractile testing of the IS and histological prep of the SS. Following testing, mice were euthanized. Mice assigned to the 1-week post-tenotomy outcome group were euthanized without contractile testing as the connective tissue ‘pseudo-tendon’ was too weak to sustain the connection to the humeral head during testing. Muscles that would have undergone contractile testing were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and the other muscles were prepared for histology as they were for the other groups.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Histological measurements</title><p>Muscles prepared for histology were affixed to cork at the distal end with tragacanth gum and frozen in liquid nitrogen cooled isopentane and stored at –80°C until sectioning. They were then transferred to a cryostat (Leica; CM1950) where they were transected at mid-belly with a razor blade. The proximal tip was stored at –80°C for Western blot and qPCR assays. The remainder was then sectioned at the mid-belly face at 10 μm for H&amp;E, picrosirius red (Sirius Red), and Oil Red-O (ORO) staining and immunostaining for fiber typing by myosin heavy chain isoform (Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank; BA-F8, SC-71, BF-F3; 1:30), fiber counting by laminin (Abcam; 11575; 1:400) outline, autophagic vesicle identification by p62 (Cell Signaling Technology [CST]; 5114; 1:100) and LC3A/B (CST; 12741; 1:100), FAP identification by platelet-derived growth factor α (PDGFRα) (R&amp;D Systems; AF1062, 1:400), and satellite cells (SC) by Pax7 (Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank; Pax7, 1:100).</p><p>Sections for ORO staining were mounted on pre-chilled slides and vapor-fixed for 48 hr in formaldehyde at –20°C. They were then post-fixed by immersion in 37% formaldehyde for 30 min. For staining, slides were transferred to a working solution of ORO consisting of a 3:2 ratio of ORO stock (5 mg/mL in isopropanol) and diH<sub>2</sub>O for 10 min with agitation. They were then rehydrated and rinsed in diH<sub>2</sub>O for imaging. Quantification of fatty infiltration was performed on 2× images of the entire cross-section. Sections for Sirius Red staining were fixed in acetone for 1 hr, followed by Bouin’s solution for 5 min. Slides were rinsed in running distilled water for 10 min and then immersed in a freshly made Sirius Red solution (1 mg/mL Direct Red 80 dissolved in saturated picric acid at 37°C, cooled to room temperature) for 2 hr. Slides were then placed in 0.01 M hydrochloric acid for 5 min, rinsed in distilled water for 1 min, dehydrated in ethanol, cleared in xylenes, and coverslipped. Quantification of fibrosis was performed on two 10× images that excluded the tendon and averaged. Images of ORO and Sirius Red were thresholded on the red channel by the Huang algorithm in ImageJ (NIH). Fatty infiltration and fibrosis were then quantified as the percentage of total pixels in the cross-section that met the threshold.</p><p>Immunostaining for p62, LC3A/B, PDGFRα, and Pax7 was performed on sections fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min. Slides allocated for Pax7 underwent an additional step of antigen retrieval consisting of steaming in pre-heated Antigen Retrieval Citra (Biogenex; HK086-5K) for 15 min, followed by gradual cooling to room temperature and blocking with the M.O.M. (Mouse on Mouse) kit (Vector Laboratories) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Slides allocated for p62 and LC3A/B were stained with H&amp;E following imaging, allowing positive identification of p62/LC3 and hematoxylin in the same section. All other immunostaining was performed on fresh-frozen sections. With the exception of myosin heavy chain-stained sections, all immunostaining was counterstained with Hoechst 33342 (DAPI). Fiber area by fiber type was quantified on four 20× images from defined regions of the superficial and deep portion of the muscle using a semi-automated ImageJ macro. First, fiber ROIs are identified by thresholding the laminin signal using the Huang algorithm followed by selecting outlined regions by the Analyze Particles algorithm with manual deletion/addition of incorrect/missing regions. Then ROIs are typed by overlaying ROIs on channels stained with each myosin heavy chain type sequentially and scored as positive or negative by average signal. Type assignment is checked and errors corrected manually. Fiber number was quantified on 2× laminin stained images of the entire cross-section using the ROI identification portion of the algorithm. Central nuclei were defined as structures positive for hematoxylin and DAPI not adjacent to a laminin boundary and were counted manually through the entire cross-section. Basophilic puncta were defined as structures positive for hematoxylin but negative for DAPI and were counted manually through the entire cross-section. FAPs and SCs were counted manually on two nonoverlapping 10× images. FAPs were defined as structures positive for PDGFRα in the interstitium between laminin fiber boundaries. SCs were defined as Pax7-positive nuclei beneath the laminin boundary.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Quantitative real-time PCR</title><p>RNA was extracted from frozen muscle using a standard Trizol/chloroform extraction protocol. Briefly, muscle was bead homogenized in Trizol using a TissueLyser II (QIAGEN; 85300) and RNA extracted by addition of chloroform with centrifugation. RNA was precipitated in 50% isopropanol, washed in 75% ethanol, and dissolved in DNAse/RNAse free water. cDNA was generated using the MultiScribe reverse transcription kit (Applied Biosystems; 4368814) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Transcript copies were detected using a fast SYBR Green PCR master mix (Applied Biosystems; 4385612). Primer sequences are listed in the Key Resources Table. Reactions were run in duplicate on a QuantStudio3 (Applied Biosystems) real-time PCR system. All expression values were normalized to GAPDH, and primers were validated against a positive control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Western blotting</title><p>Protein was extracted from frozen muscle in RIPA buffer supplemented with cOmplete Protease Inhibitor (Roche) with bead homogenization using a TissueLyser II (QIAGEN; 85300). Homogenized tissue was then solubilized for 1 hr at 4°C with agitation, centrifuged, and the protein concentration of the supernatant determined by a Pierce BCA assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific; 23225) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Then, equivalent amounts of protein (40 μg) diluted in diH<sub>2</sub>O with Laemmli buffer were denatured and separated on 4–12% Bis-Tris gels (Invitrogen; NW04120). Protein was then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane, reversibly stained with Ponceau S and blocked in TBST+ (1× Tris-buffered saline with 2.5% fish gelatin, 0.1% sodium azide, and 0.5% tween). The following primary antibodies were applied overnight at 4°C at 1:1000 unless otherwise noted: IKKβ (CST; 8943), ubiquitin (Dako; Z0458), SQSTM1/p62 (CST; 5114), LC3A/B (CST; 12741), mTOR (CST; 2983), phospho-mTOR-ser2448 (CST; 5536), Akt (CST; 9272), phospho-Akt-ser473 (CST; 4060), and actin (Sigma; A2066; 1:10,000). To assay NFκB subunit translocation, protein from a subset of muscles was fractionated into nuclear and cytoplasmic components using a Nuclear Extract Kit (Active Motif; 40010) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The nuclear fraction was validated against an established protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dimauro et al., 2012</xref>) and separated, transferred, and blocked as described above. The following primary antibodies were applied overnight at 4°C at 1:1000 unless otherwise noted: p65 (CST; 8242), p50/105 (CST; 13586), Histone H3 (CST; 4499), and GAPDH (Abcam; 9485; 1:10,000). Following incubation, membranes were washed and incubated for 1 hr with the relevant secondary antibodies and imaged with a LI-COR Odyssey. Blot analysis was performed using Image Studio (LI-COR). Band intensities were normalized to an actin loading control with the exception of p50 and p65, which were normalized to histone H3 and ubiquitin that was normalized to Ponceau. When possible, antibodies were validated with a positive loading control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Prediction of mass deficit from morphological measurements</title><p>The relative contribution of fiber CSA, length, and number changes to the mass deficit was calculated by modeling fibers as cylinders.

However, we believe that pharmacologics are likely to impact other aspects of RC tenotomy pathology (e.g. tendon healing, which has already been documented) that will indirectly affect muscle atrophy. Because of the number of potential indirect mediators and their interconnectedness, this quickly becomes a complicated question. We believe this question would be better suited for an additional study, where we can apply what we have learned here using genetic tools about the role of NFkb in the muscle fiber specifically.</p><p>We feel this is an important consideration for the reader and thus have added the following to the Discussion section:</p><p>Discussion:</p><p>“It is important to note, however, that NFκB inhibitors still have the potential to improve muscle outcomes indirectly by targeting satellite cells, fibro/adipogenic progenitors and/or tenocytes, all of which will be involved in the development of pathology or the potential for rehabilitation and none of which were genetically modified in this study. Future work comparing these results with NFκB inhibitors could shed light on their therapeutic potential for preventing tenotomy-induced atrophy and the mechanisms of action.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) For figure 4, it would be helpful to understand why there are no observed changes in contractility and tension if there are significant physical differences in muscle composition observed.</p></disp-quote><p>We are happy to provide a more detailed discussion of the contractility data and the potential physical explanators. Theoretically, normalization of tetanic force to physiological cross-sectional area (PCSA) in Fig 4 accounts for our measured changes in mass (Fig 3) and fiber length (Fig 5F), and by proxy fiber atrophy and hypoplasia (Fig 5D&amp;E). However, as you noted, there is a normalized tension deficit in tenotomized muscle (compared with sham) and it does not advance between weeks 2 and 8 despite notable changes in fiber structure during this timeframe (Fig 6E-H). We speculate that the loss of normalized tension happens early in tenotomy (it has been documented as early as day one) and is not fully recovered by the subsequent processes of healing. It is difficult to say whether some recovery of this initial mechanism occurs and is offset by the later development of structural pathology (e.g. fibrosis, fat infiltration, basophilic puncta etc.) or whether the degree of this later structural pathology is insufficient to drive additional measurable contractile changes. Future studies using targeted mouse models such as the lipodystrophic mouse (that does not develop fat infiltration) or pharmacologics that target accumulation of autophagic vesicles could shed some light on this question.</p><p>To clarify these connections for the reader we have added the following to the Results and Discussion sections:</p><p>Results:</p><p>“This suggests that normalizing contractile tension to PCSA fully accounts for the ongoing mass loss.”</p><p>Discussion:</p><p>“This suggests that the contractile deficit originated early in the tenotomy injury and never resolved during the subsequent process of healing. There is considerable evidence for myofibrillar disruption and fiber damage post tenotomy (reviewed in (Jamali <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000)), and it is possible that the tenotomized muscle cannot adequately repair this damage in its unloaded state. If this is the case, it also offers an explanation for why IKKβ knockdown did not affect the contractile deficits. However, it is difficult to say whether some recovery of this initial damage occurs and is offset by the later development of structural pathology (e.g. fibrosis, fat infiltration, basophilic puncta etc.) or whether the degree of this later structural pathology is insufficient to drive additional measurable contractile changes. Future studies using targeted mouse models such as the lipodystrophic mouse (that does not develop fat infiltration) or pharmacologics that target accumulation of autophagic vesicles could shed some light on this question.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) In Figure 6G the double arrows are very difficult to see.

We were unable to find another comparative atrophic signaling study that included tenotomy to support the Bialek study, but are happy to include one if you could point us to it.

We have expanded the Discussion in this area to include more detail on other pathways that could regulate atrophy independent of or in interaction with NFkb.</p><p>Discussion:</p><p>“It could also be because autophagy is only one piece of a more complex atrophic regulation. Notably, Foxo3 regulates autophagy/lysosomal and ubiquitin/proteasomal degradation (Mammucari <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007) and this master regulator was not assessed in detail here. Additionally, a number of E3 ubiquitin ligases other than <italic>Murf1</italic> and MAFbx regulate muscle atrophy (Ye <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007; Nagpal <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012; Hindi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014). Thus, it is possible that NFκB-driven atrophy was affected by IKKβ knockdown, but compensation by another atrophic pathway obscured the effects on muscle mass etc. The complex interplay between these pathways warrants further investigation.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1.

Original articles are cited alongside the review papers when appropriate, in particular the original research on the discovery of MAFbx and <italic>Murf1</italic> are highlighted (Bodine et al., 2001; Gomes et al., 2001). We decided to retain review references where we believe a review is the best citation (e.x. <italic>Jackman et al.</italic> for a more detailed summary with the pathway diagram requested by Reviewer 2, <italic>Paris-Moreno et al.</italic> and <italic>Laron et al.</italic> that make the statement our sentence was alluding to).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

In rotator cuff injury, whether you have denervation in SS and/or IS muscle makes a significant difference in severity and recovery. Authors should address this.</p></disp-quote><p>We completely agree and this is an excellent suggestion. We have clarified in the introduction and discussion that our model involves no denervation. We also note that this (1) isolates tenotomy-induced atrophy from denervation-induced atrophy, which is important because denervation-induced atrophy is mediated by NFkb and (2) is arguably more representative of human rotator cuff injury which does not consistently involve nerve damage.</p><p>Introduction:</p><p>“…tenotomy of the rotator cuff (RC) muscles (without suprascapular nerve injury)”</p><p>Discussion:</p><p>“Importantly, tenotomy alone does not involve any direct damage to the muscle or its innervation, avoiding confounding effects of denervation and extensive regeneration. While RC tenotomy is frequently paired with denervation to elicit more dramatic muscle pathology (particularly fatty infiltration), there is not strong evidence that nerve damage is a consistent feature of even massive RC tears in humans (Costouros <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. In the mature skeletal muscle, hyperplasia, and hypoplasia do not occur frequently. Data supporting these observations are lacking. For this to happen, strong activation of muscle stem cells is required.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree for hyperplasia. There is not compelling evidence that addition of myofibers happens even in the context of extensive hypertrophy and would absolutely require satellite cell participation. Along these lines, the evidence we present in this work does not support hyperplasia in response to tenotomy. While fibers with central nuclei are mildly increased at later stages of tenotomy-induced atrophy, we believe these to be the result of repair or regeneration events rather than hyperplasia.</p><p>However, our evidence does support hypoplasia. While myofiber count is a somewhat crude measurement, is has been used extensively to document hypoplasia in aging rodent and human muscle and associated with some myopathies. Though it hasn’t been directly demonstrated following tenotomy, there is strong evidence for myofiber degeneration and apoptosis in muscle from chronically torn human rotator cuffs (PMID 28145949).</p><p>To clarify our hypothesis that muscles are engaging in fiber repair (or locally regeneration) rather than hyperplasia, we have modified our discussion of centralized nuclei as follows:</p><p>Discussion:</p><p>“It is possible that both sexes experience some fiber degeneration (as has been noted in chronic human RC tears (Gibbons et al., 2017)), but males are more efficiently repairing the damaged fibers; this speculation would explain the sex-specificity in central nuclei, then the load borne by fewer fibers helps maintain fiber CSA.”</p><p>“Similarly, extensive regeneration does not appear to be a notable feature of RC tears in humans, where only ~10% of fibers exhibit central nucleation, compared with ~3% in controls (Gibbons <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017). In the mouse, we find no proliferation of satellite cells at W1 following tenotomy and only a minor (&lt;3%) increase in centrally nucleated fibers at later timepoints. This, combined with the lack of dilution of the NFkb knockdown at the gene and protein level, suggests that the genetically unmodified SCs are not contributing substantial additional myonuclei.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Authors should measure or at least discuss the role of satellite cells and stromal progenitors (FAPs) in injury response to rotator cuff tenotomy. The regenerative response and NFkB signaling will most likely affect muscle stem cells and niche cells more than mature fibers, especially in the week 2 time period. Accretion of satellite cell-derived myonuclei during regeneration will not have genetic modifications of NF-κB. A single muscle stem cell could give rise to hundreds of myonuclei, potentially diluting the effects. This is a major limitation of the current study.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this suggestion. Your point is well taken that satellite cells and FAPs are likely active in the early phases of tenotomy-induced atrophy and will not have IKKb knockdown. To determine whether the numbers of satellite cells and FAPs are altered by tenotomy and/or IKKb knockdown, we have quantified these cell populations via histology at week 1 and added this data to Figure 6.</p><p>Based on these data and consistent with our other data, we believe that the regenerative response following tenotomy is fairly limited. The direct injury of tenotomy is to the tendon and secondary injury to the myofibers upon retraction doesn’t appear to engage satellite cells in extensive regeneration. We base this conclusion primarily on our histological findings at week 1 which show no change in Px7+ myonuclei per fiber and less than 1% fibers as centrally nucleated (Figure 6F). Additional support for accretion of satellite cell derived nuclei being limited comes from our measures of IKKb gene and protein expression which are equivalent between sham and tenotomy (Figure 2A). To clarify this point for the reader, we have added the following text to the Discussion:</p><p>Discussion:</p><p>“Similarly, extensive regeneration does not appear to be a notable feature of RC tears in humans, where only ~10% of fibers exhibit central nucleation, compared with ~3% in controls (Gibbons <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017). In the mouse, we find no proliferation of satellite cells at W1 following tenotomy and only a minor (&lt;3%) increase in centrally nucleated fibers at later timepoints. This, combined with the lack of dilution of the NFkb knockdown at the gene and protein level, suggests that the genetically unmodified SCs are not contributing substantial additional myonuclei.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. It has been previously documented that NF-κB is not the only catabolic signal that activates ubiquitin-proteasome and lysosomal autophagy. Foxo3 can regulate both UPS and autophagy. Moreover, there are several E3 ligases other than MAFbx1 and Murf1 that play a role in muscle atrophy conditions.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree completely on this point. The fact that we see increased protein ubiquitination at week 1 post tenotomy that is unaffected by IKKb knockdown, supports this contention that there are other regulators. We have now added a more detailed discussion of these potential mediators.</p><p>Discussion:</p><p>“Notably, Foxo3 regulates autophagy/lysosomal and ubiquitin/proteasomal degradation (Zhao et al., 2007) and this master regulator was not assessed in detail here. Additionally, a number of E3 ubiquitin ligases other than <italic>Murf1</italic> and MAFbx regulate muscle atrophy (Ye <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007; Nagpal <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012; Hindi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014).
