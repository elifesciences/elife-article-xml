postnatal growth plate are characterized by slow cell cycle progression, and encompass a population of parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP)-expressing skeletal stem cells that contribute to the formation of columnar chondrocytes. However, how these chondrocytes are maintained in the resting zone remains undefined. We undertook a genetic pulse-chase approach to isolate slow cycling, label-retaining chondrocytes (LRCs) using a chondrocyte-specific doxycycline-controllable Tet-Off system regulating expression of histone 2B-linked GFP. Comparative RNA-seq analysis identified significant enrichment of inhibitors and activators for Wnt signaling in LRCs and non-LRCs, respectively. Activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in PTHrP<sup>+</sup> resting chondrocytes using <italic>Pthlh-creER</italic> and <italic>Apc</italic>-floxed allele impaired their ability to form columnar chondrocytes. Therefore, slow-cycling chondrocytes are maintained in a Wnt-inhibitory environment within the resting zone, unraveling a novel mechanism regulating maintenance and differentiation of PTHrP<sup>+</sup> skeletal stem cells of the postnatal growth plate.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>bone</kwd><kwd>growth plate</kwd><kwd>chondrocyte</kwd><kwd>cartilage</kwd><kwd>skeletal stem cells</kwd><kwd>wnt signaling</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000072</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01DE026666</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ono</surname><given-names>Noriaki</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000072</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01DE030630</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ono</surname><given-names>Noriaki</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000072</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01DE029181</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ono</surname><given-names>Wanida</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000062</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P01DE011794</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kronenberg</surname><given-names>Henry M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000072</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32DE007057</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hallett</surname><given-names>Shawn A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Slow-cycling chondrocytes are maintained in a Wnt-inhibitory environment within the resting zone, unraveling a novel mechanism regulating maintenance and differentiation of parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP)-expressing skeletal stem cells of the postnatal growth plate.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The epiphyseal growth plate, a disk of cartilaginous tissues with characteristic columns of chondrocytes formed between the primary and secondary ossification centers, is an innovation of amniotes (reptiles, birds and mammals) that facilitates explosive endochondral bone growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wuelling and Vortkamp, 2019</xref>). The postnatal growth plate is composed of three morphologically distinct layers of resting, proliferating and hypertrophic zones, in which chondrocytes continue to proliferate well into adulthood, especially in mice, therefore functioning as the engine for endochondral bone growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hallett et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kronenberg, 2003</xref>). By adulthood, a large majority of hypertrophic chondrocytes undergo apoptosis or transdifferentiate into osteoblasts, marking the completion of the longitudinal growth phase and skeletal maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zhou et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Park et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hallett et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Roach et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yang et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yang et al., 2014b</xref>).</p><p>Of the three layers, the resting zone has two important functions in maintaining the growth plate. First, early studies postulated that resting chondrocytes feed their daughter cells into the adjacent proliferating zone and contribute to longitudinal growth of postnatal endochondral bones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hunziker, 1994</xref>). More recently, the resting zone has been established as a niche for skeletal stem cells, initially demonstrated by surgical auto-transplantation experiments in rabbits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abad et al., 2002</xref>), and subsequently by lineage-tracing experiments in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mizuhashi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Newton et al., 2019</xref>). Second, chondrocytes in the resting zone express parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) that maintains proliferation of chondrocytes in a cell non-autonomous manner and delays their hypertrophic differentiation, thus sustaining longitudinal growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Schipani et al., 1997</xref>). Once resting chondrocytes exit their quiescent state, they undergo a morphological transformation into flat, columnar proliferating chondrocytes. The proliferating zone is concertedly maintained by PTHrP released from the resting zone and Indian hedgehog (Ihh) synthesized by pre-hypertrophic chondrocytes; the proliferating zone in turn provides instructive cues to regulate cell fates of PTHrP<sup>+</sup> chondrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mizuhashi et al., 2018</xref>). Therefore, the resting zone functions as a critical constituent of the tight feedback system (the PTHrP–Ihh feedback loop) that maintains growth plate structures and longitudinal bone growth.</p><p>The mechanisms regulating self-renewal and differentiation capabilities of resting zone chondrocytes remain largely unknown. G protein stimulatory subunit-α (G<sub>s</sub>α), G<sub>q</sub>/G<sub>11</sub>α G proteins, which are coupled with the PTH/PTHrP receptor (PPR), are both required for maintaining quiescent stem-like chondrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chagin et al., 2014</xref>). Pan-chondrocyte ablation of G<sub>s</sub>α (<italic>Col2a1-creER; Gnas<sup>f/f</sup></italic>) causes premature differentiation of stem-like resting chondrocytes into the proliferative pool, resulting in accelerated endochondral bone growth. Further, combined inactivation of G<sub>q</sub>/G<sub>11</sub>α through a mutant PPR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Guo et al., 2002</xref>) and G<sub>s</sub>α (<italic>Col2a1-creER, Gnas<sup>f/f</sup></italic>; PPR<sup>D/D</sup> [Pth1r<sup>tm4Hmk</sup>]) causes a more severe phenotype associated with growth plate fusion. Therefore, PPR-mediated G<sub>s</sub>α and G<sub>q</sub>/G<sub>11</sub>α synergistically maintain quiescence of resting chondrocytes and their differentiation into columnar chondrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chagin et al., 2014</xref>); however, whether this regulation occurs cell-autonomously in resting chondrocytes has not been determined.</p><p>Non-canonical Wnt/planar cell polarity (PCP) signaling plays a key role in facilitating asymmetric divisions of resting chondrocytes. Oriented division, rearrangement and intercalation of chondrocyte clones in the resting zone, and their subsequent asymmetric divisions into their daughter cells aligned with the axis of growth are the hallmark characteristic of growth plate chondrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Li et al., 2017a</xref>). Non-canonical Wnt/PCP signaling is activated when the chondrocytes exit the resting zone and start forming columns, guiding the oriented cell division of resting chondrocytes into proliferating cells and their further expansion. In fact, misregulation of non-canonical Wnt/PCP signaling via dominant-negative forms of Frizzled receptors results in severe shortening of the growth plate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hartmann and Tabin, 2000</xref>). Oriented cell division is sensitive to both high and low PCP activity mediated in part by Fzd7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Li and Dudley, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Li et al., 2017b</xref>). In addition, Wnt5a signals to establish PCP in chondrocytes along the proximal-distal axis through regulation of Vangl2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gao et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Randall et al., 2012</xref>). However, how resting chondrocytes are regulated by non-canonical Wnt/PCP signaling members, such as Rspo3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ohkawara et al., 2011</xref>) in addition to Dkk2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Niehrs, 2006</xref>) and Fzd receptors, are unknown.</p><p>Given the limited amount of mechanistic knowledge regarding maintenance and differentiation of resting chondrocytes, we set out to undertake an unbiased approach to better define the molecular mechanisms regulating maintenance and differentiation of chondrocytes in the resting zone (‘slow-cycling chondrocytes’). To achieve this goal, we developed a chondrocyte-specific genetic label-retention strategy to isolate slow-cycling chondrocytes from the postnatal growth plate. Our comparative transcriptomic analysis revealed unique molecular signatures defining the characteristics of slow-cycling chondrocytes, with particular enrichment for inhibitors of Wnt signaling pathways. Subsequent functional validation based on a cell-lineage analysis identified that, when Wnt/β-catenin signaling was activated, PTHrP<sup>+</sup> resting chondrocytes were decreased in number during initial formation and established columnar chondrocytes less effectively in the subsequent stages. These data lead to a new concept that PTHrP<sup>+</sup> skeletal stem cells may be maintained in a Wnt inhibitory environment within the resting zone niche of the postnatal growth plate.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A genetic label-retention strategy to identify slow-cycling chondrocytes</title><p>Chondrocytes in the resting zone of the postnatal growth plate (‘resting’ or ‘reserve’ chondrocytes) are characterized by their slow cell cycle progression that is much slower than that of chondrocytes in the proliferating zone. As a result, these slow-cycling chondrocytes retain nuclear labels much longer than their more rapidly dividing progeny in the proliferating zone, which are therefore termed as label-retaining chondrocytes (LRCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Walker and Kember, 1972</xref>). First, we undertook a genetic approach to fluorescently isolate LRCs from the growth plate based on a chondrocyte-specific pulse-chase protocol. To this end, we first generated transgenic mice expressing a tetracycline-controlled transactivator under a <italic>Col2a1</italic> promoter (hereafter, Col2a1-tTA), and combined this line with a <italic>Col1a1</italic> locus harboring a Tet-responsive element (TRE)-histone 2B-bound EGFP (H2B-EGFP) cassette (hereafter, TRE-H2B-EGFP) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1a</xref>). In this Tet-Off system, tTA binds to TRE in the absence of doxycycline and activates H2B-EGFP transcription (pulse), whereas tTA dissociates from TRE in the presence of doxycycline, shutting off H2B-EGFP transcription (chase) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1a</xref>). In Col2a1-tTA; TRE-H2B-EGFP mice, <italic>Col2a1<sup>+</sup></italic> chondrocytes accumulate H2B-EGFP in the nucleus without doxycycline, and upon initiation of doxycycline feeding, de novo transcription of <italic>H2B (human H2B [HIST1H2BJ])-EGFP</italic> mRNA becomes suppressed. After a long chase period, H2B-EGFP is preferentially diluted in highly proliferating cells and their progeny, whereas slow-cycling cells retain a high level of the label, marking them as LRCs.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>A genetic label-retention strategy to identify slow-cycling chondrocytes.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Chondrocyte-specific Tet-Off system by <italic>Col2a1-tTA</italic> and <italic>TRE-H2B-EGFP</italic> transgenes.

However, we also noticed that a low level of H2B-EGFP signal persisted in adjacent osteoblasts and osteocytes in the epiphysis even after the chase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1e</xref>, arrows), making it difficult to distinguish LRCs from these cells. Analysis of TRE-H2B-EGFP/+ mice without a Col2a1-tTA transgene at P28 revealed that osteoblasts and osteocytes expressed a low level of H2B-EGFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1f</xref>, arrows). These findings indicate that LRCs can be identified within the top of the growth plate by a chondrocyte-specific Tet-Off system regulating H2B-EGFP expression, although these cells cannot be easily distinguished from adjacent osteoblasts and osteocytes solely based on fluorescent intensity in histological sections.</p><p>Next, to more rigorously define LRCs and non-LRCs in the postnatal growth plate, we quantified the intensity of H2B-EGFP signal through the entire column of chondrocytes using the corrected total cell fluorescence (CTCF) after two weeks of chase at P35 in double homozygous Col2a1-tTA/Col2a1-tTA; TRE-H2B-GFP/TRE-H2B-EGFP mice. We labeled actively proliferating chondrocytes by pulsing these mice with a thymidine analogue EdU twice at 6 and 3 hr prior to sacrifice. By this approach, we expect to visualize an EdU-positive cell in the proliferating zone that is descended from an EdU-negative cell in the resting zone through one cell division (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>, left panel, arrowheads and bracket). The quantification of CTCF values through the entire column revealed that the cells in the proliferating zone (PZ) had weaker H2B-EGFP signal than those of the resting zone (RZ), and the cells in the pre-hypertrophic (PHZ) and hypertrophic zones (HZ) had yet weaker H2B-EGFP signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>, center panel, yellow numbers, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). The side-by-side comparison of CTCF values between EdU<sup>+</sup> cells in the proliferating zone and their preceding EdU-negative cells in the resting zone further revealed that H2B-EGFP CTCF values decreased significantly upon one cell division (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata2">Figure 1—source data 2</xref>, P35: H2B-EGFP CTCF, EdU<sup>-</sup> cells in RZ = 267,184.6±109,457.8; EdU<sup>+</sup> cells in PZ = 131,892.0±83,344.8, <italic>n</italic>=four mice, 24 cell-pairs [<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.0001]). The average fold change between EdU-negative and EdU-positive cells was 2.03, suggesting that H2B-EGFP intensity decreases by a factor of two following one cell division (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b,c</xref>), as expected from the fact that histone-bound GFP is distributed equally between the two daughter cells upon cell division. Further, the cells with the top 10% brightness were localized to RZ at the top of the growth plate; while there were 27 cells in this given column of chondrocytes, the three brightest cells (374,012; 343,652; 264,697) were localized to RZ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>, center panel, arrowheads). Thus, based on these quantitative histological data, we designated the cells with the top 10% brightness as LRCs.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Col2-Q system: a double-color quadruple transgenic strategy to identify LRCs in the growth plate</title><p>To circumvent the technical issues associated with the leakiness of H2B-EGFP in non-chondrocytes, we further included a <italic>Col2a1-creER</italic> transgene that activates an <italic>R26R-tdTomato</italic> reporter in a tamoxifen-dependent manner, as a means to specifically mark growth plate chondrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nagao et al., 2016</xref>).

This short protocol of tamoxifen injection marked a great number of chondrocytes in the growth plate, but a much fewer number of cells in the articular cartilage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>), indicating that this double-color strategy can effectively identify H2B-EGFP<sup>high</sup>growth plate chondrocytes at this stage. Second, Col2-Q mice were fed with doxycycline from P21 to shut off new H2B-EGFP synthesis for 4 weeks (chase) and were then treated with the short protocol of tamoxifen injection After the chase, LRCs were identified at a specific location near the top of the growth plate in the resting zone, retaining a higher level of H2B-EGFP signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>, left panel).

Chondrocytes on the superficial zone of the articular surface are morphologically similar with those at the resting zone of the growth plate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Li et al., 2017a</xref>). First, we assessed <italic>Prg4</italic> mRNA expressions in the growth plate and the articular cartilage using RNAscope fluorescent in situ hybridization analysis.

Therefore, chondrocytes of the resting zone of the postnatal growth plate express <italic>Prg4</italic> at a low level, supporting the validity of our comparative RNA-seq analysis.

Analysis of <italic>Gas1-LacZ</italic> knock-in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Martinelli and Fan, 2007</xref>) at P14 revealed that Gas1<sup>+</sup> cells were exclusively found at the top of the growth plate corresponding to the resting zone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>).

We suspect that this result reflects the reduction of PTHrP-creER<sup>+</sup> cells in the resting zone in the preceding stages, although we cannot rule out direct effects of APC haploinsufficiency in the proliferating zone as well. Although we observed significant decreases in columnar chondrocyte formation in APC cHet growth plates, column morphology and organization at P21, P36 and P96 in mutants appear similar compared to Controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>, left, middle, and right panels).</p><p>PTHrP<sup>+</sup> resting chondrocytes continue to generate long columns (more than 10 cells/column) of tdTomato<sup>+</sup> chondrocytes in the long term, the number of which gradually decreases until six months and reaches a plateau thereafter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mizuhashi et al., 2018</xref>).

To date, our understanding of the molecular regulators of this special subclass of chondrocytes is largely grounded in histological and immunohistochemical observations and extrapolations from conditional gene ablation studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hallett et al., 2019</xref>). To address this gap in knowledge, we established a quadruple transgenic murine reporter model, ‘Col2-Q’ system, to genetically label slow-cycling chondrocytes in an unbiased manner using a pulse-chase approach based on a chondrocyte-specific doxycycline-controllable Tet-Off system regulating expression of histone 2B-linked GFP. We successfully isolated and defined the identities of label-retaining chondrocytes (LRCs) and their proliferating counterparts (non-LRCs), based on combinatorial histological and flow cytometry analyses using a proliferation marker EdU, in order to profile the transcriptome of these cells. As the resting zone of the growth plate is considered to represent a resident stem-cell niche (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abad et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mizuhashi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Newton et al., 2019</xref>), our experiments serve as an approach to interrogate the fundamental characteristics of one of the stem-like cells residing in the postnatal growth plate.</p><p>It is unclear how slow-cycling chondrocytes in the resting zone maintain low mitotic capabilities while differentiating into columnar chondrocytes in the proliferating zone. Using a comparative bulk RNA-seq transcriptomic analysis, we discovered that LRCs are enriched for a unique set of genes associated with hallmark (e.g. <italic>Pthlh</italic> and <italic>Sfrp5</italic>) and novel (e.g. <italic>Gas1</italic>, <italic>Spon1</italic>, and <italic>Wif1</italic>) markers for resting chondrocytes, in addition to Wnt inhibitory molecules (e.g. <italic>Sfrp1</italic>, <italic>Dkk2</italic>, <italic>Notum</italic>, and <italic>Fzd6</italic>). Interestingly, however, we found that <italic>Wnt7b</italic>, a Wnt activator, is enriched in LRCs. Wnt7b is expressed by perichondral cells adjacent to the hypertrophic zone and simulates differentiation of osteoblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Joeng and Long, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Song et al., 2020</xref>) and chondrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, LRCs may be maintained in a delicate balance between Wnt inhibitors and activators. Conversely, non-LRCs were enriched for markers of pre-hypertrophic (e.g. <italic>Ihh</italic>) and hypertrophic (e.g. <italic>Col10a1</italic>) chondrocytes, and represent differentially expressed genes commonly associated with metabolically active cellular processes, such as oxidative phosphorylation. We further validated the expression of <italic>Pthlh</italic>, which is a hallmark marker for resting chondrocytes, and <italic>Gas1</italic>, a novel marker, using <italic>Pthlh-LacZ</italic> and <italic>Gas1-LacZ</italic> knock-in reporter alleles, respectively. We found that PTHrP<italic><sup>+</sup></italic> chondrocytes in the resting zone maintain low levels of mitotic activity, indicated by EdU labeling and pulse-chase experiments. Thus, the genes identified by our comparative transcriptomic analysis appear to represent accurate transcriptomic features of distinct populations of slow-cycling versus differentiating chondrocytes in the postnatal growth plate. Future investigations aimed at assessing the roles of novel marker genes may lead to the identification of novel skeletal stem cell populations that are important for the postnatal growth plate.</p><p>Wnt/β-catenin signaling is essential for endochondral ossification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Regard et al., 2012</xref>), and is shown to regulate initiation of chondrocyte hypertrophy by inhibiting PTHrP signaling activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Guo et al., 2009</xref>). Moreover, Wnt/β-catenin signaling is essential during skeletal development for regulating mesenchymal progenitor differentiation in favor of osteoblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Day et al., 2005</xref>), or for preventing transdifferentiation of osteoblast precursors into chondrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hill et al., 2005</xref>). In order to determine the functional contribution of Wnt signaling to PTHrP<sup>+</sup> resting chondrocyte skeletal stem cells and their differentiation, one copy of <italic>adenomatous polyposis coli</italic> (<italic>Apc</italic>), a critical signaling component of the β-catenin degradation complex, was selectively ablated using a resting chondrocyte-specific <italic>Pthlh-creER</italic> line. In the resting zone, Apc haploinsufficiency led to increased β-catenin protein expression specifically in the resting zone including in PTHrP<sup>+</sup> chondrocytes, and slightly decreased formation and expansion of PTHrP<sup>+</sup> chondrocytes, reducing differentiation capabilities of these cells into columnar chondrocytes in the proliferating zone. It is important to note that the effect of β-catenin stabilization in PTHrP<sup>+</sup> chondrocytes appears to be modest. Lines of studies demonstrate that non-canonical Wnt/planar cell polarity (PCP) signaling plays a key role in facilitating asymmetric divisions of resting chondrocytes. Therefore, our findings support the notion that canonical and non-canonical Wnt signaling pathways concertedly modulate PTHrP<sup>+</sup> chondrocytes in the resting zone and regulate their differentiation.</p><p>Taken together, our data support a novel paradigm that slow-cycling PTHrP<sup>+</sup> chondrocytes are maintained in a Wnt-inhibitory environment within the resting zone of the

All procedures were conducted in compliance with the Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals approved by the University Michigan’s Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC), protocol 7681 and 9496. All mice were housed in a specific pathogen-free condition, and analyzed in a mixed background. Mice were identified by micro-tattooing or ear tags. Tail biopsies of mice were lysed by a HotShot protocol (incubating the tail sample at 95°C for 30 min in an alkaline lysis reagent followed by neutralization) and used for GoTaq Green Master Mix PCR-based genotyping (Promega, and Nexus X2, Madison, WI).

Dissected epiphyses were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at 4°C, followed by overnight X-gal staining at 37°C. Stained samples were further postfixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, overnight at 4°C, then decalcified in 15% EDTA for 7 days. Decalcified samples were cryoprotected in 30% sucrose/PBS followed by 30% sucrose/PBS:OCT (1:1) solution, each overnight at 4°C.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Histology</title><p>Bilateral femurs were dissected under a stereomicroscope (Nikon SMZ-800, Tokyo, Japan) to remove soft tissues, and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for a proper period, typically ranging from 3 hr to overnight at 4°C, then decalcified in 15% EDTA for a proper period, typically ranging from 0 hr to 14 days. Decalcified samples were cryoprotected in 30% sucrose/PBS solutions and then in 30% sucrose/PBS:OCT (1:1) solutions, each at least overnight at 4°C. Samples were embedded in an OCT compound (Tissue-Tek, Sakura, Torrance, CA) under a stereomicroscope and transferred on a sheet of dry ice to solidify the compound. Embedded samples were cryosectioned at 14–50 µm using a cryostat (Leica CM1850, Wetzlar, Germany) and adhered to positively charged glass slides (Fisherbrand ColorFrost Plus). Cryosections were stored at −20°C (quantification) or –80°C (immunofluorescence) in freezers until use. Sections were postfixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature. For functional conditional knockout experiments, 50 µm serial sections were collected through the entire growth plate. For immunofluorescence experiments, epiphyses were popped out of bilateral femurs, processed for 24 hr in 4% paraformaldehyde and sectioned at 14 µm. Sections were incubated with anti-β-catenin primary antibody (Abcam ab16051, Cambridge, UK) overnight at 4°C and further stained with 1:200 Alexa Fluor 633 Goat anti-Rabbit IgG (H+L) Secondary Antibody (Invitrogen A21071) at a 20°C for 3 hr. Sections were further incubated with DAPI (4’,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, 5 µg/ml, Invitrogen D1306) to stain nuclei prior to imaging. For EdU assay, sections were incubated with Alexa Fluor 488-azide (<italic>Pthlh-LacZ</italic>, Invitrogen A10266) or Alexa Fluor 647-azide (Col2-Q, Invitrogen A10277) for 30 min at 43°C using Click-iT Imaging Kit (Invitrogen C10337).

The filter settings used were: FL Filter Set 34 (Ex. 390/22, Em. 460/50 nm), Set 38 HE (Ex. 470/40, Em. 525/50 nm), Set 43 HE (Ex. 550/25, Em. 605/70 nm), Set 50 (Ex. 640/30, Em. 690/50 nm) and Set 63 HE (Ex. 572/25, Em. 629/62 nm). The objectives used were: Fluar 2.5x/0.12, EC Plan-Neofluar 5x/0.16, Plan-Apochromat 10x/0.45, EC Plan-Neofluar 20x/0.50, EC Plan-Neofluar 40x/0.75, Plan-Apochromat 63x/1.40. Images were typically tile-scanned with a motorized stage, Z-stacked and reconstructed by a maximum intensity projection (MIP) function. Differential interference contrast (DIC) was used for objectives higher than 10x. Some of the images were captured by a fluorescence microscope (Nikon Eclipse E800) with prefigured triple-band filter settings for DAPI/FITC/TRITC, and merged with Spot Advanced Software (Spot Imaging, Sterling Heights, MI). Confocal images were acquired using LSM510 and Zen2009 software (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) with lasers and corresponding band-pass filters for DAPI (Ex.405nm, BP420-480), GFP (Ex.488nm, BP505-530) and tdTomato (Ex.543nm, BP565-595). LSM Image Viewer and Adobe Photoshop software were used to capture and align images. The number of tdTomato<sup>+</sup> cells, β-Catenin intensity and CTCF values of H2B-GFP were counted by two individuals manually or using ImageJ image analysis software by single blinded methods to ensure unbiased data interpretation.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Growth plate cell preparation</title><p>Distal epiphyses of femurs and proximal epiphyses of tibias were manually dislodged using dull scissors, and attached soft tissues and woven bones were carefully removed using a cuticle nipper. Cells were dissociated from dissected epiphyses using five serial rounds of collagenase digestion, incubating with 2 Wunsch units of Liberase TM (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) in 2 ml Ca<sup>2+</sup>, Mg<sup>2+</sup>-free Hank’s Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS, Sigma H6648) at 37°C for 30 min. each time on a shaking incubator (ThermomixerR, Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany). Single--cell suspension was generated using an 18-gauge needle and a 1 ml Luer-Lok syringe (BD), and filtered through a 70 µm cell strainer (BD) into a 50-ml tube on ice.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Flow cytometry</title><p>Dissociated cells were stained by standard protocols with allophycocyanin (APC)-conjugated anti-mouse CD45 (30 F-11) antibodies (1:500, eBioscience, San Diego, CA).

Acquired raw data were further analyzed on FlowJo software (TreeStar). Representative plots of at least three independent biological samples are shown in the figures.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) and RNA isolation</title><p>Cell sorting was performed using a five-laser BD FACS Aria III (Ex.355/407/488/532/633 nm) and FACSDiva. CD45<sup>neg</sup>GFP<sup>high</sup> cells at the top 10 percentile of GFP brightness (LRCs) and CD45<sup>neg</sup>GFP<sup>mid-low</sup> cells with 10~50 percentile of GFP brightness (non-LRCs) were directly sorted into TRIzol LS Reagent (ThermoFisher 10296010, Waltham, MA). Total RNA was isolated using NucleoSpin RNA XS (Macherey-Nagel, 740902). RNA Integrity Number (RIN) was assessed by Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer RNA 6000 Pico Kit. Samples with RIN&gt;8.0 were used for subsequent analyses.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>RNA amplification and deep sequencing</title><p>Complementary DNAs were prepared by SMART-Seq v4 Ultra Low Input RNA Kit for Sequencing (Takara 634888) using 150~800 pg of total RNA. Post-amplification quality control was performed by Agilent TapeStation DNA High Sensitivity D1000 Screen Tape system. DNA libraries were prepared by Nextera XT DNA Library Preparation Kit (Illumina) and submitted for deep sequencing (Illumina HiSeq 2500).</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>RNA-seq analysis</title><p>cDNA libraries were sequenced using following conditions; six samples per lane, 50 cycle single end read. Reads files were downloaded and concatenated into a single. fastq file for each sample. The quality of the raw reads data for each sample was checked using FastQC to identify quality problems. Tuxedo Suite software package was subsequently used for alignment (using TopHat and Bowtie2), differential expression analysis, and post-analysis diagnostics. FastQC was used for a second round of quality control (post-alignment). HTSeq/DESeq2 was run using UCSC mm10.fa as the reference genome sequence. Expression quantitation was performed with HTSeq, to count non-ambiguously mapped reads only. HTSeq counts per gene were then used in a custom DESeq2 paired analysis. Normalization and differential expression were performed with DESeq2, using a negative binomial generalized linear model, including a term for mouse of origin for a paired analysis. Plots were generated using variations or alternative representations of native DESeq2 plotting functions, ggplot2, plotly, and other packages within the R environment. Heatmaps were generated with updated rlog normalized count values for each sample for all plus top sets (500) of differentially expressed genes with the gplots package (v 3.0.1). Two types of clustering were used: (1) averaging across rows with Pearson correlation distance with average linkage and (2) Ward’s squared dissimilarity criterion. Top differentially expressed genes were determined after ranking genes by standard deviation across all samples. Independent of iPathway, GO term enrichment was performed on DE results, with a logFC threshold of 2 and adjusted p-value &lt; 0.05 with the GOseq package (v 1.36) with probability weighting function and GO enrichment specified with mm10 as genome and gene symbol specified as gene ID format. Results were plotted for the top ten of selected terms related to the Wnt pathways, ranked by overrepresented p-value using ggplot2 (v 3.2.1). KEGG results with FDR correction and gene tables for Wnt signaling pathway were downloaded from iPathway (report ID: 41865). KEGG gene tables for each pathway were used to subset the DE results before restricting results to genes for which both log fold change and adjusted p-value statistics were available.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Replicates</title><p>All experiments were performed in biological replicates. For all data presented in the manuscript, we examined at least three independent biological samples (three different mice) to ensure the reproducibility. Biological replicates were defined as multiple experimental samples sharing common genotypes and genetic backgrounds. For each series of the experiments, all attempts at biological replication were successful. Technical replicates were generated from a single experimental sample. For example, serial sections of the femur growth plate from a single mouse were considered technical replicates. Outliers were uncommon in our datasets and did not impact the trend and the significance of our quantitated results. As a result, all quantitative data were included to ensure transparency in our data interpretation.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Results are presented as mean values ± s.d. Statistical evaluation was conducted based on Mann-Whitney's <italic>U</italic>-test. A p value &lt;0.05 was considered significant. No statistical method was used to predetermine sample size. Sample size was determined on the basis of previous literature and our previous experience to give sufficient standard deviations of the mean so as not to miss a biologically important difference between groups. The experiments were not randomized. All the available mice of the desired genotypes were used for experiments. The investigators were not blinded during experiments and outcome assessment. One femur from each mouse was arbitrarily chosen for histological analysis. Genotypes were not particularly highlighted during quantification.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This research was supported by grants from National Institute of Health (R01DE026666 and R01DE030630 to NO, R01DE029181 to WO, P01DK011794 to HMK and T32DE007057 to SAH). We thank H Hock for <italic>TRE-H2B-EGFP</italic> mice and B Allen for <italic>Gas1-LacZ</italic> mice. We acknowledge support from the Bioinformatics Core of the University of Michigan Medical School’s Biomedical Research Core Facilities.</p></ack><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Writing - original draft, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Data curation, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Visualization</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Data curation, Investigation, Visualization</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Data curation, Visualization, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Visualization</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Data curation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Project administration, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con11"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Data curation, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing - original draft, Project administration, Writing - review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Animal experimentation: All procedures were conducted in compliance with the Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals approved by the University Michigan's Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC), protocol 7681 and 9496.</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec id="s6" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>Normalized expression count values of label-retaining chondrocytes (LRCs) and non-LRCs.</title><p>Comparative RNA-seq analysis of LRCs and non-LRCs, rlog normalized count values for each biological sample of LRCs (High1_50032, High2_53561, High3_53563) and non-LRCs (Low1_50033, Low2_53562, Low3_53564).

There remains a great deal not known about how the cells of the resting zone are maintained and what signals differentiation of these slow dividing cells. In this exceedingly innovative study, the authors elegantly use a complex set of genetic alleles in mice to label and trace maturation of these cells and to elucidate the molecular mechanisms that maintain their stem cell properties/microenvironment. They couple this work with single cell RNA seq and determine that canonical WNT signaling plays role in the maintenance and differentiation of the resting zone chondrocytes. The two major weaknesses are that questions remain for whether their approach can truly mark only the LRCs (as they call them), and the fact that WNT signaling inhibition being important in the resting zone is not entirely novel. The reviewers were all very enthusiastic about this brilliantly conducted study and strongly felt that these weaknesses could be overcome in a reasonable time frame.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. Line 59-60: The authors stated that &quot;mechanisms regulating self-renewal and differentiation capabilities of resting zone chondrocytes remain largely unknown.&quot; That is not entirely true. Published in vivo evidence suggests that Gsa abd Gq/11a signaling contributes to the maintenance of resting cells (Chagin, 2014 Nat Commun). Please consider the strengths and weaknesses of this prior work in the intro of this paper.</p><p>2. The authors used an interesting approach of combining the Col2-tTA TRE-H2B-GFP and the Col2-creER R26-Tomato lines. The reviewers were curious as to why the Col2-creER R26-Tomato did not label the chondrocytes in the articular cartilage as these cells also express Col2a1. Would not some (even though not a great deal) of the articular chondrocytes will also have a green nuclei and a red cytoplasm as a result?</p><p>3. Line 146-148: The authors stated that &quot;…more rapidly dividing and morphologically distinct columnar chondrocytes were not marked by H2B-EGFP signal. Therefore, our Col2-Q quadruple transgenic strategy can effectively mark LRCs primarily in the resting zone of the postnatal growth plate.&quot; But as can be seen in figure 1e, it's not true that the divided cells do not have H2B-GFP. The cells right below the resting zone, which have presumably divided once, have slightly weakened H2B-GFP (showing a yellow nuclei) and the cell below it have yet weaker H2B-GFP. Judging by that figure 1e alone, it seems the H2B-GFP will mark the LRC and then to a certain extent the few cells right below. At the very least, figure 1c and 2b seem somewhat misleading. While choosing the top 10% brightness is somewhat common when isolating high GFP cells, in this specific study, there is more that needs to be taken into account. It is not clear how the authors can know for sure that the GFP high cells they are identifying as LRCs do not also contain cells right below the resting zone that have undergone 1 division or maybe even 2 divisions. More information is needed to clarify what cells are being isolated by flow and the reviewers agreed that a proliferation marker could be helpful in this context. As can be seen in figure 1 and 2 (like figure 2a), the cut off for LRCs vs non-LRCs is at best arbitrary.</p><p>4. Line 157-158: The authors stated that &quot;Five rounds of digestion completely liberated cells from the growth plate, while cells on the articular surface were almost undigested&quot; and this statement is supported by the image in Figure 1f. It is unclear why or if collagenase digestion cannot or did not liberate the articular chondrocytes. On close examination, the appearance (focus on the shape of the edge) of the articular cartilage also changed after digestion (even though judging from the SOC those two are probably not the same section). I suspect that some cells in the superficial zone of the articular surface might also have come off and if those cells would be included in downstream experiments like RNA-Seq. Although it looks from figure 1d that the articular cartilage is not labeled either red or green, but the superficial zone of the articular cartilage possesses cells that are quite similar to the resting zone (see for example Li, FASEB J. 2017) and, at least in theory, are those kinds of cells would retain the GFP-H2B. Interestingly, the most differentially expressed gene in RNA-Seq is Prg4, a well-known superficial zone marker but largely undetected in the resting zone (see Lui, 2015 Ped Res).</p><p>5. Line 169-171: the authors stated &quot;Therefore, these findings demonstrate that LRCs can be effectively identified and isolated from postnatal Col2-Q growth plates by combined microdissection, enzymatic digestion and flow cytometry-based approaches&quot;. It appears what the authors are showing is that chasing by dox removal, over time, is effective in removing GFP signaling in the digested cell population. However, whether the LRCs can be effectively identified and isolated depends on how much GFP-H2B signal diminishes after 1 (or more) cell division and perhaps other factors. Please address this issue.</p><p>6. The efforts by the authors to identify and isolate the LRCs population and to perform RNA-Seq to assist with this effort were appreciated by the reviewers. The impact of technical factors (dissection, digestion, label, flow cytometry, etc) and the generalized handling of the cells could potentially affect the fidelity of gene expression study. This is not a situation unique to this study. How long after the growth plate was taken until the RNA were eventually isolated from the cells? What measures where taken to control for or account for these possible technical sources of artifactual signals?</p><p>7. In their RNA-Seq experiment, the authors defined non-LRCs as the &quot;GFP mid-low cells&quot;. What cells are these in terms of histological position in the growth plate? Are these mostly proliferative chondrocytes or includes the entirety of the PZ-PHZ-HZ cells? The expression profile seems to indicate these could a bit of everything (high in ColX, Ihh, Dlx5, etc). It would have been even more interesting if the non-LRCs are the direct progenies of the LRCs (like the one cell that just exited the resting zone).</p><p>8. In figure 3, the authors again utilized a nice combination of mouse models to test how canonical WNT signaling affects resting chondrocytes. Based on the results from figure 3d-g, it seems the effect is quite subtle, which is slightly disappointing. The conclusions from this find are described in an over zealous manner and should be tempered (e.g. &quot;slightly impaired&quot; in line 262).</p><p>9. The fact that the authors identified genes like Rspo3, Sfrp5, and Dkk2, suggests WNT signaling but does not automatically mean canonical wnt/catenin signaling. There is a reasonable amount of literature connecting these WNT modulators to other non-canonical WNT, such as the PCP WNT pathway (e.g. Ohkawara, 2011 Dev Cell). In particular, PCP WNT pathway have been implicated in resting zone chondrocyte transition to the proliferative zone (e.g. Andrew Dudley's work in 2009 Development, Tracy Ballock's work in 2012 J Orth Res, and more recently Li, 2017 in <italic>eLife</italic>). It is understood that PCP WNT signaling is activated when the chondrocytes exit the resting zone and start forming columns, thus it is not surprising at all that a lot of WNT modulator/inhibitors are highly expressed in the resting zone. The statement in line 330 &quot;no previous report ties WNT signaling to the maintenance of putative skeletal stem cell populations in the resting zone of the growth plate&quot; is erroneous. While the authors have advanced the field (particularly testing how activating canonical wnt might impact resting zone in figure 3), it is not appropriate to ignore or downplay the prior literature in this area.</p><p>10. Figure 3d and lines 245 to 248: The image is unlikely enough to support their claim that b-catenin protein is upregulated in PTHrP-CE; APC-het. The authors are encouraged to show quantitative data for the claim.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.64513.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Summary:</p><p>The resting zone of the epiphyseal growth plate plays a critical role in maintaining the growth plate.

Pan-chondrocyte ablation of G<sub>s</sub>α (Col2a1-creER; Gnas<sup>f/f</sup>) causes premature differentiation of stem-like resting chondrocytes into the proliferative pool, resulting in accelerated endochondral bone growth. Further, combined inactivation of G<sub>q</sub>/G<sub>11</sub>α through a mutant PPR (Guo et al., 2002) and G<sub>s</sub>α (Col2a1-creER, Gnas<sup>f/f</sup>; PPR<sup>D/D</sup>) causes a more severe phenotype associated with growth plate fusion. Therefore, PPR-mediated G<sub>s</sub>α and G<sub>q</sub>/G<sub>11</sub>α synergistically maintain quiescence of resting chondrocytes and their differentiation into columnar chondrocytes (Chagin et al., 2014); however, whether this regulation occurs cell-autonomously in resting chondrocytes has not been determined.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

As demonstrated in the new Figure 5 —figure supplement 2, and as the reviewers pointed out, <italic>Col2a1</italic> mRNA is indeed expressed by chondrocytes in the articular cartilage, both at P21 and 7 weeks of age, although its expression level dwindles in the later stage.</p><p>However, interestingly, <italic>Col2a1-creER</italic> does not appear to mark chondrocytes in the articular cartilage in adulthood. This point has been previously reported by Nagao et al., where the authors discovered that the labeling of articular chondrocytes by <italic>Col2a1-creER</italic> dwindles during the postnatal period. Tamoxifen administration into <italic>Col2a1-creER; R26R<sup>tdTomato</sup></italic> mice at P14, P21, P28 and P56 results in 90.8%, 46.0%, 22.2% and little to no tdTomato<sup>+</sup> cells, respectively, in the articular surface. We think that our findings that <italic>Col2a1-creER</italic> does not mark articular chondrocytes are in line with this previous report.</p><p>To further address the reviewers’ concerns, we counted the number of Col2a1<sup>CE</sup>-tdTomato<sup>+</sup> cells in the growth plate and the articular cartilage using serial sections. As shown in new Figure 3b, <italic>Col2a1-creER</italic> marked a far greater number of chondrocytes in the growth plate than in the articular cartilage at P49. Further, as shown in new Figure 2e, left, we observed a number of H2B-GFP<sup>high</sup> chondrocytes in the articular cartilage, but essentially none of these cells were also labeled with Col2a1<sup>CE</sup>-tdTomato.</p><p>Therefore, the use of a <italic>Col2a1-creER</italic> transgenic line allows us to almost specifically label growth plate chondrocytes, when recombination is induced at postnatal stages (~7 weeks of age).</p><p>The following sentences have been added to the Results:</p><p>“A great majority of cells in the epiphysis, including those in the growth plate and the secondary ossification center, but not as many on the articular surface, were H2B-EGFP<sup>high</sup> (Figure 2d, cells with green nuclei, Figure 2e, left).”</p><p>The following section has been added to the Results:</p><p>“First, we quantified Col2a1<sup>CE</sup>-tdT<sup>+</sup> cells at P49 with tamoxifen injection at 2 and 3 days prior to dissection. Importantly, we observed a significantly fewer number of Col2a1<sup>CE</sup>-tdT<sup>+</sup> chondrocytes in the articular surface compared to those in the growth plate at P49 (Figure 3a,b; GP=1,315.0±171.2 cells; AC=79.1±50.3 cells, n=9 mice [p&lt;0.0001]), consistent with the previous finding that Col2a1-creER preferentially marks growth plate chondrocytes in adulthood (Nagao et al., 2016). Therefore, our short-chase tamoxifen protocol with Col2a1-creER enables preferential labeling of growth plate chondrocytes in adulthood.”</p><p>The following section has been added to the Results:</p><p>“We further sought to determine whether collagenase digestion enables the preferential isolation of growth plate chondrocytes. To this end, we quantified Col2a1<sup>CE</sup>-tdT<sup>+</sup> cells in the growth plate and articular surface before and after collagenase digestion at P49 (Figure 3b). We found a significant reduction in Col2a1<sup>CE</sup>-tdT<sup>+</sup> chondrocytes in the growth plate after collagenase digestion (Before: GP=1,315.0±171.2, After: GP=49.8±45.2, n=9 [before], n=4 [after] mice [p=0.003]). In contrast, there was no change in the number of Col2a1<sup>CE</sup>-tdT<sup>+</sup> chondrocytes in the articular cartilage following collagenase digestion (Before: AC=79.1±50.3, After: AC=85.8±45.2, n=9 [before], n=4 mice [after] [p=0.939]). Based on this data, we further enumerated the percentage of growth plate chondrocytes among total Col2a1<sup>CE</sup>-tdT<sup>+</sup> cells dissociated from dissected the epiphyses. In fact, growth plate chondrocytes accounted for essentially all of Col2a1<sup>CE</sup>-tdT<sup>+</sup> cells (99.1±1.4% of Col2a1<sup>CE</sup>-tdT<sup>+</sup> cells, n=4 mice). Therefore, these data demonstrate that our microdissection and enzymatic dissociation approach allows us to selectively harvest Col2a1<sup>CE</sup>-tdT<sup>+</sup> chondrocytes from the postnatal growth plate.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.

We agree with the reviewers that a better definition of label-retaining chondrocytes (LRCs) is essential to sustaining the conclusions of our study. The important limitation of our study is that the transition between LRCs and non-LRCs are almost always contiguous. We therefore needed to define LRCs with somewhat arbitrary criteria in the original manuscript: (1) histologically, we defined LRCs as H2B-EGFP<sup>high</sup> cells at the top of the growth plate, and (2) by flow cytometry, we defined LRCs as cells with the top 10% brightness.</p><p>To support the authenticity of these criteria, we have performed additional experiments to justify the LRC term in our study.</p><p>First, we have quantified the intensity of H2B-EGFP signal through the entire column of chondrocytes using the corrected total cell fluorescence (CTCF) after two weeks of chase at P35, as shown in new Figure 1b,c.</p><p>This quantitative data support the reviewers’ statement that the cells right below the resting zone have slightly less H2B-EGFP signal, and the cells below them have yet weaker H2B-EGFP signal. However, we also confirmed that the cells with the top 10% brightness corresponded to resting chondrocytes at the top of the growth. While there were 27 cells in this given column of chondrocytes, the 3 brightest cells (374,012; 343,652; 264,697) were localized to the resting zone (Figure 1b, middle panel, arrows). Thus, based on this quantitative histological data, we believe that the top 10% brightness is a reasonable threshold to identify LRCs. In the revised manuscript, we have updated the description to clarify the definition of LRCs and non-LRC.</p><p>The following section has been added to the Results:</p><p>“Next, to more rigorously define LRCs and non-LRCs in the postnatal growth plate, we quantified the intensity of H2B-EGFP signal through the entire column of chondrocytes using the corrected total cell fluorescence (CTCF) after two weeks of doxycycline treatment at P35 in double homozygous Col2a1-tTA/Col2a1-tTA; TRE-H2B-GFP/TRE-H2B-EGFP mice. We labelled actively proliferating chondrocytes by pulsing these mice with a thymidine analogue EdU twice at 6 and 3 hours prior to sacrifice. By this approach, we expect to visualize an EdU-positive cell in the proliferating zone that is descended from an EdU-negative cell in the resting zone through one cell division (Figure 1b, left panel, arrows). The quantification of CTCF values through the entire column revealed that the cells in the proliferating zone (PZ) had weaker H2B-EGFP signal than those of the resting zone (RZ), and the cells in the pre-hypertrophic (PHZ) and hypertrophic zones (HZ) had yet weaker H2B-EGFP signal. The side-by-side comparison of CTCF values between EdU<sup>+</sup> cells in the proliferating zone and their preceding EdU-negative cells in the resting zone further revealed that H2B-EGFP CTCF values decreased significantly upon cell division (Figure 1c, P35: CTCF, EdU<sup>-</sup> cells in RZ = 267,184.55±109,457.82; EdU<sup>+</sup> cells in PZ = 131,891.99±83,344.76, n=4 mice, 24 data points [p&lt;0.0001]). The average fold change between EdU-negative and EdU-positive cells was 2.03, suggesting that H2B-EGFP intensity decreases by a factor of two following one cell division (Figure 1b,c), as expected from the fact that histone-bound GFP is distributed equally between the two daughter cells upon cell division. Further, the cells with the top 10% brightness were localized to RZ at the top of the growth plate; while there were 27 cells in this given column of chondrocytes, the 3 brightest cells (374,012; 343,652; 264,697) were localized to RZ (Figure 1b, arrowheads). Thus, based on these quantitative histological data, we designated the cells with the top 10% brightness as LRCs.”</p><p>The following underlined sentences have been added to the Results:</p><p><bold>“</bold>After the chase, LRCs were identified at a specific location near the top of the growth plate in the resting zone, retaining a higher level of H2B-EGFP signal (Figure 2e, right panel). In addition, most of these H2B-EGFP<sup>high</sup> cells in the growth plate were simultaneously marked as Col2<sup>CE</sup>-tdT<sup>+</sup> (Figure 2e, right panel, arrowhead, Figure 2c). While chondrocytes with the brightest H2B-GFP signal were localized to the resting zone, their descendants showed increasingly diluted H2B-EGFP signals as they progressed toward the proliferating and pre-hypertrophic zones (Figure 1b, Figure 2e, right panel).”</p><p>Second, following the reviewers’ directives, we have performed additional flow cytometry experiments using a proliferation marker EdU, to clarify the identity of LRCs and non-LRCs that are isolated for the downstream RNA-seq analysis. To this end, we pulsed Col2-Q mice with two serial doses of the thymidine analogue, EdU, at 3 and 6 hours prior to sacrifice. Under this protocol, actively proliferating cells should incorporate EdU. We used Click-iT Plus Alexa 647 Flow Cytometry kit, to fluorescently label EdU-incorporated cells. We next performed flow cytometry analysis of LRCs as cells with the top 10% H2B-EGFP brightness and non-LRCs as cells with 10-50% units of H2B-GFP brightness. We quantified the percentage of cells positive for EdU-Alexa Fluor 647 among LRCs and non-LRCs.</p><p>We observed that non-LRCs were significantly enriched for EdU<sup>+</sup> cells, both at 1 week and 2 weeks of chase (new Figure 4d, new Figure 4e, left and middle and new Figure 4 —figure supplement S2a). We also found a trend that non-LRCs were enriched for EdU<sup>+</sup> cells at 4 weeks of chase, although this was not statistically significant (new figure 4e, right and new Figure S2b). Therefore, LRCs are relatively resistant to EdU incorporation, denoting their relatively quiescent status.</p><p>Third, we examined the expression levels of cell cycle regulator genes in our comparative RNA-seq analysis, as shown in the new Figure S4. A number of S and G2/M phase cell cycle regulator genes were differentially expressed between LRCs and non-LRCs, with positive regulators particularly enriched in non-LRCs supporting the notion that non-LRCs are preferentially in cell division.</p><p>In conclusion, based on the additional quantitative data that we presented, we strongly believe that the cells with the top 10% H2B-EGFP brightness is a reasonable definition of LRCs, because these cells are (1) histologically localized to the resting zone and (2) resistant to incorporation of a proliferation marker, EdU, and negatively enriched for cell cycle regulator genes.</p><p>We acknowledge that these LRCs are still heterogeneous and perhaps include early cascades of resting chondrocytes. However, we believe that these LRCs represent a biologically unique group of growth plate chondrocytes.</p><p>The following section was added to the Results:</p><p>“We next set out to define whether LRCs isolated in single-cell suspension are characterized by slow-cycling nature therefore less mitotic activities. To this end, we quantitatively evaluated Col2a1<sup>CE</sup>-tdT<sup>+</sup> cells for EdU incorporation by flow cytometry. To this end, Col2-Q mice were fed with doxycycline for 1, 2 and 4 weeks and treated with tamoxifen twice at 3 and 2 days before analysis. These mice were pulsed with two doses of EdU shortly before analysis, at 6 and 3 hours prior to sacrifice. Actively proliferating cells that incorporate EdU were fluorescently marked by Click-iT Plus Alexa 647 Flow Cytometry kit. We quantified the percentage of EdU-Alexa647<sup>+</sup> cells among LRCs (cells with top 10% H2B-EGFP brightness) and non-LRCs (cells with 10-50% H2B-EGFP brightness). Non-LRCs were significantly enriched for EdU<sup>+</sup> cells, both at 1 week and 2 weeks of chase (EdU<sup>+</sup> cells, 1 week: 2.04±1.67% of LRCs; 7.04±2.30% of non-LRCs, n=6 mice [p=0.002]; 2 weeks: 1.13±0.74% of LRCs; 2.80±1.00% of non-LRCs, n=8 mice [p=0.047]) (Figure 4d,e left and middle, Figure 4 —figure supplement S2a). We also found a trend that non-LRCs were enriched for EdU<sup>+</sup> cells at 4 weeks of chase, although not statistically significant (EdU<sup>+</sup> cells, 2.40±0.85% of LRCs; 4.34±1.89% of non-LRCs, n=4 mice [p=0.200] (Fg.4e, right, Figure 4 —figure supplement S2b)).

Line 157-158: The authors stated that &quot;Five rounds of digestion completely liberated cells from the growth plate, while cells on the articular surface were almost undigested&quot; and this statement is supported by the image in Figure 1f. It is unclear why or if collagenase digestion cannot or did not liberate the articular chondrocytes. On close examination, the appearance (focus on the shape of the edge) of the articular cartilage also changed after digestion (even though judging from the SOC those two are probably not the same section). I suspect that some cells in the superficial zone of the articular surface might also have come off and if those cells would be included in downstream experiments like RNA-Seq. Although it looks from figure 1d that the articular cartilage is not labeled either red or green, but the superficial zone of the articular cartilage possesses cells that are quite similar to the resting zone (see for example Li, FASEB J. 2017) and, at least in theory, are those kinds of cells would retain the GFP-H2B. Interestingly, the most differentially expressed gene in RNA-Seq is Prg4, a well-known superficial zone marker but largely undetected in the resting zone (see Lui, 2015 Ped Res).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that our collagenase digestion may dissociate articular chondrocytes.

Line 169-171: the authors stated &quot;Therefore, these findings demonstrate that LRCs can be effectively identified and isolated from postnatal Col2-Q growth plates by combined microdissection, enzymatic digestion and flow cytometry-based approaches&quot;. It appears what the authors are showing is that chasing by dox removal, over time, is effective in removing GFP signaling in the digested cell population. However, whether the LRCs can be effectively identified and isolated depends on how much GFP-H2B signal diminishes after 1 (or more) cell division and perhaps other factors. Please address this issue.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you very much for raising this very important point. We agree with the reviewer that it is important to determine how much H2B-EGFP signal diminishes upon one cell division.</p><p>To address this issue, we provide a more quantitative measurement of the signal dilution of H2B-GFP following one round of cell division. We pulsed Col2-Q mice with two doses of EdU, at 3 and 6 hours prior to sacrifice, after two weeks of Doxy chase at P35. As shown in new Figure 1b, we calculated the corrected total cell fluorescence (CTCF) values of H2B-GFP signal of cells in the resting zone and their adjacent EdU<sup>+</sup> cells in the proliferating zone. By doing so, we assume that an EdU-negative cell in the resting zone has undergone one cell division and become an EdU-positive cell in the proliferating zone.</p><p>We found that EdU<sup>+</sup> cells in the proliferating zone have significantly decreased H2B-EGFP CTCF values compared to their preceding EdU-negative cells in the resting zone.

By this approach, we expect to visualize an EdU-positive cell in the proliferating zone that is descended from an EdU-negative cell in the resting zone through one cell division (Figure 1b, left panel, arrowheads and bracket). The quantification of CTCF values through the entire column revealed that the cells in the proliferating zone (PZ) had weaker H2B-EGFP signal than those of the resting zone (RZ), and the cells in the pre-hypertrophic (PHZ) and hypertrophic zones (HZ) had yet weaker H2B-EGFP signal (Figure 1b, center panel, yellow numbers). The side-by-side comparison of CTCF values between EdU<sup>+</sup> cells in the proliferating zone and their preceding EdU-negative cells in the resting zone further revealed that H2B-EGFP CTCF values decreased significantly upon one cell division (Figure 1c, P35: H2B-EGFP CTCF, EdU<sup>-</sup> cells in RZ = 267,184.6±109,457.8; EdU<sup>+</sup> cells in PZ = 131,892.0±83,344.8, n=4 mice, 24 cell-pairs [p&lt;0.0001]). The average fold change between EdU-negative and EdU-positive cells was 2.03, suggesting that H2B-EGFP intensity decreases by a factor of two following one cell division (Figure 1b,c), as expected from the fact that histone-bound GFP is distributed equally between the two daughter cells upon cell division. Further, the cells with the top 10% brightness were localized to RZ at the top of the growth plate; while there were 27 cells in this given column of chondrocytes, the 3 brightest cells (374,012; 343,652; 264,697) were localized to RZ (Figure 1b, center panel, arrowheads). Thus, based on these quantitative histological data, we designated the cells with the top 10% brightness as LRCs.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. The efforts by the authors to identify and isolate the LRCs population and to perform RNA-Seq to assist with this effort were appreciated by the reviewers. The impact of technical factors (dissection, digestion, label, flow cytometry, etc) and the generalized handling of the cells could potentially affect the fidelity of gene expression study. This is not a situation unique to this study. How long after the growth plate was taken until the RNA were eventually isolated from the cells? What measures where taken to control for or account for these possible technical sources of artifactual signals?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you very much again for raising this important point for discussion. We agree with the reviewers that our cells are subjected to multiple layers of technical manipulations before being profiled. However, we would like to point out that both LRCs and non-LRCs have been treated under the identical experimental manipulations, including dissection, digestion and FACS-sorting, up to the point that their transcriptomes are interrogated. Therefore, artifactual signals should be mitigated and minimized as long as we compare LRCs with non-LRCs within the same cell preparation.</p><p>Generally speaking, it takes approximately 6 hours to harvest RNAs after the growth plate is dissected. This includes 30 min. for microdissection, 150 min. for digestion, 45 min. for antibody staining, 60 min. for FACS-sorting and 60 min. for RNA isolation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. In their RNA-Seq experiment, the authors defined non-LRCs as the &quot;GFP mid-low cells&quot;. What cells are these in terms of histological position in the growth plate? Are these mostly proliferative chondrocytes or includes the entirety of the PZ-PHZ-HZ cells? The expression profile seems to indicate these could a bit of everything (high in ColX, Ihh, Dlx5, etc). It would have been even more interesting if the non-LRCs are the direct progenies of the LRCs (like the one cell that just exited the resting zone).</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you very much for this great question. Based on our new quantitative data shown in new Figure 1b, non-LRCs appear to include a diverse array of cells within the column, including proliferating, pre-hypertrophic and hypertrophic chondrocytes, and perhaps some resting chondrocytes as well. As discussed in the preceding response, the cells with the top 10% brightness correspond to 3 cells (374,012; 343,652; 264,697) in the resting zone, in this given example. As the reviewer pointed out, the expression profile of non-LRCs is in line with their diverse composition of cells in PZ, PHZ and HZ.</p><p>One of the co-authors of this study (Dr. Takao Hirai) tried laser-capture microdissection (LCM) to compare the profile of LRCs and their direct progeny of the LRCs; however, he found that this was technically impossible to capture single-cells from a desired location of growth plate sections.

In figure 3, the authors again utilized a nice combination of mouse models to test how canonical WNT signaling affects resting chondrocytes. Based on the results from figure 3d-g, it seems the effect is quite subtle, which is slightly disappointing.

Therefore, we have updated the text in the following:</p><p>The following underlined word has been added to the Results:</p><p>“These data indicate that the formation and the expansion of PTHrP<sup>+</sup> cells in the resting zone are slightly impaired when canonical Wnt signaling is activated in these cells.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9. The fact that the authors identified genes like Rspo3, Sfrp5, and Dkk2, suggests WNT signaling but does not automatically mean canonical wnt/catenin signaling. There is a reasonable amount of literature connecting these WNT modulators to other non-canonical WNT, such as the PCP WNT pathway (e.g. Ohkawara, 2011 Dev Cell). In particular, PCP WNT pathway have been implicated in resting zone chondrocyte transition to the proliferative zone (e.g. Andrew Dudley's work in 2009 Development, Tracy Ballock's work in 2012 J Orth Res, and more recently Li, 2017 in eLife). It is understood that PCP WNT signaling is activated when the chondrocytes exit the resting zone and start forming columns, thus it is not surprising at all that a lot of WNT modulator/inhibitors are highly expressed in the resting zone. The statement in line 330 &quot;no previous report ties WNT signaling to the maintenance of putative skeletal stem cell populations in the resting zone of the growth plate&quot; is erroneous. While the authors have advanced the field (particularly testing how activating canonical wnt might impact resting zone in figure 3), it is not appropriate to ignore or downplay the prior literature in this area.</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to thank the reviewers for their insightful comments. We apologize for the oversight. We have summarized the role of non-canonical, PCP WNT signaling in facilitating resting-to-proliferating chondrocyte transition in the revised manuscript. We have also revised the Discussion in line with this.</p><p>The following section has been added to the Introduction:</p><p>“Non-canonical Wnt/planar cell polarity (PCP) signaling plays a key role in facilitating asymmetric divisions of resting chondrocytes. Oriented division, rearrangement and intercalation of chondrocyte clones in the resting zone, and their subsequent asymmetric divisions into their daughter cells aligned with the axis of growth are the hallmark characteristic of growth plate chondrocytes (Li et al., 2017). Non-canonical Wnt/PCP signaling is activated when the chondrocytes exit the resting zone and start forming columns, guiding the oriented cell division of resting chondrocytes into proliferating cells and their further expansion. In fact, misregulation of non-canonical Wnt/PCP signaling via dominant-negative forms of Frizzled receptors results in severe shortening of the growth plate (Hartmann and Tabin, 2000). Oriented cell division is sensitive to both high and low PCP activity mediated in part by Fzd7 (Li and Dudley, 2009, Li et al., 2017). In addition, Wnt5a signals to establish PCP in chondrocytes along the proximal-distal axis through regulation of Vangl2 (Gao et al., 2011, Randall et al., 2012). However, how resting chondrocytes are regulated by non-canonical Wnt/PCP signaling members, such as Rspo3 (Ohkawara et al., 2011) in addition to Dkk2 (Niehrs, 2006) and Fzd receptors, are unknown.”</p><p>The following underlines sentences have been added to the Discussion:</p><p>“In the resting zone, Apc haploinsufficiency led to increased β-catenin protein expression specifically in the resting zone including in PTHrP<sup>+</sup> chondrocytes, and slightly decreased formation and expansion of PTHrP<sup>+</sup> chondrocytes, reducing differentiation capabilities of these cells into columnar chondrocytes in the proliferating zone. It is important to note that the effect of β-catenin stabilization in PTHrP<sup>+</sup> chondrocytes appears to be modest. Lines of studies demonstrate that non-canonical Wnt/planar cell polarity (PCP) signaling plays a key role in facilitating asymmetric divisions of resting chondrocytes. Therefore, our findings support the notion that canonical and non-canonical Wnt signaling pathways concertedly modulate PTHrP<sup>+</sup> chondrocytes in the resting zone and regulate their differentiation.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10.
