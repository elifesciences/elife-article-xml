metabolic rate and manage daily energy balance. However, the physiological ‘rules’ that govern torpor use are unclear. We tracked torpor use and body composition in ruby-throated hummingbirds (<italic>Archilochus colubris</italic>), a long-distance migrant, throughout the summer using respirometry and quantitative magnetic resonance. During the mid-summer, birds entered torpor at consistently low fat stores (~5% of body mass), and torpor duration was negatively related to evening fat load. Remarkably, this energy emergency strategy was abandoned in the late summer when birds accumulated fat for migration. During the migration period, birds were more likely to enter torpor on nights when they had higher fat stores, and fat gain was positively correlated with the amount of torpor used. These findings demonstrate the versatility of torpor throughout the annual cycle and suggest a fundamental change in physiological feedback between adiposity and torpor during migration. Moreover, this study highlights the underappreciated importance of facultative heterothermy in migratory ecology.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Torpor is an energy-saving strategy used by warm-blooded animals, including birds and small mammals. Similar to hibernation, although shorter in duration, torpor is a state of minimal activity, low body temperatures and reduced metabolism that helps animals conserve energy in unfavorable conditions. Some animals use torpor to survive times when food is not readily available. Hummingbirds, for example, eat nectar all day long to meet their high energy needs, but must build fat reserves to see them through their overnight fast. If they go to sleep with too little fat, they can descend into torpor to stretch out that limited energy supply and survive until morning.</p><p>Many hummingbirds migrate to areas with warmer weather, where food remains available, for the winter months. The ruby-throated hummingbird (<italic>Archilochus colubris</italic>), for example, travels over 5,000 kilometers in its fall migration. Like most long-distance migrants, ruby-throated hummingbirds increase their fat stores before departing, using these stores to fuel their journey. It is thought that this bird may use torpor as a way to accelerate fat build up before its annual migration. However, it remained unclear whether hummingbirds switched from using torpor strictly in energy emergencies, to using it as strategy to prepare for migration.</p><p>To shed light on this question, Eberts, Guglielmo and Welch investigated when, why and how hummingbirds save energy using torpor during the summer, and whether there are seasonal shifts in their use of torpor coinciding with migration. Eberts, Guglielmo and Welch hypothesized that a bird would initiate daily torpor if its energy stores fall below a critical level during the night, but that they may abandon this threshold (triggering torpor at higher fat levels) in late summer as a way to spare energy and gain fat before their annual migration.</p><p>To test their hypotheses, Eberts, Guglielmo and Welch tracked body composition, food intake, energy expenditure and torpor use throughout summer in a group of captive ruby-throated hummingbirds. In the middle of the summer, the birds entered torpor and remained torpid for longer when they went to sleep with low fat stores. In late summer, however, the same birds were more likely to enter torpor at consistent times and when they had higher fat stores. Eberts, Guglielmo and Welch also observed that the more time birds spent in torpor, the more fat they gained. This suggests that in late summer, hummingbirds switch from using torpor as a survival strategy to using it to maximize energy savings before migration.</p><p>These results clearly define the physiological rules governing torpor use in hummingbirds. They also support the long-standing assumption that torpor helps migratory species save energy and accumulate fat stores before long-haul flights.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>ruby-throated hummingbirds</kwd><kwd>torpor</kwd><kwd>migration</kwd><kwd>body composition</kwd><kwd>respirometry</kwd><kwd>quantitative magnetic resonance</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000038</institution-id><institution>Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>06129-2015 RGPIN</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Welch</surname><given-names>Kenneth C</given-names><suffix>Jr</suffix></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000854</institution-id><institution>Human Frontier Science Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RGP0062/2016</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Welch</surname><given-names>Kenneth C</given-names><suffix>Jr</suffix></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000038</institution-id><institution>Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Discovery Grant 05245-2015 RGPIN</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Guglielmo</surname><given-names>Christopher G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001805</institution-id><institution>Canada Foundation for Innovation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Ontario Research Fund</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Guglielmo</surname><given-names>Christopher G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Ruby-throated hummingbirds switch from using torpor to survive nighttime energy emergencies in the breeding season to using it to spare fat stores and gain premigratory mass in the late summer.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Facultative hypothermia is an energy conservation strategy that allows many mammalian and some avian species to survive periods of resource unavailability or to optimize their energy budgets in certain environments or life stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">McKechnie and Lovegrove, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ruf and Geiser, 2015</xref>). During facultative hypothermia, metabolic rates and body temperatures are reduced to varying extents across species and environmental conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ruf and Geiser, 2015</xref>). As some of the smallest avian species, hummingbirds (Trochilidae) are known for their ability to use daily torpor, a deep, short-term form of facultative hypothermia, to cope with energetic challenges they face daily and throughout their annual cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Carpenter, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hainsworth et al., 1977</xref>).</p><p>Studies that have investigated the use of torpor in hummingbirds in relation to food availability and body mass suggest that torpor initiation is controlled by an endogenous mechanism sensitive to an energy-store threshold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hainsworth et al., 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hiebert, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Powers et al., 2003</xref>). This model predicts that a bird will initiate torpor if its energy stores reach critically low levels with enough time remaining in the night to achieve net energy savings. Hummingbirds typically rewarm 1–2 hr before sunrise, so they rarely enter torpor after approximately 75% of the night has elapsed; even if critically low energy levels are reached late in the night, birds may avoid entering torpor at this point if the energetic benefits are outweighed by the potential costs (e.g. predation, moult delay) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bouma et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Carr and Lima, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hainsworth et al., 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hiebert, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hiebert, 1990</xref>). Previous studies also suggest that the function of torpor shifts seasonally, from an energy emergency survival mechanism to an energy-storage maximization strategy during migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carpenter and Hixon, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hiebert, 1993</xref>). However, this threshold has not been repeatedly and accurately measured in individual birds spanning life history stages, and the relationship between torpor use and the components of body composition (fat and lean mass) remains unclear.</p><p>We explored torpor use in ruby-throated hummingbirds (<italic>Archilochus colubris</italic>), which breed in eastern North America in the early and mid-summer, and migrate to wintering grounds in Mexico and Central America in the late summer. In the breeding period, birds maintain relatively lean body compositions to optimize aerial agility, important for successful courtship displays and competitive interactions that allow them to maintain secure access to food resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Altshuler et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hou and Welch, 2016</xref>). But like most long-distance migrants, ruby-throated hummingbirds substantially increase their body mass prior to migratory departure to fuel their journey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hou and Welch, 2016</xref>).</p><p>We repeatedly and non-invasively quantified the relationship between torpor and endogenous energy stores (fat) in ruby-throated hummingbirds to investigate the underlying rules of torpor use during the breeding and migration periods. We predicted that in the breeding period, when birds reached a low energy-store threshold before 75% of the night had elapsed, they would enter torpor to avoid complete energy depletion, and that birds that remained normothermic until this point would not enter torpor if it would not achieve net energy savings. We also predicted that this threshold would be abandoned in the late summer to facilitate premigratory fattening. Furthermore, we predicted that in the breeding period, torpor use would be primarily driven by evening fat content and the rate at which those energy reserves were used, and that in the migration period, the amount of torpor used would be driven primarily by night length, allowing the birds to spare a maximum amount of fat stores, irrespective of longer late-summer nights.</p><p>We measured the torpor use and body composition of captive adult (and one juvenile) male ruby-throated hummingbirds (n = 16; capture mass: 2.5–3.2 g) that experienced semi-natural photoperiods, on 158 focal bird-nights throughout the summer. On all days and nights, the birds experienced air temperatures of approximately 20°C (19.7°C ± 0.0°C) to control for the potential effect of air temperature as a proximate cue for torpor use. We used respirometry to calculate rates of energy expenditure and the rate of oxidation of stored fat, and quantitative magnetic resonance (QMR) to measure body composition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Guglielmo et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lighton, 2008</xref>).

We evaluated changes in the relationships between evening body composition and torpor occurrence, torpor duration, time of torpor entry, fat content at torpor entry, and amount of energy expended before torpor entry, within and among periods of consistent change in body mass. We also evaluated the influence of night length on these variables. To specifically investigate the role of torpor in driving premigratory increases in body mass, we evaluated the effects of mean torpor duration and mean daily food consumption on the amount of mass gained and duration of the fattening period.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Body mass</title><p>Throughout the study period, 13 of 16 birds exhibited relatively low morning body masses, indicative of breeding condition, until late August or early September when they substantially increased their body mass; the birds subsequently maintained high body masses.

In the summer, torpor is sensitive to critically low endogenous energy reserves; however, when the birds fatten for migration, this rule is abandoned, and the birds enter torpor with high levels of fat. While it does not appear that torpor initiation in the migration period is simply sensitive to a high energy threshold, the abandonment of the emergency threshold indicates that the rules governing torpor use are dependent on life history stage, and that hummingbirds may employ torpor as part of various energy management strategies throughout the annual cycle.</p><p>In the summer breeding period, ruby-throated hummingbirds reserve torpor for times when they face critically low fat stores during the night. At air temperatures of 20°C, which free-living birds commonly experience, torpor initiation is primarily driven by instantaneous fat stores. On nights when they started with lower evening fat stores birds depleted energy stores to critically low levels earlier in the night, and thus remained torpid longer, irrespective of night length. These results support the hypotheses that torpor use is sensitive to a low, consistent threshold of fat during the breeding period, and that torpor is an energy emergency survival strategy mechanism that protects hummingbirds from depleting energy stores during the night or before they can reach their first meal in the morning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hainsworth et al., 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hiebert, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Powers et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>The birds obeyed the average threshold on the clear majority of focal nights (47 out of 55 nights). On eight nights, 6 of the 13 fattener birds either crossed the threshold and did not enter torpor, or entered torpor without ever crossing the threshold, but we argue it is not surprising that there were a few exceptions to the threshold rule. The threshold could occasionally be overridden to remain normothermic despite reaching critical energy levels if extended bouts of torpor on subsequent nights impede regenerative processes associated with normothermy and sleep, or increase risk of predation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bouma et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Carr and Lima, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hiebert, 1990</xref>). Similarly, we and other researchers have observed hummingbirds prematurely rewarming after inadvertent light or noise disturbances, which suggests that the threshold override and emergency arousal mechanisms could be related (A. Shankar, E. Eberts, personal observations). Although we did not observe any obvious signs of greater stress in some individuals than others, it is also possible that some birds (e.g. those that were more recently captured) were more sensitive to handling and confinement in the respirometry chamber and therefore initiated torpor despite not having depleted fat levels to the threshold level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hiebert et al., 2000</xref>). Furthermore, although temperature, precipitation, and food availability were controlled in this study, these factors would likely affect free-living hummingbirds’ torpor use decisions by effecting the amount of fat the birds start each night with and the rate that they expend that fat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hainsworth et al., 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">McGuire et al., 2021</xref>). For example, the birds were fasted to ensure accurate body composition measurements, but if the birds were allowed to eat during the last 2 hr of the day, it is likely that they would have amassed larger evening fat stores and therefore would have entered torpor later in the night or not at all (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Eberts et al., 2019</xref>). Additionally, the level of the energy-store threshold could be modulated in response to anticipated energy demand. For instance, free-living birds at our study site during the breeding period experienced minimum nighttime air temperatures between 10°C and 25°C (London International Airport, Ontario, Canada). At colder temperatures, normothermic hummingbirds would need to sustain a higher resting metabolic rate and may therefore anticipate an energy emergency earlier in the night (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hiebert, 1990</xref>). While these factors likely play a role in the complex decision-making that governs free-living hummingbird torpor use during the breeding season, our evidence strongly supports the existence of an ‘adipostat’ mechanism that initiates compensatory physiological changes depending on the instantaneous level of endogenous energy stores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boyer and Barnes, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Powers et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>The patterns and role of torpor use drastically shifts as hummingbirds accumulate fat stores prior to migration. Contrary to the breeding period, torpor propensity and torpor duration were primarily driven by night length rather than evening fat content, and torpor entry, energy expenditure before torpor entry, and overnight fat loss did not vary with night length. Instead of initiating torpor to survive the night whenever they reach a critically low threshold, hummingbirds appear to enter torpor after a consistent amount of time, so that they expend a predictable amount of energy and achieve greater energy savings as they experience progressively longer nights in the late summer. This suggests that during the migration period, birds maximize their time in torpor, but must remain normothermic for a consistent period of time, perhaps accounting for the time it takes to process their final evening meal and their blood sugar declines to a level allowing for torpor initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Eberts et al., 2019</xref>). This normothermic period could also allow the birds to achieve sufficient sleep before entering torpor when the regenerative and immunological benefits of sleep are unlikely to occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bouma et al., 2010</xref>). Overall, the seasonal change in torpor use, from a survival strategy initiated by an ‘adipostat’ mechanism to a more routine use of torpor to maximize energy savings and build fat stores prior to migration, shows that torpor is a critical energy management strategy that allows migratory hummingbirds to balance fuel supply and demand during a particular season. Similar torpor use patterns have been well studied in mammals, though studies investigating avian endocrine mechanisms are needed to elucidate the proximate factors of torpor initiation across taxa.</p><p>The similarities between the life histories of North American hummingbirds and bats provide an important lens through which to interrogate the ultimate drivers of torpor use throughout the annual cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">McGuire et al., 2012</xref>). Using torpor while roosting could allow both hummingbirds and bats animals to maintain high fuel stores when feeding opportunities are constrained by migratory priorities. Unlike most nocturnal migrant birds that can replenish fuel stores during the day, ruby-throated hummingbirds are diurnal migrants that do not forage at night. In an opposite but parallel manner, North American bats migrate at night when they would otherwise forage and do not forage during the day. In both of these types of animals, foraging, migrating, and sleeping can be mutually exclusive endeavors, but torpor can allow them to conserve energy and avoid making extended refueling stopovers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">McGuire et al., 2014</xref>). While we did not study free-living birds while they migrated, the drastic shift in the relationship between hummingbird body composition and torpor use, and of the link between torpor duration and mass gains in the late summer compellingly support the ‘torpor-assisted migration’ hypothesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carpenter and Hixon, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hiebert, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hou and Welch, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">McGuire et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>The magnitude and timing of fattening in our captive birds resembled those documented in some free-living ruby-throated hummingbirds (present study: 0.58 ± 0.05 g, 19.6% ± 1.6% over 10 ± 1 days; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hou and Welch, 2016</xref>: ~ 0.65 g, or 17% over 4 days). However, not all birds in this study showed such substantial body mass changes; there was continuous variation in magnitude and duration of fattening within the fattener birds, and three non-fattener birds maintained relatively lean body compositions throughout the study period. The ranges in magnitude and timing of fattening are not surprising because hummingbirds are asocial birds that do not migrate in flocks, and we would not expect them to have finely synchronized timing of migratory preparation, especially in the absence of natural ecological cues. Furthermore, our captive birds varied in wing feather wear and activity level, suggesting that the amount of fat they could deposit was limited by how much extra weight they could carry, determined by wing morphology, pectoral mass, and power output (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chai, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dakin et al., 2020</xref>). These interindividual differences could also reflect disparate energy management strategies observed among free-living individuals. For example, a study examining migratory paths of juveniles suggested that adults take a more direct route than individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Zenzal and Moore, 2016</xref>). These disparate migratory strategies could be driven by differences in competitive abilities or experience from previous migratory journeys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carpenter et al., 1993b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carpenter et al., 1993a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hou and Welch, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kodric-Brown and Brown, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Welch et al., 2008</xref>). This hypothesis is supported by the fact that one of the three non-fattener birds was the only juvenile in our study, and ongoing work is investigating potential age/sex class differences in an ecologically relevant context.</p><p>This is the first study to non-terminally and repeatedly sample the body composition of individuals to accurately define a consistent rule governing torpor use in hummingbirds: birds will enter torpor when their fat stores reach a consistently low fat threshold (5%), during life history stages where a relatively lean body composition is advantageous. This rule may explain the typically low degree of torpor use in dominant individuals and large species, and the more frequent use of torpor in subordinate individuals and smaller species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Powers et al., 2003</xref>). Moreover, our study is consistent with the long standing, but heretofore unproven, assumptions of the key role of torpor in premigratory fattening and in refueling at migratory stopover sites. Hummingbirds dramatically shift their rules for torpor use and enter torpor at high fat levels during times when it is advantageous to accumulate excess energy stores. These findings demonstrate the versatility of torpor as an energy management mechanism throughout the annual cycle and have important implications for understanding the physiological basis of torpor initiation.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Study animals</title><p>Adult (and one juvenile) male ruby-throated hummingbirds (<italic>A. colubris;</italic> n = 16; capture mass: 2.54–3.2 g) were captured with a modified box trap (drop door trap) in London, ON, Canada, at the University of Western Ontario.

The birds began exhibiting increased body masses (indicative of migratory condition) at different times in the late summer (mean: August 28; range: August 12–September 8). In order to identify periods of distinct rates of change in body mass, we analyzed the rate of change in morning body mass across the study period (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). We first smoothed the morning body mass trace with a smoothing parameter (0.35) that we identified through an iterative process. We calculated the first derivative of this smoothed body mass trace, and defined periods based on bird-specific ‘cut-off’ slopes that we calculated as 75% of the maximum slope (g⋅day<sup>–1</sup>). We defined ‘breeding’ as periods where the rate of change was less than the cut-off slope, ‘fattening’ as periods where the rate of change was greater than the cut-off slope, and ‘migration’ as periods where the rate of change was less than the cut-off slope and after the start of the fattening period. When this analysis yielded periods that clearly disagreed with visual inspection of the curve, we slightly adjusted the bounds of the fattening period to fit a more realistic pattern. Three birds that did not fatten were categorized as ‘non-fatteners’ and were excluded from the statistical models that regard seasonal changes in torpor use.</p><p>We calculated torpor propensity as the percentage of nights the birds entered torpor of the total number of observation nights for each bird within each period. In order to calculate the energetic characteristics of torpor, such as the fat content at the time of torpor entry and duration, the temporal characteristics of torpor must be clearly defined. In much of the avian and mammalian torpor literature, torpor entry is defined by phrases such as when the metabolic rate ‘abruptly declines’, or by criteria such as a threshold value of a set proportion of the average normothermic resting values of body temperature or metabolic rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ruf and Geiser, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Shankar et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Wolf et al., 2020</xref>).

We calculated separate smoothed traces for the time before (containing entry) and after (containing arousal) the end of torpor/start of arousal. To determine this intermediate point we calculated the derivative of a smoothed trace of the entire night (using night-specific smoothing factor), and preliminarily identified the approximate end of torpor/start of arousal as the minute the rate of change was greater than an arousal cut-off slope of 0.005 <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf10"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mover><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">V</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>´</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mover><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">o</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> ⋅min<sup>–1</sup>.

We defined ‘entry’ as periods where the rate of change was greater than two times the standard deviation of the mean rate of change during the normothermic period before torpor (which was identified by analyzing the preliminary smoothed curve where the rate of change was less than –0.003 <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf12"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mover><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">V</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>´</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mover><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">o</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> ⋅min<sup>–1</sup>). We defined ‘arousal’ as periods where the rate of change was greater than five times the standard deviation of the mean rate of change during the torpid period; we defined the end of the arousal period as the point when the bird exhibited peak <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf13"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mover><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">V</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>´</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mover><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">o</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> .

We also annotated points before the start of entry and after the end of arousal as ‘normo-pre’ and ‘normo-post’, respectively. This process yielded accurate and repeatable metabolic state annotations of each minute.</p><p>The initial evening and the final morning percent fat content were calculated as fat mass (g)/body mass (g). We used the rate of energy expenditure, cumulative energy expenditure, and initial fat mass measurements to estimate instantaneous percent fat content throughout each night. These data allowed for the estimation of the amount of energy reserves, relative to body mass, of each bird at the time of torpor initiation. We calculated this value by subtracting the fat mass equivalent (1 g<sub>fat</sub>/37 kJ) of cumulative energy expenditure at torpor entry from evening fat mass and dividing the result by morning body mass. We calculated torpor duration (hr) as the time between the start of torpor entry until the beginning of arousal (excluding arousal). We calculated overnight mass losses as the fat mass equivalent of the amount of overnight energy expenditure. Lastly, we calculated body mass increases as the change in body mass from the beginning to the end of the fattening period, relative to the smoothed morning body mass trace used to determine the periods.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>We used mixed effects analyses to evaluate the relationships between various response and predictor variables, while accounting for intra-individual differences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bates et al., 2015</xref>). First, we used linear mixed effects analyses to determine how body mass, fat content, lean mass, and food consumption changed within and among (<italic>with respect to</italic> date) each period of distinct mass change (with day length as a covariate for the food consumption model). We evaluated the overall relationships between body mass and fat mass, and body mass and lean mass, using a repeated measures correlation test (‘<italic>rmcorr</italic>’ R package; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bakdash and Marusich, 2017</xref>).</p><p>We used a linear mixed effects model to compare mean torpor propensity among periods, and a logistic mixed effects model to compare the influence of evening fat content on probability of occurrence of torpor within each period. We also used linear mixed effects models to determine how torpor duration, energy expenditure before torpor entry, and overnight fat mass loss changed with respect to evening fat content within and among periods, and with respect to night length within and among periods. We used linear mixed effects models to determine how % fat at the time of torpor entry changed with respect to date and the time of night, with night length as a covariate, within and among periods. We also used linear mixed effects models to determine how overnight mass loss changed with respect to torpor duration within and among periods. Lastly, we used linear models to evaluate the effect of mean torpor duration and mean daily food consumption within the fattening period on the magnitude and duration of the fattening period.</p><p>We performed all statistical analyses using <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">R Development Core Team, 2020</xref>. To generate linear and logistic mixed effects models, we used the ‘<italic>lme4</italic>’ package, with Bird ID as a random effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bates et al., 2015</xref>). For linear models we used the ‘<italic>lm</italic>’ function. For each response variable, we iteratively compared several combinations of relevant fixed effects, and used the AICs to determine the most parsimonious model. The model with the lowest AIC by at least two points was considered the best, and we verified that residuals of this model showed homoscedasticity and normality. We determined p-values using the ‘<italic>anova</italic>’ function on each model generated using the ‘<italic>lmerTest</italic>’ package, and made pair-wise comparisons within and among periods using the ‘<italic>emmeans</italic>’ package. All values are given as estimated marginal means ± standard error, unless otherwise indicated, and significance was taken at α &lt; 0.05.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Project administration, Software, Visualization, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Methodology, Resources, Supervision, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Methodology, Resources, Supervision, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Details of animal husbandry and all experiments were approved by the University of Toronto (protocol # 20011649) and the University of Western Ontario Animal Care Committees (protocol #2018-092).

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Detlef Weigel as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Your study explored the rules governing the use of torpor and whether they differed between annual cycle stages in the ruby-throated hummingbird. You evaluated changes in the relationships between evening body fat content and torpor occurrence, torpor duration, time of torpor entry, and amount of energy expended before torpor entry during the breeding, fattening and migration periods. Your results suggest that birds shift the rules on when to enter torpor depending on whether they are breeding or during migration. During breeding, ruby-throated hummingbirds go into torpor when body fat stores drop to 5%, whereas during migration they are more likely to enter torpor at high fat levels. You conclude that your findings demonstrate the versatility of torpor as an energy management mechanism throughout the annual cycle.</p><p>All the reviews show enthusiasm about the potential of your study to advance our understanding of why, when, and how wild birds use daily torpor as an energetic strategy. The use of respirometry and QMR, and the exemplary job of providing the original data received commendations. You will find this related in the summary evaluation and public review of your work. However, the manuscript will require some major revisions before it can be considered for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. Particularly, the significance of the results is somewhat overstated because of insufficient recognition of the limitations of the experimental design. The limitations of the study need to be carefully addressed. Please do take note of the following:</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. Note that although the controlled conditions were necessary, it presents both a strength and a weakness. The weakness is that natural environmental cues that may affect torpor like variation in temperature, precipitation, and food availability were not in effect. Body mass and composition was convincingly important for torpor initiation and length, but it was difficult to tell what factors caused variation in body mass and composition because all the birds had ad libitum food. Was it just individual variation? Were some birds more stressed than others by captivity? These points need to be carried along in your interpretation and discussion of the results.</p><p>2. Following on point one, inter-individual differences should be incorporated not just in models, but the resulting output should be interpreted and discussed. The data shown in figure six and seven of the supplementary information reveals very strong individual patterns. Some individuals may be more likely to go into torpor compared to others regardless of the identified conditions. The three non-fattening birds are a typical example of individuals that do not conform to the norm.</p><p>3. Ambient temperature variation is largely ignored here. I found one place where it was indicated that it was measured (line 311), but no place where it was reported. This appears to have been an oversight because the energetics of torpor change dramatically with ambient temperature. It needs to be addressed here from a proximate perspective (what temperature regimes were experienced by the experimental birds and what effects would that be expected to have?) and an ultimate perspective (the shift in 'rules' may be an evolutionary evolved one because of the tendency for lower nighttime temperatures during the early fall), leading to the higher – 65% – frequency of torpor – and in fact, the logistic regression for torpor use should perhaps be reconsidered as far as the way it may have accounted for calendar date.</p><p>4. There are conspicuously missing analyses, interpretations, and discussions around how the absolute duration of the night may associate with torpor initiation, duration, and critical thresholds of energy stores. Day length (and therefore, night length) differs between the breeding, fattening, and migration periods and this may influence energy storage and depletion decisions. Could longer nights cause birds to enter torpor earlier and stay longer? Does this affect how much body reserve is accumulated pre-torpor? Differences in night temperature between periods of the annual cycle may also play a role.</p><p>5. A general restructuring of the manuscript may help improve the flow. Perhaps separating the results and the discussions will also help to organise things a bit better. This will allow us to see the contrasts in the results quicker because they will be less intertwined with the discussions. I will strongly recommend including a table to show the similarities and the contrasts in the results between the breeding and the migration periods side by side. As it is, the comparisons are difficult to follow.</p><p>6. I would like to see the overnight loss of body mass in normothermic birds. Did you measure the overnight fat mass loss during the different periods of the annual cycle (breeding, fattening and migration) for birds that are normothermic? This may be important for determining why birds enter torpor at different fat levels in different periods. The absolute difference in fat mass between periods may not be very important without knowing how much fat is needed to survive the night without torpor.</p><p>7. Line 228: The conclusion needs to be toned down. It is not clear that this study has repeatedly and accurately defined a consistent rule governing torpor use in hummingbirds. A detailed examination of the data (supplementary figures 6 and 7) suggests that the occurrence of torpor and the pattern of body mass change over time is specific to individuals. I will strongly recommend that individual patterns be explored. Some individuals may go into torpor regardless of whether the body fat threshold is reached or not. The three fattening birds are a typical example of inter-individual variation.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.70062.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1.

However, these environmental factors would most importantly affect the amount of fat the birds start each night with and the rate that they expend those stores. Though we controlled for these factors, individual differences in daily activity and food consumption generated sufficient variation in evening body composition to evaluate how evening energy content was most directly related to torpor use. By controlling potential environmental factors, we greatly simplified the analyses and interpretations, and avoided potentially confounding environmental factors, to confidently conclude that fat mass is the most proximate factor for torpor initiation in the breeding season, and that night length was the primary driver of torpor duration in the migration season. We have added a sentence (134-137) specifying that variation in evening fat content was generated by daily food consumption and activity, and we have added a few sentences (282-292) to discuss the potential effects of factors that we did not allow to vary, including temperature and time fasted. We also now note (278-282) that we did not observe any clear differences in stress levels of the birds.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

Regarding fattening patterns, one important limitation is that it is impossible to confidently assign migratory strategies because the birds were not allowed to actually migrate. For example, it is possible that in a natural context, the birds would have fattened to different extents over different amounts of time. That said, we have now clearly discussed the major difference between non-fatteners and fatteners, and we also describe the important relationship between the amount and duration of fattening with average torpor use and daily food consumption, whereby fattener birds with lower average torpor durations fattened less. We also note that variation in wing morphology (due to wing wear) and pectoral mass (due to activity level) could affect power output and limit the amount of fat mass each bird was able to deposit. Regarding torpor use patterns, we now highlight the consistency of the energy store threshold prediction, whereby only a small portion (15%) did not follow the rule, and we discuss potential reasons for this (i.e. the threshold rules may shift on consecutive nights of torpor use).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.

We did specify that all nighttime temperatures were 20°C, and we now also state that daytime temperatures were also 20°C. We also now explicitly discuss the potential role of ambient temperature (282-293).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4.

We have adjusted our statistical models that predict torpor use variables (i.e. torpor duration, entry time, critical fat level, energy expenditure before torpor and overnight) to incorporate the interaction between period and night length, in addition to the interaction between period and evening fat mass. Most notably, we think our story is strengthened by results that night length did not influence torpor duration in the breeding period (when evening fat content was the best predictor), and that in the migration period night length, and not evening fat content, did affect torpor duration. This is an important piece of information that further describes the clear switch in torpor use strategies, and it highlights the point that in the breeding period birds simply entered torpor at whatever time they reached critical fat stores, whereas in the migration period, birds entered torpor at consistent times, irrespective of evening fat or a threshold, and the time that they remained in torpor was driven by the length of the night. This allows us to conclude that there is a clear shift in the torpor use rules, from an energy emergency threshold, to a more routine use of torpor. We have adjusted the text throughout the manuscript accordingly.</p><p>Regarding night temperatures between periods, there were no differences – as described above, all daytime and nighttime temperatures were 20°C (96, 377, 431).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5.

Accordingly, we have added a table showing morning body mass, fat content at torpor entry, and the primary drivers (either evening fat content or night length) of the various torpor use metrics with the direction of that relationship.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. I would like to see the overnight loss of body mass in normothermic birds. Did you measure the overnight fat mass loss during the different periods of the annual cycle (breeding, fattening and migration) for birds that are normothermic? This may be important for determining why birds enter torpor at different fat levels in different periods. The absolute difference in fat mass between periods may not be very important without knowing how much fat is needed to survive the night without torpor.</p></disp-quote><p>We did measure overnight mass loss on normothermic nights, and we display this in supplementary figure 4 (now Appendix 1- Figure 4), as open circles. We had included the overall mean ± sem, and have now updated this to be period-specific (216-218). These values are not significantly different (p&gt;0.745) when taking night length into account. We have also calculated and included the threshold fat levels in terms of absolute fat masses in addition to relative fat content (165, 244).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. Line 228: The conclusion needs to be toned down. It is not clear that this study has repeatedly and accurately defined a consistent rule governing torpor use in hummingbirds. A detailed examination of the data (supplementary figures 6 and 7) suggests that the occurrence of torpor and the pattern of body mass change over time is specific to individuals. I will strongly recommend that individual patterns be explored. Some individuals may go into torpor regardless of whether the body fat threshold is reached or not. The three fattening birds are a typical example of inter-individual variation.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree the phrasing of this was not clear with respect to the use of “repeatedly”. We originally meant that we are the first study to make repeated measurements of fat content at torpor entry in the same individuals over time, as previous studies had either used terminal methods and only had one point per bird, or measured only body mass in the same individuals. We have adjusted the phrasing to be more clear (351-352). We have addressed individual variation above.</p></body></sub-article></article>
