activation of the complement cascade within the immune system. The biological activity of properdin depends on the oligomerization state, but whether properdin oligomers are rigid and how their structure links to function remains unknown. We show by combining electron microscopy and solution scattering, that properdin oligomers adopt extended rigid and well-defined conformations which are well approximated by single models of apparent n-fold rotational symmetry with dimensions of 230–360 Å. Properdin monomers are pretzel-shaped molecules with limited flexibility. In solution, properdin dimers are curved molecules, whereas trimers and tetramers are close to being planar molecules. Structural analysis indicates that simultaneous binding through all binding sites to surface-linked convertases is unlikely for properdin trimer and tetramers. We show that multivalency alone is insufficient for full activity in a cell lysis assay. Hence, the observed rigid extended oligomer structure is an integral component of properdin function.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>SAXS</kwd><kwd>electron microscopy</kwd><kwd>MD simulation</kwd><kwd>complement</kwd><kwd>protease</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003554</institution-id><institution>Lundbeckfonden</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R155-2015-2666</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pedersen</surname><given-names>Dennis V</given-names></name><name><surname>Mazarakis</surname><given-names>Sofia MM</given-names></name><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Yong</given-names></name><name><surname>Lindorff-Larsen</surname><given-names>Kresten</given-names></name><name><surname>Arleth</surname><given-names>Lise</given-names></name><name><surname>Andersen</surname><given-names>Gregers R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100009708</institution-id><institution>Novo Nordisk Fonden</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NNF16OC0022058</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pedersen</surname><given-names>Dennis V</given-names></name><name><surname>Mazarakis</surname><given-names>Sofia MM</given-names></name><name><surname>Andersen</surname><given-names>Gregers R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100009708</institution-id><institution>Novo Nordisk Fonden</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NNF18OC0032608</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lindorff-Larsen</surname><given-names>Kresten</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Combining electron microscopy and solution scattering demonstrated that properdin oligomers adopt extended rigid and well-defined conformations that are integral to the biological function of this complement regulator.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The complement system is an essential aspect of innate immunity providing a first line of defense against invading pathogens as well as maintenance of host homeostasis. The complement cascade is activated when circulating pattern recognition molecules recognize molecular patterns on a pathogen, dying host cells, or immune complexes. Activation can initiate through the classical pathway, the lectin pathway, or the alternative pathway (AP) where the AP also provides an amplification loop for the two other pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bajic et al., 2015</xref>). In all three pathways, labile protein complexes known as C3 and C5 convertases are assembled. These convertases conduct proteolytic cleavage of complement components C3 and C5, respectively, resulting in the generation of opsonins (C3b and iC3b), anaphylatoxins (C3a and C5a), and assembly of the membrane attack complex (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bajic et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>In the AP, the C3-convertase C3bBb is formed when a complex between C3b and the serine protease factor B (FB) is activated by factor D. At a high surface density of C3b, this C3 convertase becomes a C5 convertase. Properdin (FP) is a positive regulator of these convertases. FP is a 53 kDa protein composed of an N-terminal TGF-β binding (TB) domain followed by six thrombospondin type I repeats (TSR1-6). The protein is heavily post-translationally modified carrying one N-linked glycan, four O-linked glycans, and 14–17 C-mannosylated tryptophan residues in the WxxW motifs present in TSR1-6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Pedersen et al., 2019a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">van den Bos et al., 2019</xref>). FP is produced predominantly by monocytes, T cells, and neutrophils and circulates as oligomers and is primarily found as dimers, trimers, and tetramers with a 1:2:1 molar distribution in plasma at a concentration of 4–25 μg/mL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Blatt et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Pangburn, 1989</xref>). The functions of FP in relation to AP convertases are well established. (1) FP enhances the recruitment of FB to C3b and thereby stimulates proconvertase assembly; (2) FP slows the dissociation of C3bBb 5- to 10-fold; and (3) FP directly competes with factor I resulting in decreased irreversible degradation of C3b to iC3b (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Pedersen et al., 2019a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Pedersen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">DiScipio, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fearon and Austen, 1975</xref>). Other suggested functions of FP are as a C3b-independent pattern recognition molecule capable of triggering the AP (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Blatt et al., 2016</xref>) and as a ligand for the NKp46 receptor on innate lymphoid cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Narni-Mancinelli et al., 2017</xref>). The importance of FP in innate immunity and homeostasis is demonstrated by individuals with FP deficiency (PD). PD is a rare X-linked disorder, which can be divided into three subtypes: type I (complete lack of FP), type II (1–10% of normal plasma FP level), and type III (normal plasma level but dysfunctional FP). All PD types are characterized by reduced AP activity, resulting in impaired bactericidal activity and increased susceptibility to Neisseria infections and sepsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Skattum et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Classic negative-stain EM (nsEM) studies of FP dimers, trimers, and tetramers revealed that FP oligomers contain compact eye-shaped vertexes connected by thin connecting structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Smith et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Higgins et al., 1995</xref>). Alcorlo and coworkers presented the first 3D reconstruction of the FP eye-shaped vertices in oligomers and 2D classes of the FP-C3bBb convertase complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alcorlo et al., 2013</xref>). Recently, crystal structures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Pedersen et al., 2019a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">van den Bos et al., 2019</xref> demonstrated that FP oligomers are formed upon interaction of the TB domain and TSR1 from one FP monomer with TSR4, TSR5, and TSR6 from a second FP monomer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In addition, it was established that the binding site for C3b is formed by FP TSR5 in conjunction with a large loop from TSR6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Pedersen et al., 2019a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">van den Bos et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Pedersen et al., 2017</xref>). Despite prior attempts to analyze FP dimers and trimers with small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and analytical ultracentrifugation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sun et al., 2004</xref>), detailed information regarding the structure and the dynamic properties of FP oligomers is missing. Here we present for the first time a structural description of intact oligomeric FP obtained through a combination of nsEM and SAXS. Based on the recent crystal structures of monomeric FP, we are able to annotate all FP domains in monomeric, dimeric, trimeric, and tetrameric FP in EM 2D classes. Pair distance distributions and atomic models based on solution scattering suggest that the FP oligomers are rather rigid in solution despite their very open structure and that their average conformations have cyclic symmetry. In addition, we demonstrate that the defined structure of FP oligomers is crucial for their biological function.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Principles of properdin architecture and the structure of FP1.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of the FP1 monomer and FP2 as an example of an oligomer, where one subunit is colored gray, while the other is colored according to the domain structure as for FP1.

The different FP oligomers were subsequently separated by cation exchange and size exclusion chromatography (SEC). As expected, both recombinant and plasma-derived FP eluted in multiple peaks corresponding to the different oligomerization states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Besides dimeric, trimeric, and tetrameric FP, we also observed a small amount of monomeric FP (FP1) in both recombinant and plasma-derived samples eluting after 14.0 mL corresponding to a molecular weight (MW) of approx. 90 kDa. This apparent MW is significantly larger than the theoretical MW for monomeric FP (53 kDa) due to glycosylations and a non-globular shape but is identical to the observed MW for the monomeric and disease-associated FP variant E244K described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Pedersen et al., 2017</xref>). We were able to purify a significant amount of FP1, which allowed us to obtain nsEM data for a wild-type FP monomer. The resulting 2D classes revealed a flat pretzel-shaped molecule with apparent overall projected dimensions of 95 × 115 Å containing a small and a large ring-shaped structure sharing one edge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Due to a strong preference in the orientation of FP1, we could not obtain a 3D reconstruction of the molecule. We previously described the non-inhibitory nanobody hFPNb1 that binds FP TSR4 within the SCIN stabilized C3bBbFP complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Pedersen et al., 2019a</xref>). By analyzing nsEM 2D classes obtained for FP1 in complex with the nanobody hFPNb1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), we could identify with certainty the position of TSR4 and thereafter the remaining domains in the 2D classes of FP1 and nanobody-bound FP1. The small ring of the FP1 molecule corresponds to the well-described FP ‘eye’ formed by the TB domain, TSR1, TSR5, and TSR6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Pedersen et al., 2019a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">van den Bos et al., 2019</xref>), whereas the larger ring is formed by TSR2, TSR3, and TSR4 together with the TB domain and TSR1.</p><p>Based on the crystal structure of the recombinant two-chain monomer FPc in which TSR3 and TSR4 are not connected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Pedersen et al., 2019a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Pedersen et al., 2017</xref>), we manually constructed an atomic starting model in accordance with the FP1 2D classes and performed rigid-body refinement of this model against existing SAXS data obtained for the FP1 carrying the E244K mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Pedersen et al., 2017</xref>). Distance restraints secured appropriate distances across the TSR1–TSR2, TSR2–TSR3, and TSR3–TSR4 interfaces and maintained an appropriate distance between the disulfide bridged Cys132 in TSR1 and Cys170 in TSR2. The resulting models clustered tightly and fitted the data with χ<sup>2</sup> = 1.6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–E</xref>). The SAXS models strongly resembled the EM 2D classes obtained for the wild-type (WT) FP1 monomer. The <italic>p</italic>(<italic>r</italic>) function derived from our published SAXS data on the FP E244K monomer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Pedersen et al., 2017</xref>) approaches zero at about 130 Å with a small-tail stretching out to a <italic>D<sub>max</sub></italic> at 150 Å (see insert to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). This agrees with the maximum extent of 140 Å in the nsEM 2D class projections.</p><p>To obtain insight into the dynamic properties of FP E244K, we conducted explicit solvent atomistic molecular dynamics simulations of a complete model of FP E244K at microsecond timescale initiating from our SAXS model obtained by rigid-body modeling (<xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video1">Figure 1—video 1</xref>). The model included the Asn-linked complex glycan, Ser/Thr O-linked glucose-fucose, and the C-linked mannosylations on TSR tryptophans (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). The SAXS curve calculated from the ensemble of conformations sampled by molecular dynamics simulations is in good agreement with the experimental SAXS data (χ<sup>2</sup> = 2.2). By using experimental data to guide the refinement of the conformational ensemble, the fit could be further improved to χ<sup>2</sup> = 1.4 using the Bayesian maximum entropy (BME) method (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). Models in this ensemble resembled the FP E244K output models from the SAXS rigid-body refinement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) and the 2D classes obtained by EM of wild-type FP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Although the mutation E244K is expected to weaken the Trp-Arg stack in TSR3, the Trp-Arg stack remained intact throughout the molecular dynamics (MD) simulation (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). However, two independent MD simulations together suggested that TSR3 inserted between TSR2 and TSR4 is capable of rotating as a rigid body with limited conformational flexibility within domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). This domain rotation was apparently facilitated by high mobility of the TSR4 loop region Asn285-Phe295 facing TSR3, which is in excellent agreement with weak electron density we observed for this region in two crystal structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Pedersen et al., 2019a</xref>). At the TSR2–TSR3 junction, the corresponding TSR3 loop Ser225-Pro237 facing TSR2 likewise exhibited flexibility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C,D</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video1">Figure 1—video 1</xref>). For the remaining parts of FP E244K, the simulation did not indicate significant mobility, and in particular the two loops in TSR5 and TSR6 involved in convertase recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Pedersen et al., 2019a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">van den Bos et al., 2019</xref>) did not exhibit significant changes in backbone conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video1">Figure 1—video 1</xref>). Overall, the nsEM 2D classes for WT FP1 and the SAXS data for FP E244K provided the first quasi-atomic experimental model for the monomeric FP1 and FP E244K.

In one extreme 2D class, FP2 appeared as a folded dimer adopting a double-pretzel structure with a maximum dimension of 210 Å where the two connecting arms are crossing over at TSR3, and like in FP1, the TSR2–TSR3 angle is sharply bent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).

Other 2D classes obtained with hFPNb1 presented conformations that were intermediate between the open dimer observed in the absence of hFPNb1 and the folded dimer. A comparison of the SEC profiles supported significant conformational effects of hFPNb1 on FP2 in solution prior to EM sample preparation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>).

In these classes, FP3 appeared in projection as flat triangular molecules with pseudo-C<sub>3</sub> symmetry having maximum edges of 280 Å with mainly straight connections formed by TSR2, TSR3, and TSR4 between the vertices. Again, when hFPNb1 was present, some 2D classes contained a less planar FP3 with a maximal dimension of 240 Å where only the eye-shaped vertices could be unambiguously identified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).

For both FP3 and FP4 2D classes, a kink was occasionally observed, presumably at the TSR2–TSR3 interface, in at least one of the TSR2–TSR3–TSR4 connections. In summary, our nsEM analysis revealed unambiguous 2D classes for all the naturally occurring FP oligomers, and in all three cases, the vast majority of classified particles were present in rather similar classes representing flat molecules with apparent C<sub>n</sub> symmetry. Furthermore, the oligomer conformations observed in our 2D classes were not rare since the sum of particles used for the 2D classes for all three oligomers represented at least 50% of the particles picked (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Intriguingly, we also observed that the TSR4-specific hFPNb1 could induce alternative folded conformations of the TSR2–TSR3–TSR4 arms in FP2 and FP3 that appeared to be in equilibrium through intermediates with their elliptical and flat triangular conformations.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>The solution conformation of FP oligomers</title><p>Taking an orthogonal approach to our nsEM analysis of the FP oligomers, we collected SEC-SAXS and static SAXS data for FP2, FP3, and FP4 that was SEC fractionated prior to SAXS analysis to obtain samples optimized with respect to the relevant FP oligomer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A–G</xref>).

The presence of these pronounced features clearly indicates that the oligomers are rather rigid and well defined. If conformational freedom had been present, this would smear out the SAXS data. The <italic>p</italic>(<italic>r</italic>) functions of FP1, FP2, FP3, and FP4 all exhibit an initial bump at around 40 Å corresponding well to the repeated distance across the eye that is also visible in the nsEM pictures of all three oligomers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>). The FP2 has a <italic>D<sub>max</sub></italic> value of 230 Å. Along with a second well-defined peak at around 80 Å, which is most likely related to the distance between the two antiparallel arms connecting the two eyes, the D<sub>max</sub> value indicates that the FP2 solution structure is in better agreement with the extended conformation of FP2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), than it is with the more compact twisted conformation induced by hFPNb1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Finally, the <italic>p</italic>(<italic>r</italic>) of FP2 has a broad peak at 165 Å corresponding well to the distance between the two eyes.

For the FP3 and FP4, the <italic>p</italic>(<italic>r</italic>) middle peak at around 80–100 Å appears broader, less pronounced, and moves to higher values as the oligomer size increases. FP3 and FP4 have a high <italic>p</italic>(<italic>r</italic>) peak at 180 and 195 Å, respectively, which is most likely the result of neighbor eye–eye distances. The increase of the eye–eye peak position when comparing FP2, FP3, and FP4 suggests that the eyes organize in a more planar structure as the oligomerization increases. Furthermore, the FP4 <italic>p</italic>(<italic>r</italic>) function exhibits an additional small shoulder at 280 Å, which corresponds well to the less-frequent diagonal eye–eye distances.

Interestingly, the FP2 SAXS models appeared more curved as compared to the extended conformations present in EM 2D classes. In contrast to the nsEM 2D classes, the rigid-body models cannot be projected such that the two eye shapes at the opposite ends of FP2 become visible simultaneously. Hence, either rigid-body modeling could not reach the conformation observed in nsEM or the FP2 conformation is influenced by the stain and contacts with the grid and therefore become excessively flat in our 2D nsEM classes. An effect of the grid is in accordance with a lower solution <italic>D<sub>max</sub></italic> compared to the maximum extent of FP2 in nsEM 2D classes.</p><p>Using the same strategy, we generated models of FP3 and FP4 by rigid-body modeling. In contrast to FP2, the χ<sup>2</sup> values for the fit of the best models to the experimental data were comparable and in the range 1.1–1.4, indicating that the experimental data could be fitted well with single models. Importantly, the χ<sup>2</sup> values of the output models generated with C<sub>3</sub>/C<sub>4</sub> symmetry were similar to those generated with C<sub>1</sub> symmetry demonstrating that the fit to the data was independent of symmetry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B,C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D,E</xref>). All models generated with C<sub>1</sub> symmetry were qualitatively similar extended circularized structures with their three or four eye-shaped structures joined by peripheral TSR2–TSR3–TSR4 connecting arms in agreement with the FP3 and FP4 nsEM 2D classes. As for FP2, in the models generated with C<sub>1</sub> symmetry, it was never possible to obtain projections of these SAXS models in which all eyes in FP3 and FP4 were visible. Otherwise, the SAXS models had strong resemblance to the 2D classes including an occasional kink in a TSR2–TSR3–TSR4 connection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B,C</xref>). When C<sub>3</sub>/C<sub>4</sub> symmetry was assumed during refinement, some models were trapped in a local minimum and gave rise to highly elevated χ<sup>2</sup> values and models that were distinctly different from those with the lowest χ<sup>2</sup> values. In contrast, the best-fitting models were all open and extended with TSR2–TSR3 at the periphery similar to those obtained with C<sub>1</sub> symmetry. For some of these models, it was possible to visualize all eyes simultaneously in projections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B,C</xref>), which is in agreement with FP3 and FP4 nsEM 2D classes. Overall, our SAXS analysis of FP oligomers were in agreement with the corresponding nsEM 2D classes and suggests that the average solution conformation of FP3 and FP4 are well approximated by single models with C<sub>3</sub> and C<sub>4</sub> symmetry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D,E</xref>). With respect to FP2, the situation is less clear as the experimental data were fitted less well in the presence of C<sub>2</sub> symmetry, suggesting that the average FP2 conformation may be non-symmetric. Alternatively, the lower number of degrees of freedom in our rigid-body refinement performed with C<sub>2</sub> symmetry prohibits fitting the data to the extent feasible with C<sub>1</sub> symmetry and more degrees of freedom. In addition, the SAXS-based models of FP2 appear more curved than those appearing in the nsEM classes, and an effect of the EM sample preparation on the FP2 conformation cannot be excluded.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>The oligomerization interfaces can undergo very slow exchange</title><p>The oligomer distribution of FP in plasma is believed to be stable.

However, whether monomer–monomer interactions occasionally loosen up and thereby enable exchange of monomers between oligomers has never been addressed. Our prior purification of the two-chain monomeric FP molecules FPhtΔ3 and FPc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Pedersen et al., 2019a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Pedersen et al., 2017</xref>) never suggested that the two chains dissociated under native conditions.

To investigate the stability of the FP oligomerization interfaces, we mixed our two-chain monomer FPc with the two-chain deletion mutant FPhtΔ3 monomer lacking TSR3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). After incubation at 37°C, we purified FP molecules containing the His-tagged TSR4-6 tail fragment of FPhtΔ3. Using sodium dodecyl sulphate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS–PAGE) analysis, we observed that over time an increasing amount of the longer head fragment from FPc (TB-TSR1–3) co-purified with the His-tagged tail fragment from FPhtΔ3, while the amount of co-purified short FPhtΔ3 head fragment (TB-TSR1–2) decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Exchange between the two FP monomers was evident after 30 min and reached equilibrium after 12 hr. To examine monomer exchange into an FP oligomer, we conducted the same experiment with FP2 and FPhtΔ3. We observed that over time, an increasing amount of full-length FP from FP2 co-purified with the FPhtΔ3 his-tagged TSR4-6 fragment, and in this case, exchange was evident after 2 hr and complete in 6–12 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). In conclusion, these experiments demonstrated that the oligomerization interfaces in FP can open temporarily and even exchange monomers with a different FP molecule under the physiologically relevant experimental conditions containing 20 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl pH 7.5. The exchange occurs rather slowly in our pure system, but could occur faster in a specific microenvironment in vivo.

In FPn, there are n binding sites for C3b each located at the concave face of TSR5, and our prior structures of FP-bound C3bBb revealed that C3b binds with its major axis roughly parallel to the plane of the FP eye formed by the TB domain, TSR1, TSR5, and TSR6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Pedersen et al., 2019b</xref>). Hence, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> for FP2, an oligomer with its n convertase binding sites pointing in the same direction will have the optimal architecture for binding simultaneously to n C3b molecules deposited on an activator. Due to the overall flat shape of FP oligomers, the minor principal axis is the C<sub>n</sub> rotation axis perpendicular to the plane of the models generated with C<sub>n</sub> symmetry and a pseudo n-fold rotation axis for models generated with C<sub>1</sub> symmetry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). We could therefore quantitate the relative orientation of the convertase binding sites in our FP SAXS models by measuring the angle α between an appropriate vector lying in the plane of each FP eye and the smallest principal axis of the oligomer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). At the maximum value, α = 180°, the n convertase binding sites in an FP oligomer will point in the same direction and simultaneously binding at all convertase binding sites by C3b on a planar activator appears possible. At its minimum value, α = 90°, the convertase binding sites are parallel to the plane of the FP oligomer defined by the major and intermediate principal axes and simultaneous binding to more than two C3b molecules on a planar activator appears unlikely. We observe a clear decrease in α as a function of oligomer size with α ~150°, 128°, and 109° for our SAXS-based models of FP2, FP3, and FP4, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). A decrease in α with increasing multiplicity is in agreement with the shift of a major peak in the pair distance functions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1H</xref>) described above. This peak largely reflects the separation of neighboring FP eyes, and in curved oligomers, this separation will be smaller than in planar oligomers.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Oligomerization alone cannot rescue FP activity</title><p>The activity of FP oligomers in assays exploring complement-dependent erythrocyte lysis follows the order FP4&gt;FP3&gt;FP2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Pangburn, 1989</xref>), while E244K FP1 and the two-chain monomers FPc are much less active in convertase stabilization on erythrocytes and bactericidal activity compared to oligomeric FP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Pedersen et al., 2017</xref>). To investigate the importance of FP oligomerization and its three-dimensional structure for activity, we linked 2, 3, or 4 copies of hFPNb1 with glycine–serine linkers in expression vectors and purified the resulting hFPNb1<sub>2</sub>, hFPNb1<sub>3</sub>, hFPNb1<sub>4</sub>. Using size exclusion chromatography, we showed that these multivalent hFPNb1 could form the expected complexes with the two-chain monomer FPc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,B</xref>). Next, we compared the activity in erythrocyte lysis in FP depleted serum of free FPc and such nanobody-linked FPc oligomers to an FP pool containing roughly equal amounts of FP2 and FP3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>). As expected, the two-chain FPc monomer required a 100-fold higher concentration compared with the FP2/FP3 oligomer pool to elicit a similar degree of lysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). The activities of the nanobody-linked FPc oligomers were in between the activities of the FP2/FP3 pool and FPc and increased with the hFPNb1 valency of the oligomers. The erythrocyte lysis activity of these hFPNb1-linked FPc oligomers also correlated well with the dissociation of the hFPNb1-linked FPc oligomers from a C3b-coated biolayer interferometry sensor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). The FPc-hFPNb1 complex dissociated from the sensor within 75 s after transfer to the dissociation buffer. In contrast, no dissociation was observed for the FPc-hFPNb1<sub>4</sub> complex, while approx. 10% and 22% had dissociated within 75 s from the FPc-hFPNb1<sub>3</sub> and FPc-hFPNb1<sub>2</sub> complexes, respectively. In conclusion, FP activity can only be partially restored by linking FPc monomers together with the multivalent versions of hFPNb1. Importantly, these nanobody-linked FPc oligomers exhibited the anticipated slower dissociation from the C3b-coated sensor compared to the FPc monomer demonstrating that the low biological activity is not due to lack of avidity for a C3b-coated surface.

Right, FP-convertase binding sites not pointing toward the activator surface reach &gt;300 Å into solution and appear as ideal for bridging C3b-opsonized pathogens with NKp46 presenting innate lymphoid cells.

This is a surprising finding considering that EM 2D classes of an FP oligomer have not previously been presented and the large flexibility at especially the TSR2–TSR3 and TSR3–TSR4 connections required to reach the very tight FP1 conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–D</xref>) as compared to FP crystal structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Pedersen et al., 2019a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">van den Bos et al., 2019</xref>). The rigidity of FP oligomers is directly manifested by the pronounced oscillations in the SAXS data leading to well-defined peaks in the pair distance distributions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1H</xref>) that present sharp peaks between 150 and 210 Å originating from the separation of neighboring FP eyes. If the oligomers were flexible, these oscillations would be less well defined.</p><p>The solution structures of FP2 and FP3 were earlier investigated by Sun and coworkers with SAXS and analytical ultracentrifugation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sun et al., 2004</xref>) and gave R<sub>g</sub> values comparable to those presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>. Their best-fitting FP2 models bear weak overall resemblance to our FP2 models, but their best-fitting FP3 model is rather different from the models we obtained. Furthermore, an extended model resembling our models of FP3 did not fit the scattering data in the study by Sun et al. One reason for these discrepancies is beyond doubt that Sun et al. did not have a detailed model of FP to base their rigid-body modeling on, and in particular they missed the crucial information regarding the stable eye structure formed by the TB domain, TSR1, TSR5, and TSR6, which we used as a single rigid body. They also used a TSR based homology model as a proxy for the N-terminal region that is a TB domain. In addition, the resolution of SAXS data in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sun et al., 2004</xref> was much lower with significant noise at q-values above 0.1 Å<sup>−1</sup>, whereas we had only limited noise in the data in the range q &lt; 0.27 Å<sup>−1</sup> used for rigid-body refinement. The strong preference of FP oligomers for orienting with the plane of the molecule parallel to the grid suggests that achieving high-resolution cryo-EM 3D reconstructions of these unique extended structures will be an extremely challenging task. Alternatively, FP oligomers bound to a C3b- or convertase-coated activator model may be studied with cryo-electron tomography as pioneered by Sharp and Gros for large assemblies of complement proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sharp et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sharp et al., 2016</xref>). </p><p>The correlation between FP oligomerization and biological activity is well established and early on it was demonstrated that FP4 and FP3 bind much more avidly to C3b-coated erythrocytes compared to FP2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Pangburn, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Pedersen et al., 2017</xref>). Structural studies demonstrated that the binding site for C3b is located with an eye-shaped vertex formed by FP TSR5 and TSR6 in one FP monomer together with the TB domain and TSR1 from a second monomer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Pedersen et al., 2019a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">van den Bos et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alcorlo et al., 2013</xref>). However, our functional studies revealed that FP oligomerization is not strictly required for C3b binding, stimulation of C3bB assembly, inhibition of C3bBb dissociation and competition with FI, since these activities are supported to some degree by the recombinant monomeric two-chain FPc molecule in which TSR3 and TSR4 are not connected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Pedersen et al., 2019a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Pedersen et al., 2017</xref>). The simplest explanation for the correlation between FP oligomer stoichiometry and biological activity is that of avidity due to the linking of multiple convertase binding sites and that the specific structure of FP oligomers is not important. However, such a simple model is incompatible with evidence presented in this study. We have shown that FP oligomers are structurally well ordered rather than modular structures connected by dynamic hinges (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>). We also demonstrated that biological activity cannot be rescued solely by linking of multiple monomeric FP molecules <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">(Figure 5C,D</xref>).</p><p>Our findings with respect to the role of FP oligomerization in biological activity are summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>. Initial monovalent binding occurs when a single FP eye engages with C3b, proconvertase, or convertase. If subsequent bivalent binding occurs, it is likely to be stimulated by FB binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">DiScipio, 1981</xref>). The average separation of ~200 Å between convertase binding sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–D</xref>) maintained by the rigid structure of FP oligomers also appears compatible with EM analysis of erythrocytes activated through the classic pathway that visualized tight clusters of 10–40 C3b molecules extending over 400–800 Å (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Mardiney et al., 1968</xref>). Nevertheless, whether simultaneous interactions between oligomeric FP and multiple C3b molecules actually occur in vivo remains to be shown. Our prior SPR data showed a 450× lower apparent K<sub>D</sub> value for immobilized C3b and fluid-phase oligomeric FP as compared to the reverse geometry, but this experiment could not distinguish between the relative contributions from multivalent binding and a high local concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Pedersen et al., 2017</xref>). In contrast, classic binding experiments measuring association with erythrocyte-bound C3bB and zymosan-C3b complexes suggested that FP oligomers bind to a C3b opsonized activator in a monovalent fashion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">DiScipio, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Farries et al., 1988</xref>), arguing that the local high concentration of convertase-binding sites underlies the correlation between biological activity and oligomer stoichiometry.</p><p>Although we do not know in details the oligomer distribution of FP in non-mammals, the domain structure with the TB domain followed by six thrombospondin repeats is with certainty also present in properdin sequences from amphibians, reptiles, birds, teleosts, and the agnatha <italic>Petromyzon marinus</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). This evolutionary conservation supports that a defined spatial separation of convertase-binding sites in FP oligomers is important for its function. For antibodies, it is known that the flexibility of the Fab-Fc hinge enables ‘walking’ over the antigen in search for bivalent attachment on spatially defined multivalent epitopes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zhang et al., 2020a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Preiner et al., 2014</xref>). But since our results indicate that FP oligomers are quite rigid, these multivalent molecules seem not to be designed for ‘walking’ over the C3b-opsonized activator. Instead, the inherent flexibility of C3b and its attachment through a single covalent bond to the activator may favor multivalent FP-convertase complexes or fast rebinding through a neighboring convertase binding site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>).</p><p>One reservation with respect to the model of FP structure–function relationships presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref> is that our EM 2D classes obtained with the TSR4 binding hFPNb1 nanobody revealed intricate folded conformations and intermediates between the extended flat cyclic conformation observed in the absence of the nanobody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,D</xref>). This emphasizes that the FP oligomer structures we present in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> reflect their solution conformation, but the structure may be quite different for oligomers bound to surface bound C3b and convertases on activators and NKp46 on innate lymphoid cells.</p><p>Interestingly, our structures also predict that empty C3b/convertase binding sites in FP3 and FP4 point in a direction opposite to the occupied site(s) due to their α angle being far from 180° (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5E</xref>). We estimate that such unoccupied convertase binding sites in FP3 and FP4 may protrude more than 300 Å from the thioester–activator linkage of the C3b to which an existing monovalent interaction occurs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). Such empty binding sites also appear to be suitable for bridging a C3b-opsonized cell with a second cell. Historically, FP-driven agglutination of erythrocytes was associated with large non-physiologically FP oligomers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Farries et al., 1987</xref>), but the contribution from each of the three naturally occurring FP oligomers to agglutination of C3b-opsonized bacteria remains unknown. Perhaps more relevant for in vivo activity, FP can also bridge C3b-opsonized bacteria with host innate lymphoid cells presenting the NKp46 receptor, an interaction shown to be required for survival in an animal model of <italic>Neisseria meningitidis</italic> infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Narni-Mancinelli et al., 2017</xref>). Possibly, lack of this cell-bridging function is an important element in the phenotypes of FP deficiencies in addition to compromised convertase stabilization due to weaker binding to C3b on opsonized pathogens. Interestingly, administration of recombinant FP with a high content of FP tetramers and higher oligomers was protective in mouse models of infection with <italic>N. meningitidis</italic> and <italic>Streptococcus pneumonia</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ali et al., 2014</xref>). Possibly, the bridging of bacteria and innate lymphoid cells by larger FP oligomers contributed significantly to the beneficial effects of recombinant FP administration. Very recently, FP4, but not FP3 and FP2, was shown to act as a C3b-independent pattern recognition molecule on bacteria binding soluble collectin 12 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zhang et al., 2020b</xref>), suggesting a specialized function of FP4.</p><p>Our identification of FP oligomers as rigid molecules with a potential for bridging C3b-opsonized cells with other cells may assist future studies analyzing the role of FP in complement-driven pathogenesis and facilitate new strategies for therapeutic modulation of FP activity. Inhibition of FP by function-blocking anti-mouse FP mAbs or FP gene deletion has demonstrated beneficial effects in murine models of arthritis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kimura et al., 2010</xref>), renal ischemia-reperfusion injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Miwa et al., 2013</xref>), allergen-induced airway inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wang et al., 2015</xref>), abdominal aortic aneurysm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bertram et al., 2015</xref>), and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ueda et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2020</xref>). Finally, our results should promote experiments clarifying how FP oligomers may act as C3b-independent pattern recognition molecules capable of initiating the AP.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>Escherichia coli</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>E. coli</italic> BL21(DE3) LOBSTR strain</td><td>PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23852738">23852738</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/><td>hFPNb1 expression system</td></tr><tr><td>Cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td>HEK293F</td><td>Thermo Fisher Scientific</td><td>R79007</td><td>FP expression system</td></tr><tr><td>Transfected construct (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td>FP</td><td>This paper</td><td/><td>Construct used for expression and purification of the different FP oligomers.

Fractions containing 0.1 M glycine pH 2.3 were neutralized with 100 µL 2 M Tris pH 8.5 before SDS–PAGE analysis. Five micrograms of FPc or dimeric FP were mixed with 5 µg of the his-tagged FPhtΔ3 in 100 µL of 20 mM HEPES, and 150 mM NaCl pH 7.5 and were incubated on ice for 5 min or at 37°C for 5 min, 30 min, 2 hr, 6 hr, 12 hr, 24 hr, or 7 days. As a positive control, 5 µg of FPc or FP was mixed with 5 µg of FPhtΔ3 in 100 µL 20 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl pH 7.5 and subsequently acidified by adding 100 µL 0.1 M glycine pH 2.3 to cause oligomer dissociation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Pangburn, 1989</xref>). The sample was incubated for 5 min at room temperature before 20 µL of 2M Tris pH 8.5 was added for neutralization. Pull-downs were performed on all samples using 50 µL of Ni-NTA beads. The beads were transferred to a 1 mL spin columns (Bio-Rad) and equilibrated in 100 mM HEPES, 0.5 M NaCl, 30 mM imidazole pH 7.5. The samples were then transferred to the columns and incubated for 2 min, followed by a 30 s centrifugation step at 70 g. The beads were washed five times with 500 µL of 100 mM HEPES, 0.5 M NaCl, 30 mM imidazole pH 7.5 before bound protein was eluted with 80 µL of 100 mM HEPES, 0.5 M NaCl, and 400 mM imidazole pH 7.5. The eluates were retrieved from the columns by a 30 s centrifugation step at 70 g. The eluates were re-applied to the column, and the centrifugation step was repeated. The samples were analyzed under non-reducing conditions on a 12% SDS–PAGE gel (GenScript) using the SilverQuest silver staining kit (Invitrogen). The oligomeric FP used in this assay was approximately 90% dimer and 10% trimer as judged by SEC analysis performed on 24 mL Superdex 200 increase column (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1G</xref>). An SEC standard (Bio-Rad) was used for comparison.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Biolayer interferometry assays</title><p>Biolayer interferometry experiments were performed on an Octet Red96 (ForteBio) at 30°C and shaking at 1000 RPM. Binding of hFPNb1:FPc complexes was tested on streptavidin sensor tips (SA, ForteBio) equilibrated in assay buffer (phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 1 mg/mL bovine serum albumin and 0.05% Tween 20) and coated with biotinylated C3b at 16 µg/mL for 10 min. FPc or hFPNb1:FPc complexes were prepared by size exclusion chromatography and diluted to 50 µg FPc/mL in assay buffer. Association was monitored for 120 s followed by 120 s dissociation in assay buffer.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Erythrocyte lysis assay for AP activity</title><p>Rabbit erythrocytes (Er) in 11.38 mM <sc>d</sc>-glucose, 2.72 mM mono basic sodium citrate, 2.19 mM citric acid, and 7.19 mM NaCl (Alsever’s solution, Statens Seruminstitut) were washed and re-suspended in AP assay buffer (5 mM barbital, 145 mM NaCl, 10 mM EGTA, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, pH 7.4, with 0.1% [wt/vol] gelatin) to obtain a 6% (vol/vol) suspension. Samples of 20 μL human FP‐depleted serum diluted in assay buffer and supplemented with WT FP, FPc, or hFPNb1-FPc complexes were prepared separately and then transferred to a V‐shaped bottom 96‐well microtiter plate (Nunc) in duplicates. The WT FP used for this assay was approximately 50% dimer and 50% trimer as judged by SEC analysis performed on a 24 mL Superdex 200 increase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>). Ten microliters of the Er suspension were then transferred to the assay plate. The plate was mixed well and incubated for 2 hr at 37°C and shaken every 30 min. Hemolysis was stopped by adding 40 µL ice-cold 0.9% NaCl, 5 mM EDTA to each well. The plate was centrifuged at 90 <italic>g</italic> for 10 min, and 50 µL of each supernatant was subsequently transferred to a flat-bottom microtiter well plate (Nunc). Hemolysis was then determined from the A<sub>405</sub> measured on a Victor3 plate reader (PerkinElmer). Results are expressed relative to total hemolysis (obtained with water alone) and to background hemolysis (EDTA sample).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank the staff at the P12 beamline at PETRAIII for help during data collection and Karen Margrethe Nielsen and Anette Hansen for technical support.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Brian V Geisbrecht as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Cynthia Wolberger as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Viviana Ferreira (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, we are asking editors to accept without delay manuscripts, like yours, that they judge can stand as <italic>eLife</italic> papers without additional data, even if they feel that they would make the manuscript stronger. Thus the revisions requested below only address clarity and presentation.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The manuscript under consideration has provided the following insights to our understanding of properdin structure/function:</p><p>1) Building upon previous work published by Alcorlo et al. in 2013 (Alcorlo et al., 2013), the authors use a recombinant preparation of properdin to isolate defined subpopulations of properdin oligomers and characterize these structures by a combination of negative stained electron microscopy and small-angle X-ray scattering. This work reveals that properdin oligomers are structurally rigid entities where the various oligomerization states are defined by rotational symmetry.</p><p>2) Using an immunoaffinity reagent, the authors further assign the locations of individual domains in the various oligomerization states of properdin. This allows a greater level of structural insight than is currently available.</p><p>3) The authors continue by showing that the structural rigidity of properdin oligomers impairs the extent to which additional convertase binding sites in properdin oligomers can interact with nearby convertases. This implies, but does not demonstrate directly, that these other sites may function in clustering C3b-opsonized cells for clearance.</p><p>4) Finally, the authors provide evidence that biological cross-linking of properdin alone and driving its oligomerization isn't sufficient to restore full biological activity. This result lends support to the concept that the rigid and well-defined structures of properdin oligomers are main determinants of its function.</p><p>All reviewers agree that the quality of the structural data in this manuscript are impressive. By themselves, however, these data do not expand all that much our understanding of properdin from what was presented in the Alcorlo paper from 2013. There is some sentiment that the authors overstate the novelty of this work to some degree. Recognizing this limitation, all reviewers agree that the results enumerated in points 2-4 above are important and will benefit the field moving forward. Although these points are not necessarily paradigm shifting, they collectively help further our knowledge of what remains one of the least understood components of the complement system. While each reviewer has offered some minor areas for improvement in their individual critiques, all three agree on two major points in need of clarification by revision. Since all of these items can be addressed by text revision, no further experiments are required at this point.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) In the subsection entitled &quot;The oligomerization interfaces…&quot;, the authors state that &quot;these experiments for the first time demonstrated that the oligomerization interfaces in FP can open temporarily and even exchange monomers with a different FP molecule under physiologically relevant experimental conditions.&quot; However, the rearrangement of properdin oligomers was first shown by Pangburn in 1989 (Pangburn, 1989). They should remove the statement &quot;for the first time&quot; or re-word it. In addition, the authors state that &quot;the exchange occurs rather slowly in our pure system and is probably not a significant reaction in the extracellular environment after secretion&quot;. This is an over-interpretation of their data because there is no way they can conclude the in vivo relevance, or lack thereof, as they cannot predict how microenvironment may affect oligomerization (this remains unknown). This sentence should be rewritten as well. Reworking this section to analyze the data at hand without undue speculation is advisable.</p><p>2) The experiments in the final subsection of the Results (&quot;Oligomerization alone cannot rescue….&quot;), which relied on forced oligomerization of a form of properdin that is otherwise monomeric, are not described as clearly as the remainder of the text. Given the importance of these experiments to the overall theme of this manuscript, they are not as accessible to a broad audience as they probably should be. It would be beneficial to rework this portion of the text.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.63356.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) In the subsection entitled &quot;The oligomerization interfaces…&quot;, the authors state that &quot;these experiments for the first time demonstrated that the oligomerization interfaces in FP can open temporarily and even exchange monomers with a different FP molecule under physiologically relevant experimental conditions.&quot; However, the rearrangement of properdin oligomers was first shown by Pangburn in 1989 (Pangburn, 1989).

We now write:</p><p>“The oligomer distribution of FP in plasma is believed to be stable. in vitro experiments suggested that purified FP oligomers remained in their oligomerization state during storage and that when spiked into serum, radiolabeled FP oligomers did not redistribute (Pangburn, 1989).”</p><p>“In conclusion, these experiments demonstrated that the oligomerization interfaces in FP can open temporarily and even exchange monomers with a different FP molecule under physiologically relevant experimental conditions. […] Notably, even if exchange does occur, the overall oligomer distribution may remain unaltered, and our results add further support to the concept of stable FP oligomer conformations (Pangburn, 1989).”</p><p>We are very much aware of the excellent JI paper by Pangburn, but we also notice that he did not observe redistribution of FP oligomers under native conditions. He does state that after denaturation and renaturation, FP returns to the normal 1:2:1 distribution, but actually no data is presented to document this finding in the JI paper. Furthermore, we demonstrated slow exchange in vitro, but exchange does not necessarily lead redistribution of oligomers, this is now clarified in the final sentence.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The experiments in the final subsection of the results (&quot;Oligomerization alone cannot rescue….&quot;), which relied on forced oligomerization of a form of properdin that is otherwise monomeric, are not described as clearly as the remainder of the text.
