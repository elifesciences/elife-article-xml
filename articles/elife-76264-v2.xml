PM results from accumulation of <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic>-infected erythrocytes (IE) that express the surface antigen VAR2CSA and bind to chondroitin sulfate A (CSA) in the placenta. Women become PM-resistant over successive pregnancies as they develop anti-adhesion and anti-VAR2CSA antibodies, supporting VAR2CSA as the leading PM-vaccine candidate. However, the first VAR2CSA subunit vaccines failed to induce broadly neutralizing antibody and it is known that naturally acquired antibodies target both variant-specific and conserved epitopes. It is crucial to determine whether effective vaccines will require incorporation of many or only a single VAR2CSA variants. Here, IgG from multigravidae was sequentially purified on five full-length VAR2CSA ectodomain variants, thereby depleting IgG reactivity to each. The five VAR2CSA variants purified ~0.7% of total IgG and yielded both strain-transcending and strain-specific reactivity to VAR2CSA and IE-surface antigen. In two independent antibody purification/depletion experiments with permutated order of VAR2CSA variants, IgG purified on the first VAR2CSA antigen displayed broad cross-reactivity to both recombinant and native VAR2CSA variants, and inhibited binding of all isolates to CSA. IgG remaining after depletion on all variants showed significantly reduced binding-inhibition activity compared to initial total IgG. These findings demonstrate that a single VAR2CSA ectodomain variant displays conserved epitopes that are targeted by neutralizing (or binding-inhibitory) antibodies shared by multiple parasite strains, including maternal isolates. This suggests that a broadly effective PM-vaccine can be achieved with a limited number of VAR2CSA variants.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Contracting malaria during pregnancy – especially a first pregnancy – can lead to a severe, placental form of the disease that is often fatal. Red blood cells infected with the malaria parasite <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> display a protein, VAR2CSA, which can recognize and bind CSA molecules present on placental cells and in placental blood spaces. This leads to the infected blood cells accumulating in the placenta and inducing harmful inflammation.</p><p>Having been exposed to the parasite in prior pregnancies generates antibodies that target VAR2CSA, stopping the infected blood cells from latching onto placental CSA or tagging them for immune destruction. Overall, this makes placental malaria less severe in following pregnancies, and suggests that vaccines could be developed based on VAR2CSA.</p><p>However, this protein has regions that can vary in structure, meaning that <italic>P. falciparaum</italic> can generate many VAR2CSA variants. Individuals exposed to the parasite naturally generate antibodies that block a wide array of variants from attaching to CSA. In contrast, first-generation vaccines based on VAR2CSA fragments have only induced variant-specific antibodies, therefore offering limited protection against infection.</p><p>As a response, Doritchamou et al. set out to find VAR2CSA structures that could be recognized by antibodies targeting an array of variants. Blood was obtained from women who had had multiple pregnancies and were immune to malaria. Their plasma was passed over five different large VAR2CSA variants in order to isolate and purify antibodies that attached to these structures.</p><p>Doritchamou et al. found that antibodies binding to individual VAR2CSA structures could also recognise a wide array of VAR2CSA variants and blocked all tested parasites from sticking to CSA. While further research is needed, these findings highlight antibodies that cross-react to diverse VAR2CSA variants and could be used to design more effective vaccines targeting placental malaria.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>pregnancy</kwd><kwd>malaria</kwd><kwd>vaccine</kwd><kwd>VAR2CSA</kwd><kwd>variant</kwd><kwd>blocking antibody</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>P. falciparum</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006492</institution-id><institution>Division of Intramural Research, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Doritchamou</surname><given-names>Justin YA</given-names></name><name><surname>Renn</surname><given-names>Jonathan P</given-names></name><name><surname>Jenkins</surname><given-names>Bethany</given-names></name><name><surname>Fried</surname><given-names>Michal</given-names></name><name><surname>Duffy</surname><given-names>Patrick E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Doritchamou</surname><given-names>Justin YA</given-names></name><name><surname>Renn</surname><given-names>Jonathan P</given-names></name><name><surname>Jenkins</surname><given-names>Bethany</given-names></name><name><surname>Fried</surname><given-names>Michal</given-names></name><name><surname>Duffy</surname><given-names>Patrick E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>VAR2CSA, the leading candidate antigen for a placental malaria vaccine, displays epitopes targeted by naturally acquired broadly neutralizing antibodies of African multigravidae.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p><italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> infection in pregnant women causes placental malaria (PM) when <italic>P. falciparum</italic>-infected erythrocytes (IE) accumulate in the intervillous spaces of the placenta. PM has been linked to several adverse pregnancy outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Steketee et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Guyatt and Snow, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Desai et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Moore et al., 2017</xref>), and first-time mothers are most vulnerable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brabin, 1983</xref>). Over successive pregnancies, PM and the related sequalae become less prevalent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Guyatt and Snow, 2001</xref>). Susceptibility to PM has been attributed to <italic>P. falciparum</italic> parasites that bind chondroitin sulphate-A (CSA) expressed by the placental syncytiotrophoblast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fried and Duffy, 1996</xref>), and express the variant surface antigen VAR2CSA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Salanti et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tuikue Ndam et al., 2005</xref>). Conversely, the decrease in PM-related poor pregnancy outcomes with increasing parity is associated with the acquisition of functional antibodies to CSA-binding IE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fried and Duffy, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ricke et al., 2000</xref>) and antibodies to VAR2CSA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Salanti et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ndam et al., 2015</xref>). Such functional antibodies have been characterized for two major functions: (1) blocking CSA-binding of VAR2CSA-expressing parasites and (2) opsonizing IE to promote phagocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fried and Duffy, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ricke et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Duffy and Fried, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Keen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ataíde et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Hence, VAR2CSA represents the leading candidate for PM vaccine development. VAR2CSA is a large (∼318–478 kDa) multidomain transmembrane protein, a member of the <italic>P. falciparum</italic> erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (<italic>Pf</italic>EMP1) family encoded by <italic>var</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gardner et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hviid and Jensen, 2015</xref>). The cysteine-rich ectodomain is formed by N-terminal sequence (NTS), six and sometimes more Duffy-binding-like (DBL) domains as well as interdomain (ID) regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kraemer and Smith, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Doritchamou et al., 2019</xref>). Recent studies showed that VAR2CSA ectodomain structure includes a stable core (NTS-DBL1X-ID1-DBL2X-ID2-DBL3X-DBL4e-ID3) flanked by a flexible arm (DBL5e -DBL6e), and the receptor interaction involves CSA threading through two channels that formed within the stable core (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ma et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wang et al., 2021</xref>). Multiple individual DBL domains of VAR2CSA interact with CSA in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dahlbäck et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Clausen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ma et al., 2021</xref>) and induce functional antibodies in animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bigey et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fried et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Nielsen and Salanti, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chêne et al., 2018</xref>). Two subunit vaccine candidates (called PAMVAC and PRIMVAC) from the N-terminal region of VAR2CSA were recently tested in phase one trials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mordmüller et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sirima et al., 2020</xref>). Both trial teams reported that VAR2CSA subunit vaccines were safe, immunogenic and induced functional anti-adhesion antibodies in malaria-naive and malaria-exposed women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mordmüller et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sirima et al., 2020</xref>). However, functional activity was primarily against homologous parasites (same VAR2CSA sequence as vaccine) and low or absent against heterologous parasites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sirima et al., 2020</xref>), suggesting the vaccine antigen failed to display functional epitopes shared across multiple <italic>P. falciparum</italic> variants (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Doritchamou et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Similarly, VAR2CSA fragments (single or double domains) fail to purify the broadly neutralizing activity of sera from PM-resistant multigravidae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Doritchamou et al., 2016</xref>). Although VAR2CSA fragments (including constructs similar to PAMVAC vaccine) purified antibodies with CSA-binding inhibitory activity against homologous parasites, broadly neutralizing activity was neither purified nor depleted after passing sera over several VAR2CSA domains and variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Doritchamou et al., 2016</xref>). These data supports the hypothesis that functional antibodies to VAR2CSA may target conformational epitopes not displayed by any individual domain: for example, the strain-transcending human monoclonal antibody PAM1.4 is specific for an unknown conformational epitope on full-length VAR2CSA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barfod et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Naturally acquired antibodies of multiparous women exhibit broadly neutralizing anti-adhesion activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fried and Duffy, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ricke et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ndam et al., 2015</xref>). However, it is unknown whether broadly binding-inhibitory antibodies target conserved epitopes on VAR2CSA or rather result from the cumulative repertoire of antibodies against variant-specific epitopes. In this study, we investigate the hypothesis that full-length VAR2CSA ectodomain may capture naturally acquired antibodies from multigravidae plasma with greater breadth of neutralizing activity than previously achieved by multiple VAR2CSA domains. We show that a single ectodomain can purify strain-transcending IgG as well as the bulk of functional activity naturally acquired by multigravid women. In parallel, the depletion of IgG reactivities to five variants of full-length VAR2CSA resulted in significantly diminished strain-transcending anti-adhesion activity. These data suggest that full-length VAR2CSA ectodomain displays functional epitopes that are absent in subunit VAR2CSA fragments and provide a basis to design improved vaccines.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Depletion of IgG on five VAR2CSA ectodomains significantly reduces broad neutralizing activity</title><p>IgG specific to full-length VAR2CSA ectodomains was purified from a plasma pool prepared using samples from multigravid women participating in the previously described Immuno-epidemiology (IMEP) study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fried et al., 2018</xref>) (see Materials and methods and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> for experimental design).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Flow chart of the experimental design.</title><p>VAR2CSA-specific IgG was sequentially purified from total IgG isolated in multigravidae (MG) using antigen-specific columns made with NF54, 7G8, FCR3, HB3, Malayan Camp (M.

Two vaccines based on VAR2CSA fragments have been recently tested in clinical trials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mordmüller et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sirima et al., 2020</xref>), showing good safety and immunogenicity but a general inability to induce broadly neutralizing antibodies, such as those described in sera of PM-resistant multigravid women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fried and Duffy, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ricke et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Duffy and Fried, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ndam et al., 2015</xref>). The limitations of VAR2CSA domain-based subunit vaccines have also been established from the studies of naturally acquired antibodies in PM-resistant multigravidae, where single domains or domain combinations from different variants failed to deplete heterologous binding-inhibition activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Doritchamou et al., 2016</xref>). Among the probable explanations, the restricted array of protective epitopes displayed by VAR2CSA subunit vaccines, as well as the contribution of antibodies targeting other variants or antigens (including non-VAR2CSA proteins), are of major interest. It is therefore likely that larger fragments of VAR2CSA would offer a broader spectrum of functional epitopes including conformational epitopes and those present in other fragments missing from the subunits tested. Supporting this hypothesis, the present data demonstrate that strain-transcending naturally acquired anti-adhesion antibodies can be purified on a single recombinant VAR2CSA ectodomain, providing additional evidence that define VAR2CSA as the major target of functional antibodies.</p><p>This conclusion is well-supported by previous studies showing that naturally acquired anti-adhesion antibodies in PM target VAR2CSA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bigey et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Doritchamou et al., 2016</xref>), even though other invariant proteins are highly expressed by placental parasites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Francis et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fried et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tuikue Ndam et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bertin et al., 2013</xref>). Anti-adhesion activity of antibodies targeting these invariant proteins has not been reported thus far, and whether these proteins play a role in parasite binding to CSA is still unclear. Our data demonstrate that the removal of IgG specific to five variants of VAR2CSA ectodomain significantly reduced/abolished IE-surface reactivity and the CSA-binding inhibition activity of total IgG from multigravidae. This observation suggests that antibodies to surface-expressed non-VAR2CSA proteins might have limited or no blocking activity against CSA-binding parasites, although a synergistic effect of these antibodies with anti-VAR2CSA cannot be excluded.</p><p>Naturally acquired antibodies of malaria-exposed multigravid women recognize placenta-binding parasites from diverse geographical origins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fried and Duffy, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ricke et al., 2000</xref>). One leading hypothesis is that pregnant women acquire antibodies to both cross-reactive and variant-specific epitopes over successive pregnancies and exposure to diverse placenta-binding parasites. We show here that the purification of IgG to VAR2CSA recombinants resulted in loss of IE surface reactivity against the three homologous parasites, and significantly reduced heterologous cross-reactivity of total IgG to maternal isolates. Consequently, the VAR2CSA-purified IgG exhibited strong cross reactivity to all isolates tested in this study, with IgG purified on the first variant demonstrating the highest level of cross-reactivity to diverse CSA-binding isolates. Of note, the isolates under study included WF12/7G8 that expresses the South American VAR2CSA 7G8 allele, in addition to isolates from South East Asia (M Camp), East Africa (M0736), and West Africa (NF54, M2022170, M2001190), thus representing geographically diverse origins. Overall, it may be difficult to estimate the fraction of variant-specific or cross-reactive antibodies contributed by each variant to the measured activities, knowing that each sequence of VAR2CSA could have multiple epitopes that are variably shared with some or all variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Benavente et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Otto et al., 2019</xref>). However, highly cross-reactive antibodies can be purified from a single recombinant VAR2CSA ectodomain, suggesting that immunization with a single variant may prove highly effective.</p><p>The full-length VAR2CSA ectodomain-based vaccine approach has been previously investigated in preclinical studies in which antisera raised in rodent models had strong homologous functional activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Khunrae et al., 2010</xref>). However, these antibodies generated in rodents did not cross-inhibit different CSA-binding isolates, while exhibiting a broadly strain-transcending surface reactivity to these isolates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Avril et al., 2011</xref>). In contrast to this observation, our data demonstrate that naturally acquired IgG specific to a single variant and purified from multigravidae sera cross-inhibited multiple isolates. Notably, most of the binding-inhibition activity to CSA-binding parasites was depleted on the first variant and the resulting IgG purified on NF54 (in the first experiment) or M. Camp (in the second experiment) demonstrated strain-transcending blocking activity to all isolates tested in this study. Antibody response to VAR2CSA may differ between species or may differ based on exposure to vaccine antigen or to natural infection. For example, recently published data demonstrated that naturally acquired PfEMP1-specific antibodies are strongly afucosylated, while immunization with a subunit (VAR2CSA) vaccine results in fully fucosylated specific IgG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Larsen et al., 2021</xref>). Future studies that investigate differences in the host immune response to VAR2CSA in human versus other species will also elucidate any discrepancies between the functional activity of human versus rodent antibody.</p><p>Our data support the idea that one VAR2CSA variant might induce antibody with broad functional activity, acknowledging the challenges in developing a full-length VAR2CSA-based vaccine (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Doritchamou et al., 2021</xref>), including the possibility that non-functional epitopes may interfere with the optimal functional antibody response. It is also possible that the flanking flexible arm composed of DBL5ɛ–6ɛ or DBL5ɛ–7ɛ (in some cases) may play a role in masking functional epitopes on the core (NTS-ID3) structure of VAR2CSA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Doritchamou et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ma et al., 2021</xref>). Although recombinant expression of full-length VAR2CSA may not be feasible for manufacturing, novel technologies such as mRNA vaccine platform (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pardi et al., 2018</xref>) should be explored in future studies. To conclude, we report that naturally acquired antibody purified on VAR2CSA ectodomains exhibited strong strain-transcending surface reactivity and blocking activity to CSA-binding isolates. Interestingly, IgG purified against a single variant captured the bulk of strain-transcending IE reactivity and CSA-binding inhibition activity from total IgG of PM-resistant multigravidae. Therefore, the full-length VAR2CSA ectodomain appears to display both variant-specific and shared epitopes targeted by functional antibodies and as such, would be a credible alternative to the VAR2CSA subunit approach in PM vaccine development. Moreover, cross-reactive antibodies could result from both conserved linear epitopes and conformational (tertiary structure related) epitopes, and the human monoclonal antibody PAM1.4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barfod et al., 2007</xref>) provides strong evidence of the latter. Although such antibodies may contribute to the broadly neutralizing activity of VAR2CSA-specific IgG described in this study, quantifying their relative contribution will inform future PM vaccine development.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Goat anti-Human IgG Fc - Affinity Pure, HRP Conjugate (goat polyclonal)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">ImmunoReagents, Inc</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">GtxHu-004-DHRPX</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">1:3000 dilution</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Goat anti-Human IgG Fc Secondary Antibody, PE, eBioscience (goat polyclonal)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">12-4998-82</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">1:800 dilution</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Biological samples (Human)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Plasma</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Malaria Research and Training Centre, Bamako, Mali, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fried et al., 2018</xref><break/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Protein, recombinant protein</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Full-length VAR2CSA ectodomain, variant NF54</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Patrick E Duffy, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Renn et al., 2021</xref><break/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Protein, recombinant protein</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Full-length VAR2CSA ectodomain, variant 7G8</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Patrick E Duffy, <break/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Renn et al., 2021</xref><break/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Protein, recombinant protein</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Full-length VAR2CSA ectodomain, variant FCR3</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Patrick E Duffy, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Renn et al., 2021</xref><break/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Protein, recombinant protein</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Full-length VAR2CSA ectodomain, variant HB3</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Patrick E Duffy, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Renn et al., 2021</xref><break/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Protein, recombinant protein</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Full-length VAR2CSA ectodomain, variant M920</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Patrick E Duffy, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Renn et al., 2021</xref><break/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Protein, recombinant protein</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Full-length VAR2CSA ectodomain, variant M.

Briefly, pregnant women aged 15–45 years without clinical evidence of chronic or debilitating illness were enrolled from 2010 to 2013 into a longitudinal cohort study of mother-infant pairs conducted in Ouélessébougou, Mali. All participants provided signed informed consent after receiving a study explanation form and oral explanation from a study clinician in their native language.

Three CSA-binding maternal isolates (M2022170, M2001190, and M0736) expressing VAR2CSA as well as four lab-strains (NF54, FCR3, M. Camp and WF12/7G8, a progeny of 7G8 X GB4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hayton et al., 2008</xref>) that encodes the 7G8 VAR2CSA variant) selected to bind CSA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>) were maintained in culture for the functional assays.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Purification of IgG specific to full-length VAR2CSA ectodomains</title><p>Total IgG was initially purified from 4 mL of the multigravidae plasma pool using Protein G Sepharose 4 Fast Flow resin (GE Healthcare Life Sciences) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. For VAR2CSA-specific IgG purification and depletion, an antigen-specific affinity column was prepared as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Doritchamou et al., 2016</xref>) for each VAR2CSA variant. Briefly, each ectodomain variant was chemically cross-linked to N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS)-activated Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare Life Sciences) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. IgG specific to five VAR2CSA variants (NF54, 7G8, FCR3, HB3, and MC) were sequentially removed from the total IgG by passage through the affinity column and by applying the flow-through sample from one column to the next column until all specificities were depleted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>: Flow chart). IgG purification was performed repeatedly on each VAR2CSA antigen to ensure complete depletion of the specific IgG. The purified IgG were eluted with IgG Elution buffer, pH 2.8 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), neutralized with 2 M Tris buffer pH 9.0, and dialyzed into PBS pH 7.4. Variable number of passages were needed for full depletion of NF54 (x 3), 7G8 (x 3), FCR3 (x 2), HB3 (x 1) and M. Camp (x 1) specific IgG. The different aliquots of purified IgG were quantified using a Nanodrop (ND2000, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Reactivity of the naturally acquired IgG to VAR2CSA recombinants and VAR2CSA-expressing isolates</title><p>Total IgG (before and after each variant-specific depletion) or VAR2CSA-specific IgG purified on each the five ectodomain variants was assessed by ELISA as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Doritchamou et al., 2019</xref>). Briefly, recombinant VAR2CSA proteins were coated at 1 μg/mL and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Plates were blocked at room temperature (RT) for 2 hr (hr) and 100 µL of total IgG at 10 µg/mL and VAR2CSA-specific IgG at 0.1 µg/mL were added in duplicate wells for 1 hr at RT. The plates were washed and 100 µL of 1:3000 diluted HRP-conjugated anti-human IgG antibody (ImmunoReagents, Inc) added to each well for 1 hr incubation at RT followed by a final wash. One hundred microliters TMB (SeraCare) was added to each well for 10 min of incubation in dark at RT and the reaction was stopped by adding an equal volume of Stop Solution (SeraCare). Optical density (OD) values at 450 nm were acquired using the MultiskanFC (Thermo Fisher) plate reader.</p><p>IgG reactivity to native VAR2CSA expressed on IE surface was assessed by flow cytometry using 6 isolates of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Doritchamou et al., 2016</xref>).

IgG-labeled IE were quantified using an LSRII flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) and analyzed in FlowJo 10 (Tree Star, Inc).

Briefly, the proteoglycan decorin (Sigma) at 2 µg/mL in 1 X PBS was coated as 15 µL spots on a 100 × 15 mm Petri dish (Falcon 351029) by overnight incubation at 4 °C in a humid chamber. The spots were blocked with 3% BSA in 1 X PBS at 37 °C for 30 min. Before binding assay, enriched mature trophozoite/schizont stages of IE from different <italic>P. falciparum</italic> strains were adjusted to 20% parasite density at 0.5% hematocrit and incubated with total IgG (at 1, 2, and 4 mg/mL) or VAR2CSA-specific IgG (at 0.1 mg/mL) for 30 min at 37 °C. IE suspended in IgG solution were then allowed to bind duplicate receptor spots for 30 min at RT. Unbound IE were washed away and bound IE were fixed, stained and quantified by microscopy. The percentage of inhibition was calculated relative to the wells containing IE without IgG.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Supervision, Validation, Visualization, Writing - original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Writing – review and editing, Conducted the clinical study in Mali and provided samples used in the study</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Writing – review and editing, Conducted the clinical study in Mali and provided samples used in the study</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Funding acquisition, Supervision, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Conceptualization, Funding acquisition, Supervision, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Human subjects: For this study, a plasma pool was prepared using samples from multigravid women participating in the previously described Immuno-epidemiology (IMEP) study (Fried et al., 2018).

reconsideration following the decision after peer review. What follows is the decision letter after the first round of review.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting the paper entitled &quot;A single full-length VAR2CSA ectodomain variant purifies broadly neutralizing antibodies against placental malaria isolates&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Senior Editor. We are sorry to say that we have decided that this submission will not be considered further for publication by <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>While all reviewers found your work of interesting to the community, they also agreed that the findings reported are too preliminary to fully justify the conclusions drawn. In particular, the lack of permutated depletion experiments was considering a critical shortcoming, and that substantial additional experimentation will be necessary to alleviate this concern and the other concerns raised and detailed below.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This is a follow-up of a similar study by the same authors (Doritchamou, 2016). While they previously used recombinant single- and double-domain constructs of VAR2CSA to affinity-purify IgG from placental malaria-exposed multigravidae, they now employ full-length VAR2CSA ectodomain constructs. In contrast to the findings from their earlier study, the authors now report that affinity purification of IgG on full-length VAR2CSA yielded IgG that contained broadly neutralizing (adhesion-blocking) activity. The study reports what appears to be essentially a single sequential experiment that is consistent with the authors' interpretation, but in my opinion falls somewhat short of fully justifying it.</p><p>Reactivity and neutralization data of experiments all variants and single variant-depleted and single variant-purified IgG would strengthen the study markedly. Furthermore, it would be interesting to see results from experiments where the order of the sequential depletion was permutated. Finally, the authors should present absolute adhesion and adhesion inhibition data, as normalized data can be quite misleading (e.g., they can produce impressive adhesion inhibition data for a parasite line that shows almost no adhesiveness initially).</p><p>Specific comments:</p><p>– L. 15 (&quot;…it is still unclear… epitopes&quot;): The authors themselves have previously reported data supporting the existence of broadly cross-reactive IgG acquired in response to natural infection (Barfod et al. 2010).</p><p>– L. 25-8: I find this conclusion too categorical, considered the limited evidence (the above-mentioned &quot;single&quot; experiment and the fact that only a few maternal isolates – from the same study site and temporally related? – were tested).</p><p>– L. 41-2: Expression of VAR2CSA was not formally demonstrated in Fried 1998 or Ricke 2000 as both studies predate the discovery of VAR2CSA.</p><p>– L. 46-8 could deserve referencing – either original studies or a recent review (e.g., Hviid and Jensen 2015).</p><p>– L. 51-4: Suggest adding Wang et al. Nat Commun 2021.</p><p>– L. 54-8: Nine references seems a bit excessive here.</p><p>– L. 153-5 (&quot;Although… NF54-IgG&quot;): Why did the authors not test for IgG reactivity against native 7G8-VAR2CSA and HB3-VAR2CSA on the surface of IEs?</p><p>– L. 155ff (&quot;As with ELISA… antigen&quot;): How does this sentence fit with the fact that reactivity against 7G8-IEs was not tested?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This work builds on both work from this team suggesting that antibodies to individual VAR2CSA domains do not show broad cross reactive neutralising activity, and on two phase 1 trials of vaccines based on the DBL2 domain of VAR2CSA and flanking sequences, which showed limited heterologous protection in in vitro studies. This work has led to the idea that it might be necessary to include a cocktail of key variants to produce a successful vaccine. The current authors instead investigated whether antibodies purified using the whole protein ectodomain were markers of potential heterologous protection, and find that this is the case.</p><p>Generally the experiments presented and the interpretations of the findings appear logical and consistent. The figures show that depletion of antibodies using one VAR2CSA variant decreases antibody reactivity to other variants by ELISA and that the more the plasma is depleted, the greater the loss of antibody reactivity. Broadly similar data are shown for the ability of plasma to inhibit adhesion of infected erythrocytes (IEs) to CSA, and for ability to recognise the IE surface using flow cytometry. The validation of their ELISA findings with live parasites is a strength of this study.</p><p>The results are consistent with the idea that immunity to a single VAR2CSA variant might be associated with a fairly broad range of cross-reactive antibody to different VAR2CSA isolates that might broadly protect against placental malaria. It is not presently clear whether production of such an antigen at scale for use in vaccines is a realistic possibility, and this challenge might be mentioned in the discussion. It is also not clear whether immunisation with a single variant would result cross reactive immunity (recognition of an antigen by antibodies being different to an antigens ability to elicit antibodies). The results contrast with the animal immunisation studies mentioned in the discussion; however, the authors do not clearly discuss why this may be the case.</p><p>Specific suggestions</p><p>Line 84-87: should this be &quot;that are absent in 'individual' vaccine fragments&quot;? As this study does not confirm that all vaccine fragments together do not contain epitopes.</p><p>Lines 105 and 113-114: The data presented in figures 2 are different to those in supplementary figure 1. Therefore, the results from Figures in the main file and supplement should be described separately.</p><p>Line 263-7: We are missing details of how the ectodomains were expressed. There is a reference to Renn et al., JEM 20210848P which may be a submitted manuscript. This information is important in understanding how the protein expression was evaluated for conformation and folding, as it appears tertiary or higher-level structural considerations are important for understanding the difference between this study and previous efforts using single domains.</p><p>Discussion: Could the authors comment on whether it is that they have used a more complete protein or whether it is the tertiary structure which results in the cross-reactive antibodies? Would the use of for example 6 fragments (making up the whole VAR2CSA) give a similar result?</p><p>Figure 2 A: what do the brackets and asterisk refer to?</p><p>Figure 2 C: There is a comment about &quot;histogram without IgG&quot; – what does this refer to? Does it refer to B rather than C?</p><p>Figure 2 D may be redundant as it can be derived from figure 2C.</p><p>Figure 3 X axis should not be VAR2CSA, it is antibody reactivity to IEs.</p><p>Line 179- should this be 'heterologous parasites' not homologous as it is clear that other purifications did indeed capture IgG that could block activity against heterologous parasite strains (though not at the same level as that of the first depletion).</p><p>Line 202: what is an 'invariant protein'?</p><p>Methods:</p><p>Line 279-281 More detail of the elution buffer is also needed as low pH can cause changes to antibody conformation that might alter protein binding.</p><p>Lines 290,298-9 please provide details of the reagents used including detection antibodies and SYBR.</p><p>How many times did plasma need to be passed through column before activity was deemed fully depleted?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>1) It has been shown in a previous work (in particular by the first author of this work), that despite exposure to several field <italic>P. falciparum</italic> isolates, multigravid women could nevertheless be susceptible to placental infections by certain rare parasite variants (resembling in their var2csa sequence to strain WRO80). The authors should have discussed their findings in relation to these very relevant observations from this previous study?</p><p>2) Including laboratory strains 7G8 and HB3 in the cellular testings (surface reactivity and binding inhibition) would have helped to substantiate the authors' conclusions. The same applies to parasite isolates M920 and M200101 from which the FL var2csa recombinants have been produced.</p><p>3) The order of filtration of the MG IgG pool on the antigens during depletion / purification steps seems decisive. If this order had been different would the authors have expected the same activity pattern of the purified antibodies? It would have been interesting to reproduce this experiment by reversing this order. Carrying out this experiment in my opinion would have further strengthened the study and better reflect the title chosen by the authors. One can wonder whether all the VAR2CSA variants used in this study would be functionally comparable in this operation, if not the title of this study would be better suited to IgG purified on the VAR2CSA variant of NF54, as the depletion / purification activity on this protein (first in the series) presents the least bias compared to the others used afterwards.</p><p>4) Despite these comments which could only further help improve this work if addressed, the content is already of definite interest and may be published or with some few modifications.</p><p>5) Adding a figure (even as a supplementary) that shows the dispersion or phylogenic relation between the 7 VAR2CSA sequences used in this work would have been a good added value, as this will inform about their relationship with the main variants (3D7, FCR3, 7G8, WRO80) and help to further interpret the results.</p><p>6) The total IgGs purified from the MG pool show a strong reactivity against the 7 recombinants VAR2CSA used as well as on the native protein of the cultured parasites. This surface reactivity of the pre-depletion IgG pool is surprisingly less on the strain NF54 (Figure 2B). In Figure 3 the affinity-purified IgGs on the NF54 antigen (the first in the chain of depletion/purification) also show strong reactivity against the 7 recombinants used as well as on the native protein of all the 6 parasites cultured, including NF54. The authors should explain or discuss this weak recognition of the pre-depletion pool on the NF54 parasite which contrasts with the inhibitory properties observed (Figure 2C)?</p><p>7) Authors should describe how the plasma pool was prepared. It would be helpful to clarify how many multigravid women have been used as donors? If they were selected it would be necessary to clarify on which criteria and if not why.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.76264.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the authors resubmitted a revised version of the paper for consideration.

Unfortunately, our lab does not have both 7G8 and HB3 isolates. However, in this revised manuscript, we have included data generated on WF12, a progeny of 7G8 X GB4 whose genome encodes the 7G8 VAR2CSA allele (Hayton et al., Cell Host Microbe 2008). We have provided detailed information on WF12 in Supplemental Figure S2. We have also permutated the order of antigens in a second sequential depletion experiment using full-length VAR2CSA (FV2) representing Malayan Camp (MCamp), with FCR3 and NF54 variants (in that order) for purification/depletion. In our additional data, we show that IgG purified on FV2 MCamp had the highest cross-reactivity and cross-inhibitory activity against recombinant FV2 variants as well as against native antigen expressed by MCamp, FCR3 and NF54 parasites (Figure 5). This finding is consistent with the pattern observed with IgG purified on NF54 variant in the first sequential depletion experiment in our original manuscript.

We share the reviewer’s concern about the realistic possibility to produce such a large antigen at scale for use in vaccines. However, we believe the mRNA vaccine platform (among other advanced technologies) could be a feasible approach to explore and have discussed this in the revised manuscript (Lines 272-275). We also recognized the limitation of antibodies induced against FV2 in animals to display broadly neutralizing activity, similar to what is seen in naturally acquired immunity. It is possible that differences in host responses and context of the antigen may alter quality of immunity. For example, recently published data demonstrated that naturally acquired PfEMP1-specific antibodies are strongly afucosylated, while immunization with a subunit (VAR2CSA) vaccine results in fully fucosylated specific IgG (Larsen et al., 2021). This study provides new understanding of key differences in antibody features between natural- and vaccine-induced immunity. The Discussion section has been amended with this new observation in the revised manuscript (lines 258-264).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Lines 105 and 113-114: The data presented in figures 2 are different to those in supplementary figure 1.

We cite our new publication (Renn et al., Comms Bio 2021, DOI : 10.1038/s42003-021-02787-7) that provides a detailed description of the expression and functional characterization of full length VAR2CSA ectodomain variants (lines 301-306).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Discussion: Could the authors comment on whether it is that they have used a more complete protein or whether it is the tertiary structure which results in the cross-reactive antibodies? Would the use of for example 6 fragments (making up the whole VAR2CSA) give a similar result?</p></disp-quote><p>At the current state of understanding, it appears that cross-reactive antibodies could result from both conserved linear epitopes and conformational (tertiary structure related) epitopes. The strain-transcending human monoclonal antibody PAM1.4 provides strong evidence of a strain-transcending antibody targeting conformational epitopes on full-length VAR2CSA (Barfod et al., 2007). Although such antibodies may be contributing to the broadly neutralizing activities of PM IgG described in this study, quantifying their level of contribution will certainly provide crucial data to inform PM vaccine development. Similarly, whether the use of the 6 individual domains (making up the entirety of the VAR2CSA ectodomain) will give a similar result remains to be explored. The Discussion has been amended accordingly (lines 281-286)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 202: what is an 'invariant protein'?</p></disp-quote><p>Here, an “invariant protein” refers to a highly conserved protein across different variants of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> encoded by a single-copy gene.

We have indicated in this manuscript and Renn et al., 2021 that the VAR2CSA sequence of M920 has a similar ID1 motif as WR80. Our data here show that IgG purified on the first FV2 variant significantly cross-reacted with the M920 variant of VAR2CSA. Unfortunately, the M920 isolate was not available to us to generate any surface reactivity and binding inhibition data. At this point, we believe that our interpretation should be limited to the observed ELISA cross-reactivity to a WR80-like VAR2CSA.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Including laboratory strains 7G8 and HB3 in the cellular testings (surface reactivity and binding inhibition) would have helped to substantiate the authors' conclusions.

We believe that data generated from maternal isolates M2022170 (Mali), M2001190 (Mali) and M0736 (Tanzania, for which no VAR2CSA) protein was produced, have provided reasonably similar findings (substantial reduction of reactivities and inhibition after depletion of IgG specific to multiple variants of VAR2CSA) as those from M920 (parasite not available) and M200101 (fails to maintain expression of VAR2CSA in culture) would have provided.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The order of filtration of the MG IgG pool on the antigens during depletion / purification steps seems decisive.
