Here, we utilized trace fear conditioning to study the formation of trace fear memory in mice. We identified the entorhinal cortex (EC) as a critical component of sensory signaling to the amygdala. We adopted both loss-of-function and gain-of-function experiments to demonstrate that release of the cholecystokinin (CCK) from the EC is required for trace fear memory formation. We discovered that CCK-positive neurons project from the EC to the lateral nuclei of the amygdala (LA), and inhibition of CCK-dependent signaling in the EC prevented long-term potentiation of the auditory response in the LA and formation of trace fear memory. In summary, high-frequency activation of EC neurons triggers the release of CCK in their projection terminals in the LA, potentiating auditory response in LA neurons.

Fear conditioning is widely used to study this association and is performed by pairing a neutral stimulus (conditioned stimulus, CS), such as a tone, with a punishing stimulus (unconditioned stimulus, US), such as a shock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Estes and Skinner, 1941</xref>). The CS-US pair elicits fear behaviors, including freezing and fleeing, which are often species-specific. Canonical delay fear conditioning is performed by terminating the CS and US at the same time. However, CS and US do not necessarily occur simultaneously in nature, and the brain has evolved mechanisms to associate temporally distinct events. Trace fear conditioning is used to study these mechanisms by inserting a trace interval between the end of the CS and the beginning of the US. The temporal separation between the CS and the US substantially increases the difficulty of learning as well as the recruitment of brain structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Crestani et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Runyan et al., 2004</xref>). Although trace fear conditioning provides essential insight into the neurobiology of learning and memory, many unanswered questions remain. For instance, the detailed neural circuitry underlying the formation of this trace fear memory and the potential modulatory chemicals involved in this process need to be further characterized.</p><p>Synaptic plasticity is the basis of learning and memory and refers to the ability of neural connections to become stronger or weaker. Long-term potentiation (LTP) is one of the most widely studied forms of synaptic plasticity. The lateral nucleus of the amygdala (LA) receives multi-modal sensory inputs from the cortex and thalamus. It relays them into the central nucleus of the amygdala, which then innervates the downstream effector structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Phelps and LeDoux, 2005</xref>). LTP is developed in the auditory input pathway that signals to the LA. Auditory-responsive units in the LA fire faster after auditory-cued fear conditioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Quirk et al., 1995</xref>). Optogenetic manipulation of the auditory input terminals in the LA leads to the suppression or recovery of LTP in the LA and can correspondingly suppress or recover conditioned fear responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nabavi et al., 2014</xref>). Researchers recently discovered that synaptic plasticity can occur upstream of the LA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barsy et al., 2020</xref>), providing new insights into this fundamental topic. Nevertheless, synaptic plasticity in the LA is impressively correlated with the formation of fear memory.</p><p>Besides the amygdala, the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bangasser et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gilmartin et al., 2012</xref>), anterior cingulate cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Han et al., 2003</xref>), medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Runyan et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gilmartin and Helmstetter, 2010</xref>), and entorhinal cortex (EC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ryou et al., 2001</xref>) are also involved in trace fear conditioning. The EC is integrated with the spatial and navigation systems of the animal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fyhn et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hafting et al., 2005</xref>) and is essential for context-related fear associative memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Maren and Fanselow, 1997</xref>). Moreover, the EC functions as a working memory buffer in the brain to hold information for temporal associations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fransén, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Schon et al., 2016</xref>). Here, a scenario of the dependence on the EC to associate the temporally separated CS and US is manifested.</p><p>Cholecystokinin (CCK) is the most abundant neuropeptide in the central nervous system (CNS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rehfeld, 1978</xref>). CCK has two recognized receptors in the CNS: CCK A receptor (CCKAR) and CCK B receptor (CCKBR). Previous studies in our laboratory unveiled that CCK and CCKBR enabled neuroplasticity as well as associative memory between two sound stimuli and between visual and auditory stimuli (AS) in the auditory cortex (AC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Li et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>). CCK and its receptors are intrinsically involved in fear-related mental disorders including anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2006</xref>), depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Shen et al., 2019</xref>), and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Joseph et al., 2013</xref>). Moreover, the CCKBR agonist CCK-tetrapeptide (CCK-4) induces acute panic attacks in healthy human subjects and patients with a panic disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bradwejn, 1993</xref>). Despite the clear connection between CCK and fear-related disorders, it remains elusive the involvement of CCK in fear conditioning and the formation of cue-specific fear memory, which is possibly the neural foundation of these disorders.</p><p>In the present study, we investigated the involvement of CCK-expressing neurons in the EC in trace fear memory formation. We then examined how CCK enabled neuroplasticity in the auditory pathway to the LA by conducting the in vivo recording in the LA. Finally, we studied the contribution of the EC to LA pathway on the formation of trace fear memory in the physiological and behavioral context.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Loss of CCK results in deficient trace fear memory formation in <italic>Cck</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice</title><p>The first question we asked here was whether CCK is involved in trace fear memory formation. We studied transgenic <italic>Cck</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice (<italic>Cck</italic>-CreER, strain #012710, Jackson Laboratory), which lack CCK expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2019</xref>). We subjected <italic>Cck</italic><sup>-/-</sup> and wildtype (WT) control (C57BL/6) mice to trace fear conditioning using two training protocols: long-trace interval and short-trace interval training.</p><p>We performed the trace fear conditioning experiment by collecting baseline readouts on pre-conditioning day, training with the appropriate CS-US pairings on conditioning days, and testing the conditioned fear responses on post-conditioning/testing day. In the long trace protocol, mice sequentially received a 10 s pure tone (as the CS), a 20 s gap (trace interval), and a 0.5 s foot shock (as the US) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). We calculated the percentage of time frames where mice displayed a freezing response as the measure of fear memory. Freezing percentages were compared before (baseline) and after (post-training) trace fear conditioning as well as before (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>) and after (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>) presentation of the CS. The after-CS freezing percentage was calculated within the time window that includes the duration of CS (10 s) and the trace interval (20 s). For before-CS freezing percentage, we selected the time window with same length (30 s) just before the presentation of CS. At baseline, <italic>Cck</italic><sup>-/-</sup> (N = 10/2 cages) and WT (N = 14/3 cages) mice showed similarly low freezing percentages both before (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>) and after (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>) the CS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>, two-way repeated-measures analysis of variance [RM ANOVA], significant interaction, F[1,22] = 10.85, p = 0.003 &lt; 0.01; pairwise comparison, WT vs. <italic>Cck</italic><sup>-/-</sup> before CS, 7.0% ± 1.0% vs. 5.9% ± 1.1%; 95% confidence interval [CI], [5.0%, 9.0%] vs. [3.6%, 8.3%]; Bonferroni test, p = 0.482 &gt; 0.05; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>, two-way RM ANOVA, significant interaction, F[1,22] = 8.94, p = 0.007 &lt; 0.01; pairwise comparison, WT vs. <italic>Cck</italic><sup>-/-</sup> after CS, 9.9% ± 1.5% vs. 9.6% ± 1.8%; 95% CI, [6.8–13.0%] vs. [5.9–13.3%]; Bonferroni test, p = 0.911 &gt; 0.05). After conditioning, <italic>Cck</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice showed significantly lower freezing percentages (39.3% ± 5.3%, 95% CI, [28.3%, 50.2%]) than WT mice after receiving the CS (61.6% ± 4.5%, 95% CI, [52.4%, 70.9%]; pairwise comparison, p = 0.004 &lt; 0.01), indicating poor performance in associating the CS with the US (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Videos 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">2</xref>). This effect was not due to elevated basal freezing levels caused by training in WT animals. Instead, we found that <italic>Cck</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice (23.0% ± 2.1%, 95% CI, [18.6%, 27.4%]) had higher freezing percentages than WT mice (14.0% ± 1.8%, 95% CI, [10.3%, 17.7%]) in the absence of the CS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>, pairwise comparison, p = 0.003 &lt; 0.01). Together, these results suggest that trace fear conditioning results in elevated conditioned freezing percentages in WT mice, which are primarily elicited by the CS, and that loss of CCK impairs the freezing response to the CS. Furthermore, we defined an empirical threshold of moving velocity and converted the moving velocity to a binary freezing score plot, in which value 1 represents active state, and value 0 represents freezing state (see Materials and methods). Using this method, we were able to assess the freezing response of the animal as it occurred during the CS presentation.

Specifically, the inhibitory receptor hM4Di was expressed in the EC of WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>) and was activated by administrating the designer drug clozapine (CLZ). Activation of hM4Di by CLZ induces membrane hyperpolarization, effectively silencing neurons. We verified EC neuron silencing by in vivo electrophysiological recording (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b–d</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). We found that a low dose of CLZ (0.5 mg/kg) effectively suppressed both instant and long-term neuronal firing. Of note, we used CLZ instead of the canonical DREADD ligand clozapine-N-oxide (CNO). A recent study identified CLZ as the active metabolite of CNO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gomez et al., 2017</xref>), and CLZ more effectively penetrates the BBB and binds with DREADD receptors compared to CNO. As a result, a much lower dose of CLZ can elicit similar behavioral effects as higher doses of CNO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gomez et al., 2017</xref>). Therefore, we used a low dose of CLZ (0.5 mg/kg) in our experiments.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Formation of trace fear memory is suppressed by chemogenetic inhibition of the entorhinal cortex (EC) and cholecystokinin (CCK)-positive EC neurons.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Schematic diagram of trace fear conditioning and chemogenetic inhibition of the EC.

We demonstrated that <italic>Cck</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice had impaired fear responses in both short- and long-trace fear conditioning. This behavioral defect was not caused by deficits in hearing and fear expression. Depleting CCK expression in mice impaired trace fear conditioning responses; this impairment was rescued by exogenous activation of CCKBR with its agonist CCK-4. Overall, our study suggests that trace fear memory formation and neural plasticity in the LA are dependent on a functional CCK network in the CNS.</p><p>Trace fear conditioning includes a gap between the CS and the US, distinguishing it from the simultaneous CS-US termination in delay fear conditioning. In trace fear conditioning, mice must retain information from the CS during the trace interval and associate it with the subsequent US. As a result, the learning process in trace fear conditioning is slower than in delay fear conditioning, and fear generalization is more pronounced. We previously reported that WT animals form CS-US associations after three training trials with minimal fear generalization in auditory-cued delay fear conditioning. In comparison, <italic>Cck</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice required nine training trials to achieve an equivalent freezing percentage to the CS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2019</xref>). This result indicated the deficit of <italic>Cck</italic><sup>-/-</sup> in the auditory-cued delay fear conditioning. We further demonstrated that <italic>Cck</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice also have difficulties in forming visually cued delay fear memory, as well as electrically cued trace fear memory in which an electrical pulse stimulus in the AC is paired with a foot shock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>). Together, the results of our previous work and the present study indicate that the absence of the neuropeptide CCK has broad damaging effects on multiple forms of fear memory and is not limited to trace fear memory.</p><p>Fear conditioning can potentiate the signals of auditory-responsive units in the LA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Quirk et al., 1995</xref>) in a phenomenon referred to as LTP. As a result, many studies have identified LTP as a physiological hallmark of fear conditioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blair et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Maren, 2001</xref>). Our study adopted in vivo recording to measure auditory-evoked field excitatory postsynaptic potential or AEP. We found no apparent abnormalities in AEP (such as amplitude or latency) in <italic>Cck</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice, suggesting that cortical and thalamic auditory inputs to the LA were functional. <italic>Cck</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice failed to induce AEP-LTP in the LA, strongly suggesting a deficiency in neural plasticity. We understand AEP-LTP induction is not equivalent to trace fear memory as it is not sufficient to trigger the expression of fear behaviors sometimes. LTP in the LA is maintained during fear extinction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kim and Cho, 2017</xref>). Thus, LTP in the LA is necessary but not sufficient for fear memory formation.</p><p>In the present study, we found that silencing EC neurons with DREADD hM4Di impaired the formation of trace fear memory, consistent with several previous studies. Electrolytic lesion of the EC impairs trace eyeblink conditioning performance in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ryou et al., 2001</xref>). Neurotoxic lesions in the EC impair the formation of trace fear memory but not that of delay fear memory formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Esclassan et al., 2009</xref>). Although the hippocampus may involve in the trace fear memory formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bangasser et al., 2006</xref>), the EC is a promising regulatory region as it maintains sustained activity in response to stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Egorov et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fransén et al., 2006</xref>). This sustained neuronal activity is thought to be the neural basis of ‘holding’ CS information during trace intervals to allow for CS-US association even after long-trace intervals (20 s in our study). This information ‘holding’ theory is consistent with neuroimaging reports on working memory in subjects who ‘hold’ stimuli for specific periods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nauer et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Auditory responses have been previously found in the EC and its upstream circuit <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>; however, these responses were limited to loud noise and did not involve the pure tone used in our behavioral paradigm. We reasoned that if the EC perceives and delivers the CS to downstream structures, then lesions in the EC would disturb the delay fear conditioning as well. Instead, previous studies have robustly demonstrated that EC lesions leave delay fear memory intact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Esclassan et al., 2009</xref>). The amygdala responds directly to the AS, and receives inputs from the AC, the MGB, and hippocampus. Thus, the EC is likely involved in the CS-US association more complicated, and this mechanism requires further investigation. We speculate that this mechanism is probably similar to our previous finding in the sound-sound association (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2019</xref>) and visuo-auditory association (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>), which is neuropeptide-based hetero-synaptic modulation machinery.</p><p>With cell type-specific tracing systems, we demonstrated that the EC is an upstream brain region that projects CCK-positive afferents to the LA. These CCK-expressing EC neurons are primarily excitatory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Using anterograde Cre-dependent color switch labeling in the EC, we found that CCK-expressing neurons were the predominant source of EC-LA projections, implying that CCK is integral to EC-LA connection and communication. Cell type-specific chemogenetic inhibition of CCK-expressing neurons in the EC also impaired the formation of trace fear memory. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that CCK may originate in other brain regions and contribute to fear memory formation.</p><p>In a previous publication, we induced the release of CCK from terminals by HFLS on CCK-expressing fibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2019</xref>), which is consistent with the theory proposed several decades ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hökfelt, 1991</xref>). In the current study, we employed the same protocol to trigger the CCK released from CCK-positive terminals in the LA under in vivo preparation. We then presented the AS in the presence of this artificially released CCK neuropeptide. The auditory inputs from both the AC and the thalamus activated presynaptic axons via the canonical LA fear circuit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Romanski and LeDoux, 1992</xref>). In our study, the AS triggered postsynaptic neural firing. Therefore, our HFLS-mediated AEP-LTP induction protocol combines the released CCK with pre- and postsynaptic activation altogether in the LA, and this pairing leads to the potentiation of AEP in the LA.</p><p>We successfully excluded the contribution of substances co-released with CCK to the AEP-LTP induction, by blocking it after knocking down of <italic>Cck</italic> expression with shRNA. Our results that the inhibition of CCK-positive EC afferents to the LA impaired trace memory formation during the learning and response phases suggest that establishing the CS-US association during trace fear conditioning requires functional CCK-positive EC-LA projections.</p><p>Of note, we cannot underestimate the dependence of trace fear memory on contextual fear memory because some critical areas, include the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">McEchron et al., 1998</xref>) and the mPFC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gilmartin and Helmstetter, 2010</xref>), contribute to both types of fear memory. EC bridges the hippocampus and the neocortex and is crucial for the integration of spatial information. The projections from the amygdala to the EC are suggested to participate in the contextual fear conditioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wahlstrom et al., 2018</xref>). Therefore, our unveiled CCK-positive EC-LA projections may also involve the formation of contextual fear.</p><p>In conclusion, we found that EC-LA projections modulate neuroplasticity in the LA and contribute to the formation of trace fear memory. The EC neurons release CCK in the LA, enabling hetero-synaptic neuroplasticity of the auditory inputs to the LA. Our findings add a novel insight into the participation of the neuropeptide CCK in the formation of the trace fear memory. As various mental disorders, including anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Davis, 1992</xref>), depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Siegle et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Shen et al., 2019</xref>), and PTSD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Shin et al., 2006</xref>), are highly correlated with hyperactivation and dysfunction of the amygdala and the fear memory circuitry, our finding supports CCK and its receptors as potential new targets for future therapeutic applications for these disorders.</p></sec><sec id="s4"

(CCK-ires-Cre) mice were used in experiments. For behavioral experiments, only adult male mice were used. Mice were housed in a 12 hr shift of the reversed light-dark cycle and were provided food and water ad libitum. All behavioral experiments were conducted in the dark cycle. All experimental procedures were approved by the Animal Subjects Ethics Sub-Committee of the City University of Hong Kong.</p><p>For surgical procedures when doing virus injection and optic fiber implantation, mice were anesthetized with pentobarbital sodium (80 mg/kg, i.p., 20% Dorminal, Alfasan International B.V., Woerden, The Netherlands). For acute electrophysiological recording, mice were anesthetized with pentobarbital sodium (80 mg/kg, i.p.) or urethane sodium (2 g/kg, i.p., Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). Both anesthetics were periodically supplemented during the experiment to maintain anesthesia. Mice were fixed in a stereotaxic device, and the scalp was incised. A local anesthetic (xylocaine, 2%) was applied to the incision site for analgesia. After skull levelling, craniotomies were performed with varying parameters based on the region of the brain being accessed.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Auditory and visual stimuli</title><p>AS, including pure tones and white noise, were digitally generated by a specialized auditory processor (RZ6 from Tucker-Davis Technologies [TDT], Alachua, FL). For behavioral experiments, AS were delivered via a free-field magnetic speaker (MF-1, TDT) mounted 60 cm above the animal. The sound intensity was adjusted by a condenser microphone (Center Technology, Taipei) to ∼70 dB when it reached the animal. For in vivo recording, AS were delivered via a close-field speaker placed contralaterally to the recording side. The sound intensity that induced 50–70% of the maximum response was selected. Visual stimuli were generated by a direct current-driven torch bulb via the analog voltage output of the TDT workstation. Light intensity was roughly quantified as the value of the trigger voltage. For in vivo recording, the light intensity that induced 50–70% of the maximum response was selected.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>ABR recording</title><p>Mice were anesthetized with pentobarbital sodium (80 mg/kg, i.p.) and placed on a clean and warm blanket in a soundproof chamber. A free-field magnetic speaker (MF-1, TDT) was placed 10 cm away from the right ear of mice. Recording, reference, and ground needle electrodes (Spes Medica, Genova, Italy) were subcutaneously inserted below the forehead, right ear, and left ear, respectively. AS (wide spectrum clicks, 0.1 ms) were presented to the mouse with a decreasing level from 80 to 20 dB with an interval of 5 dB. For each level of click stimulus, total 512 times of presentations were given at a frequency of 21 Hz. ABR signals were collected via a specialized processor (RZ6, TDT) and digitalized with a bandpass filter from 100 Hz to 5 kHz. Stimuli generation and data processing were performed with software BioSigRZ (TDT).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Trace fear conditioning</title><p>On the pre-conditioning day, each mouse was placed into the testing context (acrylic box with white wallpaper measuring 25 cm × 25 cm × 25 cm) for habituation and baseline recording. After 3 min of habituation, a CS (2.7 or 8.2 kHz pure tone, 70 dB SPL, 3 s for the short-trace paradigm and 10 s for the long-trace paradigm) was given three times within 20 min.</p><p>On conditioning day, the mouse was placed into the fear conditioning context (acrylic box with brown wallpaper measuring 18 cm wide ×18 cm long ×30 cm high and equipped with foot shock stainless steel grid floor). After 3 min of habituation, a CS-US pairing was given. In the short-trace interval paradigm, an US (0.5 mA foot shock, 0.5 s) was given 2 s after a 3-s-long CS. Three trials were given on each training day, and the interval between trials was 10–15 min. Totally two training days were given. The mouse was kept in the fear conditioning context for a 10 min consolidation period after the last training trial. In the long-trace interval paradigm, an US was given 20 s after a 10-s-long CS. Eight training trials were given each training day, and the interval between trials was 2–3 min. The mouse was kept in the fear conditioning context for a 5 min consolidation period after the last training trial. After training, each animal was kept in a temporary cage and returned to its home cage after all individuals finished training.</p><p>On post-conditioning day (test day), the mouse was placed into the testing context. After 3 min of habituation, a CS was presented to the animal twice with a 2-min-long interval between stimuli. Two minutes after the last trial, the animal was transferred to a temporary cage and returned to its home cage after all individuals in its cage finished testing.</p><p>All contexts were cleaned thoroughly with 75% ethanol after each individual session. All of the above procedures were conducted in a soundproof chamber, and all videos (baseline, training, and testing) were recorded with a webcam (Logitech C270) set in the ceiling of the chamber. Videos were analyzed with a custom program based on an open-source platform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lopes et al., 2015</xref>) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://bonsai-rx.org">https://bonsai-rx.org</ext-link>). Briefly, the centroid of the animal was extracted from the videos. By comparing the coordinates of the centroid frame by frame, we then calculated the distance moved between two frames. The instant velocity of the animal was calculated by dividing this distance by the time span between two adjacent frames. The freezing percentage was defined as the percentage of frames with an instant velocity lower than the threshold of all frames in an observed time window. We compared the output of this program to results observed by the naked eye. Finally, we selected 0.1 (pixel<sup>2</sup>/s) as the appropriate moving threshold to define freezing. Freezing score was defined as the binary value (0 or 1) of time frame with instant velocity higher (0, ‘not freezing’) or lower (1, ‘freezing’) than the threshold. For the freezing score plot shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>, freezing scores from all test sessions were averaged per second for data visualization.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Electrophysiological recording in the LA and EC</title><p>Mice were subjected to the surgical procedures described above. Tracheotomy was conducted to facilitate breathing and to prevent asphyxia caused by tracheal secretions during the experiment. Craniotomy was performed 1.0–2.0 mm posterior and 3.0–4.0 mm lateral to the bregma to target the LA. Dura mater was partially opened using a metal hook made of a 29 G syringe needle. Tungsten recording electrodes (0.5–3.0 MΩ, FHC, Bowdoin, ME) were slowly inserted into the LA (approximately 3.5 mm from the brain surface). For laser stimulation experiments, another craniotomy was performed at the temporal lobe (1.0–2.0 mm posterior to the bregma) to expose the lateral rhinal vein. One optic fiber (200 µm diameter, 0.22 NA, Thorlabs, Newton, NJ) was inserted below the rhinal vein and forwarded till 1.0–1.5 mm from the surface. The angle of the optic fiber was approximately 75° from the vertical reference. Responses were recorded and passed to a pre-amplifier (PZ5, TDT) and an acquisition system (RZ5D, TDT). Signals were filtered for field potential or spikes with respective bandwidth ranges of 10–500 and 1–5000 Hz. All recordings were stored using TDT software (OpenEx, TDT). The maximum sound intensity was defined as the intensity that elicited a saturated AEP. The AEP baseline was recorded with 50% of the maximum sound intensity at a 5 s intertrial interval for 20 min. For high-frequency electrical stimulation experiments, we used ∼ 70% of the maximum sound intensity and a 150 µA electrical stimulation current. For HFLS experiments, we used &gt;10 mW laser power to ensure activation of transfected axons. After AEP-LTP induction, we recorded the AEP for another 20 min.</p><p>For recording in the EC, we applied the protocol from the Li I. Zhang Laboratory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>). Craniotomy was performed at the juncture of the temporal, occipital, and interparietal bones and exposed the caudal rhinal vein and the transverse sinus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Electrodes were inserted approximately 1 mm below the dura mater.</p><p>All field potential data were extracted and processed in the MATLAB program, and all single-unit data were extracted from the TDT data tank to the Offline Sorter (Plexon) for spike sorting. Sorted data were forwarded to the Neuroexplorer (Plexon) for additional processing and visualization.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Plasmid construction and AAV packaging</title><p>The sequence and cloning details of plasmid will be described elsewhere (Su et al., manuscript in preparation). In principle, we generated AAV vectors that allow Cre-controlled expression of shRNA and channelrhodopsin in neurons. For plasmid pAAV-Cre-ON-mU6-ShRNA-CAG-ChR2(E123T/T159C), shRNA was placed under the control of a mouse U6 (mU6) promoter inserted with a TATALox element (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ventura et al., 2004</xref>). CAG-DIO-ChR2(E123T/T159C) cassette was inserted following the mU6-TATAlox-ShRNA cassette.</p><p>In brief, the pAAV backbone was recovered after digesting pAAV-CAG-Flex-tdTomato (Addgene 28306) with NdeI and HindIII. Fragment 1 (pUC57-Cre-ON-mU6-shRNA) was acquired by digesting pUC57-Cre-ON-mU6(TATALox) with HpaI and XhoI and then ligating it with annealed oligos that targets the coding sequence of <italic>Cck</italic> mRNA (Anti-<italic>Cck</italic>) or nonsense sequence (Anti-Scramble). Fragment 2 was acquired by digesting pUC57-CAG-DIO-ChR2(E123T/T159C-Flag) with XhoI and HindIII. Fragment 3 was acquired by digesting pUC57-CAG-DIO-mCherry-EYFP (inverted) with EcoRI and HindIII. pAAV backbone, Fragment 1 and Fragment 2, was ligated to make pAAV-Cre-ON-mU6-ShRNA-CAG-DIO-ChR2 (E123T/T159C)-Flag. pAAV backbone, Fragment 1 without shRNA, Fragment 3, was ligated to make pAAV-CAG-DO-mCherry-DIO-EYFP. DNA templates and shRNA oligos mentioned above were acquired from Addgene or synthesized from BGI (Shenzhen, China) and verified by sequencing.</p><p>For AAV packaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Xiong et al., 2015</xref>), HEK293T cells were seeded into five dishes (15 cm, poly-D-lysine coated) for one viral preparation 1 day before transfection. Standard medium (DMEM, + 10% FBS and antibiotics) were used for HEK293T cells. For PEI transfection, mix 35 μg AAV8 helper plasmid, 35 μg AAV vector, 100 μg pHGTI-adenol, 510 μL of PEI (1 μg/mL, Sigma) with DMEM (without FBS or antibiotics) to final volume of 25 mL. Incubate this mixture at room temperature for 15 min. Meanwhile, replace the media in dishes with DMEM + 10% NuSerum (Bio-gene)+ antibiotics (20 mL/plate). Then add 5 mL of transformation mix per plate. Twenty-four hours after transfection, change the culture media to DMEM + antibiotics without Serum; 72 hr after transfection, culture medium was collected and filtered to get rid of cell pellets. Collected medium was stirred at 4℃ for 1.5 hr, meanwhile mixed with NaCl (final concentration of 0.4 M) and PEG8000 (final concentration of 8.5% w/v). Virus were precipitated by centrifugation at 7000 <italic>g</italic> for 10 min. Supernatant was discarded and 10 mL lysis buffer (150 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris pH = 8.0) was added to re-suspend the virus pellet. Virus was then concentrated and purified via iodixanol gradients (‘Optiprep’ Sigma D1556-250mL). Centrifuge the gradients for 90 min at 46,500 rpm at 16℃. The virus in 40% fraction was harvested and mixed with PBS and then transferred to an Amacon 100 K columns – UFC910008 to remove the iodixanol. Purity and titer of virus were then assessed by SDS-PAGE and SYPRO ruby staining (S-12000, Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Viral and tracer injection</title><p>Mice were subjected to the surgical procedures described above. For viral injection into the EC, the following rostral parameters were used: anterior-posterior (AP) = 3.25 mm, medial-lateral (ML) = 3.80 mm, dorsal-ventral (DV) = 3.60 mm from the surface, volume = 100 nL. Similarly, the following caudal parameters were used: AP = 4.25 mm, ML = 3.60 mm, DV = 2.60 mm from surface, volume = 200 nL. For injection of tracer or virus into the LA, we used the following parameters: AP = 1.70 mm, ML = 3.40 mm, DV = 3.70 mm from the surface, volume = 200 nL. Craniotomy was performed after skull levelling and partial opening of the dura mater using a syringe needle hook (29 G). We used the Nanoliter2000 system (World Precision Instruments, Sarasota County, FL) for all infusions. Viral or tracer infusions were slowly pumped into brain tissue trough a fine-tip glass pipette filled with silicon oil at a speed of no more than 50 nL/min. After infusion, the pipette was left in the injection site for an extra 5–10 min before slow withdrawal. After withdrawal of the pipette, the scalp was sutured, and a local anesthetic was applied. The animal was returned to its home cage after awaking. For axon stimulation (observation), the virus was expressed for at least 7 weeks, and for cell body stimulation (observation), the virus was expressed for at least 4 weeks. For CTB tracer labeling, we perfused animals after 7 days of viral expression.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Real-time PCR</title><p>To determine the expression of <italic>Cck</italic> after injecting our AAV carrying anti-<italic>Cck</italic> or anti-Scramble shRNA, real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) was performed regarding the injection site (EC) and a reference site (contralateral AC). After expressing shRNA for at least 3 weeks, mice were deeply anesthetized with isoflurane (RWD, Shenzhen, China), and the brains were harvested. Tissue from target areas was collected and RNA from these tissues was first extracted by using Trizol (Cat# 15596018, Invitrogen, Waltham, MA) and then reverse-transcribed to cDNA with the PrimeScript RT Reagent Kit (Cat# RR037B, TaKaRA Bio Inc, Kusatsu, Shiga, Japan). Real-time PCR was performed by using TB Green Premix Ex Taq II (Cat# RR820A, TaKaRa). All samples were tested in triplicate. The primers used were listed in Table 1. The comparative cycle threshold (Ct) method (2^-ΔΔCt) was employed to calculate the relative level of gene expression. The housekeeping gene GAPDH was used to normalize the original Ct values in our current experiments.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Optic fiber implantation</title><p>Mice were subjected to the surgical procedures described above. Craniotomy was performed bilaterally to target the LA using the coordinates described above. Optic fibers (optic cannulae) were gently inserted into the LA (50–100 µm above the target area) and fixed with dental cement (mega PRESS NV + JET X, megadental GmbH, Büdingen, Germany). For head fixation, a long screw was fixed to the skull with dental cement at a 45° angle from the vertical axis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Fiber photometry</title><p>The commercial 1-site Fiber Photometry System (Doric Lenses Inc, Quebec, Canada) coupled with the RZ5D processor (TDT, Alachua, FL) was used in the current study. Excitation light at 470 and 405 nm was emitted from two fiber-coupled LEDs (M470F3 and M405FP1, Thorlabs) and sinusoidally modulated at 210 and 330 Hz, respectively. The intensity of the excitation light was controlled by an LED driver (LEDD1B, Thorlabs) connected with the RZ5D processor via the software Synapse. Excitation light was delivered to the animal through a dichroic mirror embedded in single fluorescence MiniCube (Doric Lenses, Quebec, QC, Canada) in a fiber-optic patch cord (200 μm, 0.37 NA, Inper, Hangzhou, China). The intensity of the excitation light at the tip of the patch cord was adjusted to less than 30 μW to avoid photobleaching. The emission fluorescence was collected and transmitted through a bandpass filtered by the MiniCube. The fluorescent signal was then detected, amplified, and converted to an analog signal by the photoreceiver (Doric Lenses). Finally, the analog signal was digitalized by the RZ5D processor and analyzed using Synapse software at 1 kHz with a 5 Hz low-pass filter.</p><p>Optical fiber implantation and fiber photometry were used to visualize CCK activity in vivo via a fluorescent sensor. Briefly, the GPCR activation-based CCK sensor (GRAB<sub>CCK</sub>, AAV-hSyn-CCK2.0) was developed by inserting a circular-permutated green fluorescent protein (cpEGFP) into the intracellular domain of CCKBR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jing et al., 2019</xref>). Binding of CCKBR with its endogenous or exogenous ligand (CCK) induces a conformational change in cpEGFP and results in increased fluorescence intensity, which we measured by fiber photometry.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Chemogenetic manipulation</title><p>Each animal (with DREADD virus injection) received CLZ (0.5 mg/kg, Sigma-Aldrich, dissolved with 0.1% DMSO) or vehicle (sterilized saline with 0.1% DMSO) by intraperitoneal injection.

After 6 weeks, animals received bilateral optic fiber implantation as described above. Mice were allowed a 1 week recovery before being subject to the long-trace or long-delay fear conditioning. Baseline freezing percentages were recorded in the test context on the pre-conditioning day as described above. On the conditioning day, mice were connected with the optic cables, which are relayed by a rotatory joint (Inper, Hangzhou, China) then connected to a 635 nm laser source (Inper, Hangzhou, China). For long-trace fear conditioning paradigm, the training procedures were described as above while the laser illumination was applied from the onset of the CS to the onset of the US with a frequency of 5 Hz (100 ms illumination +100 ms interval, 12 mW at tip). For long-delay fear conditioning paradigm, a 30-s-long CS was co-terminated with a 0.5-s-long US. Laser illumination with same intensity and frequency covered the whole CS presentation. Three trials of CS-US pairing were conducted in each training day and animals totally received 2 days of training. After training, on post-conditioning day, the conditioned response of the animal was recorded in the test context. All activity was captured by a camera on the ceiling and analyzed with the previously described Bonsai program.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Anatomy and immunohistochemistry</title><p>Animals were anesthetized with an overdose of pentobarbital sodium, perfused with ice-cold phosphate buffered saline (PBS, 0.01 M, Sigma-Aldrich), and fixed with paraformaldehyde solution (PFA, 4% in PBS, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX). Animals were decapitated, and the brain was gently removed and submerged into 4% PFA solution for additional fixation (~48 hr). Brains were sectioned into 40-µm-thick slices on vibratome (Leica VT1000 S). To observe viral expression, neural tracer labeling, or electrode track verification, sections were counter-stained with DAPI (1:10000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 10 min and mounted onto slides with 70% glycerol (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) in PBS. For immunohistochemistry, sections were washed with 0.01 M PBS three times for 7 min each and blocked with blocking solution (5% goat serum and 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS) at room temperature for 1.5 hr. Each primary antibody was diluted to the appropriate concentration (Table 1) in blocking solution and incubated on sections overnight at 4°C. The next day, sections were washed with PBS three times for 7 min each and stained with secondary antibody, which was prepared in PBST (0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS). Each secondary antibody was incubated on sections at room temperature for 3 hr. After secondary incubation, the sections were washed with PBS three times for 7 min each and counter-stained with DAPI for 10 min.

during associative fear learning, the medial temporal lobe memory system, including the entorhinal cortex, participates in bridging temporal gaps (trace periods) between the sensory stimuli and aversive outcomes. However, the circuit connections between these structures that allow for trace fear learning have not been clarified.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Joshua Johansen as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Kate Wassum as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Stephen Maren (Reviewer #2); Fabricio do Monte (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) A central claim and potentially the most important scientific advance in the paper is the identification of a peptidergic entorhinal cortex (EC)-lateral amygdala (LA) pathway for trace fear conditioning. However, the authors have not shown definitively that this circuit is specifically involved in trace, as opposed to delay (overlapping CS and US) or context, fear conditioning. This is important as trace conditioning involves a distinct process, a trace period which needs to be bridged, which is not present in delay fear conditioning. This is particularly relevant for the manipulation experiments described in Figure 8 which most strongly support the existence of the EC-LA peptidergic pathway. Ideally, the authors would redo these optogenetic experiments and compare the effects of the optogenetic manipulation on both trace and delay conditioning using a more classical trace protocol (e.g. 10 sec CS and 20 sec trace period as in other parts of the paper) and possibly a long-delay control (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16904919/) which does not have a trace period and instead extends the CS period to 30 seconds total to co-terminate with the shock US. If there is an effect of this manipulation on both trace and delay fear conditioning, then the authors would need to change the interpretation of their findings considerably.</p><p>2) In determining the effects of experimental manipulations on freezing scores, the primary behavioral readout in this study, the authors make inappropriate use of statistical tests. While the authors' comparisons of group averages for freezing are reasonable, the use of t-tests to compare the effects of manipulations across time during trials is inappropriate and would be better suited for repeated measures ANOVAs. This issue can be easily addressed by reanalysis of this set of data.</p><p>3) The use of shRNA knockdown in EC-CCK<sup>+</sup> cells to reduce the optogenetic assisted enhancement of auditory processing plasticity in the LA (Figure 7) is an elegant test of whether CCK is the molecule in these cells which is responsible for the plasticity induction. However, the authors should also verify that their shRNA constructs are in fact targeting CCK. This could be done by quantifying CCK transcript/mRNA from EC punches and/or performing immunohistochemistry for CCK in virus treated experimental vs. control tissue.</p><p>Below are more detailed comments:</p><p>1) It looks from the WT example trace in Figure 2g that the CCK<sup>-/-</sup> animals have larger amplitude and slope than the WT controls. Since the authors normalize to the baseline, it is possible that there is synaptic saturation in the CCK<sup>-/-</sup> animals and that LTP is occluded, not that potentiation is blocked. The authors should examine this more thoroughly in some way, perhaps analyzing slope and amplitude before and after LTP induction in CCK<sup>-/-</sup> and WT animals. This is also an issue for the data in Figure 6e-j and Figure 7 and should be addressed in a similar way.</p><p>2) For the AEP experiments, it is not clear what sound intensities were used and whether there were differences between groups. The authors say that they used sound intensities that were '50% of the maximum sound intensity at a 5 s intertrial interval…&quot; for the baseline sessions and ~70% of the maximum sound intensity (defined as intensity that elicited saturated response) for the HFS experiments, but that is not enough information for the reader to understand what was done. The authors should explicitly describe what sound intensities were actually used for CCK<sup>-/-</sup> and WT animals, possibly using a bar graph (to show averages) with individual animal data-points embedded.</p><p>3) The authors conclude that MGB doesn't contain LA projecting CCK<sup>+</sup> cells based on their cre-dependent expression of retroAAV expressed fluorophore (Figure 3i). However, it is possible that retroAAV is not expressed in MGB cells because of tropism. The authors should inject a retroAAV-fluophore (no cre-dependent) into LA to determine whether the fluorophore is expressed in MGB to control for this possibility.</p><p>4) For the data in Figure 3k-l, the authors should quantify the proportion of retroAAV labeled cells which are CaMKII+ and GAD67+.</p><p>5) The use of shRNA knockdown in EC-CCK<sup>+</sup> cells to reduce the optogenetic assisted enhancement of auditory processing plasticity in the LA (Figure 7) is a nice test of whether CCK is the molecule responsible for the plasticity induction. However, they should determine whether this approach is in fact cre-dependent by injecting the cre-dependent shRNA/ChR2 into the EC of WT mice. Most importantly, they should also verify that their shRNA constructs are in fact targeting CCK. They could do this by quantifying CCK transcript from EC punches and/or performing immuno for CCK in virus treated experimental vs. control tissue.</p><p>6) The authors previously demonstrated that CCK-deficient mice have impairments in delay fear conditioning (Chen et al., 2019). Hence the observed impairments in trace fear conditioning may reflect a general deficit in delay fear conditioning (rather than a specific deficit in trace conditioning). An important control to isolate the nature of deficits in animals undergoing trace fear conditioning is animals conditioned with the same CS-US inter stimulus interval – but without an intervening trace. These so-called &quot;long-delay controls&quot; de-confound the stimulus-free trace interval and the long CS-US ISI in the trace conditioning procedure.</p><p>7) For the final optogenetic experiment (Figure 8), the authors use a short trace period of 2 sec in contrast with the 20 sec trace period they use in most of the other experiments. This is an issue because prior work has shown that short trace periods like this are more similar to normal delay/traditional fear conditioning without a trace period and don't engage the hippocampus (Chowdhury et al. 2005). This is an important experiment because it provides the only direct, functional support for the idea that EC-CCK projections to LA regulate trace fear conditioning. The authors should redo this experiment with the longer 20 sec trace interval. They should also tone down their argument that this pathway is important specifically in trace fear conditioning as the short 2 sec trace experiment may in fact be a form of delay fear learning. If they want to explicitly test this then they should perform the same experiment with delay fear conditioning (i.e. overlapping CS and US).</p><p>8) Another concern is that it trace conditioning may depend, in part, on contextual conditioning – neural manipulations (eg, HPC lesions) that impair trace often cause contextual conditioning impairments. As the authors note, the EC and its projections to the amygdala have been implicated in contextual fear conditioning, so the observed impairments in trace might be due to underlying impairments on contextual fear conditioning. It would be important to understand whether CCK deficient mice have deficits in contextual conditioning or long-delay auditory fear conditioning. If so, there is nothing unique about the contribution of EC-&gt;LA projections to trace conditioning per se.</p><p>9) Statistical Considerations: For real-time freezing scores shown in several figures (Figure 1D and H, Figure 2O, Figure 4G and M), repeated measures ANOVAs would be more appropriate than t-tests for analyzing these data.</p><p>10) Methodological Considerations: For the experiments utilizing ChETA (Figure 6), it is important to note that the AAV9 serotype can be transported anterogradely, resulting in ChETA expressing in LA-CCK neurons. To address this possible issue, the authors should refer to this caveat in the text and, perhaps, show histology in LA with DAPI and EYFP overlayed to investigate the possibility of anterograde transport of the virus.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;The entorhinal cortex modulates trace fear memory formation and neuroplasticity in the mouse lateral amygdala via cholecystokinin&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

We think the long-delay controls and evidence that entorhinal cortical projections to the amygdala have some specificity for the trace conditioning procedure is especially important. The manuscript has been improved but there are a few remaining issues that need to be addressed to support the clarity and transparency of the manuscript, as outlined below:</p><p>– One small issue, on line 407-408 &quot;We found that mice expressed Jaws (Exp, N = 8/3 cages) had a prominent higher freezing percentage than mice expressed mCherry control…&quot; We think you meant to say the opposite, that Jaws expressing animals had lower freezing levels.</p><p>– One point that was raised in the earlier reviews, was that common mechanisms have been suggested to support trace and contextual fear conditioning, and that the authors may have identified a neural circuit that mediates both processes. This was addressed in the Discussion, but the likely possibility that EC-LA projections are also involved in contextual conditioning was not addressed. Please include.</p><p>– Clarify whether the quantification of freezing during the after-CS period for the short trace interval includes only the post-CS period (2 s) or also the duration of the CS (3 s).

We redid the inhibition effect of optogenetic manipulation in long-trace (10 s CS and 20 s trace interval) and long-delay (30 s CS co-terminated with 0.5 s US) experiments. The experimental group CCK-Cre mice that expressed AAV with the opto-inhibitory opsin in the EC had a significantly lower freezing percentage in the test session, compared to the control group CCK-Cre mice that expressed a control AAV virus in the EC, both after 16 training trials in the long-trace conditioning paradigm. However, in the long-delay conditioning paradigm, mice in the experimental group did not show an impaired freezing percentage compared to those in the control group. That means the optogenetic inhibition of the EC-LA CCK positive circuit can specifically interfere with the fear memory formation in long-trace conditioning, suggesting this circuit is specifically involved in trace rather than delay fear memory formation.</p><p>Please see the below quotes and Figure 8 in our revised main text for details:</p><p>Lines 367-400:</p><p>“We employed optogenetics to dissect the real-time behavioral dependency of the trace fear memory formation on the <inline-formula><mml:math id="sa2m1"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mtext>EC</mml:mtext><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>CC</mml:mtext><mml:mtext>K+</mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:mtext>→LA</mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> pathway.

We injected the AAVs carrying anti-CCK shRNA and anti-scramble shRNA respectively into the EC of CCK-Cre mice. We dissected the EC (transfected area) and AC (untransfected area) from those mice. We performed the qPCR test to quantify the expression level of <italic>Cck</italic> mRNA. The expression level of <italic>Cck</italic> mRNA in the EC of the anti-scramble group was chosen as the normalization baseline (100 ± 19.8%). We found the <italic>Cck</italic> mRNA level in the EC of the anti-CCK group was significantly reduced (41.1% ± 4.7%). Meanwhile, the <italic>Cck</italic> mRNA level from the untransfected area did not have an observable difference (129.7% ± 16.2% in the AC from anti-scramble group vs. 131.0% ± 11.9% in the AC from anti-CCK group). In conclusion, our anti-CCK shRNA effectively knocked down the expression of <italic>Cck</italic>. We updated this result in panel D of Figure 7 in the revised version.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Below are more detailed comments:</p><p>1) It looks from the WT example trace in Figure 2g that the CCK<sup>-/-</sup> animals have larger amplitude and slope than the WT controls. Since the authors normalize to the baseline, it is possible that there is synaptic saturation in the CCK<sup>-/-</sup> animals and that LTP is occluded, not that potentiation is blocked. The authors should examine this more thoroughly in some way, perhaps analyzing slope and amplitude before and after LTP induction in CCK<sup>-/-</sup> and WT animals. This is also an issue for the data in Figure 6e-j and Figure 7 and should be addressed in a similar way.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the comment. We have enough evidence to exclude the possibility of synaptic saturation leading to LTP occlusion. Firstly, based on the I-O curve we measured, we chose a moderate instead of the saturated intensity of noise stimulation in our baseline recording, which means we reserved the space of increase of AEP after LTP induction. Secondly, as the reviewer suggested, we analyzed the actual slope and amplitude of recorded fEPSP from the raw data. We found no significant difference between the slope in raw data or amplitude in the CCK<sup>-/-</sup> and WT group, excluding the possibility that LTP blockage in CCK<sup>-/-</sup> was caused by the ceiling effect of AEP. We added the data in panels D and E of Figure 2—figure supplement 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) For the AEP experiments, it is not clear what sound intensities were used and whether there were differences between groups.

We injected this retroAAV-Cre into the LA of Ai14 (Cre-dependent tdTomato reporter) mice (N=3). And we obtained highly similar results as to what from CTB tracer showed in Figure 3b-e. Besides the AC and EC, we also found retrograde tdTomato positive cell bodies at the MGB, which excluded the possible deficit that retroAAV was not expressed in MGB cells. The related images were updated in Figure S3. We also revised our interpretation that MGB has no CCK-positive projection to the LA in the revised main text as below:</p><p>“Considering the potential tropism of retroAAV that may cause the absence of AAV expression in the MGB, we injected a Cre-expressing retroAAV (retroAAV-hSyn-Cre) into the LA of the Cre-dependent tdTomato reporter Ai14 mice (N = 3).

We injected this Cre-dependent shRNA/ChR2 into the EC of WT mice and confirmed the Cre-dependency of the virus as immunostaining detected no ChR2 signal in the slices from these WT mice. This result was updated in the Figure 7—figure supplement 1. Meanwhile, we also used qPCR to verify the knockdown efficiency of our shRNA in CCK-Cre mice.

We redid our opto-inhibition experiment to clarify the specific modulation effect of the EC-LA CCK positive pathway on long trace conditioning. As the reviewer suggested, we used the long-delay control to segregate the deficit of animals in trace fear conditioning. We found this pathway is involved explicitly in trace conditioning. However, the deficiency in CCK-KO mice may be broader than optogenetic inhibition on the EC-LA CCK pathway, as stated in the revised Discussion.</p><p>“We previously reported that WT animals form CS-US associations after three training trials with minimal fear generalization in auditory-cued delay fear conditioning.

We redid our opto-inhibition experiment.

Our other ongoing studies found deficits in spatial memory formation in the Morris water maze test in CCK-KO mice. Therefore, we cannot guarantee the uniqueness of the deficiency in CCK-KO mice. Our current study focused on clarifying the function of the EC-LA CCK-positive pathway. Following the suggestions from reviewers, we conducted the opto-inhibition experiment on both long-trace and long-delay conditioning, and we found the uniqueness of this pathway in the formation of long-trace fear memory instead of long-delay fear memory.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) Statistical Considerations: For real-time freezing scores shown in several figures (Figure 1D and H, Figure 2O, Figure 4G and M), repeated measures ANOVAs would be more appropriate than t-tests for analyzing these data.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the suggestion, and we re-analyzed the relevant data with two-way RM ANOVA followed by Bonferroni multiple pairwise comparisons.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) Methodological Considerations: For the experiments utilizing ChETA (Figure 6), it is important to note that the AAV9 serotype can be transported anterogradely, resulting in ChETA expressing in LA-CCK neurons.

After re-examination of the histological images showing the overlay of DAPI and EYFP at LA, we could exclude the post-synaptic labelling of LA-CCK neurons caused by AAV9 anterograde transportation. We could hardly observe the EYFP positive cell bodies at LA. We could think of the following two possibilities. The virus we used in Figure 6 (AAV9-EF1a-DIO-CHETA-EYFP) uses EF1a as the promoter, which could be less potent than the reported hSyn and CMV promoter (Zingg et al., Neuron, 2016) in anterograde transmission. Another possibility is that the viral titer we used (around 5e12 GC/ml) is much lower than reported in the above paper (more than 1e13 GC/ml).

We found that mice expressed Jaws (Exp, N = 8/3 cages) had a prominent lower freezing percentage than mice expressed mCherry control (Ctrl, N = 9/3 cages), while in baseline session, there is no statistical difference between these groups (Figure 8e, two-way RM ANOVA, significant interaction, F[1,15] = 5.59, <italic>P</italic> = 0.032 &lt; 0.05; in baseline session, Exp vs. Ctrl, 7.8 ± 2.1% vs. 11.6 ± 2.0%; 95% CI, [3.4%, 12.2%] vs. [7.4%, 15.7%]; <italic>P</italic> = 0.208 &gt; 0.05; in post-training session, Exp vs. Ctrl, 33.3 ± 5.3 % vs. 51.9 ± 5.0 %; 95% CI, [22.1%, 44.5%] vs. [41.4%, 62.5%]; <italic>P</italic> = 0.021 &lt; 0.05; Video 11-12).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– One point that was raised in the earlier reviews, was that common mechanisms have been suggested to support trace and contextual fear conditioning, and that the authors may have identified a neural circuit that mediates both processes. This was addressed in the Discussion, but the likely possibility that EC-LA projections are also involved in contextual conditioning was not addressed. Please include.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the suggestion. We included the following paragraph in our Discussion.</p><p>“Of note, we cannot underestimate the dependence of trace fear memory on contextual fear memory because some critical areas, include the hippocampus (McEchron et al., 1998) and the medial prefrontal cortex (Gilmartin and Helmstetter, 2010), contribute to both types of fear memory. […] Therefore, our unveiled CCK positive EC-LA projections may also involve the formation of contextual fear.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Clarify whether the quantification of freezing during the after-CS period for the short trace interval includes only the post-CS period (2 s) or also the duration of the CS (3 s). Provide the same information for the long trace interval experiments too.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for this suggestion, and we added the following description in our main text:</p><p>&quot;We calculated the freezing percentage during the after-CS period including the duration of CS (10 s) and the trace interval (20 s) and the before-CS period with the time window of the same length of 30 s immediately before the CS presentation.”</p><p>&quot;Same as above, we calculated the freezing percentage during the after-CS period including the duration of CS (3 s) and the trace interval (2 s) and during the before-CS period with the same time window of 5 s immediately before the CS presentation.&quot;</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– For Figure 6H, consider using a schematic similar to what you have used for Figure 3F.
