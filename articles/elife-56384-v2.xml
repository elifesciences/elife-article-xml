ultrastructure in comparison with a standard chemical fixation method (Korogod et al., 2015). Extracellular space matched physiological measurements, there were larger numbers of docked vesicles and less glial coverage of synapses and blood capillaries. Here, using the same preservation approaches, we compared the morphology of dendritic spines. We show that the length of the spine and the volume of its head is unchanged; however, the spine neck width is thinner by more than 30% after cryo fixation. In addition, the weak correlation between spine neck width and head volume seen after chemical fixation was not present in cryo-fixed spines. Our data suggest that spine neck geometry is independent of the spine head volume, with cryo fixation showing enhanced spine head compartmentalization and a higher predicted electrical resistance between spine head and parent dendrite.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cryo fixation</kwd><kwd>dendritic spine</kwd><kwd>electron microscopy</kwd><kwd>ultrastructure</kwd><kwd>dendrite</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Swiss National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31003A_182010</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Petersen</surname><given-names>Carl CH</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Swiss National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31003A_170082</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Knott</surname><given-names>Graham William</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Japanese Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>JP17KK0191</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tamada</surname><given-names>Hiromi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Swiss National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CRSII3_154453</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Petersen</surname><given-names>Carl CH</given-names></name><name><surname>Knott</surname><given-names>Graham William</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Cryo preservation of brain tissue reveals dendritic spines with thinner necks compared to those prepared with chemical fixation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In our previous paper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Korogod et al., 2015</xref>), we used a cryo fixation method to study the neuropil of the adult mouse cerebral cortex, comparing it with a standard chemical fixation approach that has been used for many years to preserve brain tissue for analysis with electron microscopy (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Spacek and Harris, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Knott et al., 2002</xref>). This study had been motivated by the work of Anton Van Harreveld (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Van Harreveld et al., 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Van Harreveld and Malhotra, 1967</xref>; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Korogod et al., 2015</xref> for detailed description) who had been the first to show how fresh, cryo frozen brain tissue showed appreciable amounts of extracellular space which was not present in tissue asphyxiated for 8 min. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Korogod et al., 2015</xref> elaborated on this result showing how cryo fixation preserved an extracellular space matching previous in vivo measurements, whereas chemically fixed tissue shows reduced extracellular space. Furthermore, synapse density and vesicle docking, as well as astrocytic processes close to synapses and around blood capillaries, were significantly different between the two fixation methods. This led us in this study to investigate the extent to which dendritic spines might be affected by chemical fixation.</p><p>The dendritic spine is a small dendritic protrusion that carries the majority of the excitatory synaptic connections in the adult brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Colonnier, 1968</xref>) with a size and shape that is closely linked with its function (reviewed by: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Holtmaat and Svoboda, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Harris and Kater, 1994</xref>). The larger the spine head, the larger its synapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Harris and Stevens, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arellano et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Knott et al., 2006</xref>), the number of its receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kharazia and Weinberg, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Noguchi et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nusser et al., 1998</xref>), and its synaptic strength (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Matsuzaki et al., 2001</xref>). However, the synapse on the spine head is separated from the parent dendrite by the spine neck. This is often thin, compartmentalizing biochemical signals and creating a potentially significant electrical resistance between synapse and dendrite. Changes in the morphology of spine head and neck have been seen after different forms of activity including LTP induction and tetanic stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lang et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Matsuzaki et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Harvey and Svoboda, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tønnesen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fifková and Anderson, 1981</xref>). The understanding of dendritic spine morphology and function has come from many years of analysis using ultrastructural and in vivo analysis with electron and light microscopy. Up until now, however, all the ultrastructural data comes from chemically fixed samples. These show that the brightness of in vivo imaged spines closely correlates with their volume measured in serial electron microscopy images (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Knott et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cane et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nägerl et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">El-Boustani et al., 2018</xref>). Although the resolution of light microscopy had limited the comparison of such features of spine length, and width from living neurons, the super resolution methods of STED and FRAP have been able to make these measurements in hippocampal spines in both slices and in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tønnesen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pfeiffer et al., 2018</xref>). We investigated these parameters using serial section electron microscopy to compare the sizes of spine heads, their neck lengths and neck widths between cryo and chemically fixed tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). We show that although cryo fixation reveals unchanged spine neck length and head volume, the spine neck is significantly narrower in cryo-fixed tissue compared to chemically fixed tissue, likely having an important impact upon consideration of the communication between a spine and its parent dendrite.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Serial section electron microscopy to compare the sizes of spine heads, their neck lengths and neck widths between cryo and chemically fixed tissue.</title><p>Dendritic spines in chemically fixed (<bold>A, B, C</bold>) and cryo-fixed (<bold>D, E, F</bold>) neuropil were reconstructed in 3D from serial electron micrographs.

As before, these revealed very little extracellular space with chemical fixation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), while cryo fixation showed elements more dispersed with significant spaces separating them. The cryo-fixed membranes also had a distinct appearance from those exposed to chemical fixative. Cryo-fixed membranes were smoothly curving and lacked wrinkles typically seen after chemical fixation. Furthermore, the cryo-fixed tissue showed many thin processes, some of which were spine necks, which form the focus of the current study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><p>Quantifying spine geometry, we found that the mean spine neck cross-sectional area was significantly narrower in the cryo-fixed samples (cryo fixation, 0.0159 ± 0.0185 µm<sup>2</sup>; chemical fixation, 0.0284 ± 0.0197 µm<sup>2</sup>; unpaired Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, p&lt;0.0001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

We also found no correlation between the head volume and neck length in either cryo-fixed or chemically fixed spines (cryo fixation, r = 0.124, p=0.18; chemical fixation, r = 0.044, p=0.59, non-parametric Spearman test) and also no correlation between the neck length and the neck diameter (cryo fixation, r = −0.020, p=0.83; chemical fixation, r = −0.155, p=0.059, non-parametric Spearman test).</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Chemically fixed, but not cryo-fixed, spines show a correlation between neck width and head volume.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Correlation between neck diameter and neck length for cryo-fixed spines (Spearman r = −0.020, p=0.83, n = 116 spines, N = 5 mice) and chemically fixed spines (Spearman r = −0.155, p=0.059, n = 150, N = 3 mice).

Previous EM analyses have shown that spines with larger heads tend to be those where membranous structures, such as endoplasmic reticulum (ER), are present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Spacek and Harris, 1997</xref>). If, by their presence, these structures enlarge the neck then this may have an influence on the correlation between head volume and neck thickness. We investigated this question by grouping dendritic spines (chemical fixation, n = 75; cryo fix, n = 98) according to whether or not membranes were present in the neck (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). We scored this as ER, and did not classify them further as cisterns or vesicles as unequivocal classification in the cryo-fixed material was not possible. The cryo preparation method, where there is less extraction of molecules results in less contrast between the membranes, cytoplasm and extracellular compartments. Also, despite the sub-nanometre resolution of TEM imaging, the section thickness of 50 nm gives an obscured view of the details within the spine necks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A’, B’, C’</xref>). FIBSEM imaging generates images with less contrast at a lower resolution. This analysis showed that spine neck length and the spine neck diameter were not different if membranes were present or absent, neither in cryo-fixed tissue nor in chemically fixed tissue (neck length, chemical fixation p=0.95, cryo fixation p=0.99; spine neck diameter, chemical fixation p=0.08, cryo fixation p=0.81; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D,E</xref>). Therefore, the presence of intracellular compartments within the neck do not appear to determine its thickness. However, spines in which ER is present in the spine neck do have larger heads after both cryo and chemical fixation (chemical fixation p&lt;0.0001, cryo fixation p=0.0074; Tukey’s multiple comparison test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>), in agreement with a previous study of chemically fixed spines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Spacek and Harris, 1997</xref>).</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Dendritic spine geometry and the presence of membranes in the spine neck.</title><p>(<bold>A, B, C</bold>) show examples of cryo-fixed spines, and higher magnification views of their necks (<bold>A’, B’, C’</bold>).

We found that the volume of spine heads and the length of spine necks are unaltered by chemical fixation, and only the size of the spine neck is changed, being 42% thicker in diameter in chemically fixed tissue compared to cryo-fixed tissue. The thinner spine necks observed in cryo-fixed tissue suggest a larger electrical resistance coupling spines to parent dendrites than previously indicated from analysis of chemically fixed tissue.</p><p>Several of the parameters we assessed here appear to show that spines remain largely unchanged between chemical and cryo fixation, in agreement with previously published work. Spine head volume in cryo-fixed tissue was 0.069 µm<sup>3</sup>, which was not different to the spine volume in chemically fixed tissue of 0.081 µm<sup>3</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Our spine volume measurements are similar to other studies in the same region of the mouse brain (0.06 ± 0.04 µm<sup>3</sup>, layer 4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rodriguez-Moreno et al., 2018</xref>]; 0.075 ± 0.005 µm<sup>3</sup> - 0.079 ± 0.006 µm<sup>3</sup>, layer 1, adult and aged mice, layer 1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Calì et al., 2018</xref>]). Our measurement of mean spine length after cryo-fixation of 0.77 ± 0.55 µm was not different from the length of 0.84 ± 0.57 µm in chemically fixed tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), and is similar to other studies, for example rat CA1 hippocampus, 0.45 ± 0.29 µm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Harris and Stevens, 1989</xref>) rat cerebellum, 0.66 ± 0.32 µm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Harris and Stevens, 1988</xref>) and mouse layer 2/3 pyramidal cells, 0.66 ± 0.37 µm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arellano et al., 2007</xref>). Despite the fact that chemical fixation causes important changes to the extracellular space and astrocytic arrangement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Korogod et al., 2015</xref>), the overall structure of dendritic spines appears to be resilient to the alterations that the aldehydes are causing.</p><p>On the other hand, our results suggest that spine neck thickness is affected by chemical fixation, with a mean diameter of 128 nm in cryo-fixed tissue compared to 182 nm in chemically fixed tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). This finding raises the question as to what could be happening during the aldehyde preservation method that could explain the widening. Spines are highly dynamic structures, with their shape changing during development and also adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nimchinsky et al., 2002</xref>), and in concert with changes in synapse size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sala and Segal, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Knott et al., 2006</xref>). To explain dynamic spine morphology, we need to consider the structural components. Actin is present throughout spines, with branched and linear actin being in different proportions in the neck and head (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Matus, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Korobova and Svitkina, 2010</xref>). This cytoskeleton determines the size and shape of the spine, with synaptic activation capable of altering the quantities of filamentous actin, and changing spine shape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Honkura et al., 2008</xref>). Modeling of dendritic spines using the physical properties of different structural components suggests the presence and arrangement of different proteins, such as actin in the neck, maintain its diameter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Miermans et al., 2017</xref>). This is supported by evidence of a clear periodic arrangement of actin rings in the spine neck (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bär et al., 2016</xref>) as well as various experiments showing that disruption of the actin regulatory pathways lead to changes in the spine shape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Basu and Lamprecht, 2018</xref>). However, preserving the integrity of actin is difficult, due to its sensitivity to aldehyde fixatives such as the ones used here (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boyles et al., 1985</xref>). Therefore, the shape of spines appears to be critically dependent on the arrangement of actin, which is dismantled on exposure to aldehydes, and this is likely to contribute to the differences in spine necks comparing cryo-fixed and chemically fixed tissue.</p><p>Some spine necks have also been shown to be rich in other proteins, such as the GTPases from the septin family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tada et al., 2007</xref>), thought to be involved in the restriction of movement of certain membrane proteins out of the spine head (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ewers et al., 2014</xref>). A differential protein concentration within this narrowed part of the spine could exert on oncotic pressure pulling water into this region during chemical fixation.</p><p>We cannot exclude the possibility that chemical fixation leaves the spine neck unchanged with the differences measured occurring during the process of tissue extraction, before cryo fixation. However, we think this unlikely, as although the effects of hypoxia on dendrites have been investigated - showing changes such as swelling, the formation of filopodia, and the elongation of immature spines - these were seen after 15 min (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jourdain et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Segura et al., 2016</xref>). Our workflow vitrifies samples within 90 s of the heart stopping and within the first 30 s the tissue had been extracted and placed on a cooled surface. This method showed that in vivo levels of the extracellular space were preserved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Korogod et al., 2015</xref>) and there was no evidence of the compact neuropil, showing little extracellular space that is a feature of asphyxiated tissue as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Van Harreveld and Malhotra, 1967</xref>.</p><p>Our data support the observation from light microscopy showing that the morphology of the spine neck is independent of the spine head volume (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Araya et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tønnesen et al., 2014</xref>). Previous electron microscopy analysis had suggested a correlation, although only a weak one, between these parameters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arellano et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bartol et al., 2015</xref>), which we also show here with chemical fixation. However, cryo-fixed spines, presumed to be in their native state, show no correlation. Spine neck thickness, therefore, appears to be independent of the spine head volume, and therefore synapse size.</p><p>Functionally, the smaller spine widths observed in cryo-fixed tissue without change in spine neck length suggest that spine neck resistances might be higher than that implied by previous studies of chemically fixed tissue. Assuming cytosolic resistivity of 109 Ω cm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cartailler et al., 2018</xref>), we estimate a mean spine neck resistance of 110 MΩ ranging from 2 MΩ to 595 MΩ in cryo-fixed tissue compared to 44 MΩ ranging from 1 MΩ to 206 MΩ in chemically fixed tissue. It is important to note that these are likely lower bound estimates, since the presence of intracellular organelles, and large macromolecular complexes, in the spine neck will further increase spine neck resistance. Our results are consistent with estimates from physiological analyses (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bloodgood and Sabatini, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Grunditz et al., 2008</xref>) as well as morphological analyses in vivo using STED microscopy of hippocampal dendrites in CA1 showing neck widths of 147 nm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pfeiffer et al., 2018</xref>). The same imaging approach on cultured hippocampal slices gives similar results and estimated that half of spines had a resistance of greater than 56 MΩ. Here, the median value is 80 MΩ for cryo fixed, and 34 MΩ for chemically fixed spines.</p><p>At the upper end of the range of spine neck resistance, there could be a considerable impact upon spine voltage dynamics during synaptic signaling, with a 1 GΩ spine neck resistance causing a 1 mV drop in potential from spine to parent dendrite for each 1 pA of synaptic current. Given that synaptic currents are typically considered to be in the range of tens of pA, our data are consistent with tens of mV difference between spine head and dendrite for the smallest spine neck diameters. For these spines, regulation of spine neck diameter could therefore contribute to functional synaptic plasticity as previously proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bloodgood and Sabatini, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Grunditz et al., 2008</xref>). Our data showing smaller spine neck width in cryo-fixed tissue therefore suggest that spine neck resistance may play a more important role in synaptic signaling compared to estimates based on chemically fixed tissue.</p><p>These results, and those from our previous paper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Korogod et al., 2015</xref>), indicate how cryo fixation gives a truer representation of neuronal structure, at least at the level of dendritic spines. In future studies, it will be of great interest to examine axonal structure comparing cryo and chemical fixation. However, achieving a reliable preservation of neuronal tissue in its native state, and in significant volumes, is not possible with freezing due to the limited thickness to which vitrification can occur in samples with such high water content. Therefore, chemical fixation is still the best method for the preservation of significant volumes of nervous tissues, and variations to this approach that address some of its drawbacks have been used, such as alterations to osmolarity to correct for extracellular space loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pallotto et al., 2015</xref>). Our cryo fixation also uses a low-temperature embedding method with the replacement of water with solvents containing heavy metal stains. Advances in focused ion beam microscopy at cryo temperatures have shown that these steps may be avoidable in the future, removing any possible structural changes they may cause (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Schertel et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zachs et al., 2020</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>The sample preparation and imaging methods were identical to those used in our previous paper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Korogod et al., 2015</xref>) and described briefly below.</p><sec id="s4-1"><title>Preparation of cryo-fixed tissue</title><p>This study was performed in strict accordance with the rules issued by the Swiss Federal Veterinary Office, under authorization 1889 issued by the 'Service de la consommation et des affaires vétérinaires' of the Canton de Vaud, Switzerland.

Adult mice (male, C57BL/6J, 6–10 weeks old, N = 5 mice) were deeply anesthetized with isoflurane (experimentation license 1889.3; Swiss Federal Veterinary Office). After decapitation, the brain was rapidly removed from the skull, placed on the top surface of a closed, cooled glass Petri dish filled with ice. The tissue was not exposed to any solutions. Razor blades were then used to slice small (approximately 2 mm x 2 mm x 0.2 mm) pieces of cortex. This was achieved by using two razor blades, one in each hand, and drawing them against each other, in opposite directions, against the surface of the glass to slice the tissues into smaller and smaller pieces. Once a piece of a suitable size is cut, it is then placed inside the 3 mm diameter and 200 µm cavity of an aluminium sample holder followed by a small drop of 1-hexadecene to remove all the air from around the piece of tissue.

transparency, eLife publishes the most substantive revision requests and the accompanying author responses.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Ultrastructural comparison of dendritic spine morphology preserved with cryo and chemical fixation&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Catherine Dulac as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: U. Valentin Nägerl (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, when editors judge that a submitted work as a whole belongs in <italic>eLife</italic> but that some conclusions require a modest amount of additional new data, as they do with your paper, we are asking that the manuscript be revised to either limit claims to those supported by data in hand, or to explicitly state that the relevant conclusions require additional supporting data.</p><p>Our expectation is that the authors will eventually carry out the additional experiments and report on how they affect the relevant conclusions either in a preprint on bioRxiv or medRxiv, or if appropriate, as a Research Advance in <italic>eLife</italic>, either of which would be linked to the original paper.</p><p>This manuscript analyzes the morphology of dendritic spines in cryo-fixated brain tissue using electron microscopy (EM). Cryo fixation is known to provide a geometric arrangement of neurites that more closely resembles the in-vivo condition. In particular, it is expected to correct the reduction of extracellular space volume that the conventional aldehyde-based fixation approaches yield in EM. Interestingly, while the morphology of the spine heads (the sites of most synapses in the cerebral cortex) was largely unaltered in cryo fixated tissue, the diameter of spine necks was reduced by about 30%. Since the spine neck constitutes a biophysically relevant electrical resistance for transmission of synaptic signals towards the neuron's cell body, such a reduced diameter carries significance for arguments about spine necks as a potential regulator for effective synapse strength. Together, this work provides a focused quantitative morphological description of one of the main sites of synaptic processing in mammalian cortex.</p><p>The reviewers agreed on a few requests, all can be addressed by additional analyses or text edits:</p><p>– More careful analysis of the spine neck effect: especially comparison to thin axons to understand whether the diameter reduction is a general effect for thin neuronal processes.</p><p>– More accurate methodological descriptions, see reviews below.</p><p>– Discussion whether cryo fixation may specifically alter thin processes (i.e. could it be that cry fixation provides an overall more realistic geometric configuration, but alters thin processes disproportionally?)

This study, therefore, only represents the first part of this quest. We have focused initially on dendritic spines because these structures have taken centre stage for a long time in a vast literature examining the structural plasticity of the brain. Much of this work has used live imaging methods, and some chemical fixation, but without any clear understanding as to what happens to spine shape during the preservation process using aldehydes. This was the motivation of our study. We agree with the reviewers that investigating the effect of chemical fixation on axons is also of great interest, and, indeed, we are collaborating with the group of Shigeki Watanabe at John’s Hopkins on exactly this topic. This collaborative project is looking at how different axons are altered by chemical fixation and together we hope to submit a paper on this topic once all the analyses are complete. This will be presented as a separate piece of work.

In addition, the journal Bio-Protocols, that collaborates with <italic>eLife</italic> to provide detailed methodologies, has accepted an elaborated write-up of this workflow, and I understand this can be linked to any final publication.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Discussion whether cryo fixation may specifically alter thin processes (i.e. could it be that cry fixation provides an overall more realistic geometric configuration, but alters thin processes disproportionally?)

The distribution of spine neck areas after chemical fixation appears to closely reflect a right-ward shift compared to the distribution of spine neck areas in cryo-fixed tissue.

The volumes imaged were 125 µm<sup>3</sup>, 1112 µm<sup>3</sup>, 504 µm<sup>3</sup>, 450 µm<sup>3</sup>, 446 µm<sup>3</sup>, and 446 µm<sup>3</sup>.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Were all spines included in the analysis or randomly sampled? If not all spines, authors need to provide more calibrations (e.g. spine density on parental dendrites). Because the traceability of thin structures was found more difficult in data set without extracellular space (Pallotto et al., 2015), sampling bias might result in a larger average spine neck width in chemical fixed samples.</p></disp-quote><p>We included all spines that were completely contained in the volumes sampled, and which could also be clearly visualized and completely segmented. We considered this to be an unbiased approach to assessing the difference between the two fixation approaches. We accept that we could not analyse all the spines in the volumes of cryo fixed material. Some spines, and in particular those with very thin necks, were difficult to follow and reconstruct in the serial images, but not to detect. Pallotto et al., 2015, used block face scanning electron microscopy (SBEM; pixel resolution of 9.8 nm); a lower resolution imaging approach, for capturing very large volumes, but it is not our understanding, or experience, that TEM or FIBSEM gives images in which spines could not be detected. As the membrane contrast in the cryo-fixed tissue is lower than in chemically fixed, however, due to the contrasting reaction taking place at cryo temperatures and less extraction of native molecules, if any thin spines are missed, this would be more likely to occur in the cryo-fixed material.</p><p>We must also point out that the depth to which vitrification occurs is limited due to the high water content of adult brain tissue. Only a few microns are well preserved before ice crystal damage is clearly evident. Therefore, we have only small volumes in which to sample spines. The idea of reconstructing pieces of dendrite and making estimates of spine density is a good one, but was not possible in volumes with such limited thickness.</p><p>We now write:</p><p>“All spines in each of the imaged volumes were reconstructed if they their entire structure was clearly visible in all of the serial images.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) What was the inter-section distance in Figure 1G and H? Were they equally distributed along spine neck? What was the criterion of compartmentalizing a spine? It would be also interesting to report width variation along spine neck.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that including the variation of the width would provide a better understanding of the spine neck morphology in the two groups of spines. This we have added to Figure 1 with a clearer explanation of how we define the neck (subsection “Image processing, analysis, 3D reconstruction, and morphometric measurements”). The cross-sectional areas that were calculated along the spine neck were always spaced equally, and were approximately 150 nm apart. Establishing an objective, and precise, measure of where the spine neck finishes and the spine head starts, across all spines, was not possible as the heads of some spines would not be detected, i.e. those whose necks expand gradually to form the head. We have tried this for the detection of axonal boutons in axonal reconstructions (Gala et al., 2017 <italic>eLife</italic>) but this only works for clearly defined boutons, such as those of excitatory axons. For this reason, we used the average neck cross sectional area, defining the neck as the region attaching the spine head to the shaft, and finishing where the neck’s width starts to expand appreciably to form the head the dendritic shaft. We do agree that this could be considered somewhat arbitrary, which would hold for all other published spine morphology studies to date. Therefore, we have now included of minimum neck width measurement. Both graphs indicated the same result that chemical fixed spines have wider necks.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Spine neck width was found around 150 nm using STED microscopy in acute brain slice (Tonnesen et al., 2014) and in vivo (Pfeffer et al., 2018 ).

As we mentioned above, this was a follow-on study (eLife Research Advance format) from the paper by Korogod et al., 2015. We are in fact engaged in a larger study with the group of Shigeki Watanabe in the analysis of the effect of chemical fixation on the morphology of axons of different types. The reviewer’s suggestion of studying intracellular organelles is of great interest. However, there were no mitochondria within any of the spines and we were not able to detect any spinules. We study effects of the presence of ER in Figure 4, finding bigger spine head volumes in the presence of ER, but no difference in spine neck length or diameter.</p><p>We also agree that it is perhaps speculative to assume that the changes are only due to the aldehyde fixation and have now added some appropriate text into the Discussion. As our previous work had shown how the extracellular compartment was the same as physiological measurements, and this had been shown, by Van Harreveld, to reduce after 8 minutes of asphyxiation we assume the morphology seen after cryo fixation was close to native, though of course we cannot be certain. We also cite papers that show changes in immature dendrites occurring after 15 minutes of hypoxia:</p><p>“We cannot exclude the possibility that chemical fixation leaves the spine neck unchanged with the differences measured occurring during the process of tissue extraction, before cryo fixation. […] This method showed that in vivo levels of the extracellular space were preserved (Korogod et al., 2015) and there was no evidence of the compact neuropil, showing little extracellular space that is a feature of asphyxiated tissue as described by Van Harreveld and Malhotra, 1967.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
