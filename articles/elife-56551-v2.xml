These mutants showed multiple developmental defects including shortened cochlear duct and abnormal apical patterning of the organ of Corti. Although ciliogenic defects in cochlear hair cells such as misalignment of the kinocilium are often associated with the planar cell polarity pathway, our results showed that inner ear defects in these mutants are primarily due to loss of sonic hedgehog signaling. Furthermore, an inner ear-specific deletion of <italic>Cilk1</italic> elicits low-frequency hearing loss attributable to cellular changes in apical cochlear identity that is dedicated to low-frequency sound detection. This type of hearing loss may account for hearing deficits in some patients with ciliopathies.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>sonic hedgehog</kwd><kwd>hearing loss</kwd><kwd>primary cilia</kwd><kwd>ciliopathies</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003725</institution-id><institution>National Research Foundation of Korea</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NRF-2014M3A9D5A01073865</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bok</surname><given-names>Jinwoong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003725</institution-id><institution>National Research Foundation of Korea</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NRF-2016R1A5A2008630</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bok</surname><given-names>Jinwoong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003725</institution-id><institution>National Research Foundation of Korea</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NRF-2017R1A2B3009133</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bok</surname><given-names>Jinwoong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003725</institution-id><institution>National Research Foundation of Korea</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NRF-2014M3A9D5A01073969</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ko</surname><given-names>Hyuk Wan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Developmental defects of the cochlea caused by dysregulation of sonic hedgehog signaling are the potential etiology for hearing loss in a group of ciliopathies with defective ciliogenesis.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The primary cilium is a microtubule-based organelle protruding from the apical surface of nearly all animal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Goetz and Anderson, 2010</xref>). This microtubular projection is anchored by the basal body and enveloped by the plasma membrane. The formation and maintenance of primary cilia are regulated by a dynamic transport system known as intraflagellar transport (IFT), which is the bidirectional cargo transport system gated by ciliary appendages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Goetz and Anderson, 2010</xref>). The ciliary cargos include proteins that make up the cilium, as well as various signaling receptors and effectors. Such enrichment of various signaling components within a slender cellular apparatus may be a good strategy to improve sensitivity to receiving signals, making the primary cilium an efficient receiving center (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Goetz and Anderson, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pala et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Primary cilia are known to play crucial roles in animal development and homeostasis by mediating various signaling pathways including sonic hedgehog (SHH), WNT, platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), TGF-β, Notch, and mechanosensation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Christensen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nishimura et al., 2019</xref>). The planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway, which is associated with non-canonical WNT signaling, has also been implicated with primary cilia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wallingford, 2012</xref>). Thus, gene mutations affecting ciliary formation and function elicit a broad spectrum of genetic disorders known as ciliopathies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nishimura et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Reiter and Leroux, 2017</xref>). Hearing loss is one of the sensorineural defects commonly observed in ciliopathies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Esposito et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lindsey et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Reiter and Leroux, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ross et al., 2005</xref>), yet the etiology of hearing loss in relation to ciliary defects remains unclear.</p><p>The organ of Corti is the peripheral auditory sensory organ of the inner ear, comprised of mechanosensory hair cells (HCs) and various supporting cells (SCs). Primary cilia are present in both HCs and SCs, with those in HCs known as kinocilia. The role of kinocilia has been highlighted by their polarized migration to the abneural (lateral) side of the HC, which guides the subsequent orientation of actin filament-rich stereociliary (hair) bundles. Thus, a hair bundle, arranged in a three-row staircase pattern, is positioned such that the tallest row is closest to the kinocilium (Figure 2A). Notably, the hair bundle of outer hair cells (OHCs) is V-shaped, with its vertex located directly adjacent to the kinocilia at the abneural side (Figure 2A). Mutants lacking kinocilia due to mutations in genes encoding the IFT complex such as <italic>Ift88</italic>, <italic>Ift20</italic>, and <italic>Kif3a</italic> exhibit abnormal hair bundle orientation and morphology as well as random localization of the basal body, which forms the basis for the kinocilium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jones et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">May-Simera et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sipe and Lu, 2011</xref>). The kinocilium-directed uniform orientation of hair bundles is considered essential for efficient responses to sound vibrations and normal hearing. However, recent studies have indicated that defective hair bundle polarity is not always associated with hearing loss, as is observed in <italic>Ttc8<sup>-/-</sup></italic> (a.k.a. <italic>Bbs8<sup>-/-</sup></italic>) and <italic>Alms1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mutant mice, in which hearing is normal until several months after birth despite evident neonatal polarity defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Collin et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jagger et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">May-Simera et al., 2015</xref>). These results suggest that polarity defects may not account for all instances of hearing loss observed in ciliopathies.</p><p>Other than polarity defects, mutants lacking primary cilia exhibit severe shortening of cochlear ducts, which may lead to hearing loss due to cochlear hypoplasia or Mondini disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jones et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">May-Simera et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Montcouquiol and Kelley, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sipe and Lu, 2011</xref>). Considering the role of primary cilia in PCP signaling, which provides the directionality for convergent extension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rida and Chen, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wallingford, 2010</xref>), cochlear shortening in ciliary mutants could result from abnormal PCP signaling. However, research has shown that <italic>Tmem67</italic> and <italic>Bbs8</italic> (a.k.a. <italic>Ttc8</italic>) mutant ciliopathy models or inner ear-specific <italic>Vangl2</italic> mutants showed normal cochlear lengths despite exhibiting severe polarity defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abdelhamed et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Copley et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">May-Simera et al., 2015</xref>). These data suggest that PCP signaling may be uncoupled from cochlear extension and that there may be an additional role of primary cilia in promoting cochlear extension.</p><p>In this study, to better understand the role of primary cilia in the cochlea, we analyzed cochlear phenotypes in three different categories of ciliopathy mouse models, including no cilia (<italic>Ift88</italic> mutants), morphologically defective cilia (<italic>Tbc1d32<sup>bromi</sup></italic> mutants), and abnormally elongated cilia (<italic>Cilk1</italic> mutants) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jones et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ko et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Moon et al., 2014</xref>). Comparative analysis of our results and previous studies suggest that there are two categories of cochlear phenotypes in ciliopathy models: one associated with impaired SHH signaling and the other without SHH-associated defects. Our work suggests that dysregulation of SHH signaling is an important consideration for the etiology of hearing loss in ciliopathies.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Primary cilia are required for SHH signal transduction in the inner ear primordium</title><p>To investigate the role of primary cilia in inner ear development, we first examined whether primary cilia are present in the otocyst, or inner ear primordium, at embryonic day (E) 10.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Primary cilia were visualized by immunostaining with antibodies against ARL13B and γ-tubulin, which are localized to the ciliary membrane and basal body, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cantagrel et al., 2008</xref>).

We thus examined whether the tonotopic properties of stereocilia were altered in 4-week-old <italic>Cilk1</italic> cKO cochlea. It is well known that stereocilia lengths are shorter at the base and gradually elongate toward the apex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wright, 1984</xref>).

These results are consistent with the downregulation of apical cochlear markers in ciliary mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).

Both sources provide an SHH activity gradient that is higher in the ventral inner ear (or apical cochlea) and gradually lower toward the dorsal inner ear (or basal cochlea), and this is mediated by a balance between GLI activator and repressor activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bok et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bok et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Driver et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Son et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Thus, inner ear defects may differ depending on when and where SHH signaling becomes impaired (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Briefly, when SHH signaling is absent (<italic>Shh<sup>-/-</sup></italic>) or when otic epithelium cannot transduce SHH signaling at all (<italic>Foxg1<sup>Cre</sup>;Smo<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic>), the cochlea is completely lost (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bok et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brown and Epstein, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Riccomagno et al., 2002</xref>).

Lastly, when SHH signaling becomes impaired after cochlear specification (<italic>Emx2<sup>Cre</sup>;Smo<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic>), mild cochlear shortening and premature HC differentiation in the developing cochlea are accompanied by low frequency hearing loss in the mature cochlea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tateya et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Our analyses of ciliary mutants, summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>, revealed that cochlear phenotypes induced by ciliary defects encompass all of the defects resulting from impaired SHH signaling described above, except for a complete loss of the cochlea observed in <italic>Shh<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mutants.

Consistent with this, primary cilia are absent from nearly all precursor cells of <italic>Tbc1d32<sup>bromi</sup></italic> mutant cochlea at E14.5, when HC differentiation has just begun and kinocilia have not yet appeared (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). A similar phenotype has been reported in <italic>Tmem67</italic> mutant cochlea, where primary cilia are selectively lost in SCs but not HCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abdelhamed et al., 2015</xref>). These results indicate that primary cilia in SCs and kinocilia in HCs utilize distinct ciliogenesis mechanisms, and these results further suggest that molecular constituents and ciliary function are different between primary cilia and kinocilia. This speculation is consistent with the distinct roles of primary cilia as SHH signaling center in the developing cochlea and of kinocilia as a regulator of hair bundle polarity in differentiating HCs.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Possible etiology of hearing loss in ciliopathy models</title><p>Based on comparative analysis of our results and previous studies (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>), we propose that cochlear phenotypes of ciliopathy mutants can be categorized into two groups: a group associated with impaired SHH signaling and the other group without SHH-associated defects.</p><p>The first group with defective ciliogenesis with abnormal SHH signaling includes most IFT complex mutants as well as <italic>Cilk1</italic> and <italic>Tbc1d32<sup>bromi</sup></italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). We and others have observed that <italic>Cilk1</italic> cKO mutants, which show relatively mild SHH impairment and survive postnatally, exhibit low frequency hearing loss at 4–7 weeks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figures 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Okamoto et al., 2017</xref>). A previous study proposed that hair bundle polarity defects are a major cause of low frequency hearing loss in <italic>Cilk1</italic> cKO mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Okamoto et al., 2017</xref>). However, <italic>Cilk1</italic> cKO cochlea exhibited only a mild hair bundle polarity defect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Furthermore, polarity defects do not always result in hearing loss as in the case of <italic>Bbs8<sup>-/-</sup></italic> and <italic>Alms1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mutants (see below), questioning the direct contribution of polarity defects to hearing function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jagger et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">May-Simera et al., 2015</xref>). Our findings here suggest that apical cochlear specification is compromised in <italic>Cilk1</italic> cKO mutants due to impaired SHH signaling, resulting in basally shifted tonotopy and low frequency hearing loss. Consistent with this, the importance of SHH signaling for low frequency hearing in humans has been demonstrated in Pallister–Hall syndrome patients, in which SHH activity is impaired due to abnormal GLI activator function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Driver et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>In the second group of ciliopathy models, which include Bardet–Biedl syndrome (<italic>Bbs4<sup>-/-</sup>, Mkks<sup>-/-</sup></italic> (<italic>Bbs6<sup>-/-</sup></italic>), and <italic>Bbs8<sup>-/-</sup></italic>), Alström syndrome (<italic>Alms1<sup>-/-</sup></italic>), and Meckel–Gruber syndrome (<italic>Tmem67<sup>-/-</sup></italic>), the primary cilia are present with relatively normal SHH signaling and normal cochlear lengths (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abdelhamed et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ezan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jagger et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Leightner et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">May-Simera et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rachel et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ross et al., 2005</xref>).

Histopathological analysis of human inner ears from Alström syndrome patients confirmed the degeneration of cochlear HCs, spiral ganglion neurons, and stria vascularis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nadol et al., 2015</xref>). These results suggest that hearing loss in the second ciliopathy group with normal SHH signaling is caused by degeneration of cochlear cells and tissues, which could be due to dysfunction of SHH-independent ciliary roles or cilium-independent roles of BBS or ALSM1 proteins.</p><p>In the current study, we show that primary cilia play multiple essential roles in cochlear development and hearing function (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Comparative analyses of various ciliopathy models (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>) indicate that hair bundle polarity defects, although observed in most ciliopathy models, are unlikely to be the major cause of hearing loss. Instead, cochlear hypoplasia (shortening) and abnormal tonotopic organization should be considered as a potential etiology for hearing loss in a group of ciliopathies with defective ciliogenesis leading to impaired SHH signaling.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources

Images of all cochlear sections were collected and numbered from the base to the apex. The number of cochlear sections were around 35–42 in wild-type cochlea, and less for ciliary mutants, between 26 and 31. To measure signal intensities in cochlear section, a rectangle (15 × 4.5 μm for <italic>A2m</italic>, <italic>Inhba</italic>, <italic>Msx1</italic>, <italic>Ptch1</italic>, <italic>Gli1</italic>, <italic>Atoh1</italic>, and <italic>Sox2</italic> and 20 × 6 μm for <italic>Fst</italic>) was positioned on the cochlear epithelial region that shows hybridization signals for the gene of interest (e.g. the lesser epithelial ridge area for <italic>Msx1</italic>), and the signal intensity within the rectangle was measured as a quantum level (Q). Then, the same size rectangle was positioned in a nearby epithelial region that is not expressing the gene of interest to measure background level (B). The intensity of in situ hybridization signal in each cochlear section was calculated by subtracting the background level (B) from the quantum level (Q) and designated as QB. Cochlear sections that were obliquely sectioned due to the coil structure, such as the curvature of the spiral, were excluded from the analysis. For each gene, the lowest QB value among all sections with positive signals from a cochlea was set as ‘the threshold QB’, and the relative signal intensity of each section was calculated as

Platinum coated specimens were mounted on a stub holder and imaged using a cold field emission scanning electron microscope (JSM-7001F; JEOL). SEM images of HCs were taken from the lateral side so that the tallest stereocilia of each HC could be easily visible for analysis. For measurements of stereociliary lengths along the cochlear duct, SEM images obtained from entire cochlear regions were combined using Adobe Photoshop software, and the cochlear regions were divided into five regions 10–18%, 28–36%, 46–54%, 64–72%, and 82–90% from the basal end to represent base, mid-base, mid, mid-apex, and apex of the cochlea, respectively. We excluded 0–10% (basal end) and 90–100% (apical end) regions from measurement because of irregular stereociliary morphology often found in these regions. The lengths of the three tallest stereocilia were measured from at least 30 HCs in each region from three wild-type and three <italic>Cilk1</italic> cKO mice using ImageJ software (NIH). Averages of the three tallest stereocilia in each HC were plotted as a box plot using Prism 8.0 software (GraphPad, USA).

Sub-dermal needles (electrodes) were positioned at the vertex and ventrolateral to the right and left ear of the anesthetized mice. Calibrated click stimulus (10-µs duration) or tone burst stimuli (5 ms duration) at 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 18, 24, 30, and 42 kHz were produced using the SigGenRZ software package and an RZ6 digital signal processor and delivered to the ear canal through a multi-field 1 (MF1) magnetic speaker (TDT). The stimulus intensity was increased from 10 to 95 dB SPL in 5 dB SPL increments. The ABR signals were fed into a low-impedance Medusa Biological Amplifier System (RA4LI, TDT), which then was used to deliver the signal to the RZ6 digital signal processing hardware. The recorded signals were filtered using a 0.5–1 kHz band-pass filter, and the ABR waveforms in response to 512 tone bursts were averaged. The ABR thresholds for each frequency were determined using the BioSigRZ software package. Wave I amplitudes were determined at two specific frequencies (8 and 18 kHz) by calculating P1-N1 peak amplitudes (in μV) as input/output (I/O) functions with stimulus levels increased from 50 to 90 dB SPL in 10 dB SPL increments.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Distortion product otoacoustic emission</title><p>DPOAEs were measured using a combined TDT microphone-speaker system.

This work potentially explains the etiology of hearing defects associated with a subset of ciliopathies, and elucidates the role of Sonic hedgehog ciliary signaling in inner ear development.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Dysregulation of sonic hedgehog signaling causes hearing loss in ciliopathy mouse models&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Kathryn Cheah as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As the editors have judged that your manuscript is of interest, but as described below that additional experiments are required before it is published, we would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The reviewers appreciated the extensive amount of data, the interesting experimental system, and the importance of the biological question, but were concerned that the study was skewed towards a preconceived conclusion. They found that this study is biased in its presentation, in some cases ignoring or diminishing data that does not agree with the preconceived conclusion that the primary effects of a loss of cilia are all mediated through SHH signaling rather than, for example, defects in apicobasal polarity, planar cell polarity or some other consequence of ciliogenesis. The reviewers agreed that more data to support the role of SHH signaling dysregulation in the hearing loss phenotype and/or a rewriting of the paper to provide a more measured interpretation of the results is required before the manuscript can be considered for publication.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>A number of conclusions are based on non-quantitative analyses. Several conclusions lack statistical support of any kind. For example, the paper would be improved by quantification of the data in Figure 3 (perhaps similar to the analysis used in Figure 6).</p><p>This paper does not show a direct link between low tone sensitivity loss and the SHH phenotype. Rather, the authors present a second Cre line, crossed with the least severely affected line (<italic>Ick</italic>), and show mild alterations to the cilia, without providing evidence that SHH is also disrupted in this ciliopathy model. Therefore, the functional conclusion is based on faith that the phenotype follows from the signaling alterations shown in the more severe models. Further, it is not clear what the consequences of <italic>Foxg1-Cre Ick</italic> cKO is: it is unclear if the tonal loss is due to abnormal development or due to the cilia phenotype. Further, it is unclear if SHH is meaningfully altered at all in those mutants, or if the cochleas are morphologically abnormal (e.g. truncated apex). A formal quantification of SHH in the <italic>Foxg1-Cre</italic> cKO mice is critical for the conclusion that SHH disruptions in this model are what cause low tone sensitivity loss.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.56551.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Summary:</p><p>The reviewers appreciated the extensive amount of data, the interesting experimental system, and the importance of the biological question, but were concerned that the study was skewed towards a preconceived conclusion.

This critical comment has spurred us to rethink all the results from a different perspective, conduct additional essential experiments, and rewrite parts of the manuscript.

In the revised manuscript, every effort has been made to include quantitative measurements and statistical analyses whenever results can be quantified, such as numbers, lengths, and hearing thresholds.

We used this inner ear-specific <italic>Cilk1(Ick)</italic> conditional mutants to examine the effect of defective cilia on auditory function, because all three ciliary mutants used for developmental studies (<italic>Ift88</italic> cKO, <italic>Tbc1d32<sup>bromi</sup></italic>, <italic>Cilk1(Ick)</italic> KO) were embryonic lethal.
