horizontally transmit viral pathogens together with saliva to plant phloem, but the mechanism remains elusive. Here, we report that an important rice reovirus has hijacked small vesicles, referred to as exosomes, to traverse the apical plasmalemma into saliva-stored cavities in the salivary glands of leafhopper vectors. Thus, virions were horizontally transmitted with exosomes into rice phloem to establish the initial plant infection during vector feeding. The purified exosomes secreted from cultured leafhopper cells were enriched with virions. Silencing the exosomal secretion-related small GTPase Rab27a or treatment with the exosomal biogenesis inhibitor GW4869 strongly prevented viral exosomal release in vivo and in vitro. Furthermore, the specific interaction of the 15-nm-long domain of the viral outer capsid protein with Rab5 induced the packaging of virions in exosomes, ultimately activating the Rab27a-dependent exosomal release pathway. We thus anticipate that exosome-mediated viral horizontal transmission is the conserved strategy hijacked by vector-borne viruses.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>exosome</kwd><kwd>multivesicular bodies</kwd><kwd>insect vectors</kwd><kwd>salivary glands</kwd><kwd>viral transmission</kwd><kwd>plant phloem</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Virus</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31772124</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Qian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31920103014</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wei</surname><given-names>Taiyun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31972239</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Qian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>An important rice reovirus hijacks exosomes to traverse the apical plasmalemma into saliva-stored cavities in the salivary glands of insect vectors, facilitating viral horizontal transmission into rice phloem.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Many devastating plant, animal, and human viral pathogens are horizontally transmitted by arthropod insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Eigenbrode et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Mayer et al., 2017</xref>). For example, rice stripe virus transmitted by planthoppers is a serious agricultural threat in rice-growing countries throughout Asia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">He et al., 2017</xref>), and Zika virus (ZIKV) transmitted by mosquitoes has been a recent public health threat in the Americas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Liu et al., 2017</xref>). In general, arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) establish their initial infection in the insect midgut, which is disseminated to the hemolymph and ultimately spread into the salivary glands, from which virions are introduced into susceptible hosts together with saliva (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hogenhout et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wei and Li, 2016</xref>). Insect salivary gland cells are filled with abundant apical plasmalemma-lined cavities, where saliva is stored (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Mao et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wei and Li, 2016</xref>). Arboviruses have to pass through the apical plasmalemma into insect salivary cavities, thereby moving with salivary flow to establish the initial infection in hosts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Mayer et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wei and Li, 2016</xref>). The secretory cells in the central region of salivary glands of the whitefly have been demonstrated to determine the transmissibility of begomoviruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wei et al., 2014</xref>). However, how arboviruses overcome cavity plasmalemma barriers for successful viral transmission is still poorly understood.</p><p>Frequently, arboviruses are sequestered into multivesicular bodies (MVBs) in the salivary glands of insect vectors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ammar and Nault, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gray et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gray and Gildow, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Janzen et al., 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Mao et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Shikata and Maramorosch, 1965</xref>). MVBs are spherical endosomal organelles containing small vesicles formed by the inward budding of the limiting membrane into the endosomal lumen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chahar et al., 2015</xref>). MVBs fuse with the plasma membrane to release the internal vesicles into the extracellular space in an exocytic manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chahar et al., 2015</xref>). These released vesicles are known as exosomes, which can transport various cellular regulatory RNAs from cell to cell, thereby receiving extensive research attentions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chahar et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Geisler and Coller, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Janas et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kim et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, exosome biogenesis starts with the maturation from the early endosomes into late endosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chahar et al., 2015</xref>). Several proteins are implicated in exosome biogenesis, including Rab GTPases and the tetraspanin CD63 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kalluri and LeBleu, 2020</xref>). Endosomal Rab GTPases, such as Rab27a, Rab5, and Rab11, can regulate exosome biogenesis, trafficking, and/or release from cultured animal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akers et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alenquer and Amorim, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zeigerer et al., 2015</xref>). Notably, early endosomal Rab5 is also detected within the MVBs and exosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Logozzi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pisitkun et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Vidal and Stahl, 1993</xref>). For example, the purified exosomes from hepatitis C virus-infected and uninfected hepatoma cells contain Rab5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ramakrishnaiah et al., 2013</xref>). In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, a model plant system, purified exosomes from leaf apoplasts also contain the Rab5 GTPase homologue ARA7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rutter and Innes, 2018</xref>). Indeed, the depletion of Rab5 strongly inhibits exosomal formation and secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ostrowski et al., 2010</xref>). Furthermore, Rab27a functions in the docking of MVBs in the plasma membrane, thereby regulating exosome secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ostrowski et al., 2010</xref>). For example, Herpes simplex virus-1 glycoprotein can interact with Rab27a to mediate the exosomal release pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Temme et al., 2010</xref>). Several arboviruses, such as dengue virus (DENV) and ZIKV, hijack exosomes to release virions, as observed in cultured mosquito cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">MartÃ­nez-Rojas et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Reyes-Ruiz et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Vora et al., 2018</xref>). Moreover, the secreted exosomes from arbovirus-infected mosquito cells can transmit viruses to cultured mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">MartÃ­nez-Rojas et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Reyes-Ruiz et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Vora et al., 2018</xref>). However, whether exosome-mediated viral spread occurs in infected host tissues or organs in vivo remains unknown. The final bottleneck in viral infection via insect vectors, thatÂ is, the cavity plasmalemma of salivary glands, is a principal determinant of the ability of an insect species to transmit a virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hogenhout et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wei and Li, 2016</xref>). Accordingly, we can reasonably regard the cavity plasmalemma of insect salivary glands as the plasma membrane of cultured infected cells. Thus, how arboviruses exploit exosomes to overcome the cavity plasmalemma barriers of vector salivary glands is a unique system for us to more easily address the role of viral release via the exosomal pathway in vivo.</p><p>Numerous plant viral pathogens of agricultural importance are persistently transmitted by piercing-sucking insect vectors, such as leafhoppers, planthoppers, and whiteï¬ies, to plant phloem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hogenhout et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wei and Li, 2016</xref>). Rice dwarf virus (RDV), the ï¬rst recorded plant arbovirus transmitted by leafhopper vectors in 1895, causes a severe rice disease in Asia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wei and Li, 2016</xref>). We have previously demonstrated that the plant reovirus RDV can be secreted by cultured leafhopper cells via infectious exosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wei et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wei et al., 2009</xref>). Here, we report that RDV hijacks the exosomal release pathway to traverse the apical plasmalemma into saliva-stored salivary cavities, ultimately moving with exosomes into the phloem of rice plants to establish initial viral infection via leafhopper vectors.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>RDV traverses the apical plasmalemma into leafhopper salivary cavities via the exosomal release pathway</title><p>The salivary glands of the leafhopper <italic>Nephotettix cincticeps</italic> consist of a pair of principal and accessory salivary glands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). The principal salivary gland (PSG) contains six types of cells (IâVI) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A</xref>), which are filled with apical plasmalemma-lined cavities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). Immunofluorescence microscopy showed that RDV disseminated into the salivary cavities by traversing the apical plasmalemma in all types of PSG cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>). We further used electron microscopy to visualize how RDV disseminated into the salivary cavities. In the cytoplasm of virus-infected type III cells, double-layered RDV particles (approximately 65 nm in diameter) were often engulfed into small vesicles within the MVBs at the periphery of salivary cavities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>). The attachment of MVBs to the cavity plasmalemma drove the enation of the apical plasmalemma to form a membrane extrusion toward the cavity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D and E</xref>). This extrusion was followed by the fusion of the apical plasmalemma of cavities with the plasma membrane of MVBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1FâH</xref>). Finally, virus-containing small vesicles (exosomes) were released into the salivary cavities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I and J</xref>). RDV-specific antibody specifically recognized viral particles within the MVBs or exosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2AâC</xref>). Virus-free exosomes measured 53â135 nm in diameter, but the packaging of viral particles enlarged exosomes to 110â302 nm in diameter in the salivary cavities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K</xref>). Together, our observations suggest that RDV exploits an exosomal release pathway to mediate viral entry into the salivary cavities via passage through the apical plasmalemma.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Transmission electron micrographs showing that RDV traverses the apical plasmalemma into the salivary cavities via the exosomal release pathway.</title><p>At 14 days padp, virus-infected salivary glands of <italic>N. cincticeps</italic> were examined by transmission electron microscopy.

Through horizontal transmission, infectious virions are ejected into hosts by insect stylets and then robustly establish the initial infection in hosts. Exosome-mediated spread of virions and various cellular or viral regulatory RNAs from cell to cell has gained considerable interest among researchers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chahar et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Geisler and Coller, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Janas et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kim et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mori et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tanggis et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nguyen et al., 2003</xref>); however, these studies have been limited to in vitro systems of cultured animal cells. Here, we show that the specific interaction of the 15-nm-long domain of RDV P2 on viral surface with Rab5 on the cytoplasmic face of endosomes induces the packaging of intact virions into endosomal MVBs in salivary glands. Such MVBs attach to the apical plasmalemma and induce an exocytosis process promoting the release of virus-containing exosomes into salivary cavities. The average diameters of the salivary canal of leafhoppers in Cicadellidae range from 3 Î¼m to 500 nm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brozek and Herczek, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Leopold et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zhao et al., 2010</xref>), greatly exceeding the maximum diameter of virus-containing exosomes. Therefore, such virus-containing exosomes can move easily through the salivary canal. Finally, the virus can be horizontally transmitted with exosomes into rice phloem to establish the initial infection. Inhibition of exosome secretion by silencing Rab5 or Rab27a can prevent such viral exosomal release into salivary cavities, ultimately suppressing viral transmission by insect vectors. More importantly, viral infection upregulates the expression of Rab5 or Rab27a, thereby activating the formation of exosomes for delivery of viral particles to the salivary cavities. Accordingly, the packaging of virions enlarges the normal sizes of exosomes secreted by infected salivary glands cells. Thus, the virus has evolved strategies to activate and exploit the exosomal release pathway into the salivary cavity, facilitating viral transmission by leafhopper vectors to rice phloem together with saliva (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>).</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Proposed model of RDV hijacking the exosomal release pathway to be released from salivary glands of leafhopper vectors into rice phloem.</title><p>In the proposed model, the specific interaction of RDV P2N and Rab5 causes the internalization and delivery of viruses to endosomes. Then, these virus-containing endosomes are engulfed in the MVBs in the cytoplasm. The attachment of MVBs with the apical plasmalemma drives the enation of the apical plasmalemma toward the cavity. The fusion of MVBs with apical plasmalemma leads to the release of virus-containing exosomes to the cavities. This exosomal release pathway is mediated by Rab27a. Exosomes are secreted with the salivary flow from the salivary cavities into the stylets and are then injected into the plant phloem as leafhoppers feed on rice plants. The virus released into the phloem establishes the initial replication within plant cells.

Thus, RDV P2 has evolved to interact with distinct receptors in insect bodies to enable the virus to overcome various tissue or organ barriers. RDV enters insect vector cells through receptor-mediated, clathrin-dependent endocytosis and is sequestered in endosomal compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wei et al., 2007</xref>). Furthermore, RDV P2 can induce membrane fusion in insect vector cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zhou et al., 2007</xref>). We also show that the 15-nm-long domain of RDV P2 has the inherent ability to recognize endosomal compartments even in the absence of viral infection. Thus, RDV P2âRab5 interaction leads to the recruitment of Rab5 on the surface of virions within the exosomes. These observations are fully consistent with the role of RDV P2 in the viral package within MVBs via interaction with Rab5 and subsequent fusion of MVBs with the cell membrane for exosome secretion. Indeed, exosomes isolated from mammalian or plant cells have also been reported to contain the early endosome marker Rab5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Logozzi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ramakrishnaiah et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Song et al., 2019</xref>). Purified exosomes secreted from infected leafhopper cells were larger and contained virions. The inhibition of exosomal secretion by silencing Rab27a or treatment with GW4869 suppresses such virus-mediated exosomal release, confirming the functional relevance of infectious exosomes with RDV dissemination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wei et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wei et al., 2009</xref>). Thus, the use of the continuous insect cell culture system provides more conclusive proof that RDV can be released from insect vector cells via a Rab27a-dependent exosomal release pathway. Similarly, numerous arboviruses, such as DENV and ZIKV, are packaged in MVBs and secreted from cultured mosquito vector cells via the exosomal release pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">MartÃ­nez-Rojas et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Reyes-Ruiz et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Vora et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, the exosomes play a conserved role in arbovirus dissemination.</p><p>Generally, in the secretory cells of insect salivary glands, arboviruses are frequently packaged in MVBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ammar and Nault, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gray et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gray and Gildow, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Janzen et al., 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Mao et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Shikata and Maramorosch, 1965</xref>). We thus anticipate that arboviruses may have evolved a conserved strategy to exploit the exosomal release pathway to ensure viral horizontal transmission from insect vectors into plant or mammalian hosts. In particular, exosome-mediated viral release from the apical plasmalemma into cavities does not cause substantial damage to salivary glands, conferring an evolved advantage for RDV to be persistently transmitted into plant phloem. Furthermore, exosomes potentially operate as an immune evasion strategy to ensure the initial infection of viruses in plant phloem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chahar et al., 2015</xref>). Identification of the molecular modes or determinants of the transmission of arboviruses from vectors to hosts is a basic but very fundamental research objective. For the first time, we show the role of virus-induced exosomes in viral horizontal transmission from the salivary glands of an insect vector to a plant host in vivo.</p><p>Information concerning plant-cellâderived extracellular vesicles is rather limited.

It is well known that various cellular or viral regulatory RNAs or proteins can be packaged into exosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chahar et al., 2015</xref>), and thus, exosome-mediated viral horizontal transmission may modulate phloemâinsectâvirus interactions, an exciting frontier of plant science.

Data from three independent biological experiments were analyzed using Histogram software and displayed as a plot of fluorescence intensity of GFP (<italic>x</italic>-axis) against cell number (<italic>y</italic>-axis).</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Frozen sections of rice plants</title><p>Then, approximately 15 viruliferous or nonviruliferous leafhoppers were reared in small cages to inoculate the two rice seedlings for 2 days, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7âfigure supplement 1</xref>). The feeding areas of the tested plants were embedded with O.C.T. Compound (Sakura, Torrance, CA, USA) and then sectioned with a Shandon Cryotome FSE (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The sections were ultimately immunolabeled with virus-FITC and Rab5-, CD63-, or Rab27a-rhodamine, and processed for immunofluorescence microscopy, as shown above. Rice without leafhopper feeding was treated exactly as the same.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>All quantitative data presented in the text and figures were analyzed with two-tailed <italic>t</italic>-tests in GraphPad Prism 7 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We are grateful to Dr. Toshihiro Omura (National Agricultural Research Center, Tsukuba, Japan) for providing the antibodies against intact viral particles and P8.

This report demonstrates that rice dwarf virus is packaged into exosomes in its insect vector and that these exosomes are subsequently delivered to the plant phloem. These results have important implications for understanding virus transmission and movement with the plant. We think you have addressed the concerns raised previously and commend you on submitting a revised version that is significantly improved.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Exosomes mediate horizontal transmission of viral pathogens from insect vectors to plant phloem&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Detlef Weigel as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Verify exosome identify:</p><p>Some concerns were raised regarding the identity/origin of exosomes. These points are especially important to address as your main conclusion is that the virus is shuttled from the insect to the plant via insect-derived exosomes.</p><p>2) Antibody specificity:</p><p>Some concerns were raised regarding the specificity of antibodies used in immunofluorescence and western blot experiments. It is not clear that these antibodies have been properly vetted for use in this heterologous system. It is important to have controls without antibodies in some immunofluorescence assays to rule out any plant autofluorescence, as well as in western blots to rule out any cross-reaction with plant proteins.</p><p>3) Justify use of Rab markers for exosomes:</p><p>Some concerns were raised around the use of Rab GTPases as optimal markers for exosomes. The authors need to justify their use. Our suggestion is to conduct a few comparative assays alongside better-established exosomal markers (such as tetraspanins; orthologs of mammalian DC63).</p><p>4) Specificity of knock-downs in miRNA experiments:</p><p>Due to sequence similarity among Rab proteins, concerns were raised regarding the specificity of the miRNA-mediated knock down assays.

The manuscript presents an evidence of how vector-borne viruses use their relationships with their arthropod vectors to be well-transmitted to subsequent plant hosts and initiate infection. The use of exosome is a unique strategy by which membrane-associated structure are secreted into plant sieve elements for further infection and their formation is regulated by the expression of associated genes with the exosomal pathway. The authors used both electron and fluorescent microscopy as well as molecular biology tools to track the mode of transmission of RDV and the involved pathways. Some points require clarification and potentially additional experiments to fully support the conclusions.</p><p>1. In figure 1 the authors indicate the involvement of exosomes for shuttling RDV virions, however they did not use immunogold labeling as they did in figure 2 to track the virions. To support those images I would also perform immunogold labeling as in the size range of RDV and ribosomes and maybe other organelle structures are close and the images can be misleading without using specific antibody labeling and subsequent gold detection.</p><p>2. In figure 2 the authors indeed performed immunogold labeling, however, the amount of presented results in this regards are insufficient, and this kind of experiments needs to be quantified in order to make sure the labeling observed is not random as many times the gold particles attach non specifically. Although the subsequent results with regards to Rab27a, Rab5 and P8 show that those exosome-related genes are indeed induced upon virus infection and the silencing of two of them reduced their levels and colocalization with the virus.</p><p>3. I think better labeling of figure 4 panels, especially figure 4D and G is needed, to show the released virions which need to be marked.</p><p>4. Figure 7 shows that RDV is secreted into plant sieve elements with exosomes derived in the salivary glands of its leafhopper vector. The authors mainly used immunofluorescence and western blot. Control immunofluorescence images without antibodies or other controls are not provided. It is known that plant tissues strongly auto fluoresce at some wavelengths and thus it necessary to show controls for all these images.</p><p>5. The hypothesis is that exosome containing RDV virions are secreted into phloem. Since the authors can measure the diameter of such exosomes, I wonder if they can show measurements of exosomes and then compare this to the diameter of the salivary canal in the insect stylet. I assume the diameter of the salivary canal is way thinner than the exosome, and i wonder how such exosomes can move through the salivary canal if they are bigger. More information needs to be provided as this is the only route such exosomes would leave the insect and enter the plant.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The authors present in this manuscript compelling data that the Rice Dwarf Virus (RDV) might be transmitted from the grasshopper vector into the phloem of rice host plant via insect exosomes. The authors support this hypothesis with their findings of i) co-localization of the vector MVB marker proteins Rab27a/Rab5 and virion particles and ii) physical interaction of the N-terminal viral capsid protein P2 (P2N) with vector Rab5. Moreover, transient knockdown of vector Rab27a/Rab5 via dsRNA treatment inhibits viral packaging into MVBs and rice transmission.</p><p>In general, the text is well written and experiments are well designed and explained. However, in order to state that exosomes are the means of virus transmission into rice phloem (see title) examination of exosomes with additional biomarkers and nanoparticle track analysis is necessary. Further, regarding the provided experimental data, some experiments would benefit from additional controls to ensure specificity of the experimental outcome and their interpretation.</p><p>Comments for the authors:</p><p>Rab27a and Rab5 dsRNA knockdown experiments. Please, provide control experiments of the specificity of targeted knockdown. Since Rab GTPases contain highly conserved domains, co-suppression might have occurred. For example, this could be tested by dsRNA Rab27a and Rab5 cross-check.</p><p>It was unclear whether Rab GTPases are optimal exosome biomarkers, and a suggestion is to include tetraspanins (orthologs of the mammalian CD63) as most commonly used exosome biomarkers.</p><p>It was unclear whether the specificity of the used antibodies has been vetted. Both anti-Rab antibodies are raised against <italic>Drosophila</italic> proteins and are polyclonal.</p><p>Quantification of difference in protein levels (Western blot) requires at least three biological replicates (Figure 2G, 3B, 4F, 5G, 7b).</p><p>In Figure 2A, the authors state that &quot;Rab27a antibodies specifically labelled virus-containing exosomes&quot;, but Rab27a signals appear also in non-viral loaded exosomes in Figure 2A-II.</p><p>The authors state in lines 137/138&quot;â¦ KD Rab27a significantly reduced the accumulation of virus and Rab27a positive puncta in salivary glands&quot;. Such statement requires quantitative analysis and proper statistics in order to claim such significance.</p><p>Knockdown of Rab27a as well as chemical inhibition of endosome formation leads to reduced viral P8 expression (virus quantity) and cellular foci in fluorescence microscopy images. However, these data do not present exosomal release of virus, as interpreted by the authors.</p><p>The cell culture system was used to isolate exosomes and IGL via Rab27a antibody by electron microscopy. The authors claim that exosomes with viral particles are enlarged compared to non-virus containing exosomes. Here, size measurement and relative quantities by nanoparticle track analysis should be performed to support this statement. Additional biomarkers such as tetraspanins would support the identity of exosomes. Again, like in Figure 2, Rab27a labeled exosomes free of virus, thus Rab27a is not specific to virus-containing exosomes.</p><p>The authors state that &quot;treatments of dsRNA Rab27a significantly abolished the formation of exosomes&quot;, similar to GW54869. Such statement must be verified by exosome quantification using nanoparticle track analysis.</p><p>No explanation was provided why Rab5 localization via antibody or Rab5-cMyc expression look so different, see Figure 6A versus B.</p><p>In Figure 6C, it seems that pictures for mock and DMSO have a longer exposure time than GW4869 and chloroquine. In order to claim any GFP signal intensity difference, quantitative analysis on biological replicates must be provided.</p><p>In Figure 7A, there seems to be cross-reaction of the Rab5 antibody with rice protein(s) leading to background signals in non-feeding samples. This makes it difficult to compare Rab5 translocation during feeding.</p><p>Figure 7D: Label WB with viruliferous or non- viruliferous instead of 1 and 2.</p><p>Here, I would suggest a complementary experiment, in which extracted exosomes, e.g. from infected grasshopper cell culture, to be injected in the rice phloem, to reproduce effects of viral spread, as observed in infected rice. Would such exosome injection lead to disease symptoms in rice?</p><p>Figure S1: Please clarify what Roman numbering indicates.</p><p>Figure S4B: What was the way to normalize fluorescence intensity (considering background noise)?</p><p>Figure S5E: axis labels of graphs are not readable.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The manuscript under review addresses a timely and interesting question regarding how viruses are transmitted by insects and suggests that a plant virus, RDV, upon replicating in the cells of the insect vector, is secreted in exosomes and delivered to the insect saliva, and subsequently to the plant phloem. Although many studies have shown the involvement of exosomes and related machinery in animal viruses, very little is known about this phenomenon with plant viruses. The authors present very high-quality data in support of their conclusions. Indeed, the microscopy images are very well presented and convincing. At the same time, the authors present important data that suggest a very plausible mechanism for how the virus is packaged into multi-vesicular endosomes (MVEs) before being secreted. They show that the viral coat protein (CP) interacts with Rab5, a well-established identity marker for early endosomes. This mechanistic work is validated using several lines of evidence using protein-protein interaction methods and cell biology. Furthermore, they show that the CP and RDV particles associate with Rab27a, a marker for several secretion pathways, including exosomes. In addition, the association with the Rabs is shown to be biologically relevant as knock downs affect virus transmission. As such, there is a convincing story here regarding the packaging of RDV into exosomes in the insect vector.</p><p>There is only one major issue, regarding the putative detection of insect-derived exosomes in the plant that should either be addressed or be toned down (see point 9 below). Although the authors make a case for the insect proteins Rab5 and Rab27a being important for vectoring the virus, there are controls missing regarding the specificity of detection of these proteins in the plant. This point needs to be addressed.</p><p>The flow of the manuscript and presentation of data in the figures is good and relatively easy to follow. However, the writing needs to be significantly improved before publication in terms of form and grammar. The manuscript would also be improved by more discussion of how this data fits with the current state of knowledge on exosomes in plants. For example, Rab5 is associated with early endosomes. As such, is it logical, or consistent with the literature, to detect Rab5 in exosomes? This report will be of interest to a broad range of researchers and it is important to introduce and discuss the dynamics of the endomembrane system to this broad audience.</p><p>Comments for the authors:</p><p>1. Figure 3b. The RNAi-mediated knock-down of Rab27b does not result in a dramatic reduction of the Rab27b protein (1 vs. 1.41). Is this result representative? That is, the qRT-PCR results suggest that the efficacy of knock down varies widely between individual insects.</p><p>2. At several points, the authors indicate that virus-containing exosomes as being larger than normal exosomes, but is there some quantification for this?</p><p>3. Figure legends: generally, the figure legends are not acceptable for a scientific publication. Legends need to contain all the information required to understand what was done in the experiments, without interpretation of the results. For example, multiple figure legends talk about immunostaining with virus-rhodamine red and Rab27a-FITC. Presumably, the virus was detected with anti virus antibodies labelled with rhodamine, not with actual virus. Likewise, in Figure 5C it is simply indicated &quot;GST pulldown&quot; or &quot;proteins incubated with cell lysate&quot;. While one can figure out what is meant, this is not the way to formally write a figure legend. These are just two small examples and all legends should be revisited.</p><p>4. Figure 4e. KD of Rab27a is again not that remarkable by western.

Figure 6B: P2N shows colocalization with Rab5 and, in a separate set of experiments, with Rab27a. Thus, P2N colocalizes with both proteins, but are all three colocalized. In vertebrate systems invagination of exosomes is thought to be concomitant to replacement of Rab5 with Rab7, presumably prior to recruitment of Rab27a, which is associated with later stages related to secretion. Given what is known about these Rab GTPases, is there precedent for them to be present on the same vesicles.</p><p>Do you have direct data showing colocalization of Rab5 and Rab27a?</p><p>8. Please discuss more what is known about exosomes in plants and if possible their known associations with different Rabs.</p><p>9. Figure 7D. Western blots show Rab5 and Rab27a accumulation in plants exposed to leafhoppers, with a moderate difference in accumulation of both when exposed to viruliferous insects. These blots should include samples from plants not exposed to leafhoppers to demonstrate a lack of cross-reaction to any plant protein. This is particularly important given that there is a non-negligible background in the immunofluorescence microscopy of non-feeding plants. The antibodies used in this study were raised against <italic>Drosophila</italic> proteins and quick BLAST of <italic>Drosophila</italic> Rab5, and to a lesser extent Rab27a, against rice shows significant blocks of exact or near exact homology.</p><p>It is thus important to determine if the signals seen are Rab GTPases from the insect or from the plant. It is not implausible that feeding from viruliferous and non-viruliferous could induce the expression of Rab GTPases. Indeed, given the amount Rab proteins putatively transferred from insect to plant, these proteins would presumably be diluted throughout the entire plant. Is it plausible that the insect would secrete enough of these proteins to detectable in all parts of the phloem?</p><p>10. Supplementary figure 4 (and related to figure 6): data is shown on the quantification of fluorescence as a measure of P2N. It is indicated that there is less in the presence of the two inhibitors. However, if there is no longer a concentration of P2N in specific vesicles, then one would expect the diffuse protein to be much less detectable. As such, and quantification based on fluorescence is probably not accurate and should rather be assayed by western blot.</p><p>11. Movahed et al., have reported Turnip Mosaic Virus Components Are Released into the Extracellular Space by Vesicles in Infected Leaves. These vesicles also appeared to contain several Rab proteins, albeit not the as those investigated here (and these are plant derived exosomes).

Although many studies have shown the involvement of exosomes and related machinery in animal viruses, very little is known about this phenomenon with plant viruses. The authors present very high-quality data in support of their conclusions. Indeed, the microscopy images are very well presented and convincing. At the same time, the authors present important data that suggest a very plausible mechanism for how the virus is packaged into multi-vesicular endosomes (MVEs) before being secreted. They show that the viral coat protein (CP) interacts with Rab5, a well-established identity marker for early endosomes. This mechanistic work is validated using several lines of evidence using protein-protein interaction methods and cell biology. Furthermore, they show that the CP and RDV particles associate with Rab27a, a marker for several secretion pathways, including exosomes. In addition, the association with the Rabs is shown to be biologically relevant as knock downs affect virus transmission. As such, there is a convincing story here regarding the packaging of RDV into exosomes in the insect vector.</p><p>There is only one major issue, regarding the putative detection of insect-derived exosomes in the plant that should either be addressed or be toned down (see point 9 below). Although the authors make a case for the insect proteins Rab5 and Rab27a being important for vectoring the virus, there are controls missing regarding the specificity of detection of these proteins in the plant. This point needs to be addressed.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added the necessary plant or antibody controls to prove the specificity for antibodies against Rab5, Rab27a and CD63 to react with exosome components secreted from insect vectors, but not with rice components. Related results were shown in Figure 7.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The flow of the manuscript and presentation of data in the figures is good and relatively easy to follow. However, the writing needs to be significantly improved before publication in terms of form and grammar. The manuscript would also be improved by more discussion of how this data fits with the current state of knowledge on exosomes in plants. For example, Rab5 is associated with early endosomes. As such, is it logical, or consistent with the literature, to detect Rab5 in exosomes? This report will be of interest to a broad range of researchers and it is important to introduce and discuss the dynamics of the endomembrane system to this broad audience.</p></disp-quote><p>In the Introduction and Discussion, we have added the sentences to induce and discuss the dynamics of the exosomes biogenesis, including plant system. The published literatures indicated that Rab5 was also detected in the exosomes or extracellular vesicles isolated from mammalian or plant cells, especially in virus-infected systems. Furthermore, our data of RDV P2-Rab5 interaction would lead to the recruitment of Rab5 on the surface of virions within the exosomes. These observations (Figure 5) are fully consistent with the role of RDV P2 in viral package within MVB via interaction with Rab5. Thus, our finding is logical and consistent with the published literatures.

Presumably, the virus was detected with anti virus antibodies labelled with rhodamine, not with actual virus. Likewise, in Figure 5C it is simply indicated &quot;GST pulldown&quot; or &quot;proteins incubated with cell lysate&quot;.

RDV particles, confirmed by immunoelectron microscopy, were easily distinguished by their spherical appearance and diameter (65 nm), and they were not found in uninfected controls.

Figure 6B: P2N shows colocalization with Rab5 and, in a separate set of experiments, with Rab27a. Thus, P2N colocalizes with both proteins, but are all three colocalized. In vertebrate systems invagination of exosomes is thought to be concomitant to replacement of Rab5 with Rab7, presumably prior to recruitment of Rab27a, which is associated with later stages related to secretion. Given what is known about these Rab GTPases, is there precedent for them to be present on the same vesicles. Do you have direct data showing colocalization of Rab5 and Rab27a?</p></disp-quote><p>We have added Figure 5âfigure supplement 2E to show that some puncta labeled by Rab27a-FITC could colocalize with the puncta labeled by Rab5-rhodamine in the salivary glands from nonviruliferous <italic>N. cincticeps</italic>.</p><p>Furthermore, our data of RDV P2-Rab5 interaction would lead to the recruitment of Rab5 on the surface of virions within the exosomes. These observations (Figure 5) are fully consistent with the role of RDV P2 in viral package within MVB via interaction with Rab5. In the Introduction and Discussion, we have added the sentences to discuss the dynamics of the exosomes biogenesis, including plant system. The published literatures indicated that Rab5 was also detected in the exosomes or extracellular vesicles isolated from mammalian or plant cells, especially in virus-infected systems. Thus, our finding is logical and consistent with the published literatures.

Figure 7D. Western blots show Rab5 and Rab27a accumulation in plants exposed to leafhoppers, with a moderate difference in accumulation of both when exposed to viruliferous insects. These blots should include samples from plants not exposed to leafhoppers to demonstrate a lack of crossreaction to any plant protein. This is particularly important given that there is a non-negligible background in the immunofluorescence microscopy of non-feeding plants. The antibodies used in this study were raised against Drosophila proteins and quick BLAST of Drosophila Rab5, and to a lesser extent Rab27a, against rice shows significant blocks of exact or near exact homology.</p></disp-quote><p>We reconducted this biological experiment for 3 replicates. Western blot assay proved the obvious difference of Rab5, CD63 or Rab27a accumulation between viruliferous and non-viruliferous feeding samples. Furthermore, the utilization of Rab5, CD63 or Rab27a antibody did not cause the cross-reaction with plant proteins. Related results were shown in Figure 7D.</p><p>The amino acid sequences of Rab27a and Rab5 of <italic>N. cincticeps</italic> had no significant similarity according to Blast N, although they showed the conserved domain of Rab GTPases. The relative expression of Rab27a and Rab5 genes of <italic>N. cincticeps</italic> in the salivary glands treated with dsRab27a or Rab5 were tested. The absence of co-suppression with the treatments of dsRab27a or dsRab5 was concluded. The related results were shown in Figure 5âfigure supplement 2D.</p><p>Furthermore, there were 57% and 79% amino acid sequence similarities between <italic>Drosophila</italic> and <italic>N. cincticeps</italic> Rab27a and between <italic>Drosophila</italic> and <italic>N. cincticeps</italic> Rab5, respectively. Although both Rab antibodies were prepared against the antigen derived from <italic>Drosophila</italic>, these antibodies showed the specificity of <italic>N. cincticeps</italic> samples in western blot with correct molecular weights, and in the immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy with the localization of MVBs and exosomes. These results confirmed that both Rab antibodies in this study were useful for recognizing exosomes in <italic>N. cincticeps</italic>. The related contents were shown on lines 241-246, 389-391, and on Figures 2-5 and Figure 5âfigure supplement 3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It is thus important to determine if the signals seen are Rab GTPases from the insect or from the plant. It is not implausible that feeding from viruliferous and non-viruliferous could induce the expression of Rab GTPases. Indeed, given the amount Rab proteins putatively transferred from insect to plant, these proteins would presumably be diluted throughout the entire plant. Is it plausible that the insect would secrete enough of these proteins to detectable in all parts of the phloem?</p></disp-quote><p>We have added the plant controls which were not fed on by leafhoppers. The immunofluorescence result showed the weak background signals of Rab27a and Rab5 in the non-feeding control, and showed strong and specific fluorescence signals in leafhopper-feeding samples. It was suggested that the signals were from insect but not plant. Furthermore, western blot assay confirmed that Rab27a and Rab5 antibodies did not react with the plant samples. These results were shown in Figure 7A and 7D.</p><p>Theoretically, Rab proteins would be diluted throughout the entire plant. However, as shown in Figure 7âfigure supplement 1, in our study, approximate 15 viruliferous or nonviruliferous leafhoppers were reared in small cages to inoculate rice seedlings for 2 days. We even fed 80 viruliferous or nonviruliferous leafhoppers on 2 rice seedlings to enrich the proteins for western blot assay. Such methods are useful for accumulation of enough amount Rab proteins putatively transferred from insect to plant phloem. The related results were shown in Figure 7.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10. Supplementary figure 4 (and related to figure 6): data is shown on the quantification of fluorescence as a measure of P2N. It is indicated that there is less in the presence of the two inhibitors. However, if there is no longer a concentration of P2N in specific vesicles, then one would expect the diffuse protein to be much less detectable. As such, and quantification based on fluorescence is probably not accurate and should rather be assayed by western blot.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added western blot to show the difference of P2N expression level among the treatments in Figure 6âfigure supplement 1C.
