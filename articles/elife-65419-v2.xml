impact many facets of human biology. Here we review and discuss the impact of sex on human circadian and sleep physiology, and we uncover a data gap in the field investigating the non-visual effects of light in humans. A virtual workshop on the biomedical implications of sex differences in sleep and circadian physiology led to the following imperatives for future research: i) design research to be inclusive and accessible; ii) implement recruitment strategies that lead to a sex-balanced sample; iii) use data visualization to grasp the effect of sex; iv) implement statistical analyses that include sex as a factor and/or perform group analyses by sex, where possible; v) make participant-level data open and available to facilitate future meta-analytic efforts.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>circadian physiology</kwd><kwd>sleep</kwd><kwd>chronobiology</kwd><kwd>sex differences</kwd><kwd>science forum</kwd><kwd>equality diversity inclusion</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>204686/Z/16/A</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Spitschan</surname><given-names>Manuel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FI 2275/3-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fischer</surname><given-names>Dorothee</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Research on human sleep and circadian physiology exhibits a bias towards male subjects, creating a sex data gap which holds potential real-world impact and requires concerted effort to close.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Template</meta-name><meta-value>5</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Despite marked sex differences in many aspects of human physiology and behaviour, biomedical research continues to be disproportionately biased towards the male sex. For example, women made up only 25% of participants in landmark trials for congestive heart failure and 19.2% of participants for studies in antiretroviral treatment of HIV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Criado-Perez, 2019</xref>). Such a skewed evidence base leads to disparities in clinical and non-clinal research applications and it weakens the impact of science-based policies and translational outcomes.</p><p>This sex bias or ’sex data gap' – whereby data mainly come from male individuals – has recently received widespread attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Criado-Perez, 2019</xref>), with policy advisers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Buitendijk and Maes, 2015</xref>), funders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lee, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Clayton and Collins, 2014</xref>) and publishers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rippon et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Docherty et al., 2019</xref>) pushing for better inclusivity in research regarding sex. Embracing these new practices should improve translational outcomes and scientific efficiency, but this will require a two-pronged tactic that both strengthens forces for change and weakens barriers in the field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Karp and Reavey, 2019</xref>). The problems that allow sex bias to emerge are multifaceted and closing the data gap will require solutions to be bespoke for each research community.</p><p>Here, we explore the sex data gap in the context of human circadian physiology and sleep research. The field focuses on the temporal organization of physiology and behaviour at a daily scale, including rest-activity cycles, diurnal changes in hormone levels and cognitive performance, as well as the non-visual effects of light. First, we describe primary findings on sex differences in circadian physiology and sleep. Next, we discuss the sex data gap in circadian and sleep research based on an analysis of over 150 papers on the non-visual effects of light, and finally we outline recommendations emerging from a virtual workshop on the biomedical implications of sex differences in sleep and circadian physiology (held in June 2020).</p><p>While we distinguish between gender identity (how individuals and groups perceive themselves e.g. men, women, non-binary) and sex (the biological attributes that distinguish organisms as female, male or intersex), we note that these terms are often used interchangeably and wrongly in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Tannenbaum et al., 2019</xref>). Yet, in biology, sex describes differences in sexual characteristics that go beyond reproductive functions. Furthermore, we acknowledge that there is very little to no research about intersex individuals within circadian physiology and sleep research, constituting an important gap. Addressing this gap may contribute to better granularity and understanding of sex-differentiated biological mechanisms and responses. When reporting on results from the literature, we use the terms used by the researchers in these studies, as we are unable to know whether participants were asked about their sex or their gender.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Sex differences in sleep and circadian physiology</title><p>Human circadian and sleep physiology features well-established sex differences: for instance, circadian timing is phase-advanced (earlier) in female compared to male individuals, as seen in the core body temperature minimum and evening rise in melatonin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boivin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cain et al., 2010</xref>). Female individuals also have a shorter circadian period of the temperature and melatonin rhythms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Duffy et al., 2011</xref>), and larger amplitude of the melatonin rhythm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cain et al., 2010</xref>). Furthermore, sex differences exist in chronotype, the circadian continuum of early (‘larks’) to late (‘owls’) diurnal preference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chontong et al., 2016</xref>), such that more male individuals are late types than females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fischer et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Roenneberg et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fischer et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Phillips et al., 2017</xref>). With regard to sleep, female individuals have an earlier timing of sleep, longer sleep duration and more slow-wave sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Roenneberg et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dijk et al., 1989</xref>).</p><p>More recently, sleep regularity – the day-to-day consistency in sleep timing and duration – has emerged as an important factor in health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bei et al., 2016</xref>). Irregular sleep is associated with cardiovascular disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Yoon et al., 2014</xref>), inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Okun et al., 2011</xref>), metabolic disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Patel et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chontong et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Spruyt et al., 2011</xref>), mental health conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lemola et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Vanderlind et al., 2014</xref>), and cognitive impairment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">McBean and Montgomery-Downs, 2013</xref>). The data on sex differences are mixed with reports ranging from no sex differences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kaufmann et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Xu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Minors et al., 1998</xref>) to more irregular sleep in female (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mezick et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dillon et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lunsford-Avery et al., 2018</xref>) or in male individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Roane et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Yetish et al., 2018</xref>). Chronotype may account for these inconsistencies as ‘owls’ tend to be more irregular sleepers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Duffy et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fischer et al., 2017</xref>). Indeed, in revisiting three published datasets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fischer et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fischer et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Keller et al., 2017</xref>), more male individuals were found to be irregular sleepers than females when both were a later chronotype.</p><p>Finally, while data remain sparse, the adverse health effects of sleep irregularity itself may also differ between the sexes. To the best of our knowledge, only one study examined this question (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Roane et al., 2015</xref>), finding that variability in sleep duration was significantly associated with weight gain in male but not female students. Overall, despite the far-reaching health implications, sex differences in sleep and circadian physiology remain underresearched.</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>Impact of sex differences in sleep and circadian physiology in a non-clinical setting</title><p>Perhaps the most observable effect of sex differences in sleep and circadian physiology in a non-clinical setting is in shift work, a ubiquitous facet of modern society. Shift workers (approximately 50% of which are women) account for about a third of the workforce in North America and Europe, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kervezee et al., 2018</xref>). Women have higher injury rates during night work than men, despite the injury rates between men and women being similar in day workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Safe Work Australia, 2009</xref>). The physiological mechanisms underlying this difference remains unclear, partly due to a lack of research on the female circadian system. An exception is a recent study on sex differences in the effects of acute sleep deprivation on alertness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Smolensky et al., 2017</xref>). This work showed that women in the follicular phase of their menstrual cycle had more sleep loss-related alertness failure than men, whereas there were no differences between women in the luteal phase and men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Vidafar et al., 2018</xref>).

Across the 24 hour cycle, the molecular circadian clock rhythmically controls drug bioactivation, detoxification and transport while the circadian timing system as a whole regulates drug absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dallmann et al., 2016</xref>). In experimental models, this results in strong circadian changes in the tolerability and efficacy of over 50 anticancer medications, indicating that timing is a critical factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dallmann et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lévi et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>For instance, a study examining colorectal cancer – the third cause of cancer deaths worldwide – showed that the intravenous delivery of the drug 5-FU leucovorin (5-FU-LV) at a constant rate resulted in circadian changes in drug concentration in plasma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Petit et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Fustin et al., 2012</xref>). Most importantly, female patients had reduced 24 hour mean and circadian amplitude of the 5-FU body clearance compared to their male counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bressolle et al., 1999</xref>). Furthermore, peak delivery at 1pm or 4pm for oxaliplatin (another anticancer drug) and at 1am or 4am for 5-FU-LV proved to be least toxic by up to six-fold in male patients, whilst optimal timing was located six hours later in female patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lévi et al., 2007</xref>). Thus, optimal drug timing and optimal drug doses can differ according to sex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Spitschan et al., 2020</xref>).

In this specific analysis, we focused on the reported sex of participants, although in many instances the terms sex and gender were used interchangeably. Each paper was then reviewed by a single reviewer to determine if participant sex and numbers were reported, and where possible, the proportion of female participants was calculated. Of the papers assessed, 14 (7.77%) did not give sufficient information on the sex breakdown of participants for this to be determined. In the remaining 166 articles, females comprised an average of 33.9% of the sample. Seven papers reported studying exclusively female participants, while 56 papers reported studying only males. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> shows the proportion of female study participants as a function of the publication year, calculated from the per-sex participant sample sizes.

This approach is necessary to generate ‘doable problems’, allowing researchers to better understand the mechanisms that underlie a biologically intricate world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gompers, 2018</xref>). In animal research, this simplification has led to studying one sex and strain in one batch, an approach supported by an interpretation of the ‘Reduce’ element of the 3R ethical framework. Historically, this has been conceived as a requirement for minimizing the number of animals in a single experiment, thus encouraging researchers to generate a narrow testing space before extrapolating and generalizing the results. Male animals were consistently selected due to the belief that the sex hormone cycle in females would lead to greater variability in the data, which would then require a larger number of female animals to achieve the same statistical power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Karp and Reavey, 2019</xref>). A recent meta-analysis looking at 9,932 traits found that the variability seen in female mice was not greater than for male mice – and in some cases was less – yet the legacy remains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Prendergast et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>A related misconception is that studying both males and females requires the sample size to be doubled. Indeed, the analysis is not conducted independently for each sex; rather a regression analysis is used to explore the variation in the outcome variable of interest after accounting for effect of sex. Another benefit is that this approach also includes a statistical test for whether the treatment effect depends on sex. As regression analysis does not pool the data, the variance introduced by sex is accounted for, and the sensitivity for a treatment effect is minimally impacted by the inclusion of two sexes. The statistical test for the main treatment effect reveals the average treatment effect across the two sexes, and the interaction term shows how the treatment effect differs for the two sexes. The power for the main effect will be impacted when the treatment effect goes in the opposite direction for the sexes (crossed effect) but then the power to detect an interaction will increase. Biologically, crossed effects are rare, as shown in a large study assessing the prevalence of sexual dimorphism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Karp et al., 2017</xref>). In these situations, the treatment effect must be estimated for each sex individually. This potential situation may appear concerning to some, but it simply provides more evidence for the need to study both sexes to avoid misunderstanding biology.</p><p>Notably, the ongoing misconceptions about including female individuals in research have become part of the implicit scientific practice, and they are passed on to future generations of researchers. To curtail this, we point to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://orwh.od.nih.gov/sex-gender/nih-policy-sex-biological-variable">guidelines</ext-link> which stipulate that male and female sexes should be included. Furthermore, rather than automatically powering to test for an interaction, we suggest that the average treatment effect represents both sexes, and a sex-disaggregated analysis would reveal possible large differences.</p><p>Sometimes, researchers propose studying one sex at the time, but it is important to collect data on both male and female individuals simultaneously to test how the treatment interacts with sex. If data is collected independently for the two sexes, it becomes impossible to determine whether differences in estimate emerge due to sample variation or because the effect depends on sex.</p><p>A common pushback is that other sources of variation, such as age, should be considered: why should sex be the variable that is prioritized? Conducting an experiment means simplifying a complex biological world that features many sources of variation into a testing space, before generalizing the findings to reach broader conclusions. In biomedical research, the target population will be, on average, 50% male and 50% female, and it is becoming clear that variations between male and female physiology extend beyond hormonal differences. Therefore, as a rule, sex should be the first variable to be included to significantly increase generalizability – except, as discussed in the NIH guidelines, for cases such as the study of sex-specific conditions or phenomena.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Understanding the research landscape and identifying opportunities for change</title><p>In a three-part virtual workshop held in June 2020, the authors of this paper explored practices, barriers, and challenges in designing and executing inclusive research in circadian physiology and sleep research. <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/WU2QX">All materials from the workshop</ext-link>, including the recordings and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://osf.io/9cy87/">the programme</ext-link>, are available under the CC-BY license (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Fischer and Vidafar, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Karp and Ahluwalia, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">White and Lévi, 2020</xref>).</p><p>The workshop series comprised three 90-minute sessions held a week apart and included invited talks as well as interactive sessions.

The central tenet includes sex and gender analysis as an essential component of research design. The specific recommendations are:</p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Design research to be inclusive and accessible. In many cases, research is designed exclusively by researchers who may not necessarily have sufficient expertise on how to make their study inclusive and accessible. An important step is reaching clarity in recording and reporting participant sex and gender. As an example, one research team reporting the sex of participants may use participant-derived responses on a questionnaire or intake form, and another group may use the sex assigned at birth, based, for instance, on an ID card. While these could give congruent answers, they represent different types of information. Wider engagement with definitions of sex and gender and questions surrounding this topic within a research group or researcher community could lay the groundwork for making research more inclusive and accessible. As a formalised way to ensure inclusivity, we also suggest that research participants be integrated in the research planning process through Patient and Public Involvement (see <xref ref-type="box" rid="box2">Box 2</xref>) or similar mechanisms.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Implement recruitment strategies that lead to a sex-balanced sample. This includes wide advertisement of research studies, and tailoring recruitment strategies by engaging with patients, participants and the general public, for example through Patient and Public Involvement mechanisms (see <xref ref-type="box" rid="box2">Box 2</xref>). Given fixed resources, recruiting a sex-balanced sample does not simply mean doubling the sampling size, but merely recruiting a sample with 50% female and 50% male participants. A balanced design is recommended to ensure the resulting statistical analysis is robust and that the variance can be decomposed to the factors of interest without confounding these (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Collins et al., 2009</xref>). While exceptions to this principle may arise from sex-specific research questions, as a general guiding principle there is little to argue against. Furthermore, this will allow sex to be included as a factor in the analysis without compromising sensitivity to a generalizable main effect.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Use data visualization to grasp the effect of sex. An informal visualization in the early stages of analyses can be used to ascertain sex difference trends, which can then be followed up with more rigorous statistical testing.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Implement statistical analyses that include sex as a factor and/or perform group analyses by sex, where possible. Sex can be included as a factor or a covariate in analyses, or an alternative strategy can be to perform a group analysis by sex. Both require a good understanding of effect sizes and statistical power. Researchers should seek to upskill in statistics to develop advanced analytic strategies.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Make participant-level data open and available to facilitate future meta-analytic efforts. This step requires data to be available, which many journals now mandate. The large, combined sample size afforded by the wide availability of data can enable a sex-related effect to be more readily detectable. We also suggest that researchers should include tables reporting the primary data and participant meta-data as supplementary information in articles. A recent analysis of open science practices in circadian rhythms and sleep research journals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Spitschan et al., 2020</xref>) has indicated an opportunity to mandate data sharing in journal policies. Journal policies requiring participant-level data sharing could facilitate future analyses incorporating sex.</p></list-item></list><boxed-text id="box2"><label>Box 2.</label><caption><title>Patient and Public Involvement as a vehicle to make research more inclusive.</title></caption><p>Patient and Public Involvement (PPI) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arthritis Research UK, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bagley et al., 2016</xref>) is defined as research carried out ‘with’ or ‘by’ patients, those who have experience of a condition, and the broader public in general. PPI is a term that is largely used in the UK research landscape, but similar initiatives may exist in different countries. PPI differs markedly from engagement and participation; this refers to various types of interactions with people with a condition (such as providing information and knowledge in research) as well as surveying what people understand about a particular condition regardless of whether they experience it, or exploring what should be prioritized in basic or clinical research on that condition. Involvement, on the other hand, implies a more active collaboration between researchers, and the target group – and in some cases the general public – that helps shape the design of a research project. At different levels, all these interactions provide opportunities for dialogue and bring research to those directly impacted by conditions and the public. This, in turn, helps increase diversity – including, but not limited to, making research more inclusive with respect to sex and gender.</p><p>Engaging with the general public and with patients is now often asked by charities and research funding organizations but should be considered beyond being a box-ticking exercise. PPI will very likely impact the design of research projects by identifying what is vital to patients and society, and why. In turn, this will help to identify gaps in our understanding of the disease or condition in question thereby increasing research quality. This can help prioritize research areas and lead to research that is better aligned with patient and public interests. For example, the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.jla.nihr.ac.uk/">James Lind Alliance Priority Setting Partnerships</ext-link> is a non-profit initiative bringing patients, carers and clinicians together to identify and prioritise unresolved questions or evidence uncertainties they consider important. In this way, research funders become aware of what matters most to the people who use their research in their everyday lives. PPI will also help the target group to better understand research, and give an often unique opportunity for researchers – especially discovery scientists – to understand patients’ reality and perspective.</p></boxed-text><p>While none of these actions will suffice on their own, each will contribute to closing the sex data gap.

Overall, a total of 545 papers were identified and analyzed, as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>.</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Articles included in the meta-analysis.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Database</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Search strategy</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source paper</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Articles considered</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Articles included</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">–</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">–</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brown, 2020</xref></td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">19</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">18</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">–</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">–</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lok et al., 2018</xref></td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">20</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">20</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">–</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">–</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Souman et al., 2018</xref></td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">49</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">45</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">SCOPUS</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Citation count</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">-</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">359</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">94</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="6" valign="bottom">Cochrane</td><td align="left" rowspan="6" valign="bottom">(light AND circadian OR sleep OR alertness)”</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pachito et al., 2018</xref></td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">5</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">0</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Forbes et al., 2014</xref></td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">13</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">0</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Montgomery and Dennis, 2002</xref></td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">0</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">0</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Tuunainen et al., 2004</xref></td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">49</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">3</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Slanger et al., 2016</xref></td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">21</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">0</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dennis and Dowswell, 2013</xref></td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">10</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">0</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom"> </td><td align="left" valign="bottom"> </td><td align="left" valign="bottom"> </td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">545</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">180</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s6-1"><title>Inclusion and exclusion criteria</title><p>Papers were excluded where the following exclusion criteria applied, leaving a total of 180 papers for the present analysis:</p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Studies that do not assess the acute effect of light: including those looking at longitudinal exposures or habits rather than controlled light exposure within a specified time frame, e.g. cohort and case-control studies were excluded;</p></list-item><list-item><p>Studies in which the primary outcome measure did not relate to circadian physiology (e.g. the role of light exposure in treating affective disorders);</p></list-item><list-item><p>Studies assessing the effects of interventions other than light exposure, e.g. sleep deprivation or magnetic field exposure.

and sleep research&quot; to <italic>eLife</italic> for consideration as a Feature Article. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Peter Rodgers as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers and editors have discussed the reviews and we have drafted this decision letter to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Please also note that <italic>eLife</italic> does not permit figures in supplementary materials: instead we allow primary figures to have figure supplements (tables, however, can be supplementary materials).</p><p>After revision, please note that the <italic>eLife</italic> Features Editor may also contact you separately about some editorial issues that you will need to address.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This article highlights the sex-bias present in chronobiology and sleep medicine research, and it provides recommendations and guidance for sex- and gender-inclusive research practices and policies. To do so, it relies on insight from a workshop conducted to evaluate sex differences in circadian and sleep research. Overall, the authors have provided robust examples from a growing body of evidence which suggests that biological sex influences the human circadian clock and that these sex differences may play a key role in health and disease. However, a number of points need to be addressed to make the article suitable for publication.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. Please shorten the introduction, and reorganize the first two sections &quot;Sex differences are ubiquitous in circadian rhythms and sleep&quot; and &quot;Sex differences in circadian rhythms can impact therapeutic interventions&quot; into one cohesive introduction section which lays the ground for the literature analysis and the workshop discussion. In doing so, please make sure to streamline the text to ensure the reader feels it was written cohesively rather than by different people.</p><p>2. Lines 61-198 have a large overlap of topic matter with lines 200-266: please try to reduce this repetition. (For instance, the sub-section &quot;What is the sex data gap?&quot; repeats the conclusions from the previous section).</p><p>3. Line 73: Please discuss this point further, as &quot;blockers&quot; are not the only people who may resist change – they are probably a tiny minority of people. Far more people resisting change are probably people who don't know enough about how or why.</p><p>4. Line 217 onward: Please discuss why there appears to have been a thorough review of studies involving light impact on human circadian rhythms, but not of other types of studies that are only mentioned briefly (e.g., circadian period or phase)</p><p>5. Line 227 onwards: Please clarify whether there was a relationship between the proportion of female participants and the sample size of the study</p><p>6. Line 268 onwards: Please provide further information about the workshop participants and how they contributed to the outcomes of the paper.</p><p>– For instance, please clarify the methods used to obtain participant reflections/responses (i.e. Did you provide participants with a certain set of questions or surveys to obtain the information described in Workshops 1 and 2? Alternatively, did this information come from discussions which were transcribed and coded?)</p><p>– Please indicate whether the participants of the workshop gave consent for their responses/comments to be used in this format? If not, please discuss whether there is a need for a retrospective-IRB approval.</p><p>– Please report how many individuals attended each workshop</p><p>– For each workshop section, please give all answers, not a selection of them. You can group into categories or ones with similar wording. The number of each question is not needed since there was limited time to respond and participants may not have been able to include all possibilities (so the number of each response does not necessarily reflect the importance of said response).</p><p>7. Line 282: Please further discuss the statement that a common misconception in research is that the sample size must be doubled to include both sexes. The authors note that this is a flawed assumption because treatment effects are reported from the entire group. While this is certainly true, the authors should also acknowledge that the issue may be more complex than described, especially because sex differences exist. In the first half of this manuscript, the authors describe important differences that have been identified between sexes on a variety of outcomes (shiftwork tolerance, sleep differences, phase differences, etc.). Doesn't this suggest that pooling of males and females a bad idea, particularly for time-varying differences? For example, on lines 188-192, the authors describe the results of several important studies examining oxaliplatin and irinotecan in male and female patients. The authors note that the optimal timing for females and males were at different times for these treatments. If these reports would have pooled the data for males and females wouldn't that have attenuated the results or obscured the researchers' ability to observe a time-of-day effect at all? In this case, it seems pretty important that the analyses were stratified by sex. If a researcher wishes to examine outcomes by sex, as seems pretty important given the thesis of this manuscript, then one should be powered to conduct separate analyses (Diester CM, Banks ML, Neigh GN, Negus SS. Experimental design and analysis for consideration of sex as a biological variable. Neuropsychopharmacology. 2019;44(13):2159-2162. doi:10.1038/s41386-019-0458-9).</p><p>8. Line 343 onwards (Recommendations #2):</p><p>– Please discuss further whether 1:1 female:male is the only valid ratio. Would other ratios be ok in some circumstances? When is this ratio more important than other variables (e.g. age)?</p><p>– Please acknowledge that recruiting a sample that consists of 50% females and 50% males may increase variability (in some circumstances) compared to studies with 100% of one sex, and therefore change power calculations and/or require larger sample size.</p><p>9. Recommendations: Please consider discussing whether one option for closing the gap would be to fund/conduct studies that only include females.</p><p>10.

Across the three workshops, between 38 and 94 attendees participated in the interactive sessions, with approximately 4/5 of all participants being researchers (82/94 in Workshop 1, 47/60 in Workshop 2, 31/38 in Workshop 3).

Firstly, the variables baseline levels can depend on sex. Secondly, the treatment effect can depend on sex. When studying both sexes, a regression analysis will account for the sex differences in baseline levels and this has minimal impact on power. Regression analysis is not pooling the data which is completely inappropriate and can deliver misleading results. Recommending half the animals are male and half are female for a treatment group, is based on the premise that you want to estimate an average effect and then you can see a large interaction if it occurs. If we are interested in these differences, we then need the power to study the interaction which is a different goal.</p><p>In typical time course studies, where the time effect is also of interest, a regression analysis would ask at each time point what is the effect of sex, what is the effect of the treatment and does the effect depend on sex.</p><p>The section on page 8 has been reworded to give greater clarity and to highlight that pooling is not recommended.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. Line 343 onwards (Recommendations #2):</p><p>– Please discuss further whether 1:1 female:male is the only valid ratio.</p></disp-quote><p>Statistically it is good practice to have balanced designs [ref: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2796056/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2796056/</ext-link>]. ‘In a balanced design the main effects and interactions are orthogonal so that each one is estimated and tested as if it were the only one under consideration, with very little loss of efficiency due to the presence of other factors’. Basically, having a balanced design makes analysis more robust and ensures that factors are independent and the variance can be decomposed in to the individual contributions without confounding. Consequently, this is our recommendation as the default basic design. The following sentence has been added to page 11 “A balanced design is recommended to ensure the resulting statistical analysis is robust and that the variance can be decomposed to the factors of interest without confounding.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Would other ratios be ok in some circumstances? When is this ratio more important than other variables (e.g. age?)</p></disp-quote><p>We have added a paragraph to page 9:</p><p>“A common push back is that there are other sources of variation (e.g. age) that should be considered and ask why should sex be the variable that is prioritized. Whenever we conduct an experiment we are simplifying a complex biological world with lots of sources of variation into a testing space and we generalize the findings allowing us to make conclusions. When considering biomedical research, on average the target population will be 50% male and 50% female and we are now understanding that the differences between male and female are significant and stretch beyond hormonal differences. Therefore, as a general rule, including both sexes should be the first variable to be included to significant increase generalizability. However, there may be exceptions, such as the study of sex specific conditions or phenomena, as written into the NIH guidelines.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Please acknowledge that recruiting a sample that consists of 50% females and 50% males may increase variability (in some circumstances) compared to studies with 100% of one sex, and therefore change power calculations and/or require larger sample size.</p></disp-quote><p>The data is not pooled and hence the sex differences are accounted for. With a regression analysis, when the treatment effect is the same or in the same direction then there is no loss in power to estimating the average effect. We gain then that the conclusions space is larger. When the treatment effect is crossed, then we do lose power on estimating the average effect but we gain in ability to test for an interaction. However, in this situation if you had studied one sex you would have missed a major differences in the understanding of the outcome. We have reworded the section on page 8 to improve the clarity of this discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9. Recommendations: Please consider discussing whether one option for closing the gap would be to fund/conduct studies that only include females.</p></disp-quote><p>We do not think that the sex data gap can be closed if data are collected in a sex-selective fashion. If generalizable data are to be collected, then biasing the sample in the opposite direction is not helpful. If the suggestion is to fund data collection including only females post-hoc, then it is not clear what justifies data collection of the first sample with only males. The only way to resolve this is to collect data on males and females from the get-go.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10.
