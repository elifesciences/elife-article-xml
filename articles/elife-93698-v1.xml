One of the essential readouts is the intracellular bacterial burden carried by the infected host cells. The most commonly used method for enumerating such bacterial load is counting the colony forming unit (CFU) number by agar plate culturing following the lysis of host cells and release of bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Staley and Konopka, 1985</xref>). However, the reliability of such measurements has long been recognised to be impacted by various factors, including, but not limited to, host cell/tissue type, bacterial strain, bacterial load, and culturing conditions for CFU enumeration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chang et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Davis et al., 2005</xref>). Osteomyelitis (OM), an infectious disease with pathogen-mediated infection of bone tissues, features a considerable proportion of infected but culture-negative cases, ranging between 20% and 40% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bejon et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Yoon et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Kim et al., 2015</xref>). This clear deficiency in CFU evaluation creates difficulties for the accurate diagnosis and therefore treatment of OM.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><p><italic>Staphylococci</italic>, including coagulase-negative species, such as <italic>S. epidermidis</italic> and <italic>S. aureus</italic>, comprise the major pathogens in adult OM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Kavanagh et al., 2018</xref>). In this study, we employed a previously established osteocyte-like cell model, differentiated SaOS2 (SaOS2-OY) and the single most common causative pathogen in OM, <italic>S. aureus</italic>, to simulate the in vitro infection of osteocytes, the most abundant cell type in bone tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Prideaux et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Gunn et al., 2021</xref>). Two previously characterised <italic>S. aureus</italic> strains, a high virulence (methicillin-resistant <italic>S. aureus</italic>; MRSA) strain, WCH-SK2 (SK2), shown previously to establish an intracellular infection in human osteocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Yang et al., 2018</xref>) and a low virulence (methicillin-sensitive <italic>S. aureus</italic>; MSSA) strain, WCH-SK3 (SK3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bui and Kidd, 2015</xref>), were chosen for experimentation. In addition to CFU enumeration to quantify bacterial number, a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) approach measuring genomic DNA copies represented by a single-copy gene within the <italic>S. aureus</italic> genome, was also performed in parallel. In the past, real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) assays have been widely used for the quantification of bacteria. However, the working principle of standard qPCR is dependent on the establishment of a standard curve using a known number of bacterial gene copies and the fitting of test samples into a linear regression to estimate the bacterial number for each assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Kralik and Ricchi, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Smith and Osborn, 2009</xref>). Here, we utilised digital droplet PCR (ddPCR) for this measurement. By its nature, the latter technique offers the advantage of counting the absolute target sequence copy number within the sample and removes the need for normalisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Hindson et al., 2013</xref>). For all PCR-based assays, the quality of DNA containing the target sequence for amplification and quantification is critical for the sensitivity and reproducibility of readout. Therefore, methods for DNA preparation from both human and bacterial cells were examined. Here, we introduced the usage of DirectPCR Lysis Reagent (Direct buffer), a lysis buffer that maximises the release of genomic DNA from samples and is compatible with the downstream PCR analysis from cell culture lysate without any purification step. With the application of Direct buffer for DNA preparations in comparison to a commonly used DNA extraction spin column kit (DNA kit), the absolute bacterial genome copy number quantified by ddPCR was measured to be 5-fold higher in SaOS2-OY samples and 100-fold higher in samples from two strains of <italic>S. aureus</italic>, SK2 and SK3; better overall reproducibility among biological replicates was also achieved using Direct buffer over the standard approach (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–C</xref>). Serial 10-fold dilutions of bacterial log-phase suspension cultures were used to generate DNA lysates for testing the extent of DNA release. Plotting genome copy number against CFU from the same cultures showed near perfect linear regression relationships (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D, E</xref>), confirming the complete and highly reproducible release of bacterial DNA. With this validating readout, we sought to determine if the elimination of purification steps by using the Direct buffer might minimise the sample loss associated with the utilisation of conventional column-based extraction methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Schmitz et al., 2021</xref>). Furthermore, the release of genomic material by this reagent appeared to be complete and unbiased in our experiments, which led to higher consistency of inter- and intra-assays.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Validation of DNA preparations from SaOS2-OY cells and <italic>S. aureus</italic>.</title><p>Digital droplet PCR (ddPCR) genome counting of SaOS2-OY (<bold>A</bold>), SK2 (<bold>B</bold>), and SK3 (<bold>C</bold>), comparing the Direct buffer approach (<inline-graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="jpeg" xlink:href="elife-93698-inf001-v1.tif"/> ) and a standard DNA kit (<inline-graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="jpeg" xlink:href="elife-93698-inf002-v1.tif"/> ) (four biological replicates with mean and standard errors were shown on graphs, ***p &lt; 0.001 and ****p &lt; 0.0001); demonstration of complete bacterial chromatin release from SK2 (<bold>D</bold>) and SK3 (<bold>E</bold>): correlation with CFU plating.

Following infection, the SaOS2-OY and <italic>S. aureus</italic> co-cultures were lysed to break down host cell structures for the release of intracellular <italic>S. aureus</italic> for CFU development on agar plates. Consistent with previous findings, significant reductions ranging between 10<sup>3</sup>- and 10<sup>6</sup>-fold in cultured CFU on agar plates over the 5-day co-culture time period were observed in both SK2- and SK3-infected SaOS2-OY groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–F</xref>). This trend was also found with low multiplicities of infection (MOI) (~10<sup>7</sup> total CFU/well, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C, E</xref>) and high MOI (~10<sup>8</sup> total CFU/well, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D, F</xref>) for initial bacteria-inoculated groups with either strain. However, when total DNA preparations from the whole culture lysates were taken for ddPCR quantification of bacterial genome copy number, differences in the dynamic changes of bacterial load were found. In the high virulence strain SK2-infected group, the genome copy numbers by 5-day post-infection were maintained at the levels of 10<sup>7</sup> and 10<sup>8</sup> cells/well for the low and high MOI groups, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C, D</xref>), similar to the original input levels.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Measurement of intracellular <italic>S. aureus</italic> in SaOS2-OY cells in vitro.</title><p>Colony-forming unit (CFU) recovery of SK2 (<bold>A</bold>) and SK3 (<bold>B</bold>) from host SaOS2-OY cells, with haemolysis reactions (<inline-graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="jpeg" xlink:href="elife-93698-inf003-v1.tif"/> ) and numerous small colony variants (<inline-graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="jpeg" xlink:href="elife-93698-inf004-v1.tif"/> ) shown in SK2 group; quantification of SK2 and SK3 using CFU count (<inline-graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="jpeg" xlink:href="elife-93698-inf005-v1.tif"/>, left Y) and digital droplet PCR (ddPCR) count (<styled-content style="color: #0B0BFE;">⬤</styled-content>, right Y) from low (<bold>C, E</bold>) and high (<bold>D, F</bold>) multiplicities of infection (MOI) groups; relative human genome copy (%) with CTRL (⬤) vs. INF (<styled-content style="color: #ff0000;">◼</styled-content>) quantified by ddPCR from low (<bold>G</bold>) and high (<bold>H</bold>) MOI groups (four biological replicates with mean and standard errors are sḩown; **p &lt; 0.01, ***p &lt; 0.001, ****p &lt; 0.0001; ns = not significant).</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-93698-fig2-v1.tif"/></fig><p>However, the low virulence strain SK3-infected group demonstrated a decrease in genome copy counts. Interestingly, regardless of the initial input amount, by 5-days post-infection, the remaining SK3 genome counts dropped to approximately 10<sup>6</sup> cells/well for both groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E, F</xref>). The quantification of human genome copy number was also performed in all groups to estimate the remaining host cells in culture and this also served as an indicator of host cell viability. With the low MOI co-cultures, the human genome copy counts in the presence of either strain of <italic>S. aureus</italic> were not statistically different from uninfected controls, across 1- and 5-days post-infection. When the initial bacterial inoculum was increased 10-fold to 10<sup>8</sup> cells/well, reductions in the human genome copies of ~30% and 50% were measured in 1- and 5-day post-infection groups, respectively; such a trend was found to be similar in both SK2- and SK3-infected groups. Overall, our observations demonstrated profound differences in the readout of the presence of intracellular bacteria when using CFU and ddPCR quantification methods. Such inconsistency between these readouts in our model was as high as 10<sup>6</sup>-fold, with interaction of factors including initial bacterial load and strain variation. In contrast, comparison of the same quantification methods performed on bacterial suspension cultures yielded differences under twofold, indicated by the respective slope factor (less than 2) in the linear regression curves for both SK2 and SK3 strains (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D, E</xref>). Together, our results indicate the dramatic change in bacterial culturability when comparing growth in ideal microbial suspension culture conditions and the growth-limiting intracellular environment. Therefore, we propose that the interaction between the host cell response to infection and pathogen adaptation to the intracellular environment will compromise the reliability of the standard CFU counting method alone for the evaluation of bacterial persistence in a bacteria/host cell co-culture experiment. However, phenotypic variations were also observed in the recovered colonies from agar plating, with variations in haemolytic activity and small colony variant (SCV) formation, particularly in the SK2 group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). SCV variants of <italic>S. aureus</italic> feature reduced metabolic activity and growth but are an indication of adaptation and the establishment of a chronic infection. This is consistent with the findings of reductions in CFU recovery but maintained levels of detectable genome copies, at least in the SK2-infected group.</p><p>To examine the applicability of this workflow to a clinical setting, we next extended the tests to clinical human bone specimens. Three clinically culture-negative periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) cases were chosen for analysis. All three cases were confirmed infected by clinical observation for typical PJI symptoms by clinicians, using the current gold-standard Musculoskeletal Infection Society (MSIS) criteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Parvizi et al., 2018</xref>); while each patient presented with a sinus tract communicating with their prosthesis, a major diagnostic criterion, neither the culturing of the synovial membrane biopsies nor synovial fluid around the prosthesis returned any positive cultures from a clinical laboratory. The bone tissue sections from the three patients were examined by Masson’s trichrome staining in comparison to tissue section from an osteoarthritis (OA) patient as a non-infection control, to examine bone matrix degradation, according to our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ormsby et al., 2021</xref>). With this method, the red colour indicates intact bone matrix collagen and the blue colour corresponds to degraded collagen. Within all the histological observations, matrix degradation was found in sections of all three PJI patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B–D</xref>), whereas the staining of the control OA patient bone indicated intact collagen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), consistent with infection in the three PJI patient specimens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ormsby et al., 2021</xref>). In addition to the gold-standard diagnostic approach and histological staining, we performed CFU analysis using homogenised bone tissue, and negative culture results were also recorded. In this study, the samples containing total genomic DNA were prepared from histological sections in conjunction with the use of the DirectPCR Lysis reagent. The prepared DNA samples were subjected to PCR amplification using a primer set targeting a highly conserved bacterial genomic region, elongation factor Tu (<italic>tuf</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Li et al., 2012</xref>), for the enrichment of bacterial signal within host/pathogen genomic mixture. The generated amplicons were then sequenced using an Oxford Nanopore Technology (ONT) MinION sequencer for the identification of bacterial species. All three patient bone DNA samples were confirmed to be bacterial genome-positive, with combinations identified of the coagulase-negative staphylococcal species <italic>S. haemolyticus</italic>, <italic>S. hominis</italic>, and <italic>S. epidermidis</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E–G</xref>). The respective total bacterial load for each of the samples was then quantified by ddPCR. Each bone sample examined contained between 2 × 10<sup>4</sup> and 1 × 10<sup>6</sup> bacterial genomic copies per million human genomic copies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E–G</xref>). To confirm that the detected bacteria species were not introduced during the handling procedures, bone specimens from five primary total hip replacement (non-infected) patients were processed at the same time along with the PJI specimens; PCR reactions with negative <italic>tuf</italic> amplification for these bone samples indicated that operational contamination was unlikely (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Pathogen diagnosis in clinical PJI bone specimens.</title><p>Masson’s trichrome staining of bone tissue sections of an osteoarthritis (OA) subject (<bold>A</bold>) and culture-negative periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) subjects I–III (<bold>B–D</bold>).

The addition of ddPCR provided the advantage of achieving absolute quantification without the need for a PCR standard curve, which is both cost and time effective. For the purposes of unknown pathogen diagnosis in clinical cases, the exact bacterial species readout is required from sequencing the generated amplicons. Here, the utilisation of ONT dramatically lowered the equipment and skill demands for performing this analysis, since the MinION sequencer is a portable device and the sequencing results are analysed by the on-board software with little bioinformatics requirement. Noted here, the usual whole-genome sequencing approach might not be suitable for this application, as in many of the clinical specimens, the amount of human genome can be orders of magnitude higher than the level of bacterial genomic material. Sequencing and analysing the relatively rare bacterial DNA present in this scenario is considerably more lengthy and costly. Therefore, a PCR approach was chosen to amplify the bacterial signal for detection. In this study, the bacterial gene <italic>tuf</italic> was chosen as the target sequence to generate PCR amplicons instead of the commonly used <italic>16</italic>S rRNA gene sequence because of its greater discriminatory power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Hwang et al., 2011</xref>). Here, we took <italic>tuf</italic> sequences from <italic>S. aureus</italic> and the three coagulase-negative <italic>staphylococcal</italic> species identified in the clinical specimens for cross-comparisons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Within the designated amplified sequence of only 271 bp, 11–22 (or 4.1–8.1% differences) mismatches were identified between these four species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B</xref>). For achieving equivalent differences in <italic>16</italic>S sequences among the four strains, PCR amplicons with over 1000 bp in length are required (data not shown). Again, the strategy of analysing a short amplicon not only offers reduced reaction time, more importantly, it minimises the chance of generating non-specific products by shortening the elongation step. The listed primer set targeting the <italic>tuf</italic> gene was confirmed to cover most of the species in genus <italic>Staphylococcus in silico</italic>. In practice, it is challenging to find universal primers that cover the entire bacterial domain. Hence, for future real-world tests in clinical diagnosis, the strategy of using multiple primer sets to cover common PJI pathogens might need to be considered. Together, this workflow is potentially applicable as a point-of-care diagnostic method with the prospect of a rapid turnover: within hours compared to the current procedure in the magnitude of days.</p><p>To conclude, for the purpose of quantifying the intracellular bacterial load in a host–pathogen co-culture setting, we have developed a workflow with the advantages of: (1) being rapid and labour-saving, with the elimination all DNA extraction steps by virtue of using the direct lysis approach; (2) minimisation of potential sample loss encountered with conventional DNA isolation methods, enabling better accuracy and reproducibility; (3) absolute genome copy number quantification by ddPCR for achieving superior consistency of intra-assay experiments; absolute bacterial load readout is particularly useful to track infection status with longitudinal serial samples from PJI patients; (4) sequencing analysis using the ONT MinION platform has the potential to become a point-of-care diagnostic approach when performing unknown pathogen identification in a clinical setting. Nevertheless, we suggest that the CFU plating method should not be omitted as it allows the evaluation of bacterial phenotypic adaptation in such experimentation.</p></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>SaOS2 cell culture and differentiation</title><p>The human osteosarcoma cell line SaOS2 differentiated to an osteocyte-like stage was employed for performing bacteria/host co-cultures, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Gunn et al., 2021</xref>).

Bone biopsies were collected from patients undergoing either primary total hip replacement or revision total hip replacement surgery for PJI, with informed, written patient consent. Each bone specimen was separated into two parts. One of these was homogenised in a bead-beating tissue homogeniser (Bead Ruptor Elite, Omni International, Kennesaw, GA, USA), with two cycles of beating at 3 m/s for 30 s to disassociate the bone structure for the release of potentially viable bacteria. Bone homogenates were then sent to a clinical pathology laboratory (SA Pathology, Adelaide, Australia) for CFU analysis. Clinical soft tissue and fluid samples were sent to SA Pathology directly from surgery for pathogen analysis. The second piece of bone biopsy was processed and de-mineralised using OSTEOSOFT (Sigma-Aldrich) solution for standard paraffin embedding procedure. Post-embedding, the bone tissues were sectioned under DNase/RNase-free conditions. One 5 μm section from each bone specimen was used for Masson’s Trichrome staining, as described in our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ormsby et al., 2021</xref>), and six sections were pooled together in DirectPCR Lysis Reagent for the isolation of total genomic DNA, as described above.

Our method has the benefits (not limited to) of achieving absolute quantification of bacterial load in a shortened time period (in the order of hours) in clinical bone specimens from infected patients. Many of the identified bacterial species in patients were not able to be diagnosed by standard bacterial culturing. Moreover, one of the problematic features of treating bone infection is that repetitive surgeries are usually needed, particularly in PJI, hence, serial clinical bone specimens from the same patient are in fact often available. Therefore, our method of being able to quantify bacterial load offers the advantage of monitoring the infected status throughout the treatment journey. In this study, we chose the <italic>tuf</italic> gene as the targeting sequence to amplify the bacterial signal instead of the well-established <italic>16S</italic> PCR for the reason that <italic>tuf</italic> provides much better sequence discrimination between bacterial species. Therefore, the short PCR amplicon of just 271 bp used in our study, is able to give us a highly accurate taxonomic readout. By this approach, we again shorten the time required for diagnosis. In the last paragraph of the Discussion in the revised manuscript, extra text, a figure demonstrating the strong sequence diversity in <italic>tuf</italic> (Supplementary Figure 2) and an additional reference have been added to address the Reviewer’s concerns.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- I have further concerns regarding the interpretation of the combined bacterial and host cell-directed PCRs against the CFU results.

We have yet to find a method that can definitively identify bacterial viability in a clinical setting in the absence of culture. However, PJI and osteomyelitis in general is characterised by a high percentage of culture-negative infection cases, calling for such molecular approaches. Commercially available, so called “live/dead” bacterial PCR reagents exist that act as PCR signal inhibitors by penetrating the cell wall of compromised cells to prevent the PCR signal being generated from those cells. In our experience, while these can provide a certain level of added scrutiny in an experimental setting, they are not definitive because the reaction is often incomplete in an idealised situation and also the reagent may cancel signal from viable bacteria growing under conditions of stress, such as during antimicrobial treatment and host-derived stress imparted in intracellular or intra-tissue environments. Indeed, such stresses are likely contributors to clinical non-culturability. Whole genome sequencing would provide more certainty of bacterial viability to demonstrate genomic intactness but as we discuss herein, this a lengthy and costly process, and one which may prove difficult from host tissue with a low pathogen load. It should be noted that the significance of any diagnostic readout, including from culture, WGS or our method reported here would need to be interpreted by the treating clinical team. We would argue that a rapid, practical molecular diagnostic method in the absence or even presence of culture would provide treating clinicians with an improved rationale for tailoring antimicrobial treatments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Strengths</p><p>- On the positive side, the authors provide clear evidence for the value of the direct buffer extraction system they used as well as confirming the utility of ddPCR for quantification.
