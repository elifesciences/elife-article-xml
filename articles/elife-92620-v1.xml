However, it remains unclear how the brain encodes and uses rule information to guide behavior. Here, we made single-unit recordings while head-fixed mice performed a cross-modal sensory selection task where they switched between two rules: licking in response to tactile stimuli while rejecting visual stimuli, or vice versa. Along a cortical sensorimotor processing stream including the primary (S1) and secondary (S2) somatosensory areas, and the medial (MM) and anterolateral (ALM) motor areas, single-neuron activity distinguished between the two rules both prior to and in response to the tactile stimulus. We hypothesized that neural populations in these areas would show rule-dependent preparatory states, which would shape the subsequent sensory processing and behavior. This hypothesis was supported for the motor cortical areas (MM and ALM) by findings that (1) the current task rule could be decoded from pre-stimulus population activity; (2) neural subspaces containing the population activity differed between the two rules; and (3) optogenetic disruption of pre-stimulus states impaired task performance. Our findings indicate that flexible action selection in response to sensory input can occur via configuration of preparatory states in the motor cortex.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>sensorimotor</kwd><kwd>cross-modal</kwd><kwd>sensory selection</kwd><kwd>ALM</kwd><kwd>S1</kwd><kwd>S2</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01NS089652</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>O'Connor</surname><given-names>Daniel H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1R01NS104834-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>O'Connor</surname><given-names>Daniel H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001201</institution-id><institution>Kavli Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>S-2021-GR-045</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>O'Connor</surname><given-names>Daniel H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002701</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Education</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Government Scholarship to Study Abroad</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chang</surname><given-names>Yi-Ting</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Preparatory states within the motor cortex play a critical role in selecting an appropriate action in response to sensory input, dependent on the context.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Abstract relationships between objects, events, and actions can be established by rules. How we receive, process, and respond to sensory signals is guided by our understanding of rules that apply to the current context. For example, a student picks up a vibrating phone while waiting for a phone interview, but not during a lecture. This rule-guided flexibility is essential to adapt in a dynamic environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Miller and Cohen, 2001</xref>) and is at the core of many advanced cognitive functions such as economic decision-making and social interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Koechlin, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mansouri et al., 2020</xref>). Several lines of studies have shown that impairments in rule-based decision-making are linked to neurodevelopmental conditions including autism spectrum disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gastgeb et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Jones et al., 2013</xref>) and schizophrenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Weinberger and Berman, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Woodward et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Flexible rule-guided behaviors require at least two processes from the brain. First, (1) to maintain and update rule representations; and (2) to apply the appropriate rule to correctly transform sensory signals into motor outputs. Higher-order brain areas in frontal and parietal cortices are thought to play an important role in process 1, i.e., in encoding abstract rules and guiding the sensorimotor transformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Miller and Cohen, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bari et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hattori and Komiyama, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kamigaki et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Rodgers and DeWeese, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Sakai, 2008</xref>). It remains less clear how process #2 occurs, i.e., how rules are applied to sensorimotor pathways to govern the mapping between stimulus and response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">van den Brink et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p>Rodent orofacial circuits provide well-defined sensorimotor pathways to study rule implementation. Recent studies have uncovered important cortical areas linking whisker input to licking output in goal-directed behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Crochet et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Esmaeili et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Petersen, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Svoboda and Li, 2018</xref>). For example, findings in a delayed tactile detection task have shown that the whisker region of primary somatosensory cortex is required for sensory detection and the anterior lateral motor cortex (ALM) is critical for motor planning and execution of licking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Esmaeili et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Guo et al., 2014</xref>). Additionally, the medial motor cortex (MM), which contains the whisker primary and secondary motor cortices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mao et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Matyas et al., 2010</xref>), demonstrates early selectivity of whisker-based tactile signals compared with ALM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Activity in sensorimotor pathways can reflect both sensory input and the rules dictating the appropriate use of that input (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Rodgers and DeWeese, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">van den Brink et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Condylis et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Steinmetz et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>). Analysis of neural populations may provide insight into how these sensory and contextual signals are integrated to govern behavior. Recent progress in the study of neural population dynamics has uncovered population-level computations for motor control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Afshar et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Churchland et al., 2006a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Churchland et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Sauerbrei et al., 2020</xref>), timing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Buonomano and Maass, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Remington et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Wang et al., 2018</xref>), and decision-making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Finkelstein et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gao et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mante et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Raposo et al., 2014</xref>). The evolution of the neural population state is controlled by initial conditions, internal dynamics, and external inputs, and can allow computations to be carried out (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Vyas et al., 2020</xref>). For example, preparatory activity in non-human primate motor and premotor areas has been proposed to initialize dynamical systems to generate appropriate arm movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Churchland et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Shenoy et al., 2013</xref>). In addition, thalamic input has been shown to drive cortical dynamics in the mouse motor cortex during reaching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Sauerbrei et al., 2020</xref>). In the primate dorsomedial frontal cortex, the speed of neural trajectories encoding the passage of time is adjusted by both initial conditions and thalamic inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Remington et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Wang et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Here, we investigate how task rules affect activity in a sensorimotor pathway to govern the mapping between stimulus and response. We trained mice in a cross-modal sensory selection task that we recently developed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">ChevÃ©e et al., 2022</xref>) and then recorded and analyzed population single-unit activity from a set of cortical areas along the pathway that transforms whisker sensory inputs into licking motor outputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Esmaeili et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Guo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2017</xref>). We found that single-neuron and population activity before stimulus delivery reflected task rules in the whisker regions of primary (S1) and secondary (S2) somatosensory cortical areas, and in the MM and ALM areas. Across these cortical areas, neural subspaces containing the trial activity differed between the two rules. Pre-stimulus population states in the motor cortical areas shifted in a manner that tracked the rule switch. Optogenetic inhibition designed to disrupt pre-stimulus states in the motor cortical areas impaired rule-dependent tactile detection. Together, our results show that the application of task rulesâto link a stimulus to the correct responseâinvolves rule-dependent configuration of pre-stimulus preparatory states within the sensorimotor cortex.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Task rules modulate touch-evoked activity of individual neurons in the tactile processing stream</title><p>We trained head-fixed mice to perform a cross-modal sensory selection task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">ChevÃ©e et al., 2022</xref>) in which they switched between ârespond-to-touchâ and ârespond-to-lightâ rules in different blocks of trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a and b</xref>). During the respond-to-touch rule, mice responded to a tactile stimulus by licking to the right reward port, and to withhold licking following a visual stimulus. During the respond-to-light rule, mice responded to a visual stimulus by licking to the left reward port, and withheld licking following a tactile stimulus. For each trial, the stimulus duration was 0.15 s and an answer period extended from 0.1 to 2 s from stimulus onset. Blocks of trials under the two rules alternated multiple times in a session (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>; 4â6 blocks per session, ~60 trials per block). No cue was immediately provided after rule switching, so mice detected the rule change through reward availability over the first few trials. On the 9th trial, a drop of water from the correct reward port was released following the stimulus to ensure switching (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>, black dots).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Touch-evoked activity of individual neurons is modulated by task rules.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Schematic of the cross-modal sensory selection task.

Across neurons, activity varied by orders of magnitude (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2b</xref>) and showed diverse selectivity. In tactile stimulus trials, some neurons in sensory and motor cortical areas showed prominent touch-evoked responses in both block types (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1c</xref>). Most of these touch-evoked responses appeared enhanced and sustained at time points prior to licking in the respond-to-touch (tactile hit [âtHitâ]) blocks when compared with similar time points in the respond-to-light (tactile correct rejection [âtCRâ]) blocks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1a and e</xref>).

We used ideal observer analysis to determine how well trial-by-trial activity of a single neuron could discriminate between the task rules (Materials and methods). We found that 18â33% of neurons in these cortical areas had area under the receiver-operating curve (ROC) (AUC) values significantly different from 0.5, and therefore discriminated between tHit and tCR trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1h</xref>; S1: 28.8%, 177 neurons; S2: 17.9%, 162 neurons; MM: 32.9%, 140 neurons; ALM: 23.4%, 256 neurons; criterion to be considered significant: Bonferroni corrected 95% CI on AUC did not include 0.5 for at least three consecutive 10 ms time bins). Moreover, the distribution of AUC values for discriminative neurons showed that the majority had enhanced responses (AUC &gt;0.5) to tactile stimuli that were behaviorally relevant. Therefore, touch-evoked responses were overall enhanced by the relevance of tactile stimuli according to the current stimulus-response rule.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Pre-stimulus activity of single neurons signals task rules</title><p>In our cross-modal selection task, rules were block-based and there were no cues to indicate the current rule (except for the rule transition cue on the 9th trial of each block), so the mice were required to maintain rule information during the intertrial interval (ITI). To test if ITI activity of neurons in the somatosensory and motor cortical areas reflected task rules, we first analyzed neural activity during the 1 s window preceding stimulus delivery. Trials with licking in this time window were removed to minimize possible movement effects on pre-stimulus activity (Material and methods). We found that some cortical neurons showed obvious changes in their pre-stimulus activity across blocks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). A preference for the respond-to-touch rule (i.e. with activity higher in respond-to-touch blocks compared with respond-to-light blocks) and a preference for the respond-to-light rule were both observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a and b</xref>).

We hypothesized that pre-stimulus activityâi.e., the state of the population at the start of the trialâwould be set in such a way as to enable processing of the upcoming sensory signals according to the appropriate rule. Predictions from this hypothesis are that: (1) the pre-stimulus state of a neural population could be used to decode the current task rule; (2) the rule-dependent separation of neural subspaces before and after the tactile stimulus onset should be correlated; (3) pre-stimulus states would shift when the mice switched between rules; and (4) perturbations of the pre-stimulus state should disrupt task performance. We tested each prediction via the following analyses and experiments.</p><p>We first determined whether the pre-stimulus population state could be used to decode the current task rule.

In general, inhibition of PPC before stimulus onset decreased the hit rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1b</xref>; Î tHit [â0.36,â0.05]; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6âfigure supplement 2b</xref>; Î visual hit [â0.26, 0]), whereas inhibition of PPC after stimulus onset increased the false alarm rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1f</xref>; Î visual false alarm [0.13, 0.38]; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6âfigure supplement 2f</xref>; Î tactile false alarm [0, 0.25]).</p><p>It is possible that disruption of pre-stimulus states may affect aspects of tactile sensory processing and/or lick production that are unrelated to rules. To exclude this possibility, in a new cohort of mice (<italic>n</italic>=5), we inhibited each cortical area in either the pre- or the post-stimulus-onset period during performance of a simple tactile detection task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6eâg</xref>). In this task, mice had only to report with Go/NoGo licking whether a whisker was deflected, without rule-switching components to the task or the need to suppress responses to distracting stimuli. We found that tactile sensitivity was decreased when the sensory and motor cortical areas were inhibited after but not before stimulus onset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6f and g</xref>; 95% CI on Î tactile sensitivity for pre-stimulus-onset inhibition: S1/S2 [â0.34, 0.18], 3 mice, 3 sessions; MM [â0.23, 0.06], 3 mice, 5 sessions; ALM [â0.28, 0.07], 3 mice, 4 sessions; Î tactile sensitivity for post-stimulus-onset inhibition: S1/S2 [â0.59,â0.31]; MM [-0.59,â0.25]; ALM [â0.45,â0.1]). This was mainly caused by the decrease in hit rate in the post-stimulus-onset inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1i</xref>; 95% CI on Î tHit rate: S1/S2 [â0.61,â0.28]; MM [â0.67,â0.2]; ALM [â0.73,â0.05]). Inhibition of AMM and PPC did not influence tactile sensitivity in either inhibition condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6f and g</xref>; Î tactile sensitivity for pre-stimulus-onset inhibition: AMM [â0.25, 0.16], 3 mice, 4 sessions; PPC [â0.12, 0.1], 3 mice, 4 sessions; Î tactile sensitivity for post-stimulus-onset inhibition: AMM [â0.17, 0.18]; PPC [â0.14, 0.3]). Together, these results show that inhibition immediately prior to stimulus delivery did not impact the performance of a simple tactile detection task in which the stimulus-response rule remained fixed.</p><p>We conducted an additional analysis to rule out the possibility that the behavioral effects of cortical inhibition we observed could be due simply to a deficit in lick production per se. Specifically, we compared the probability of licking in laser-only trials (catch trials where there was no sensory stimulus) with the probability of licking during ITI, for both the cross-modal selection task and the simple tactile detection task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6h</xref>). Lick probability was unaffected during S1, S2, MM, and ALM experiments for both tasks, indicating that the behavioral effects were not due to an inability to lick (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6i and j</xref>; 95% CI on Î lick probability for cross-modal selection task: S1/S2 [â0.18, 0.24], 4 mice, 10 sessions; MM [â0.31, 0.03], 4 mice, 11 sessions; ALM [â0.24, 0.16], 4 mice, 10 sessions; Î lick probability for simple tactile detection task: S1/S2 [â0.13, 0.31], 3 mice, 3 sessions; MM [â0.06, 0.45], 3 mice, 5 sessions; ALM [â0.18, 0.34], 3 mice, 4 sessions).</p><p>Taken together, our results suggest that the pre-stimulus states of motor cortical networks play an important role in rule-dependent sensorimotor transformations.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Here, we investigated how rules modulate the transformation of tactile signals into actions across a set of key sensory-motor cortical areas comprising S1, S2, MM, and ALM. We found that neural activity prior to stimulus delivery reflected task rules at both the single-neuron and population levels in each area, but more prominently so in the motor cortical areas MM and ALM. Across the areas examined, each of the two task rules was associated with its own neural subspace for processing tactile signals. In ALM and MM, pre-stimulus population states shifted concomitantly with the behavioral signs of a rule switch. Optogenetic inhibition of motor cortical areas during the pre-stimulus period impaired tactile detection during the cross-modal selection task, but not during a simpler tactile detection task that did not require switching among rules. Together, our results suggest that the neural population states in motor cortical areas ALM and MM play an important role in transforming sensory stimuli into actions in a flexible, rule-dependent manner.</p><p>The responses to tactile stimuli were enhanced in S1, S2, MM, and ALM when they were behaviorally relevant according to the current rule (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1h</xref>). In our task, relevance relates to reward, movement preparation, and movement, factors known to influence activity across many brain areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Steinmetz et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chubykin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lacefield et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Musall et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Shuler and Bear, 2006</xref>). We chose not to attempt to dissociate ârelevanceâ from these factors in our task design, given that they are linked in many natural scenarios (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Moore and Zirnsak, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Rizzolatti et al., 1987</xref>). Below, we address potential concerns and confounding effects associated with reward and movement.</p><p>First, neural responses on tHit and tactile false alarms were similar, despite the fact that hits but not false alarms were rewarded (proportions of neurons showing a significant difference in mean response between tHit and tactile false alarms: S1 (0/177); S2 (2/162); MM (0/140); ALM (6/256); permutation tests on PSTHs with Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons; Materials and methods). Second, we minimized movement effects by limiting the analysis window to a period that preceded 97% of lick onsets (0â150 ms from stimulus onset). We also included censor and grace periods (Materials and methods) to reduce the impact of compulsive licking, and excluded trials with licking during the 1 s window preceding stimuli. We note that motor-related signals need not always occur together with overt movement. For instance, subthreshold stimulation of the frontal eye fields in primates can drive V4 activity and mimic the effects of attention without causing eye movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Moore and Armstrong, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Moore and Fallah, 2001</xref>).</p><p>Responses to tactile stimuli within a respond-to-light block were significantly reduced but still observable in ALM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1g</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1g</xref>). This suggests that gating of tactile information likely occurred in part prior to ALM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aruljothi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Borden et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Zhang and Zagha, 2022</xref>). In contrast, we did not observe visually evoked activity in ALM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1g</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1g and h</xref>). This modality bias is consistent with the long-range connectivity between sensory and frontal areas. Specifically, the somatosensory cortex is connected to the motor cortex, whereas the visual cortex is connected to the anterior cingulate cortex <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?lkqNut">(ACC</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>). Also consistent with this anatomy is that we observed visually evoked activity in the anterior part of the ACC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1iâk</xref>; the AMM), and ACC has been shown to modulate V1 activity in rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>In our task, the right or left water port was the rewarded port in a respond-to-touch block or a respond-to-light block, respectively. Although the mice could not anticipate stimulus types and licking responses during the ITI, there might be a subtle bias of posture and movement across blocks given the different positions of the rewarded port. To reduce the effects of movement bias on pre-stimulus activity (â100 to 0 ms), we removed trials with licking during a 1 s window before stimulus onset. Moreover, in a separate study using the same task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Finkel et al., 2024</xref>), high-speed video analysis demonstrated no significant differences in whisker motion between respond-to-touch and respond-to-light blocks in most (12 of 14) behavioral sessions.</p><p>We found that the neural subspaces containing population activity patterns were different during respond-to-touch and respond-to-light rules. Specifically, S1, S2, MM, and ALM showed lower subspace overlaps when calculated between tHit and tCR than when calculated between tHit and control (held-out) tHit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4e</xref>). These subspace differences could result from: (1) involvement of different sets of neurons; (2) differently signed changes in firing patterns (such as some neurons fire more and others fire less); and/or (3) differently scaled changes in firing patterns (such as the firing rates of some neurons do not change and the firing rates of other neurons increased twofold).</p><p>We found that how well neural subspaces were separated during tactile processing was associated with how well they were separated prior to the stimulus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4f</xref>). This result is consistent with a dynamical systems view of neural population processing, where initial conditions are of critical importance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Vyas et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Shenoy et al., 2013</xref>). Bringing the population activity to an optimal initial state could allow the evolution of the population activity to produce the desired movement. Primate studies have shown that motor cortical areas implement this strategy to control movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Afshar et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Churchland et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Churchland et al., 2006b</xref>). Here, we identified a potentially similar role for motor cortex activity states in the transformation of incoming sensory signals into actions in a rule-dependent manner. In addition, we found that not only motor but also sensory cortical areas had initial states that varied with the current rule. Indeed, pre-stimulus activity has been shown to encode rule information in primate visual cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Jonikaitis et al., 2020</xref>) and rodent auditory cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Rodgers and DeWeese, 2014</xref>). Overall, these findings indicate that setting up appropriate initial states could be a general strategy by which cortical networks integrate external inputs to achieve context-specific processing.</p><p>No-lick trials included misses, which could be caused by mice not being engaged in the task. While the majority of no-lick trials were correct rejections (respond-to-touch: 75%; respond-to-light: 76%), we treated no-licks as one of the available choices in our task and included them to calculate choice CDs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1c, d, and f</xref>). To ensure stable and balanced task engagement across task rules, we removed the last 20 trials of each session and used stimulus parameters that achieved similar behavioral performance for both task rules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>; ~75% correct for both rules). However, we also calculated choice CDs using only right- and left-lick trials. In S1, S2, MM, and ALM, the choice CDs calculated this way were also not aligned well across task rules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1h</xref>), consistent with the results calculated from lick and no-lick trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1f</xref>). Data were limited for this analysis, however, because mice rarely licked to the unrewarded water port (# of licks<sub>unrewarded port</sub> /# of licks<sub>total</sub>, respond-to-touch: 0.13, respond-to-light: 0.11). These trials usually came from rule transitions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>) and, in some cases, were potentially caused by exploratory behaviors. These factors could affect choice CDs.</p><p>Inhibition of the motor cortical areas prior to stimulus delivery slightly but significantly impaired tactile detection in the respond-to-touch rule and visual detection in the respond-to-light rule (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6âfigure supplement 2g</xref>). However, the ability to detect sensory stimuli was not completely abolished. This suggests that circuits for encoding the task rules may be redundant and/or other gating mechanisms may be involved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bari et al., 2019</xref>). Indeed, the pre-stimulus activity in either MM and ALM could be used to decode the task rules, although we inhibited only one area at a time. Additionally, it has been shown that loops between ALM and subcortical regions including thalamus and cerebellum maintain persistent activity during short-term memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gao et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Guo et al., 2017</xref>). It is possible that recurrent circuits across multiple brain areas contribute to holding rule information during ITI.</p><p>To test for a rule-specific function of pre-stimulus states, we used a simple tactile detection task to assess the potential effects of inhibition on sensory processing and lick production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6eâg</xref>). We found that inhibition of the pre-stimulus states of MM and ALM only reduced the detection sensitivity for tactile stimuli in the cross-modal selection task but not in the simple tactile detection task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c and f</xref>), suggesting a role specific to flexible rule-dependent sensorimotor transformations. We balanced the behavioral performances in these tasks (~75% correct) via the adjustment of stimulus intensity to make the task difficulties similar. However, the effects of silencing cortex can also depend on factors that we did not probe, such as the time course of an areaâs task involvement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Oude Lohuis et al., 2022</xref>). To more precisely dissect the effects of perturbations on different cognitive processes in rule-dependent sensory detection, more complex behavioral tasks and richer behavioral measurements are needed in the future.</p><p>Pre-stimulus activity in MM and ALM showed a strong dependence on the current rule (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3,</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>), correlated with aspects of subsequent tactile processing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), and was required for tactile detection during the cross-modal selection task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c</xref>). These motor cortical areas are therefore likely to play an important role in the rule-dependent sensorimotor transformations occurring within cortical networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Siniscalchi et al., 2016</xref>). A greater rule dependence of activity in motor compared with sensory areas is consistent with primate visual and somatosensory studies showing that attention effects become more prominent in higher-order areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Buffalo et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gregoriou et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hsiao et al., 1993</xref>). Moreover, a number of studies in primates and rodents have shown that sensory-related responses in sensory cortical areas are modulated by motor cortical areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Petersen, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Moore and Zirnsak, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Moore and Armstrong, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lee et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Zagha et al., 2013</xref>). It is possible that MM and ALM received rule information from other brain regions such as the medial prefrontal cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bari et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Guo et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anastasiades and Carter, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Schmitt et al., 2017</xref>) and send this information to S1 and S2 in the cross-modal selection task. Future work is needed to identify and characterize the neural circuits responsible for implementation, encoding, and updating of rules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mansouri et al., 2020</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>Mus musculus,</italic> male and female)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>Pvalb</italic><sup>Cre</sup>: B6.129P2-Pvalb<sup>tm1(cre)Arbr</sup>/J</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">The Jackson Laboratory</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">008069</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Materials and methods &gt;Mice</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>M. musculus,</italic> male and female)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>Emx1<sup>Cre</sup></italic>: B6.129S2-Emx1<sup>tm1(cre)Krj</sup>/J</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">The Jackson Laboratory</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">005628</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Materials and methods &gt;Mice</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>M. musculus,</italic> male and female)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Ai32: B6.129S-Gt(ROSA)26Sor<sup>tm32(CAG-COP4*H134R/EYFP)Hze</sup>/J</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">The Jackson Laboratory</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">012569</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Materials and methods &gt;Mice</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>M. musculus,</italic> male and female)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>Slc32a1<sup>ChR2-EYFP:</sup></italic> B6.Cg-Tg (Slc32a1-COP4*H134R/ EYFP)8Gfng/J</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">The Jackson Laboratory</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">014548</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Materials and methods &gt;Mice</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Software, algorithm</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">MATLAB</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">MathWorks</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">2019a</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/release-notes-R2019a.html">https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/release-notes-R2019a.html</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Software, algorithm</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">BControl software</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Brody, Princeton University</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://brodywiki.princeton.edu/bcontrol/index.php?title=Main_Page">https://brodywiki.princeton.edu/bcontrol/index.php?title=Main_Page</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Software, algorithm</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Kilosort</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Pachitariu et al., 2016</xref>;

Behavioral apparatus was controlled by BControl software (C. Brody, Princeton University). Four to 7 days after a headpost implantation and 7â14 days before behavioral training, mice were allowed 1 ml of water daily until reaching ~80% of their starting body weight. On training days, mice were allowed to perform until sated (~1 hr/day) and were weighed before and after each session to determine the amount of water consumed. Additional water was given if mice consumed &lt;0.3 ml of water in order to maintain a stable body weight. On days when their behavior was not tested, they received 1 ml of water.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Cross-modal sensory selection task</title><p>The cross-modal sensory selection training consists of two stages. Mice were first trained to perform tactile and visual detection separately, then trained on the cross-modal selection task where tactile and visual stimuli were randomly interleaved.</p><p>In the first 1â2 sessions, mice were acclimated to head fixation in the behavioral apparatus while being given free access to water via two reward ports located 6â10 mm and ~35 degrees to the left and right of the mouse midline. In subsequent sessions, mice were randomly assigned to start with tactile or visual detection training. After the hit rate of one modality reached &gt;70% (~3 days; hit rate = 100*(# hits)/(# hits + # misses)), stimulus detection training of the other modality began. For tactile detection training, a single whisker (always on the right whisker pad) was threaded into a glass pipette attached to a piezo actuator (D220-A4-203YB, Piezo Systems), which was driven by a piezo controller (MDTC93B, Thorlabs). Approximately 1.5 mm of whisker remained exposed at the base. All whiskers except the target whisker were trimmed to near the base. Mice were given a drop of water (~6 Âµl) for licking to the right reward port in response to a tactile stimulus (1 s sinusoidal deflections at 40 Hz, ~1400 degrees/s) during an answer period (0.1â2 s from stimulus onset). For visual detection training, mice were rewarded for licking to the left water port in response to a visual stimulus. Each visual stimulus comprised 470 nm light (1 s flash at ~5 mW) generated by an LED (M470F1 LED driven by LEDD1B, Thorlabs) and emitted from the tip of an optic fiber (105 Âµm diameter, 0.22 NA; M43L01, Thorlabs) positioned 5.5 cm away from the tip of the mouseâs nose along its midline. The intensity of visual stimulus can be adjusted by a density filter (NE530B, Thorlabs). To reduce compulsive licking, licks that occurred within a âgrace periodâ (0â0.1 s from stimulus onset) were not rewarded. Licks occurring in a âcensor periodâ (â0.2â0 s from stimulus onset) resulted in the withholding of the stimulus presentation for that trial and no reward or punishment. Trials with licks occurring in the grace and censor periods were omitted from analysis. In all sessions, ambient white noise (cutoff at 40 kHz, ~80 dB SPL) was played to mask any potential sound associated with movement of the piezo stimulator.</p><p>After the stimulus detection training, mice were trained to perform the cross-modal selection task. Tactile and visual stimuli were randomly interleaved (subject to a limit of 4 consecutive trials of the same type) and trials were separated by a random interval (3.5 s fixed interval+random interval drawn from an exponential distribution with mean 4 s). Trials were grouped into either respond-to-touch or respond-to-light blocks (54â66 trials per block from a uniform distribution with mean 60 trials). Each session randomly began with one of two block types, and the block types subsequently alternated multiple times (4â6 blocks per session). In respond-to-touch blocks, mice were rewarded with a drop of water if they licked the right reward port following tactile but not visual stimuli. In respond-to-light blocks, mice were rewarded with a drop of water for licking the left reward port following visual but not tactile stimuli. The answer, grace, and censor periods were as described above for the stimulus detection training.</p><p>Four trial outcomes were defined based on block types, sensory stimuli, and responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). Trials in which mice licked to the correct reward port following tactile stimuli in respond-to-touch blocks or visual stimuli in respond-to-light blocks were scored as âhitâ trials. Failures to lick to the correct port after tactile stimuli in respond-to-touch blocks or visual stimuli in respond-to-light blocks were scored as âmissâ trials. Licks to either reward port after tactile stimuli in respond-to-light blocks, visual stimuli in respond-to-touch blocks, or to the incorrect reward port after either stimulus type, resulted in âfalse alarmâ trials. Trials in which mice correctly withheld licks after tactile stimuli in respond-to-light blocks, or after visual stimuli in respond-to-touch blocks, were scored as âcorrect rejectionâ trials. Performance was quantified as percent correct: 100*(# hits + # correct rejections)/(# of trials total).</p><p>In an initial stage of cross-modal selection training (~7 sessions), a drop of water from the rewarded port was automatically released following 80% behaviorally relevant stimuli. Subsequently, automatically released water only occurred on the 9th trial after a block switch. Once performance reached &gt;70% of trials correct, task difficulty was gradually increased by reducing stimulus intensity and duration. In a final stage of training, faint stimuli (tactile: 0.15 s sinusoidal deflections at 20 Hz, ~800 degrees/s; visual: 0.15 s flash at ~3 ÂµW) were used to increase cognitive load and to result in error trials for analysis. Mice were considered trained when performance reached &gt;70% correct for at least 3 consecutive days. After reaching this performance criterion, mice proceeded with test sessions. Seven <italic>Pvalb<sup>cre</sup></italic>; Ai32 mice performed the cross-modal task during inhibition experiments, and six of them continued for electrophysiology recordings. Other transgenic mice were given test sessions for electrophysiology recordings but not optogenetic experiments.</p><p>Behavioral sessions lasted until mice were sated. To ensure stable engagement, the last 20 trials of each session were removed from further analysis. In addition, sessions were omitted from analysis if overall performance was &lt;60% correct, at least one of block performances (respond-to-touch or respond-to-light blocks) was &lt;55% correct, or at least one of hit rates (tactile or visual hits) was &lt;35%. Three sessions in total were removed for these reasons (from two mice).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Tactile detection task</title><p>Head-fixed mice were trained to perform a Go/NoGo tactile detection task. On Go trials, the whisker was deflected (0.15 s sinusoidal deflections at 20 Hz, ~600 degrees/s). If mice licked the right reward port following a tactile stimulus, a drop of water was released and it was scored as a hit trial. If mice failed to respond to a tactile stimulus, it was scored as a miss trial. On NoGo trials, the target whisker was not deflected. If mice licked during the answer period, it was scored as a false alarm. If mice withheld licking, it was scored as a correct rejection. Go and NoGo trials were randomly interleaved (subject to a limit of 4 consecutive trials of the same type), and no trial-start cue was presented. The answer, grace, and censor periods were as described above for the cross-modal selection task. Tactile stimuli of the tactile detection task were slightly weaker compared with the cross-modal selection task in order to control task difficulties by making behavioral performance similar (~75% correct).</p><p>Similar to the cross-modal selection task, the last 20 trials in each session were excluded, and sessions with performance &lt;60% correct or tHit rate &lt;35% were removed from subsequent analysis.

During surgery, mice were anesthetized under isoflurane (1â2% in O<sub>2</sub>; Surgivet) and mounted in a stereotaxic apparatus (David Kopf Instruments) with a thermal blanket (Harvard Apparatus). Mice were given a subcutaneous injection of Marcaine or Lidocaine for local analgesia and an intraperitoneal injection of Ketoprofen to reduce inflammation. The scalp and periosteum over the dorsal surface of the skull were removed. To expose S2 on the left hemisphere, the left temporal muscle was detached and the bone ridge at the temporal-parietal junction was thinned using a dental drill. Headposts were fixed to the skull over the lambda structure using clear adhesive luting cement (C&amp;B Metabond Quick Adhesive Cement System; Parkell). A thin layer of clear cement followed by an additional layer of cyanoacrylate glue (Krazy Glue) was applied to the entire surface of the exposed skull, leaving it largely transparent. To protect the clear skull from scratching, a silicone elastomer (Kwik-Cats) was applied prior to optogenetic experiments.</p><p>Intrinsic signal imaging (ISI) was used to guide the whisker parts of S1 and S2 for neural recordings and optogenetic experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Masino et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">OâConnor et al., 2013</xref>). Mice were lightly anesthetized with isoflurane (0.5â1%) and chlorprothixene. The C2 or C3 whisker was stimulated with a Piezo at 10 Hz. Since S2 is close to the auditory cortex, white noise was played during imaging.</p><p>For silicon probe recording, a small craniotomy (~1 mm in diameter) over the recording site (always on the left hemisphere) was made (S1 and S2 determined by ISI; MM: 1.5 mm anterior, 1.0 mm lateral; ALM: 2.5 mm anterior, 1.5 mm lateral to bregma). The dental acrylic and skull was thinned using a dental drill and the remaining bone was removed with a tungsten needle or forceps. A separate, smaller craniotomy (~0.6 mm in diameter) on the right hemisphere was made for implantation of a ground screw (0.6 mm anterior, 3.0 mm lateral to bregma; S1 trunk region). Additional craniotomies were usually made in new locations after finishing recordings in previous ones (12 mice; 1â4 recording sites per mouse).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Electrophysiology and data preprocessing</title><p>Linear 64-channel probes (H3, Cambridge NeuroTech) were coated with DiI (saturated) or DiD (5â10 mg/ml) to histologically verify the site of recording post hoc. The silicon probe was inserted into the cortex either vertically (for MM and ALM) or at ~40 degrees from vertical (for S1 and S2). After probe insertion, the brain was covered with a layer of 1.5% agarose and ACSF and was left for ~10 min prior to recording.</p><p>Neural signals and behavioral timestamps were recorded using an Intan system (RHD2000 series multi-channel amplifier chip; Intan Technologies). Neural signals were sampled at 30 kHz. Kilosort was used for spike sorting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Pachitariu et al., 2016</xref>) and spike clusters were manually curated using Phy. Units were excluded from further analysis if the rate of inter-spike-interval violations within a 1.5ms window was &gt;0.5%, L-ratios were &gt;0.1, the presence of spikes was &lt;90% of the whole session, the cumulative drift of spike depth was &gt;40 Âµm (Unit Quality Metrics, Allen Institute).</p><p>For analyses about stimulus-evoked responses, neural spike rates were calculated in 10 ms bins and smoothed with a Gaussian kernel (50 ms). For analyses about pre-stimulus activity, neural spike rates were calculated in 100 ms bins without smoothing. Spike rates of simultaneously recorded neurons were normalized for all population-level analyses including LDA and PCA. We used soft normalization to make activity in a roughly unity range and to reduce the impact of units with low firing rate (normalized response = (responseâmean(response))/(range(response)+5)) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Churchland et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Russo et al., 2020</xref>). In addition, to minimize movement effects on neural activity during the pre-stimulus window (â1 to 0 s from stimulus onset), trials with licking occurring in this window were removed (~25%).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Optogenetic inhibition</title><p><italic>Pvalb<sup>cre</sup></italic>; Ai32 mice implanted with clear-skull caps were given optogenetic inhibition experiments after behavioral task training (cross-modal selection or tactile detection). Laser stimuli (473 nm; MBL-III-473-100, Ultralasers) were directed to the brain via optic fibers (200 Î¼m diameter, 0.22 NA; TM200FL1B, Thorlabs) positioned over (~2 mm above) the cortical areas bilaterally (8â10 mW each side). The intensity of laser stimuli was controlled by an acousto-optic modulator (MTS110-A3-VIS, QuantaTech). For S1 and S2, the left whisker areas were guided by ISI (as described above) and the right whisker areas were determined as the symmetric positions. Other targeted areas on the dorsal cortex included MM (1.5 mm anterior, 1.0 mm lateral to bregma), ALM (2.5 mm anterior, 1.5 mm lateral), AMM (2.5 mm anterior, 0.5 mm lateral), and PPC (1.94 mm posterior, 1.6 mm lateral). Sham sessions were identical to optogenetic inhibition sessions except that the dorsal cortex was covered by blackout cloth in order to not inhibit any brain areas. For each session, one of the cortical areas or the sham condition was randomly assigned for inhibition. A cone, blackout cloth and tape were used to shield the mouseâs eyes from scattered light due to the laser.</p><p>For the cross-modal sensory selection task, laser stimuli were delivered to the targeted brain areas in ~30% of tactile and visual stimulus trials. In around half of these trials, optogenetic inhibition occurred before stimulus onset to suppress baseline activity (â0.8 to 0 s from stimulus onset, 40 Hz sinusoidal waveform with a 0.1 s linearly modulated ramp-down at the end). In the other half of these trials, optogenetic inhibition began simultaneously with the stimulus onset to suppress sensory-evoked activity (0â2 s from stimulus onset, 40 Hz sinusoidal waveform with a 0.2 s linearly modulated ramp-down at the end). Additionally, in a subset of trials (~20%), laser stimuli were delivered alone. These âlaser-onlyâ trials consisted of short (0.8 s) and long (2 s) trains of laser pulses that are identical to the laser stimuli in pre-stimulus-onset and post-stimulus-onset conditions respectively.</p><p>For the tactile detection task, laser stimuli were delivered in ~30% of trials. Among these laser trials, Go trials consist of approximately half pre-stimulus-onset and half post-stimulus-onset inhibition. Since there was no tactile stimulus in NoGo trials, short (0.8 s) and long (2 s) laser stimuli were delivered before and after trial onset respectively. Laser stimuli are identical to those used in the cross-modal selection task.</p><p>Baseline behavioral performance was measured by trials without laser stimuli and used to determine if a session passed the criteria of good performance (as described in the Behavioral tasks section). In addition, sessions with laser catch rates &gt;75% or &gt;hit rates were removed from analysis because a high laser catch rate indicates that mice detected laser stimuli instead of tactile or visual stimuli (laser catch rate = 100*(# of laser-only trials in which licking occurred)/(# of laser-only trials total)).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Single-neuron discrimination analyses</title><sec id="s4-8-1"><title>ROC analysis</title><p>ROC analysis was used to calculate how well trial-by-trial activity of a single neuron could discriminate certain conditions (e.g. tHit vs tCR). The AUC represents the performance of an ideal observer in discriminating trials based on these conditions (MATLAB âperfcurveâ). For discriminability of touch-evoked activity between task rules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1h</xref>), tactile correct trials were split into tHit (respond-to-touch) and tCR (respond-to-light). The analysis window was the first 150 ms after stimulus onset to minimize any movement effects resulting from licking. A Bonferroni corrected 95% confidence interval for AUC was obtained by bootstrap. For each time bin (10 ms), if its 95% CI did not include the chance level (0.5), it was considered significant. We defined a unit as showing significant tHit-tCR selectivity when three consecutive time bins (&gt;30 ms) of AUC values were significant.</p><p>For discriminability of pre-stimulus activity between task rules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>), correct trials were split based on block types (respond-to-touch: tHit and visual correct rejections; respond-to-light: visual hits and tCR). The analysis window was the 100 ms window before stimulus onset. For discriminability of pre-stimulus activity between stimulus types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>), correct trials were split based on stimulus types rather than block types (tactile: tHit and tCR; visual: visual hits and visual correct rejections). For discriminability of sensory-evoked activity between stimulus types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>), correct trials were split based on stimulus types, and the analysis window was the first 100 ms after stimulus onset rather than before stimulus onset. For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2câe</xref>, the analysis window was one time bin (100 ms). If the Bonferroni corrected 95% CI for this time bin did not include the chance level (0.5), it was considered significant.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8-2"><title>PSTH-based permutation test</title><p>To determine whether water reward affected touch-evoked activity in the cross-modal selection task, we compared the mean PSTHs for tHit and for tactile false alarms in which mice licked to the right water port following a tactile stimulus in the respond-to-light blocks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). For each neuron, the Euclidean distance between the mean PSTHs for tHit and tactile false alarms was calculated (0â250 ms from stimulus onset). We then performed a permutation test on whether this Euclidean distance was significantly different from zero (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Foffani and Moxon, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">OâConnor et al., 2010</xref>).

Significance was determined at the alpha = 0.05 level after Bonferroni correction for the number of neurons.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Population decoding analyses</title><p>We used LDA (MATLAB âfitcdiscrâ) to measure how well population activity from simultaneously recorded neurons could decode (1) task rules (respond-to-touch vs respond-to-light) prior to stimulus delivery (â100 to 0 ms from the stimulus onset), (2) stimulus types (tactile vs visual stimuli) prior to stimulus delivery, and (3) stimulus types after stimulus onset (0â100 ms). All correct trials were used and classification accuracy was obtained using 10-fold cross-validation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1c and d</xref>). In addition, SVM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1a</xref>; MATLAB âfitcsvmâ) and Random Forests (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1b</xref>; MATLAB âTreeBaggerâ with 500 trees) were used to discriminate task rules prior to stimulus delivery.

We used 90% of the correct trials as training data for task rules and the held-out 10% of correct trials to classify trials as having come from respond-to-touch or respond-to-light blocks. We also separately classified trials occurring in the âearly transitionâ and âlate transitionâ periods as having come from one or the other of the block types.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Distance between neural trajectories</title><p>We calculated the distance between tHit and tCR trajectories to determine how these trajectories diverged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a and b</xref>). For each session, we performed a PCA using the trial-averaged tHit and tCR population spike rate responses (â100 to 150 ms from stimulus onset). Population responses for individual tHit and tCR trials were projected onto the top three PC space. For each pair of tHit and tCR trials, the Euclidean distances between the neural states of tHit and tCR trajectories at each time point were calculated. The distances between tHit and tCR trajectories were averaged across these pairs in each session.</p><p>To investigate the relationship between a difference in pre-stimulus activity and a difference in subsequent sensory-evoked activity, the distances between tHit and tCR trajectories from all recording sessions (total 40 sessions; S1 [10], S2 [8], MM [9], ALM [13]) were ranked based on the distances before stimulus delivery (â100 to 0 ms). The mean tHit-tCR distances after stimulus onset (0â150 ms) between the top and bottom 50% groups were compared using a permutation test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>). Specifically, we calculated the Euclidean distance between the mean tHit-tCR distances for these two groups. The group labels were then randomly shuffled, and new mean tHit-tCR distances of the shuffled groups were obtained. The Euclidean distance between these shuffled mean tHit-tCR distances was calculated. This shuffling procedure was repeated 1000 times, and then the p-value was calculated (one-tailed; null hypothesis: no difference; distance â¥ 0).</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Subspace overlap</title><p>The subspace overlap between tHit and tCR trials was obtained through their variance alignment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4dâf</xref>). For each session, the trial-averaged tHit activity was used to perform a PCA (0â150 ms from stimulus onset). The trial-averaged tCR activity was projected onto the top three PC space (tCR<sub>tHit-subspace</sub>), and the variance explained was calculated. For normalization, a separated PCA was performed on the trial-averaged tCR activity, and its own (tCR<sub>tCR-subspace</sub>) variance explained was calculated. The subspace overlap was defined as the ratio of the variance explained of tCR<sub>tHit-subspace</sub> to the variance explained of tCR<sub>tCR-subspace</sub>. We chose the top three PCs because most of the variances of tHit<sub>tHit-subspace</sub> (~90%) and tCR<sub>tCR-subspace</sub> (~85%) were captured.</p><p>To test if the subspace for processing tactile signals significantly changed under different rules, we compared the subspace overlap between tHit and tCR trials with a control group. Specifically, we randomly assigned tHit trials into equal sized reference and control groups. The tCR and tHit control groups were projected to the PC space of the tHit reference group, and their subspace overlaps were compared (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4e</xref>). To calculate the separation of subspaces prior to stimulus delivery, pre-stimulus activity in tCR trials (â100 to 0 ms from stimulus onset) was projected to the PC space of the tHit reference group and the subspace overlap was calculated. In this analysis, we used tHit activity during stimulus delivery (0â150 ms from stimulus onset) to obtain reliable PCs. In addition, the subspace overlap could be overestimated when there were only few neurons in a session (low dimensionality). To avoid this issue, sessions having less than 10 units were excluded from this analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Stimulus and choice CDs</title><p>For each session, <italic>n</italic> simultaneously recorded neurons created an <italic>n</italic> dimensional space.

The results are relevant for context-specific neural computation and provide a neural substrate that will surely inspire follow-up mechanistic investigations. We only have a couple of suggestions to help the authors further improve the paper.</p><p>(1) We have a comment regarding the calculation of the choice CD in Fig S3. The text on page 7 concludes that &quot;Choice coding dimensions change with task rule&quot;. However, the motor choice response is different across blocks, i.e. lick right vs. no lick for one task and lick left vs. no lick for the other task. Therefore, the differences in the choice CD may be simply due to the motor response being different across the tasks and not due to the task rule per se. The authors may consider adding this caveat in their interpretation. This should not affect their main conclusion.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for the suggestion. We have discussed this caveat and performed a new analysis to calculate the choice coding dimensions using right-lick and left-lick trials (Fig. S3h) on page 8.</p><p>âChoice coding dimensions were obtained from left-lick and no-lick trials in respond-to-touch blocks and right-lick and no-lick trials in respond-to-light blocks. Because the required lick directions differed between the block types, the difference in choice CDs across task rules (Fig. S4f) could have been affected by the different motor responses. To rule out this possibility, we did a new version of this analysis using right-lick and left-lick trials to calculate the choice coding dimensions for both task rules. We found that the orientation of the choice coding dimension in a respond-to-touch block was still not aligned well with that in a respond-to-light block (Fig. S4h; magnitude of dot product between the respond-to-touch choice CD and the respond-to-light choice CD, mean Â± 95% CI for true vs shuffled data: S1: 0.39 Â± [0.23, 0.55] vs 0.2 Â± [0.1, 0.31], 10 sessions; S2: 0.32 Â± [0.18, 0.46] vs 0.2 Â± [0.11, 0.3], 8 sessions; MM: 0.35 Â± [0.21, 0.48] vs 0.18 Â± [0.11, 0.26], 9 sessions; ALM: 0.28 Â± [0.17, 0.39] vs 0.21 Â± [0.12, 0.31], 13 sessions).â</p><p>We also have included the caveats for using right-lick and left-lick trials to calculate choice coding dimensions on page 13.</p><p>âHowever, we also calculated choice coding dimensions using only right- and left-lick trials. In S1, S2, MM and ALM, the choice CDs calculated this way were also not aligned well across task rules (Fig. S4h), consistent with the results calculated from lick and no-lick trials (Fig. S4f). Data were limited for this analysis, however, because mice rarely licked to the unrewarded water port (# of licksunrewarded port / # of lickstotal , respond-to-touch: 0.13, respond-to-light: 0.11). These trials usually came from rule transitions (Fig. 5a) and, in some cases, were potentially caused by exploratory behaviors. These factors could affect choice CDs.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) We have a couple of questions about the effect size on single neurons vs. population dynamics. From Fig 1, about 20% of neurons in frontal cortical regions show task rule modulation in their stimulus activity. This seems like a small effect in terms of population dynamics. There is somewhat of a disconnect from Figs 4 and S3 (for stimulus CD), which show remarkably low subspace overlap in population activity across tasks. Can the authors help bridge this disconnect? Is this because the neurons showing a difference in Fig 1 are disproportionally stimulus selective neurons?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for the insightful comment and agree that it is important to link the single-unit and population results. We have addressed these questions by (1) improving our analysis of task modulation of single neurons (tHit-tCR selectivity) and (2) examining the relationship between tHit-tCR selective neurons and tHit-tCR subspace overlaps.</p><p>Previously, we averaged the AUC values of time bins within the stimulus window (0-150 ms, 10 ms bins). If the 95% CI on this averaged AUC value did not include 0.5, this unit was considered to show significant selectivity. This approach was highly conservative and may underestimate the percentage of units showing significant selectivity, particularly any units showing transient selectivity. In the revised manuscript, we now define a unit as showing significant tHit-tCR selectivity when three consecutive time bins (&gt;30 ms, 10ms bins) of AUC values were significant. Using this new criterion, the percentage of tHittCR selective neurons increased compared with the previous analysis. We have updated Figure 1h and the results on page 4:</p><p>âWe found that 18-33% of neurons in these cortical areas had area under the receiver-operating curve (AUC) values significantly different from 0.5, and therefore discriminated between tHit and tCR trials (Fig. 1h; S1: 28.8%, 177 neurons; S2: 17.9%, 162 neurons; MM: 32.9%, 140 neurons; ALM: 23.4%, 256 neurons; criterion to be considered significant: Bonferroni corrected 95% CI on AUC did not include 0.5 for at least 3 consecutive 10-ms time bins).â</p><p>Next, we have checked how tHit-tCR selective neurons were distributed across sessions. We found that the percentage of tHit-tCR selective neurons in each session varied (S1: 9-46%, S2: 0-36%, MM:25-55%, ALM:0-50%). We examined the relationship between the numbers of tHit-tCR selective neurons and tHit-tCR subspace overlaps. Sessions with more neurons showing task rule modulation tended to show lower subspace overlap, but this correlation was modest and only marginally significant (r = -0.32, p = 0.08, Pearson correlation, n = 31 sessions). While we report the percentage of neurons showing significant selectivity as a simple way to summarize single-neuron effects, this does neglect the magnitude of task rule modulation of individual neurons, which may also be relevant.</p><p>In summary, the apparent disconnect between the effect sizes of task modulation of single neurons and of population dynamics could be explained by (1) the percentages of tHit-tCR selective neurons were underestimated in our old analysis, (2) tHit-tCR selective neurons were not uniformly distributed among sessions, and (3) the percentages of tHit-tCR selective neurons were weakly correlated with tHit-tCR subspace overlaps.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>For the analysis of choice coding dimensions, it seems that the authors are somewhat data limited in that they cannot compare lick-right/lick-left within a block. So instead, they compare lick/no lick trials. But given that the mice are unable to initiate trials, the interpretation of the no lick trials is a bit complicated. It is not clear that the no lick trials reflect a perceptual judgment about the stimulus (i.e., a choice), or that the mice are just zoning out and not paying attention. If it's the latter case, what the authors are calling choice coding is more of an attentional or task engagement signal, which may still be interesting, but has a somewhat different interpretation than a choice coding dimension. It might be worth clarifying this point somewhere, or if I'm totally off-base, then being more clear about why lick/no lick is more consistent with choice than task engagement.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for raising this point. We have added a new paragraph on page 13 to clarify why we used lick/no-lick trials to calculate choice coding dimensions, and we now discuss the caveat regarding task engagement.</p><p>âNo-lick trials included misses, which could be caused by mice not being engaged in the task. While the majority of no-lick trials were correct rejections (respond-to-touch: 75%; respond-to-light: 76%), we treated no-licks as one of the available choices in our task and included them to calculate choice coding dimensions (Fig. S4c,d,f). To ensure stable and balanced task engagement across task rules, we removed the last 20 trials of each session and used stimulus parameters that achieved similar behavioral performance for both task rules (Fig. 1d; ~75% correct for both rules).â</p><p>In addition, to address a point made by Reviewer 3 as well as this point, we performed a new analysis to calculate choice coding dimensions using right-lick vs left-lick trials. We report this new analysis on page 8:</p><p>âChoice coding dimensions were obtained from left-lick and no-lick trials in respond-to-touch blocks and right-lick and no-lick trials in respond-to-light blocks.

Data were limited for this analysis, however, because mice rarely licked to the unrewarded water port (# of licksunrewarded port / # of lickstotal , respond-to-touch: 0.13, respond-to-light: 0.11).

I think I'm missing the big picture interpretation of this result.</p></disp-quote><p>That there is no significant change in stimulus coding dimensions but a change in subspace suggests that the subspace change largely reflects a change in the choice coding dimensions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>As I mentioned in the public review, I thought there was a weakness with interpretation of the optogenetic experiments, which the authors generally interpret as reflecting rule sensitivity. However, given that they are inhibiting premotor areas including ALM, one might imagine that there might also be an effect on lick production or kinematics. To rule this out, the authors compare the change in lick rate relative to licks during the ITI. What is the ITI lick rate? I assume pretty low, once the animal is welltrained, in which case there may be a floor effect that could obscure meaningful effects on lick production. In addition, based on the reported CI on delta p(lick), it looks like MM and AM did suppress lick rate. I think in the future, a task with richer behavioral read-outs (or including other measurements of behavior like video), or perhaps something like a psychological process model with parameters that reflect different perceptual or cognitive processes could help resolve the effects of perturbations more precisely.</p></disp-quote><p>Eighteen and ten percent of trials had at least one lick in the ITI in respond-to-touch and respond-tolight blocks, respectively.

For subspace overlap calculation of pre-stimulus activity in Fig 4e (light purple datapoints), please clarify whether the PCs for that condition were constructed in matched time windows. If the PCs are calculated from the stimulus period 0-150ms, the poor alignment could be due to mismatched time windows.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for the comment and clarify our analysis here. We previously used timematched windows to calculate subspace overlaps. However, the pre-stimulus activity was much weaker than the activity during the stimulus period, so the subspaces of reference tHit were subject to noise and we were not able to obtain reliable PCs. This caused the subspace overlap values between the reference tHit and control tHit to be low and variable (mean Â± SD, S1: 0.46Â± 0.26, n = 8 sessions, S2: 0.46Â± 0.18, n = 7 sessions, MM: 0.44Â± 0.16, n = 5 sessions, ALM: 0.38Â± 0.22, n = 11 sessions). Therefore, we used the tHit activity during the stimulus window to obtain PCs and projected pre-stimulus and stimulus activity in tCR trials onto these PCs. We have now added a more detailed description of this analysis in the Methods (page 32).</p><p>âTo calculate the separation of subspaces prior to stimulus delivery, pre-stimulus activity in tCR trials (100 to 0 ms from stimulus onset) was projected to the PC space of the tHit reference group and the subspace overlap was calculated. In this analysis, we used tHit activity during stimulus delivery (0 to 150 ms from stimulus onset) to obtain reliable PCs.â</p><p>We acknowledge this time alignment issue and have now removed the reported subspace overlap between tHit and tCR during the pre-stimulus period from Figure 4e (light purple). However, we think the correlation between pre- and post- stimulus-onset subspace overlaps should remain similar regardless of the time windows that we used for calculating the PCs. For the PCs calculated from the pre-stimulus period (-100 to 0 ms), the correlation coefficient was 0.55 (Pearson correlation, p &lt;0.01, n = 31 sessions). For the PCs calculated from the stimulus period (0-150 ms), the correlation coefficient was 0.68 (Figure 4f, Pearson correlation, p &lt;0.001, n = 31 sessions). Therefore, we keep Figure 4f.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Minor point.

We are somewhat confused about the timing of some of the example neurons shown in figure S1. For example, many neurons show visually evoked signals only after stimulus offset, unlike tactile evoked signals (e.g. Fig S1b and f). In addition, the reaction time for visual stimulus is systematically slower than tactile stimuli for many example neurons (e.g. Fig S1b) but somehow not other neurons (e.g. Fig S1g). Are these observations correct?</p></disp-quote><p>These observations are all correct. We have a manuscript from a separate study using this same behavioral task (Finkel et al., accepted in principle) that examines and compares (1) the onsets of tactile- and visually-evoked activity and (2) the reaction times to tactile and visual stimuli. The reaction times to tactile stimuli were slightly but significantly shorter than the reaction times to visual stimuli (tactile vs visual, 397 Â± 145 vs 521 Â± 163 ms, median Â± interquartile range [IQR], Tukey HSD test, p = 0.001, n = 155 sessions). We examined how well activity of individual neurons in S1 could be used to discriminate the presence of the stimulus or the response of the mouse. For discriminability for the presence of the stimulus, S1 neurons could signal the presence of the tactile stimulus but not the visual stimulus. For discriminability for the response of the mouse, the onsets for significant discriminability occurred earlier for tactile compared with visual trials (two-sided Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, p = 1x10-16, n = 865 neurons with DP onset in tactile trials, n = 719 neurons with DP onset in visual trials).</p></body></sub-article></article>
