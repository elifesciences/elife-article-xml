However, little is known about the effects of exposure to volatiles emitted by microbes or in the environment that we are exposed to over longer durations. Using <italic>Drosophila melanogaster,</italic> we evaluated a yeast-emitted volatile, diacetyl, found at high levels around fermenting fruits where they spend long periods of time. Exposure to the diacetyl molecules in headspace alters gene expression in the antenna. <italic>In vitro</italic> experiments demonstrated that diacetyl and structurally related volatiles inhibited conserved histone deacetylases (HDACs), increased histone-H3K9 acetylation in human cells, and caused changes in gene expression in both <italic>Drosophila</italic> and mice. Diacetyl crosses the blood–brain barrier and exposure caused modulation of gene expression in the mouse brain, therefore showing potential as a neuro-therapeutic. Using two separate disease models previously known to be responsive to HDAC inhibitors, we evaluated the physiological effects of volatile exposure. Diacetyl exposure halted proliferation of a neuroblastoma cell line in culture. Exposure to diacetyl vapors slowed progression of neurodegeneration in a <italic>Drosophila</italic> model for Huntington’s disease. These changes strongly suggest that certain volatiles in the surroundings can have profound effects on histone acetylation, gene expression, and physiology in animals.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>HDAC</kwd><kwd>odor</kwd><kwd>Huntington's</kwd><kwd>neuroblastoma</kwd><kwd>DEG</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AI087785</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Haga-Yamanaka</surname><given-names>Sachiko</given-names></name><name><surname>Nunez-Flores</surname><given-names>Rogelio</given-names></name><name><surname>Scott</surname><given-names>Christi A</given-names></name><name><surname>Perry</surname><given-names>Sarah</given-names></name><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Stephanie Turner</given-names></name><name><surname>Pontrello</surname><given-names>Crystal</given-names></name><name><surname>Ray</surname><given-names>Anandasankar</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AI153195</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nair</surname><given-names>Meera G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007602</institution-id><institution>University of California, Riverside</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ray</surname><given-names>Anandasankar</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Volatile compounds from microbes and food alter epigenetic states by inhibiting histone deacetylases and alter gene expression, slow degeneration in Huntington’s model flies, and slow proliferation of a neuroblastoma cell line.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Multicellular organisms evolve in the presence of microbial volatiles and metabolites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">McFall-Ngai et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dorrestein et al., 2014</xref>), often exposed for prolonged periods of time. Human-associated microbes have incredible metabolic diversity, encoding 100× as many genes as the human genome itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">McFall-Ngai et al., 2013</xref>). It is estimated that about half of the thousands of metabolites found in mammalian blood are either produced or altered by microbes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wikoff et al., 2009</xref>). Microbial metabolites are an important mechanism by which the microbiome influences host immunity amongst other things (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dorrestein et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rooks and Garrett, 2016</xref>). Apart from microbial volatiles, many volatiles are also generated from the metabolism of a variety of food components, like triglycerides, sugars, and amino acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Shibamoto, 2014</xref>). Some chemicals are also produced by microorganisms such as yeasts and lactic bacteria during fermentation in many foods and beverages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Shibamoto, 2014</xref>).</p><p>In the model system <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, prolonged exposure to CO<sub>2</sub> showed an increase in volume of the CO<sub>2</sub>-sensing glomerulus in the antennal lobe, which lead to adaptations in fly behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Devaud et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sachse et al., 2007</xref>). Carbon dioxide is a common by-product of yeast fermentation in overripe fruits, the preferred food source. In order to study the physiological effects of long-term exposure to other volatiles emitted during fermentation, we exposed flies for 5 d to diacetyl, a buttery odorant made at high levels by yeast in fermenting fruits (1350 ppb in ripe banana), that is also found in many commonly consumed foods such as butter, yoghurt, wine, fruits, beer, and popcorn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Shibamoto, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Martineau et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nykanen and Nykanen, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hughes and Baxter, 2001</xref>). Diacetyl was selected for two reasons: first, <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> use fermenting fruits as their favored food source, oviposition site, and spend long durations of time exposed to it. Second, diacetyl is known to be an inhibitory odorant of the CO<sub>2</sub> receptor and therefore an opposite effect is expected on the V-glomerulus from the previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Turner and Ray, 2009</xref>). Follow-up experiments revealed that diacetyl acts as a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor <italic>in vitro</italic>. We found that volatiles structurally like diacetyl have similar HDAC inhibitory properties as well. Subsequent analyses with two different model systems – <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> and <italic>Mus musculus</italic> – showed gene expression changes in tissues caused by odor exposure from a distant source. We found expression of hundreds of genes to be modulated upon exposure to the volatile, as would be expected from an inhibitor of HDACs. HDACs are histone-modifying enzymes involved in the removal of acetyl groups from lysine residues and the remodeling of chromatin structure to regulate gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Shahbazian and Grunstein, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gräff and Tsai, 2013</xref>). With large-scale roles in gene regulation, HDACs are promising targets in drug development for many diseases such as cancers and neurodegenerative disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Minucci and Pelicci, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kazantsev and Thompson, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chuang et al., 2009</xref>). Several classes of orally administered HDAC inhibitors have been found to attenuate the progression of certain cancers and neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease and Huntington’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chuang et al., 2009</xref>). We determined that exposure to diacetyl volatiles substantially altered gene expression in the mouse brain, presumably by crossing the blood–brain barrier. Diacetyl exposure also slowed degeneration of photoreceptor cells in a Huntington’s disease model in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Last, exposure to diacetyl caused dramatic reduction in proliferation of a neuroblastoma cell line in culture. Our discovery of a family of volatile odorants that also act as HDAC inhibitors highlights the need to understand how small molecules present in our environment interact with and alter eukaryotic gene expression.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Activity-dependent expression modulation of chemosensory receptors</title><p>Previous studies demonstrated that prolonged exposure of ~5 d to elevated CO<sub>2</sub> levels causes an increase in volume of the CO<sub>2</sub>-sensitive V-glomerulus in the antennal lobe of <italic>Drosophila</italic>, which lead to adaptations in fly behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Devaud et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sachse et al., 2007</xref>). To assess the effect of the CO<sub>2</sub> response inhibitor diacetyl on the antennal lobe, flies were exposed to the odorant during the first 5 days immediately following eclosion. The CO<sub>2</sub>-detecting ab1C neuron was labeled using the promoters of the CO<sub>2</sub> receptors, <italic>Gr63a-Gal4; UAS-mcd8GFP</italic> and <italic>Gr21a-Gal4; UAS-mcd8GFP</italic>, and the flies were exposed to headspace above a 1% (V/V) diacetyl solution in an air-tight container. The flies were then imaged for expression of GFP in the ab1C neurons of the antenna, as well as the V glomerulus, which receives axonal input from ab1C neurons in the antennal lobe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jones et al., 2007</xref>). Surprisingly, the <italic>Gr63a</italic> promoter-driven GFP signal in the V glomerulus was completely abolished after 5 days of exposure to the odor for all brains imaged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). However, there was also a concomitant decrease in GFP signal in ab1C neurons in the antenna (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>). Similar results were seen for <italic>Gr21a</italic>-driven expression, where expression of GFP was lost in both the V-glomerulus and ab1C neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>). Interestingly, after 5 d of recovery in clean air, the GFP expression was regained in the V-glomerulus as well as in ab1C neurons in the antenna, indicating that both <italic>Gr21a</italic> and <italic>Gr63a</italic> expression had been restored (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Because olfactory neurons do not regenerate in the fruit fly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Berdnik et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sigg et al., 1997</xref>), these results suggest that changes in GFP levels are likely due to changes in the promoter expression and not due to neuronal cell death.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Volatiles found in microbes can inhibit histone deacetylases (HDACs) <italic>in vitro</italic>.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Antennal and whole-mount brain staining of <italic>Gr63a-Gal4</italic> flies.

It is also structurally related to another known HDAC inhibitor sodium butyrate. Diacetyl is present widely in nature as a pH-neutral fermentation product of microorganisms such as yeasts in over-ripe fruit, the favorite food for <italic>Drosophila</italic>, and also from lactic acid bacteria, and is found in many foods and beverages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Shibamoto, 2014</xref>). In humans, diacetyl is also produced by microbes on the skin, in the oral cavity, and is found in breath (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Whiteson et al., 2014</xref>). Interestingly, this volatile is known to traverse the cell membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Krogerus and Gibson, 2013</xref>).</p><p>Soluble metabolites from the gut microbiome, such as short-chain fatty acids, are known to affect histone-modifying enzymes, gene expression, and physiology in various parts of the host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">McFall-Ngai et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Krautkramer et al., 2017</xref>). It is presumed that these dissolved compounds absorbed in the blood circulate to various parts of the body. Microbes in our skin microbiome, mouth microbiome, and environment also emit a diverse repertoire of volatile metabolites that can traverse much greater distances away from the source (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">James et al., 2013</xref>). To examine whether diacetyl can directly modulate HDACs like β-hydroxybutyrate, we performed <italic>in vitro</italic> acetylation assays with purified recombinant HDACs. We found that, indeed, diacetyl inhibited all four purified human class I HDACs (HDAC1, 2, 3, and 8) and the one class II HDAC (HDAC6) tested. The inhibition occurred in a dose-dependent manner. The IC<sub>50</sub> values for HDAC1, 2, 3, 8, and 6 were 7.3, 23.1, 7.5, 14.3, and 24.5 mM, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). The levels of inhibition as observed from IC<sub>50</sub> values for HDAC1 and HDAC3 were comparable to those of β-hydroxybutyrate whose IC<sub>50</sub> values were previously reported as 5.3 and 2.4 mM, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Shimazu et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>To test other odorants for their ability to inhibit HDACs, we identified a list of volatile odorants structurally similar to diacetyl using the similarity search feature on PubChem (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) and tested them on four purified human HDACs, from class I (HDAC1 and HDAC3) and class II (HDAC4 and HDAC6). Each compound was tested at 15 mM, the concentration at which diacetyl inhibits HDAC1, 3, and 6 with more than 50% efficacy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>). All compounds tested reduced the activity of at least one of the HDACs tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Ethyl pyruvate, methyl pyruvate, 2,3-hexanedione, 2,3-heptandione, 2,3-pentandione inhibited HDAC1, 3, and 6 with more than 70% efficacy. Allyl butyrate also inhibited those HDACs but with lower efficacy. 1-Acetoxyacetone and 2,3-butanediol inhibited HDAC6 more than 70% but inhibitory effects against HDAC1 and 4 were lower. Moreover, propyl formate strongly inhibited HDAC 6 but did not inhibit HDAC1, 3, and 4. Taken together, these results indicate that microbial volatiles and structurally related odorants can inhibit human HDACs, and that each compound has a specific HDAC inhibitory spectrum.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Microbial volatile increases histone acetylation in human cell nuclei</title><p>In order to directly examine histone acetylation at the cellular level, we used human HEK293T cells, which offer a tractable system to prepare nuclear extracts, and picked the volatile diacetyl to test in more detail.

The majority of ommatidia retained 6–7 rhabdomeres at day 5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D and F</xref>). Even after 10 d, the majority of the ommatidia still had 2–3 rhabdomeres left in the odor-exposed flies, while the solvent controls had only ~1–2 rhabdomeres (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E and G</xref>). These results demonstrate that exposure to volatile diacetyl in air slows down the photoreceptor degeneration caused in these Huntington’s disease model flies. Thus, odorants like diacetyl may have potential as a prophylactic against this neurodegenerative disorder. Therefore, the volatile odorant can both significantly alter gene expression from a distance as well as cause a phenotypic change in the fly with a human disease gene.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we discovered that eukaryotic cells could alter gene expression in response to an odorant in a manner independent of traditional neuronal activity-induced pathways. Members of a conserved family of HDACs detected the concentration of diacetyl differentially. Diacetyl exposure increased levels of H3K9 acetylation in the nucleus in a dose-dependent manner and led to changes in gene expression. The odorant diacetyl occurs naturally and is generated from the metabolism of a variety of food components, including triglycerides, sugars, and amino acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Shibamoto, 2014</xref>). Moreover, the chemical is produced by the activity of microorganisms such as yeasts and lactic bacteria during fermentation in many foods and beverages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Shibamoto, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata1">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>). Although beyond the scope of this study, the discovery that cells can alter gene expression upon prolonged exposure to a common naturally occurring odorant raises important questions about the potential physiological consequences of the expression changes. Given our repeated exposure to particular flavors and fragrances, the findings outlined here highlight a new consideration for evaluating the safety of certain volatile chemicals that can cross the cell membrane.</p><p>In mammals, upregulation of circulating β-hydroxybutyrate during fasting or calorie restriction induces changes in the expression of a set of genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Shimazu et al., 2013</xref>). The acetylation mark specificity and IC<sub>50</sub> of β-hydroxybutyrate is similar to that of diacetyl. Any beneficial physiological effects of odor detection at lower odor concentrations would also be countered by studies of potential risks at higher concentrations. In fact, the deleterious effect of exposure to high levels to diacetyl causing bronchiolitis obliterans, or ‘popcorn lung,’ and its toxicity in cultured cells is already known (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">More et al., 2012</xref>). Even so it is present in several foods we eat and is on the Generally Regarded as Safe list of Flavor and Extract Manufacturers Association for use as a flavoring ingredient at low concentrations. While the specific mechanism of ‘popcorn lung’ is unknown, it has previously been proposed that carbonyl groups of diacetyl can react to modify amino acid side chains on proteins or generate reactive dicarbonyl and reactive oxygen species, leading to excessive cytokine production and inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Starek-Swiechowicz and Starek, 2014</xref>). Our results raise the possibility that the molecular mechanisms underlying this disorder could also be partially attributed to the unusually high HDAC-mediated genetic response to diacetyl by cells in the lungs. Several studies using rodent animal models have shown toxicity of high levels of diacetyl in the respiratory tracts including the nose and lungs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Morgan et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Palmer et al., 2011</xref>). The toxic effect of higher dosages has been observed for many types of HDAC inhibitors. For example, in one <italic>Drosophila</italic> study, feeding of a high dosage of 4-phenylbutyrate reduces survival rate, while a lower dosage extends longevity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kang et al., 2002</xref>). Another concern is that one of the highest known levels of diacetyl exposure to humans is through smoking cigarettes, where exposure from even a single cigarette (250–361 ppm) is high (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rigler and Longo, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pierce et al., 2014</xref>): Salem (128 μg/cigarette), Camel (128.1 μg/cigarette), and Carlton (45.6 μg/cigarette) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pierce et al., 2014</xref>). Different types of diets and lifestyle choices have been known to have effects on health and well-being due to differences in balance of different health-promoting ingredients, yet little is known about the role of such flavors, fragrances, and metabolites acting on epigenetic marks and altering gene expression. Our findings raise the possibility that diacetyl and structurally related odors in the environment may affect gene expression directly through absorption/transport into these cells. In mammals, the epithelium-lined lungs and nasal/oral pathway is directly exposed to odorants, presenting an opportunity to affect gene expression and physiology.</p><p>Eukaryotes primarily detect volatile odorants in the environment using olfactory neurons that express a variety of transmembrane receptors, a family of genes that have independently evolved multiple times in different phyla. Examples of these unrelated genes include the ionotropic 7-transmembrane (TM) odorant receptor (Or) family, which is insect-specific; 3-TM ionotropic receptors, which are present across most arthropods; the nematode-divergent 7-TM GPCRs belonging to the <italic>str, sra, srg, srw, srz, srbc, srsx,</italic> and <italic>srr</italic> families; the mammalian 7-TM GPCR olfactory receptor (OR) family; and the trace amine-associated receptor family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Buck and Axel, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Clyne et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Troemel et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Benton et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Vosshall et al., 1999</xref>). The activation of these receptors induces neuronal action potentials, and this information is conveyed to higher brain centers where olfactory perception is generated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Knaden and Hansson, 2014</xref>). This second response pathway that we have discovered is much slower and has an enzymatic mechanism that draws parallels with the multiple pathways in place to detect light. In the specialized cells of the eye, detection of light occurs via rhodopsins (7-transmembrane GPCRs) and leads to neuronal activity and behavioral responses. However, other cells, including in plants, are also able to respond to changes in light intensity of certain wavelengths using the ancient, conserved cryptochrome proteins that are related to photolyases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fogle et al., 2015</xref>). This suggests that vital sensory modalities can be detected via multiple pathways. Our observations raise the question whether HDACs represent a conserved detection mechanism for odorants like diacetyl that link odor detection to a specific gene expression response. HDAC proteins, however, are an ancient family of genes that predate even histones themselves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gregoretti et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Postberg et al., 2010</xref>). It is conceivable that odor detection mechanisms that emerged in ancient forms may not have involved specialized transmembrane receptors, or neurons, or resulted in rapid behavioral movements.</p><p>Our data suggests that an HDAC inhibitory odorant also affects gene expression in the lungs and brain of mice, including significantly decreasing the expression level of the ACE2 receptor, whose ortholog in humans is the entry receptor for the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19. The applied impact for the future could be far-reaching as HDACs are known to affect a wide variety of pathways in eukaryotes, and inhibitors are candidates for novel inhaled therapeutics as treatment of many conditions such as COVID-19, cancers, neurodegeneration, and a variety of infectious diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Witt and Lindemann, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yeung et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Park et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cai et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Shankar and Srivastava, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Platta et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Komatsu et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>Our studies also show that one of the volatiles is protective against the neurodegenerative effects of Huntington’s disease model and neuroblastoma. Exposure to diacetyl volatiles in the fly model of Huntington’s disease reduces cell degeneration, as has been previously observed with orally administered HDAC inhibitors like sodium butyrate and SAHA in this genetic model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Steffan et al., 2001</xref>). Previous studies indicate that the inhibition of HDACs counters the acetyltransferase inhibitory activity of the polyglutamine-domain of the Htt protein, which binds to p300, P/CAF, and CBP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Steffan et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p>This newly discovered activity in this class of volatile chemicals will also allow us to understand how their presence in our environment, diet, and microbiome shapes the epigenetic landscape in the lungs and affects inflammation and immune responses. Our approach to investigate consequences in model systems allows for a foundation for future research and allow identification of key molecular biomarkers that can be associated with observation of epigenetic effects, toxic or not, in individuals. The public health impact of these findings can be far-reaching, both from the perspective of toxicity and therapeutics. Investigating the health safety concerns of exposure to such odorants at high doses or prolonged periods is essential to understand potential for damage. Conversely, at nontoxic concentrations, HDAC inhibitors can be used for the treatment of many debilitating conditions in the lungs such as COPD, inflammation, and COVID-19 infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Shakespear et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Taken together, our discovery that cells can alter gene expression in response to an odor that acts as an HDAC inhibitor and reprogram gene expression promises the pursuit of new types of odor-based therapeutics already approved for human consumption as prophylactics for a myriad of diseases. Simultaneously, they raise the concern of a new type of environmental agent that can reprogram gene expression and have widespread effects that are yet unknown.</p></sec><sec id="s4"

A total of 300 heads were collected for each sample and ground on liquid nitrogen. mRNA was extracted using a PolyATract kit (Promega) and was reverse transcribed using Superscript III (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The quality of the cDNA was assessed on a 1.5% agarose gel. cDNA was added to individual reactions of SYBR green master mix (Bio-Rad) and run on a Bio-Rad-MyQ thermocycler. The program began with a single cycle for 3 min at 95°C, followed by 40 cycles of 15 s at 95°C, 30 s at 58°C and 30 s at 72°C. Afterward, the PCR products were heated to 95°C for 1 min and cooled to 55°C for 1 min to measure the dissociation curves. The efficiency of each primer set was first validated by constructing a standard curve and three 10× serial dilutions of first-strand cDNA. For each serial dilution, the CT value was plotted against the log (template dilution) and the slope and r<sup>2</sup> value of each regression line calculated. Expression of each <italic>Or</italic> or <italic>Gr</italic> gene was assessed in triplicate. Dissociation curves were used to assess the purity of the PCR reactions. <italic>Or</italic> and <italic>Gr</italic> transcript levels were normalized by using the transcript levels of <italic>ribosomal protein 49</italic>.

The odorant was dissolved in 5 ml paraffin oil at 1% dilution. For a given exposure protocol, two groups of flies were prepared: those exposed to 1% diacetyl headspace and those exposed to paraffin oil headspace alone (control flies). Adult male flies aged 1 d were transferred to fly vials containing fresh medium and put into the container with the odor vial. At the end of the fifth day of exposure, flies were collected, and their antennae were dissected for RNA extraction. All treatments and experiments were performed at room temperature. For the recovery experiment, flies were transferred to a container with a glass vial of paraffin oil after 5 d of diacetyl exposure.

HDAC activity of class II HDACs (HDAC4 and HDAC6) were measured with the fluorometric HDAC Activity Assay kit: HDAC4, HDAC 4 (50064 and 50076, BPS Bioscience), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. HDAC activity in these 96-well format kits was directly correlated with fluorescence produced by the enzyme and substrate interaction. Each test compound was tested in duplicates, minimum. Due to interference, concentrations of &gt;30 mM were not used in the IC50 calculation. To account for any potential absorbance or fluorescence contributed by the test chemicals interacting with the assay substrate, all baseline background measurements of test compound + substrate control wells (everything, but no HDAC enzyme) were performed and subtracted against the respective test compound wells. It is fair to note that no significant changes in background fluorescence were seen with tested compounds in comparison to control background fluorescence.

Though the demonstration of diacetyl is novel, several similar molecules have been used before.</p></disp-quote><p>In this manuscript we are not trying to understand the mechanisms by which HDAC inhibitors affect Huntington’s disease or cancer, since these have either been studied in detail before and are outside the scope of this manuscript. Our focus is to demonstrate that volatile odorants commonly found in the environment can inhibit HDACs, alter gene expression, and have downstream physiological effects. To the best of our knowledge this unusual effect of odorants has not been systematically described before.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Sachiko et al. study presents strong evidence that implicates environmental volatile odorants, particularly diacetyl, in an alternate role as an inhibitors HDAC proteins and gene expression. HDACs are histone deacetylases that generally have repressive role in gene expression. In this paper the authors test the hypothesis that diacetyl, which is a compound emitted by rotting food sources, can diffuse through blood-brain-barrier and cell membranes to directly modulate HDAC activity to alter gene expression in a neural activity independent manner. This work is significant because the authors also link modulation of HDAC activity by diacetyl exposure to transcriptional and cellular responses to present it as a potential therapeutic agent for neurological diseases, such as inhibition of neuroblastoma and neurodegeneration.</p><p>The authors first demonstrate that exposure to diacetyl, and some other odorants, inhibits deacetylation activity of specific HDAC proteins using in vitro assays, and increases acetylation of specific histones in cultured cells. Consistent with a role for diacetyl in HDAC inhibition, the authors find dose dependent alterations in gene expression in different fly and mice tissues in response to diacetyl exposure. In flies they first identify a decrease in the expression of chemosensory receptors in olfactory neurons after exposure to diacetyl. Subsequently, they also observe large gene expression changes in the lungs, brain, and airways in mice. In flies, some of the gene expression changes in response to diacetyl are partially reversable and show an overlap with genes that alter expression in response to treatment with other HDAC inhibitors. Given the use of HDAC inhibitors as chemotherapy agents and treatment methods for cancers and neurodegenerative diseases, the authors hypothesize that diacetyl as an HDAC inhibitor can also serve similar functions. Indeed, they find that exposure of mice to diacetyl leads to a decrease in the brain expression of many genes normally upregulated in neuroblastomas, and selectively inhibited proliferation of cell lines which are driven from neuroblastomas. To test the potential for diacetyl in treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, the authors use the fly Huntington's disease model, utilizing the overexpression of Huntingtin protein with expanded poly-Q repeats in the photoreceptor rhabdomeres which leads to their degeneration.

Throughout the manuscript, the authors demonstrate gene expression differences in different tissues in flies and mice in response to exposure to diacetyl using both transgenic reporter expression and RNAseq. The authors mention they were able to show that these gene expression changes are independent of neural activity, yet I am not sure which experiment specifically demonstrates this. How do the authors know that these changes in gene expression are due to diacetyl reaching the brain after passing blood brain barrier but not due to changes in gene expression with olfactory circuit activity? I acknowledge that disproving that the gene expression differences are independent of neural activity, but one question is whether inhibiting neural activity result in changes in the expression of overlapping genes in the same direction. Or for example, if one inhibits neural activity in Gr21a neurons, do they reversibly shut down expression of the receptor after a few days? Is this true for other ORs or specific to Gr21a and Gr63a?</p></disp-quote><p>While it is difficult to completely rule out contributions of the olfactory effects in the brain, we also report differential gene expression in the lungs of mice where we do not expect olfactory circuit activity (Fig 3D-G). The overlap in DEGs is highly statistically significant between the organs suggesting at least some commonality in mechanism (Fig 5D). We recently evaluated a <italic>Drosophila</italic> tissue that does not express odorant receptors or connections, the ovaries, and also found substantial evidence of diacetyl-exposed modulation of genes. While the data are intended for a different publication, we found up to 123 up and 61 downregulated DEGs (FDR cutoff &lt;0.05 and log2 fold change cutoff of 1 and -1). These data should also be viewed together with the in vitro HDAC inhibition data and the increased histone acetylation seen in cell lines.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b. Is diacetyl detected by any chemosensory receptors in flies or mice? RNA profiles from these receptor mutants can be used to distinguish whether the gene expression changes are occurring due to neural activity or direct ability of diacetyl to alter HDAC activity. One relatively simple experiment would be to test whether differentially expressed genes in the orco mutant antennae overlap at all with antennal RNA profiles from diacetyl exposed flies.</p></disp-quote><p>Diacetyl can be detected by multiple chemosensory receptors in flies and mice. In flies the Gr21a+Gr63a complex expressing neurons are inhibited by diacetyl as indicated, and Or9a, Or43b, Or59b, Or67a, and Or85b are activated receptors (Hallem, Cell, 2006). It would be extremely resource and time-consuming process to create and evaluate single mutants or combinations of mutants as suggested. In response to the previous point, we noted examples of tissues without olfactory receptors or olfactory circuits showing DEGs upon diacetyl exposure.</p><p>As suggested by the referee, we compared DEGs from RNASeq data of Orco mutant antenna (N=2 replicates) generated for another project. There is very little overlap between antennal DEGs from Orco and the diacetyl (labelled chart as d4on_up and d4on_down) exposed flies. These data suggest that large-scale silencing of antennal neurons in Orco mutants do not alter expression of the same genes as altered by exposure to diacetyl.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-86823-sa2-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c. The comparison of DEGs from individuals exposed to diacetyl versus the other two HDAC inhibitors shows some overlap. The overlap is greater for DEGs shared between the two HDAC inhibitors. Yet, there is still a substantial number of genes that are unique to diacetyl exposure. For example, if you compare SB to VA exposure, each condition has about 150-200 genes uniquely misexpressed for each condition with about 55 genes shared. However, the number of uniquely misexpressed genes is over 600 for diacetyl exposed individuals, with only 30 and 100 genes shared with either SB and VA respectively. I would have expected a higher overlap in DEGs if these compounds all inhibit similar HDACs. Do they inhibit different HDACs? Can this explain the significant number of uniquely misexpressed genes in each condition?</p></disp-quote><p>It is difficult to judge significance of overlap in DEG sets the genome has around 13,000 genes from evaluating numbers without statistical analysis which we noted in the text. “A pairwise analysis using the Fisher’s exact test of each gene set revealed a statistically significant overlap of diacetyl-induced genes with SB-induced genes (p=6x10-11) and with VA-induced genes (p=2x10-65) (Figure 4F).”</p><p>We have also further clarified in the text “This highly significant overlap among upregulated genes lends further support to our model that diacetyl vapors act as an HDAC inhibitor in vivo. As expected, each of the 3 treatments also modulated a substantial number of unique genes (Figure 4G,H), suggesting that differences in delivery format (oral vs vapor delivery), molecular structure and inhibition profile across the repertoire of HDACs may contribute to differences in gene regulation.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>d. The authors show changes in RNA profiles in response to diacetyl exposure in different tissues and suggest that these are due to changes in histone acetylation without direct comparison of genes that show up or down regulation with acetylation patterns. They do show in the beginning that diacetyl inhibits HDAC function in vitro and in cell culture. Yet it is critical that they also show a general increase in acetylation levels within tissues profiled for RNA. Additional experiments profiling chromatin and histone acetylation patterns in the tissues where RNA is profiled from would strengthen the argument of the paper.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the referee’s suggestion and appreciate it. However, given the heterogeneity of the cell types and therefore histone marks in chromatin within the tissues that we analyzed, we estimate that it will require substantial effort to purify or enrich specific cell populations before performing Chip-Seq. Such studies will examine correlations between up- and down-regulated genes and histone acetylation pattens in cells in the future studies. This effort will require significant resources and time which we feel are outside the scope of this manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>e. The rhabdomere experiments might benefit from a negative control. Can the authors expose the flies to another volatile and show neurodegeneration is not affected?</p></disp-quote><p>We exposed the negative control group to headspace odorants of paraffin oil which is a mixture of hydrocarbons.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>f. The same is true for the initial HDAC activity profiles from Figure 1.
