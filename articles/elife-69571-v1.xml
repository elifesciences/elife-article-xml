heterogeneous tissue. Available approaches for engineering-targeted technologies for new neuron subtypes are low yield, involving intensive transgenic strain or virus screening. Here, we present Specific Nuclear-Anchored Independent Labeling (SNAIL), an improved virus-based strategy for cell labeling and nuclear isolation from heterogeneous tissue. SNAIL works by leveraging machine learning and other computational approaches to identify DNA sequence features that confer cell type-specific gene activation and then make a probe that drives an affinity purification-compatible reporter gene. As a proof of concept, we designed and validated two novel SNAIL probes that target parvalbumin-expressing (PV+) neurons. Nuclear isolation using SNAIL in wild-type mice is sufficient to capture characteristic open chromatin features of PV+ neurons in the cortex, striatum, and external globus pallidus. The SNAIL framework also has high utility for multispecies cell probe engineering; expression from a mouse PV+ SNAIL enhancer sequence was enriched in PV+ neurons of the macaque cortex. Expansion of this technology has broad applications in cell type-specific observation, manipulation, and therapeutics across species and disease models.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>parvalbumin neurons</kwd><kwd>neuron subtype isolation</kwd><kwd>cell type-specific enhancers</kwd><kwd>machine learning</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd>Rhesus macaque</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>UG3-MH-120094</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Stauffer</surname><given-names>William R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1DP1DA046585</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pfenning</surname><given-names>Andreas R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DGE1745016</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lawler</surname><given-names>Alyssa J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000026</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Drug Abuse</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1F30DA053020</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Phan</surname><given-names>BaDoi N</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000025</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MH096985</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fish</surname><given-names>Kenneth N</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A new cross-species machine learning-based strategy is applied to find enhancers that specifically label parvalbumin neurons in the mouse and macaque.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The biology of the brain is complicated by vast diversity in cell types, subtypes, and states. Contemporary advancements in single-cell sequencing have identified over a hundred molecularly distinct neuronal populations in the mammalian cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lake et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Saunders et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Tasic et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hodge et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Zeisel et al., 2015</xref>), including several small subpopulations of gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic neurons with specialized functions that are critical for the control of neuronal inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kepecs and Fishell, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lim et al., 2018</xref>). Understanding neurological function in health and disease from a cell type-specific perspective is critical to the progress of neuroscience.</p><p>Such endeavors necessitate cell type-specific technologies to identify, isolate, and manipulate discrete cell populations. Transgenic mouse strains targeting major inhibitory neuron subclasses, including parvalbumin-expressing (PV+), somatostatin-expressing (SST+), and serotonergic (5-HT+) neurons, are widely used today and have been instrumental toward our understanding of these cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Madisen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Taniguchi et al., 2011</xref>). More recently, many developers have turned toward scalable virus-based cell type-specific tools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dimidschstein et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hrvatin et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Nair et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Vormstein-Schneider et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Graybuck et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Mich et al., 2021</xref>). Adeno-associated virus (AAV) technologies became particularly attractive with the invention of AAV variants that cross the blood–brain barrier to transduce the central nervous system, AAV-PHP.B, and AAV-PHP.eB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Deverman et al., 2016</xref>). In line with certain transgenic engineering, an emerging AAV targeting strategy is to incorporate cell type-specific enhancer elements into the viral genome to promote restricted expression. Enhancer activity can be extremely selective, even more so than the activity of most genes and their associated promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hoffman et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kellis et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Roadmap Epigenomics Consortium et al., 2015</xref> <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://paperpile.com/c/Cz4BAw/XmeWT+4Y4qa+kW7dJ">2015)</ext-link>. Thus, enhancers may be used to confer specificity for neuron subtypes that cannot be resolved by the expression of a single marker gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Tasic et al., 2018</xref>) or for which the marker gene promoter is not specific on its own (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Nathanson et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Despite the enthusiasm for enhancer sequences in cell type-specific AAV development, their selection remains challenging. ATAC-seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Buenrostro et al., 2013</xref>) is an advantageous technique for defining potential cell type-specific enhancer regions because of its high nucleotide resolution and its compatibility with small cell populations and even with single-cell technologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Buenrostro et al., 2015b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cusanovich et al., 2015</xref>). Though convenient, chromatin accessibility is a noisy approximation for enhancer activity and differentially accessible sequence elements often fail to produce selective expression in vivo. A parallel screening approach involving single-nucleus sequencing of barcoded enhancer libraries, PESCA, was proposed to speed up the selection process toward a successful enhancer-driven virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hrvatin et al., 2019</xref>). Other approaches leveraged marker gene proximity and conservation across species for enhancer prioritization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Vormstein-Schneider et al., 2020</xref>). These efforts highlight the low conversion rate from experimentally suggested cell type-specific open chromatin regions (OCRs) to desired cell type-specific activity. We hypothesized that machine learning models could be applied as additional in silico filters to reduce the burden of experimental screening in cell type-specific AAV development while maintaining the convenience of ATAC-seq as the sole input data requirement.</p><p>The nucleotide sequence code that links transcription factor (TF) binding sites and other DNA features to enhancer activity is underutilized in AAV enhancer design, perhaps due to its complexity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jindal and Farley, 2021</xref>). We reasoned that machine learning classifiers could be leveraged to identify the most characteristic and specific enhancer sequence patterns for a cell population, enabling efficient prioritization of sequences that are likely to drive selective expression. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Le Cun et al., 1989</xref>) and support vector machines (SVMs), for example, have achieved state-of-the-art performance on predicting enhancer activity from sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arvey et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ghandi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Zhou and Troyanskaya, 2015</xref>). Here, we present a framework for machine learning-assisted engineering of cell type-specific AAVs, which we refer to as Specific Nuclear-Anchored Independent Labeling (SNAIL). Similar to our previously described Cre-activated AAV technology cSNAIL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lawler et al., 2020</xref>), SNAIL probes have the unique advantage of an affinity purification-compatible fluorescent reporter that can be used to isolate rare cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Mo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Deal and Henikoff, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lawler et al., 2020</xref>). Unlike cSNAIL, which relies on Cre activation, SNAIL probes are stand-alone AAVs driven by cell type-specific enhancer sequences selected through machine learning models. Thus, SNAIL probes may be used in a wide variety of systems, including wild-type mice, primates, and other species.</p><p>We used our framework to create two novel AAV probes for PV+ neurons. In the mouse primary motor cortex, PV+ SNAIL probes labeled PV+ neurons with &gt;70% specificity when compared to Pvalb antibody staining. PV+ SNAIL probes in this context were more specific to GABAergic PV+ neurons than the common Pvalb-2A-Cre/Ai14 mouse strain. In addition, isolated populations of tagged cells from the cortex, striatum, and external globus pallidus (GPe) were each heavily enriched for known PV+ open chromatin signatures. Nucleotide-resolution model interpretation highlighted a collection of 14 TF binding motif families contributing to PV+ neuron-specific enhancer activation. Machine learning can aid in cross-species probe design as well; at least one SNAIL probe showed PV+ neuron selectivity in both mouse and macaque. These results demonstrate concrete utility in sequence-level information for AAV enhancer selection, setting the stage for efficient probe design for a wide range of cell types.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>SVMs discriminate known cell type-specific regulatory sequences</title><p>We built machine learning classifiers, primarily SVMs, to discriminate sequences of differential OCRs between two cell populations. These models take 500 bp candidate enhancer DNA sequence strings as input and they output, for each sequence, the cell type in which that candidate enhancer is active and an associated score. The similarity between sequences is determined based on gapped k-mer count vectors, that is, the number of occurrences of all short subsequences of length k, tolerating some gaps or mismatches, as implemented by LS-GKM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ghandi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lee, 2016</xref>). Where there are sufficient reliable sequence features associated with differential enhancer activation between two cell types, the model should learn these principles during the training phase and then be able to apply these principles to determine the cell type-specific activities of new sequences. We imposed upfront that training sequences have a minimum fold difference in chromatin accessibility between the two cell types used to define the classes. This should help the model learn cell type-specific features of enhancer activation rather than general enhancer features. We chose this strategy because it closely aligned with our goal of prioritizing sequences that would activate enhancers in one cell type and not others.</p><p>To evaluate this strategy, we first built SVMs comparing select broad classes of cell types in the brain using publicly available single-nucleus (sn)ATAC-seq data from the mouse motor cortex (Mop) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Li et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). These were (i) a neuron vs. astrocyte classifier and (ii) an excitatory neuron vs. inhibitory neuron classifier. To assess model performance, we used standard classifier metrics, the area under the receiver operator curve (auROC), and the area under the precision-recall curve (auPRC). These scores quantify model performance by comparing the predicted class to the actual class, where a randomly guessing binary classifier would have an auROC score of 0.5 and an auPRC score equal to the fraction of actual positives in the data, and a perfect classifier would have a maximum auROC score of 1.0 and auPRC score of 1.0. Both models performed well on held-out data, achieving auROCs of 0.95 and 0.93 and auPRCs of 0.98 and 0.82 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>Although the models were built for enhancer sequences, they recapitulated known cell type-specific activation patterns of some commonly used AAV promoter sequences: <italic>Gfap</italic>, <italic>Camk2a</italic>, and <italic>Dlx</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). The <italic>Gfap</italic> promoter sequence, which has a heavy astrocyte bias in vivo, was classified as astrocyte-specific in our neuron vs. astrocyte model (5580 astrocyte-specific enhancers evaluated; <italic>Gfap</italic> ranks 3298/5580). The same neuron vs. astrocyte model scored the <italic>Camk2a</italic> promoter and <italic>Dlx</italic> promoter sequences, which are known to have neuron-specific activity, as neuron-specific (14,347 neuron-specific enhancers evaluated; <italic>Camk2a</italic> = rank 13,300/14,347, Dlx = rank 9736/14,347). Also consistent with empirical expectations, the excitatory vs. inhibitory neuron model predicted the <italic>Camk2a</italic> sequence to have an excitatory neuron preference and the <italic>Dlx</italic> sequence to have an inhibitory neuron preference (15,391 excitatory neuron-specific enhancers evaluated; <italic>Camk2a</italic> = rank 11,541; 4,608 inhibitory neuron-specific enhancers tested; Dlx = rank 1142/4608) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Therefore, this classification strategy is capable of correctly predicting cell type-specific regulatory sequence activity in the viral context for these very distinct cell classes.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Machine learning models accurately predict PV+ neuron-specific open chromatin from sequence</title><p>Next, we assessed whether the same modeling strategy could be applied to more narrowly defined neuron subtypes, using PV+ neurons as a target. Again, we trained binary classifiers on sequences underlying differential ATAC-seq peaks between two cell populations (PV+ neurons and another population). To maximize sequence signal detection, we built several models comparing PV+ neurons to either PV- cells generally, excitatory neurons, VIP+ neurons, or SST+ neurons. In addition, we varied the input data source to be either ‘population-derived’ (from bulk ATAC-seq sequencing on purified nuclei populations) or ‘sn-derived’ (from single-nucleus open chromatin assays such as droplet-based snATAC-seq). Finally, we implemented multiple modeling strategies, including linear gapped k-mer SVMs, nonlinear gapped k-mer SVMs using the radial basis function (rbf), and CNNs. The ratios of positive and negative examples during training ranged from 1:0.4 to 1:3.7.

Therefore, purified populations from these mice are a direct reflection of cells labeled by the Pvalb-2A-Cre mouse strain, a current standard for PV+ neuron labeling.

To address this issue, we trained additional population-derived SVMs that directly discriminated between enhancer sequences of PV+ neurons and other neuron subtypes using publicly available ATAC-seq data from INTACT-sorted excitatory (EXC) neurons and VIP+ neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Mo et al., 2015</xref>). These models performed well (auROC = 0.89–0.93, auPRC = 0.79–0.92; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b and c</xref>), demonstrating that, even at the level of neuron subtypes, OCR sequence information is rich enough to reliably distinguish cell type-specific activity.</p><p>To survey an additional machine learning strategy, we built CNN classifiers from the same underlying data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). CNNs are a type of artificial neural network defined by multiple convolutional layers. The CNNs were trained to take in 1000 bp DNA sequence strings with different accessibility between two cell types, automatically extract predictive sequence features, and output a cell class probability between 0 and 1 (see Materials and methods for details). Compared with SVMs, CNNs are better equipped to learn higher-order interactions between sequence features due to CNNs’ capacity for flexible feature representation and automated feature selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Le Cun et al., 1989</xref>). The CNNs were highly accurate (auROC = 0.95–0.96, auPRC = 0.76–0.97; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). Thus, CNNs represent an additional successful approach to discriminate OCR sequence differences between purified neuron populations.</p><p>While ATAC-seq from purified cell populations is advantageous for its depth and recovers many examples of differentially accessible reads between neuron subtypes, many neuron populations of interest are not yet isolatable, even through transgenic means. Single-nucleus sequencing technologies can be applied to measure neuron subtype-resolution open chromatin without cell sorting by performing several parallel microreactions that introduce unique cell barcodes into ATAC-seq sequencing reads and then clustering the cells with similar chromatin profiles. We explored whether cell type-specific enhancer sequences derived from mouse motor cortex snATAC-seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Li et al., 2021</xref>) were sufficient to produce neuron subtype-level classifiers. We trained five pairwise linear gapped k-mer SVMs to discriminate differential open chromatin sequences from snATAC-seq clusters or groups of clusters. These included analogous models to the population-derived models comparing PV+ vs. PV-, PV+ vs. EXC, and PV+ vs. VIP+. In this case, the single-nucleus-derived PV+ vs. PV- model refers to a model trained on differential OCR sequences comparing PV+ cluster nuclei to all other nuclei with a random sampling probability. The PV+ vs. k-nearest-neighbor (KNN) model is an additional variation on the PV+ vs. PV- model where the PV- nuclei sampling for differential OCR analysis was selected for similarity to the PV+ cluster as implemented in SnapATAC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fang et al., 2021</xref>). We also produced a model comparing PV+ vs. SST+ neurons, the most similar subtype to PV+. Single-nucleus-derived SVMs were also able to classify cell type-specific enhancer sequences with high accuracy (auROC = 0.89–0.93, auPRC = 0.72–0.92; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>).</p><p>Moreover, models built independently from different data sources identified similar sequence contributions for equivalent tasks. When scoring the population-derived sequences through both the population-derived SVMs and the single-nucleus-derived SVMs, individual sequences had highly similar scores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>). These findings highlight the prevalence of reliable cell type-specific enhancer sequence signatures that can be defined by a variety of classifier types and sources of open chromatin measurements.

Importantly, the enhancer sequence from the probe with the lowest PV+ specificity (E4; 14% specificity) received a negative score from every model, and two of the enhancer sequences with highest cortical PV+ specificity (E22 and E29; 94% specificity) received high positive scores from every model (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata3">Figure 1—source data 3</xref>).</p><p>We binarized PV+ enhancer AAV sequences E1–E34 into either the high-specificity (&gt;70%) or low-specificity (&lt;70%) group and assessed the relationships between these groups and ATAC-seq log2 fold difference or SVM score (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>). These groups had little variation in mammalian nucleotide sequence conservation levels measured by PhyloP, but many of the sequences with highly confidently predicted PV+-specific accessibility had PV+ accessibility in humans (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5b</xref>). On the complete set of enhancers, SVM score was predictive of the PV+ specificity group (p=0.008), and differential activity log2 fold difference had a weak association with PV+ specificity group (p=0.069) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5c</xref>). Much of the log2 fold difference association with group PV+ specificity was driven by enhancer sequences with low log2 fold difference and low PV+ specificity. Undesirably, there were some sequences with high log2 fold difference and low in vivo specificity. Within the subset of enhancers with high log2 fold difference (log2 fold difference &gt; 1), the log2 fold difference was not associated with specificity group (p=0.601), while SVM score was weakly associated (p=0.057) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5d</xref>). Unlike log2 fold difference scores alone, SVM scores may limit false-positive candidates and improve efficient enhancer AAV selection.</p><p>This result emphasizes the benefit of enhancer pre-selection with machine learning, which could reduce in vivo screening efforts by identifying the best PV+ enhancer sequences before experimentation.

They also carry information about precisely which subsequences were responsible for the predicted PV+ neuron-specific activation.

Ideally then, ATAC-seq from Sun1GFP-sorted cells from SNAIL probes in wild-type mice should provide similar information as ATAC-seq from Sun1GFP-sorted cells from cSNAIL in Pvalb-2A-Cre transgenic mice. Therefore, we defined PV+ cSNAIL ATAC-seq log2FoldDifference over bulk cortical tissue ATAC-seq as a gold standard for each OCR. For SC1 and SC2, we computed the correlations between the log2FoldDifference of OCR signal relative to bulk tissue and the log2FoldDifference of OCR signal in PV+ cSNAIL relative to bulk tissue. To establish an upper limit for correlation, we compared two different batches of cortical PV+ cSNAIL samples, which had a Pearson correlation of 0.86 and a Spearman correlation of 0.85. As a lower limit, we evaluated the nonspecific <italic>Ef1a</italic> control virus, which had a Pearson correlation of 0.38 and a Spearman correlation of 0.26. Because the AAV-PHP.eB capsid has a neuron bias, these lowly correlated signatures are likely to be general neuron specifications shared among PV+ and other neurons. Within this range, SC1 and SC2 had very high correlation with cSNAIL, with SC1 achieving almost equivalent correlation as the two cSNAIL batches (SC1 Pearson = 0.85 and Spearman = 0.84; SC2 Pearson = 0.81 and Spearman = 0.79) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>).

We defined cluster-specific OCRs for each snATAC-seq cluster and population-enriched OCRs for SNAIL-isolated cells relative to bulk tissue (see Materials and methods) and assessed the overlaps. We found that cSNAIL-isolated PV+ OCRs, SC1-isolated OCRs, and SC2-isolated OCRs were each significantly enriched for PV+ cluster-specific markers (34–47% overlap, hypergeometric p=0), while OCRs from <italic>Ef1a</italic>-isolated cells were not enriched for PV+ cluster-specific markers (4% overlap, p=1). <italic>Ef1a</italic> OCRs instead had the highest enrichment for markers of a layer 4 excitatory neuron cluster (25% overlap, p=5.3 × 10<sup>–5</sup>). We also note that cSNAIL PV+ ATAC-seq had an additional 8% overlap with excitatory cluster L5 PT markers (p=2.5 × 10<sup>–45</sup>), possibly reflective of Pvalb-2A-Cre line labeling in layer 5 parvalbumin-expressing excitatory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Tanahira et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jinno and Kosaka, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Roccaro-Waldmeyer et al., 2018</xref>).

In fact, SC1 and SC2 had no enrichment for cluster-specific OCRs of any cluster other than PV+ (≤2% overlap, p&gt;0.1), including the closely related SST+ neuron population. This suggests that SC1 and SC2 SNAIL probes target a stricter subset of the cells than the Pvalb-2A-Cre mouse strain, likely restricted to PV+inhibitory interneurons.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Chromatin accessibility differences between PV+ neurons in different brain regions</title><p>SC1 and SC2 SNAIL probes were designed based on the sequence properties of cortical PV+ neurons.

Here, we assessed whether SC1 and SC2 SNAIL probes, designed in the cortex, were also selective for PV+ neurons in the striatum and GPe. First, we used cSNAIL ATAC-seq data from the striatum and GPe to model the regulatory sequence properties of PV+ neurons vs. PV- cells in these brain regions, using the population-derived linear SVM strategy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). We assessed the correlation between the score outputs of the cortex PV+ vs. PV- SVM with the striatum PV+ vs. PV- or GPe PV+ vs. PV- SVMs for our set of experimentally identified mouse cortical PV+ neuron enhancers sequences. Enhancer scores were well correlated between the cortex and striatum models (Pearson = 0.73, Spearman = 0.72), indicating shared regulatory sequence determinants between PV+ neurons in the cortex and striatum. There was a low correlation between enhancer scores of the cortex and GPe models (Pearson = 0.25, Spearman = 0.24), indicating differences in the learned PV+ regulatory sequence properties in these regions. SC1 and SC2 sequences were predicted to have PV+-specific activation in both the striatum and GPe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c and f</xref>). However, there were between 1000 and 3000 sequences with more confident PV+ scores than SC1 and SC2 in the striatum and GPe.</p><p>We proceeded to isolate SC1- and SC2-labeled cells from these tissues in wild-type mice using Sun1GFP affinity purification and performed ATAC-seq on the tagged populations. We have previously shown high agreement between cSNAIL and Pvalb-2A-Cre labeling in the striatum and GPe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lawler et al., 2020</xref>), so we again used cSNAIL ATAC-seq samples from these regions as true PV+ neuron signals. By principal component analysis (PCA), we recovered separation between PV+ samples, including SC1- and SC2-isolated populations, and PV- samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d and g</xref>). We assessed the correlations between log2FoldDifference in SNAIL and cSNAIL samples, each relative to bulk tissue (striatum) or, where there were no bulk samples available, cSNAIL PV- cells (GPe) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4e and h</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata4">Figure 4—source data 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata5">Figure 4—source data 5</xref>). Pearson correlation coefficients were similar or slightly lower for SC1 and SC2 in the striatum and GPe than for equivalent comparisons in the cortex, indicating less conservation between cSNAIL and SNAIL probe targets (SC1 cortex = 0.85, striatum = 0.71, GPe = 0.68; SC2 cortex = 0.81, striatum = 0.82, GPe = 0.73). Still, these were substantially increased over <italic>Ef1a</italic> correlation with cSNAIL in these tissues, especially for the striatum (<italic>Ef1a</italic> cortex = 0.38, striatum = 0.18, GPe = 0.51).</p><p>Finally, by comparing the peak overlaps of SC1 and SC2-enriched OCRs in striatum and GPe with cortical snATAC-seq cluster-specific OCRs, we still identified the PV+ cluster as most similar to SC1 and SC2 cells. As expected, all overlaps in striatum-cortex and GPe-cortex comparisons were lower than those from cortex-cortex comparisons, but the magnitudes of SC1 and SC2 overlapped with the Pvalb cluster in these brain regions were similar to the magnitudes of cSNAIL PV+ overlap with the Pvalb cluster in these brain regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). In the striatum, the overlaps with the Pvalb cluster were 8% for SC1, 14% for SC2, and 14% for cSNAIL. In the GPe, the overlaps with the Pvalb cluster were 7% for SC1, 7% for SC2, and 9% for cSNAIL. From these interpretations, SC1 and SC2 SNAIL viruses seem to generalize to the striatum and GPe, though they may not be as robust as they are within the cortical context. Additional experimental evidence may be necessary to confirm the appropriateness of PV+ SNAIL viruses for certain applications outside the cortex.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Esrrg and Mef2 motifs are important for the PV+ neuron-specific activity score of SC1 and SC2 sequences</title><p>To interpret the specific sequence patterns within SC1 and SC2 that contribute to their PV+ neuron-specific activity prediction, we assessed commonly used motifs for each model and identified potential matches within the candidate sequences.

With the SNAIL framework, we identified and validated two novel enhancers that drive targeted expression in PV+ neurons in the mouse cortex. While these do not represent enough trials to establish a new conversion rate from cell type-specific OCRs to cell type-specific AAVs, we were encouraged by the immediate success of the first probes we selected. We believe that the incorporation of differential sequence property analyses will continue to improve the throughput of targeted AAV development in new contexts and make cell type-specific enhancer tool development accessible for more researchers.</p><p>An additional advantage of incorporating classifiers for cell type-specific enhancer selection is increased interpretability of the factors that govern success. The sequence patterns learned by PV+ models reflected known PV+ neuron biology. Common motifs contributing to successful PV+ probe enhancers included Esrrg, Mef2, and Lhx6, important for the specification and maintenance of the cortical PV+ interneuron lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Zhao et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Mayer et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Liodis et al., 2007</xref>). It is interesting to note the varying expression patterns of these TFs. In the cortex, Esrrg expression is mainly restricted to PV+ neurons and Lhx6 is restricted to MGE interneurons, but Mef2 transcripts are widely expressed in many inhibitory and excitatory neurons. It is likely that combinatorial interactions between abundant and cell type-specific TF binding events specify PV+ neuron enhancer activation. The SNAIL framework provides an opportunity to meaningfully leverage these complex sequence codes.</p><p>We found that a combination of multiple direct comparisons between the target cell type and other cell types made for particularly useful screening. Here, we used a tiered approach to ensure specific activity at multiple levels of cellular relationships to PV+ neurons. At the broadest level, we modeled PV+ neuron OCR sequences against PV- OCRs, a mixed signature from all other neuron and non-neuron cell types in the mouse cortex. Within neurons, we modeled PV+ vs. EXC neurons, and then PV+ relative to more specific subtypes of inhibitory neurons VIP+ and SST+. Successful SC1 and SC2 sequences contained attributes that made them highly PV+ specific across these comparisons.</p><p>SC1-Sun1GFP and SC2-Sun1GFP are new AAV technologies for PV+ neuron labeling and isolation in diverse systems. A unique feature of these viruses is the modified Sun1GFP tag that enables nuclei purification by magnetic beads coated with anti-GFP antibodies. This process is advantageous for isolating genomic and epigenomic signals from the population of interest with no dependence on transgenic strains. In comparison to single-nucleus sequencing technologies, affinity purification with SNAIL is more efficient for addressing targeted hypotheses about a specific cell type. SNAIL may also be paired with single-nucleus sequencing technologies for unprecedented resolution of the substructures within minority cell populations. We took advantage of SNAIL affinity purification to isolate SC1-Sun1GFP and SC2-Sun1GFP nuclei for molecular assessment with ATAC-seq. This represents a novel approach for validating new cell type-specific AAVs. We found that SC1 and SC2 PV+ SNAIL probes had high molecular agreement with cells tagged in the Pvalb-2A-Cre mouse strain, making them a reasonable alternative to transgenic strain technology. In addition to their success in the intended brain region (cortex), SC1 and SC2 PV+ SNAIL viruses also generalized to subcortical regions, the striatum, and GPe enough to isolate PV+ ATAC-seq signal. Moreover, the SC1 enhancer has sequence characteristics consistent with primate PV+-specific activation and has biased expression in PV+ neurons in the macaque brain. It will be interesting to conduct further comparisons of the composition of cell populations that are labeled by these tools in different brain regions and species. We speculate that the SNAIL framework could be strategically employed to design tools for specific subtypes of PV+ neurons or other cell populations that may be brain region or species specific.</p><p>In general, pairing cell type-specific enhancers with AAVs provides much more flexibility and scalability than transgenic technologies. However, there are drawbacks to certain applications. AAVs require time to reach peak expression, usually 2–4 weeks, although some may be robust earlier. This means they are not appropriate for developmental studies in very young animals. These and other developmental time points outside of the scope of the training data may have unintended effects on enhancer expression and specificity. Additionally, there are limitations to the transduction efficiency, so AAVs may not be ideal for studies where it is important to label all cells of a certain type. Finally, an enhancer’s activity in AAV may differ from the same enhancer’s activity in the host genome due to the surrounding genomic and epigenomic context. Enhancer activity may also fluctuate in response to different conditions because enhancers are dynamic actors in the regulation of gene expression. However, machine learning model-based prioritization of characteristic sequences may minimize this risk.</p><p>Excitingly, there are many opportunities for extensions of the SNAIL framework that enable cell type-specific interrogation in unprecedented settings. In a direct application that we began to explore in this work, SNAIL probes could be used to isolate cell types of interest in diverse species. High evolutionary conservation in the rules for enhancer activity has been demonstrated by the success of machine learning models in predicting enhancers across mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Minnoye et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kelley, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kaplow et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2018</xref>). Models trained across multiple species could further improve the transferability of probes across species. For example, a new approach that explicitly encourages the model not to learn signatures of species-specific enhancer activity might be especially promising for designing cross-species SNAIL probes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cochran et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Beyond the potential ability for cross-species probe design, the SNAIL framework provides the opportunity to develop viral tools targeting previously unexplored cell types that are identifiable in snATAC-seq both within and across species. There is potential to divide subpopulations at multiple levels and design extremely specific technologies, including specialization for neuron populations within a specific brain region. Other applications may exploit changes in enhancer sequence activity in disease and other contexts to target specific cell states. In addition to creating cell type-specific enhancers to isolate cell types of interest, machine learning model-selected enhancer sequences may be used to drive the expression of a gene for cell type-specific circuit manipulation, as has been achieved with channelrhodopsin and DREADDS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lee et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Vormstein-Schneider et al., 2020</xref>). This approach could also be used to overexpress a particular ion channel, neurotransmitter receptor, gene variant, or guide RNA for a CRISPR-based gene manipulation strategy. We anticipate that SNAIL will provide a foundation for using sequence signatures underlying cell type-specific enhancer activity to develop tools for understanding cell type-specific function of a variety of cell types in diverse contexts.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Pvalb-2A-Cre</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Jackson Laboratories</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Stock #

We removed bins overlapping with the ENCODE blacklist, mitochondrial regions, and the top 5% of bins that overlapped with invariant features. We reduced dimensionality and selected 18 significant components. We used these to correct for batch effects with Harmony (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Korsunsky et al., 2019</xref>).

Because ATAC-seq summit regions are highly enriched for TF binding motifs, we centered on the peak summits within differential ATAC-seq OCRs and extended in both directions for a total fixed sequence length of 500 bp, a convenient length for AAV cloning. Peak summits were defined by MACS2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>), and only summit regions of peaks called within the cell type of interest were retained. For data from sorted cells, we used optimal IDR peaks across biological replicates of the given cell type. For example, in a PV+ vs. VIP+ model comparison, the positive model input examples were 500 bp summit-centered regions of PV+ IDR peaks that overlapped PV+-specific differential OCRs and the negative model input examples were 500 bp summit-centered regions of VIP+ neuron IDR peaks that overlapped VIP+ neuron-specific differential OCRs. For snATAC-seq data, we used peaks called within a cluster to define the relevant summit regions. If multiple cell clusters were involved in the comparison, for example, the excitatory neuron vs. inhibitory neuron model, we used summits found in any peak set from a cluster within that category. In cases where there were multiple summits within a differential OCR, all summits greater than 100 bp apart from each other were retained.</p><p>After defining the genomic locations of the summit-centered differential OCRs, we did additional filtering to finish preparing the data for model training. First, we restricted the data to enhancer regions because they usually have more cell type specificity than promoters and may be governed by different sequence properties. Therefore, we filtered out regions that were within 2000 bp of a TSS using RefSeq annotations downloaded from the UCSC Table browser in July 2020 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kuhn et al., 2013</xref>). Next, for mouse models, we removed super-enhancers because they also may be governed by different sequence features and are not useful for AAV probe design because they are too large. We downloaded mm9 coordinates of mouse cortex super enhancers defined by H3K27ac from the dbSuper database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Khan and Zhang, 2016</xref>) and converted these to mm10 coordinates using UCSC liftOver with minmatch = 0.95 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kuhn et al., 2013</xref>). Using bedtools intersect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Quinlan and Hall, 2010</xref>), we removed regions with any super-enhancer overlap. Finally, we used bedtools getfasta (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Quinlan and Hall, 2010</xref>) to retrieve the sequences at these genomic coordinates from the mm10 assembly downloaded from UCSC genome browser in May 2018 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kuhn et al., 2013</xref>) or the hg38 genome assembly GCA_000001405.27 downloaded from NCBI, and we removed any sequences that contained uncertain bases (Ns).</p></sec><sec id="s4-17"><title>SVM model construction</title><p>We divided sequences into separate partitions by chromosome for model training, validation, and final testing. For mouse models, the training sets included chromosomes 3–7, 10–19, and X, the validation sets included chromosomes 8 and 9, and the test sets included chromosomes 1 and 2. For human models, the training sets included chromosomes 3–7, 10–22, and X, the validation sets included chromosomes 8 and 9, and the test sets included chromosomes 1 and 2. We input the training data into LS-GKM’s gkmtrain, and we evaluated model performance with gkmpredict (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lee, 2016</xref>). Because the input data was summit-centered, all models used the center-weighted gkm kernel, option -t 4, or the center weighted gkm rbf kernel, option -t 5. We tuned the -l, -k, -d, -c, and -w parameters for word length, number of informative columns, number of mismatches to consider, regularization, and class-weighted regularization, respectively, to maximize the validation set F1 scores. We used default values for other parameters. We calculated auROC and auPRC metrics and visualized on training, validation, and test sets using the ROCR package in R (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ipa-tys.github.io/ROCR/">http://ipa-tys.github.io/ROCR/</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Sing et al., 2020</xref>).

We used PV+ and PV- neuron ATAC-seq samples generated in this study as well as PV+, VIP+, and EXC neuron ATAC-seq samples from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Mo et al., 2015</xref>. To conduct differential accessibility analysis, we obtained genomic coordinates of all 200 bp bins in the mm10 reference genome, starting from the 200 bp bin at the beginning of each chromosome and including all following contiguous nonoverlapping 200 bp bins. We then filtered out any bin that overlaps with an artifact region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amemiya et al., 2019</xref>) or with regions that have unknown nucleotides (obtained from the UCSC twoBitInfo utility using the -nBed option). During this step, regions near the ends of chromosomes were filtered out. Then, using the featureCounts function in the subread package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Liao et al., 2014</xref>), we counted the reads mapping to each of the 200 bp bins in the ATAC-seq samples obtained from every included ATAC-seq sample. We then use the DESeq2 R package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Love et al., 2014</xref>) to identify bins that were differentially accessible between (i) PV+ and PV-, (ii) PV+ and VIP+, and (iii) PV+ and EXC neurons at a Benjamini–Hochberg FDR-adjusted p-value cutoff of 0.01. For each of the three comparisons, significant differential bins that displayed PV+ specificity (log2FoldDifference &gt; 0) were used as positive examples for CNN training and significant differential bins that displayed negative log2FoldDifference (log2FoldDifference &lt; 0) were used as negative examples for CNN training.</p></sec><sec id="s4-19"><title>CNN model construction</title><p>We trained three separate CNN models that relate sequence to comparative regulatory activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Zhou and Troyanskaya, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kelley et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Quang and Xie, 2016</xref>). For each significant differential 200 bp bin, we obtained the 1000 bp sequence surrounding the center of the bin from the mm10 reference genome and trained the CNN to predict the positive or negative class label. We held out sequence examples underlying all significant differential bins on chromosome 4 as a validation set to evaluate hyperparameter settings and to choose the best performing final model. We also held out sequence examples underlying all significant differential bins on chromosomes 8 and 9 as a test set for final evaluation. Because we had different validation and test sets from those used for the SVM, we did not use any results from the SVM to influence our approach to designing the CNN architecture or any other aspects of CNN training. We implemented our CNN model in Keras 2.2.4 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://keras.io/">https://keras.io/</ext-link>) with a theano backend (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Al-Rfou et al., 2016</xref>). We created a one-hot encoded representation of the sequence, a 4 × 1000 binary matrix representing positions and occurrences of the 4 nucleotide characters (A,T,G and C) on the sequence, which was propagated through the network. Our CNN architecture consisted of multiple layers of convolution kernels stacked on top of each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). The first such layer consisted of 1000 convolution kernels, each with a kernel width of 8 and height of 4, which scan the input sequence in chunks of 8 nucleotides. We applied rectified linear unit (ReLu) activations on the outputs of these convolution kernels. This initial layer is followed by a variable number of convolution layers with the same number of kernels (100), each of width 8 and height 1. We applied ReLu activations on these convolution outputs as well. These convolution layers are then followed by a set of max pooling operations that selects the maximum value from a set of 13 adjacent units (pooling size = 13). We set the stride for the max pooling operation to 13 units, meaning that it selected the maximum values from contiguous chunks of 13 adjacent outputs from the previous layer. We applied dropout regularization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Srivastava et al., 2014</xref>) on the outputs of the max pooling operation to prevent overfitting to the training set. We then flattened the outputs of the max pooling layer into a single vector and passed them to a single output unit with a sigmoid activation function. We used stochastic gradient descent (SGD) to minimize binary cross-entropy loss (log loss) between the output of this unit and the positive/negative class label to learn model parameters.</p><p>Each model was trained for 100 passes through the training set (or ‘epochs’). For the PV+ vs. PV- and the PV+ vs. VIP+ tasks, we evaluated model performance and chose the best performing model based on the value of the binary cross-entropy loss on the validation set. For the PV+ vs. EXC task, we chose the final model based on a combination of auROC and auPRC on the validation set. We ignored small differences in validation auROC and auPRC (± 0.02) while selecting the final PV+ vs. EXC model. Tuning only the number of variable convolution layers (0, 1, or 2), and the dropout probability for the max pooling output (0.2, 0.4, or 0.5), we were able to achieve strong auROCs and auPRCs on the held-out validation sets. Therefore, we did not attempt to vary learning rate for SGD (0.01), momentum (0.0), batch size (30), number of training epochs (100), number of filters in the first convolution layer (1000), number of filters in subsequent convolution layers (100), kernel sizes (8), max pooling size (13), and stride (13).

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Jeremy J Day as Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Naama Barkai as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Cliff Kentros (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) To expand on the overall applicability of the cSNAIL approach, it would be useful to determine whether identified PV-specific sequences using this approach extend to ATAC-seq signal from PV neurons in other species. Showing this would also help to generate confidence that the selected AAV sequences can drive expression in PV neurons in other systems. At a minimum, it would be important to demonstrating the accessibility of the machine-learning identified enhancer sets studied here in publicly available snATAC-seq datasets from other brain regions and in other species. This addition would go a long way to indicating the ability to generalize this approach, which is important for a resource manuscript like this.</p><p>2) In many cases, the computational approaches are not fully described and may introduce confusion for a more general readership. It would be useful for descriptions of what each model actually does to be incorporated into the manuscript.</p><p>3) Points raised by all reviewers regarding technical and interpretational clarifications should be addressed in a revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. The introduction is a bit lengthy, and may be improved by efforts to consolidate the last three paragraphs.</p><p>2. It is encouraging that population-derived SVMs and single nucleus-derived SVMs arrive at similar conclusions with respect to selected sequences (Figure 1F). However, if I understand correctly all of this data is from mouse cortex. To extend the applicability of this approach, it would be useful to determine whether identified PV-specific sequences using this approach extend to ATAC-seq signal from PV neurons in other species. Showing this would also help to generate confidence that the selected AAV sequences can drive expression in PV neurons in other systems (thereby significantly expanding the applicability of this tool beyond the mouse).</p><p>3. Similar to the above comment, the extension of this approach to other brain regions will largely drive the application of this technology by other groups. While Figure 4 shows data demonstrating that the predictions generated from mouse cortex may hold for mouse striatum and GPe (although not as well as cortex), this claim is only tested using ATAC-seq. This claim could be strengthened by the addition of co-labelling evidence (as in Figure 2 for cortex) that targeted SUN-GFP cells are also PV+.</p><p>4. The text identifies Err3 and <italic>Mef2</italic> motifs as being important for the PV-specific activity of SC1 and SC2 sequences. However, without additional experimental evidence demonstrating that loss or mutation of these motifs abolishes the PV-specific expression pattern of these sequences, this conclusion should be moderated.</p><p>5. Other reports using open chromatin profiling to identify enhancers for transgene expression in AAV have recently been published (PMID 33789083, 33789096). While these reports are cited here, the Discussion section of this manuscript would benefit from a more systematic comparison of these approaches with the current approach.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1) Twice the authors compare the PV specificity of their viral vectors to that achieved with the Pvalb-2A-Cre mouse (line 91, line 271), however no data or references are cited to explain what data the authors are comparing from the mouse strain. Published studies using Cre-dependent viruses in adult Pvalb-2A-Cre show excellent specificity for expressing in PV+ neurons, it is when the strain is crossed to other transgenic reporter mice (like the original Ai14 mouse in the Madisen et al., paper) that there is expression outside the PV+ population in the adult brain. This may not reflect Cre expression outside the PV+ population as much as it reflects Pvalb gene activation during development in cells beyond the highly PV+ population of the adult. Therefore, the authors need to clarify what data from the Pvalb-2A-Cre mice to which they are comparing.</p><p>2) in Line 275-276, and Figures 2d-e, the authors state that their PV derived enhancer vectors have a 9-fold increase in PV specificity over the negative control. However, the negative control vector has no promoter and thus should really have no expression (there is certainly exceptionally little expression in Figure 2C in the right hand most panel). If the image is truly representative, then it seems that the authors probably have too few expressing cells to say much that is meaningful in a quantitative way about the specificity of that negative control.</p><p>3) In line 338 the authors use their motif analysis to suggest a distinction in the <italic>MEF2</italic> family members that may control the differentiation of different inhibitory cell types. However, to my knowledge there is no rigorous experimental identification of distinct MEF2A versus MEF2C versus MEF2D binding sites (if the authors are aware of a validated study this reference would be good to add). The slight variations in the motifs in the databases interrogated here may rather reflect differences in the methods of the groups that deposited the motifs. The authors would benefit the field to think broadly about their interpretation of these variations in motif enrichment and what they might mean.</p><p>4) As to the evidence that MEF2C is required for the PV+ interneuron lineage, what the Mayer 2018 paper actually showed is that conditional knockout of MEF2C in PV+ lineage cells (with Dlx6-Cre) led to loss of PV expression in the adult cortex. However, whether this is loss of PV expression, versus failure of PV cells to develop, was not addressed. The authors should adjust their language here to account for that uncertainty. It is also important that the Mayer study settled on MEF2C because it was more highly expressed in PV interneurons compared with other interneurons (esp. SST interneurons). However, MEF2C is highly expressed in many classes of excitatory neurons especially during development but also in the adult brain. Therefore, MEF2C alone cannot explain cell type specific enhancer function except in collaboration with other cell type specific transcription factors.</p><p>5) In Line 351 the authors highlight the association of open chromatin near BDNF especially at promoter IV. However, this is somewhat surprising, given that BDNF is really not expressed in interneurons (see PMID 24855953). This example highlights that the authors need to consider the possibility that not every region of differentially open chromatin reflects enhancers – these may instead be regions bound by repressors that silence nearby genes, or architectural factors that affect long-distance regulation of gene expression. The authors could strengthen this aspect of their analysis if they compared their differential OCRs to differential gene expression at least for their major cell types of interest.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>To sum up the public review, it is not that we don't believe that there is added value in the SNAIL approach, we suspect there definitely is, and would honestly like to try it ourselves once it is published. It just needs to be properly and clearly demonstrated. The ideal way to show this would be to analyse the same tissue twice, once via SNAIL and once via any of the competing approaches discussed above, find areas of non-overlap and see which one works best at making specific vectors, but this is admittedly a big ask, which I am not making. However, there needs to be a bit more to demonstrate how useful it might be… another less onerous way one could do so can be seen in Figure 1 suppl 6, which shows the predicted PV specificity from SNAIL (1S6b) versus accessibility alone (1S6c). Note that the two panels are largely similar, but there are particular enhancers which have wildly different predicted specificity than from chromatin accessibility alone. The authors could illustrate how well their approach worked by taking an enhancer with very different values by the two methods (e.g. E14, E12) and seeing which prediction holds true in an AAV: SNAIL vs. raw accessibility.</p><p>Specific points are below.</p><p>Line 16: &quot;introduce&quot; seems out of place, since cSNAIL was already described in the previous 2020 paper… In general this is a real issue… the paper would be greatly aided by making clearer the <italic>functional</italic> distinctions between the two acronyms, rather than simply say that cSNAIL is Cre-based. The similarity of the acronyms will be confusing to the casual reader who doesn't look up the prior paper, because they are actually quite distinct in application. It is unclear how much of the paper is about the label versus the algorithm (it's almost entirely the latter). This is central to the novelty of the work, so it should be clearer.</p><p>Lines 56 to 68: in this description of selection of enhancers one relevant aspect is overlooked, namely that scATAC-seq is a relatively noisy approach to the prediction of active enhancers. A combination of different chromatin marks would likely be equally effective in selecting relevant enhancers. Naturally, this would be harder to accomplish than a simple scATAC-seq. For example the work by Ernst and Kellis is very useful here (for example PMID: 29120462).</p><p>Discovery of functional elements does not require necessarily any modeling, the addition of K27Ac marks alone for example improves prediction greatly in the case of active promoters and enhancers.</p><p>Figure 1 – supplement 2 and lines 112-114: even though this presentation is convincing in showing the predictive capabilities of machine learning, it does not put the empirically tested promoters into context of all predicted regulatory elements. I would like to see in the text an inclusion of which rank the cell class specific promoters reach (i.e. &quot;the SVM model ranked the Gfap promoter as xx out of xxx astrocyte specific OCRs&quot;).</p><p>Furthermore, in supplement 2b, I would like to see the inclusion of all enhancers/promoters as gray, points. This will put the verified promoters into context.</p><p>Line 130 and other instances: please use &quot;PV+&quot; rather than &quot;PV&quot;, in the context of &quot;PV-&quot;, only using &quot;PV&quot; for &quot;PV+&quot; is confusing. In the same vein &quot;PV-&quot; may work better to prevent confusion with &quot;PV-specific&quot; in line 132.</p><p>Line 133: how many OCRs were present on the merged reproducible list? This information would help to put into context the differentally accessible regions in line 140.</p><p>Lines 141 to 153: it is unclear what ROC does for a naïve reader. Please include some more information what actually happens in this model. Furthermore, with OCRs of 500bp and motifs typically 6-20bp (possibly several), that would leave many basepairs of noise. Are the OCRs first screened for relevant motifs, or is the ROC applied directly the full OCRs?</p><p>How well does the CNN models perform on the more broad peaks of ATAC-seq compared to the data they were originally designed for with a much higher basepair resolution (ie. CHiP-NEXUS)?</p><p>Line 160: how many peaks were present in the merged reproducible list of peaks?</p><p>Line 165 to 174: it is unclear what the CNN does for a naïve reader. Please add a few sentences of explanation. Additionally, the true/false positive rate graphs are presented without further explanation.</p><p>Lines 221 to 225: Rather than picking out 3 values that correlate with the hypothesis, please report the full data.</p><p>In other words, please include a full list/table of enhancers E1-E34 with scores from both models, as well as values of specificity. Then ideally include two graphs with on the X-axis specificity and on the Y axis the model score, for a selection of the contrasts. I requests this because in many cases in figure 1 supplementary 4 and 5 the correlation seems to be driven primarily by E4, E22 and E29.</p><p>Could you also provide the correlation between predicted activity and specificity without E4, E22 and E29? This should hold up even without these most obvious examples.</p><p>Figure 1 supplement 5a: according to the predicted activity E10, E7 and E9 are particularly specific for PV+ cells compared to VIP+ cells. Similarly E14 should be particularly specific for PV+ cells compared to SST+ cells. This predicted specify is not apparent from the accessibility (supplement 5b) and the general, empirically determined specificity is not particularly high. But, based on the models, these particular enhancers should display specificity for PV+ cells over VIP+ cells. This hypothesis is easily tested by injecting viral vectors with these particular enhancers and counting the transgene expression in PV+ cells compared to VIP+/SST+ cells.</p><p>This hypothesis is particularly interesting because the tested enhancers are fully in line with the accessibility predictor of specificity, whereas E10, E7 and E9 predict something different than accessibility.</p><p>Figure 1 supplement 5b: It appears the correlation between specificity and accessibility is stronger than the correlation between specificity and predicted activity. Please provide the Pearson correlation of specificity and accessibility also and comment on the difference between the two correlations.</p><p>Line 241 to 250: it appears E14, and in lesser extend E11 and E2, have a similarly high specificity. Do these enhancers contain motifs too? For that matter, all other enhancers?</p><p>Line 258: what is the motivation for picking SC2 over all other candidates in the 90th percentile?</p><p>Figure 2 A-B: It appears the snATAC signal for SC1 and SC2 alone would be very strong in pointing these enhancers out as PV specific enhancers. Based on only Accessibility, how high would they rank? In other words, could you make a list with all enhancers sorted based on log2 fold accessibility difference, and provide the percentile ranks of these enhancers based on this compared to the model predicted ranks?</p><p>Figure 2C-E and lines 266 to 276: which region was investigated? Were the same cortical regions investigated to establish the percentages? Some cortical regions are naturally more abundant with PV+ cells. Please include more details on this analysis.</p><p>If this is done right: very strong, excellent to see this working! Absolutely convincing SC1 and SC2 drive PV specific expression.</p><p>Line 297 to 327: Strong, convincing evidence that SC1 and SC2 are indeed PV specific. This is not only interesting for those researching PV cells, but also an indication that the selection of these enhancers based on the in silico models was successful.</p><p>Line 360: it would be interesting to see a GPe or cortical PV+ neuron specific enhancer in a subsequent publication!</p><p>Line 444: most interesting, a good lead into functional understanding of enhancers-TF interaction in particular cell types in the brain.</p><p>Line 449: This sentence seems a bit of an overstatement. As I understand, first OCRs are selected on differential activity. Meaning a requirement of scATAC data with defined and annontated clusters. For this statement to be true, the models need to be run on all peaks, rather than pre-selected regions with differential activity. Perhaps I misunderstood and the models were actually run on the merged lists of peaks, in that case disregard this comment.</p><p>Line 459: I'm not sure which data this is based on. I don't think a direct comparison was made between the average score in Figure 1.sup5a and b. I would like to see this explicitly state in the text, along with correlation plots for specificity vs. predicted activity and specificity vs. accessibility, with pearson correlations.</p><p>Line 491: Could you speculate on the possibility to find or generate regulatory elements specific for cell types in these regions. So, instead of generalization, specification.</p><p>Lines 493 to 501: Another limitation, is that when supplemented in mature neurons, the viral vector will not undergo the same developmental, epigenomic modifications. This may result in different levels of expression. At least, in our hands we found discrepancies in expression between transgenically provided genes and virally provided ones. There does not seem to be much literature on this topic though, so a discussion may be beyond the scope of this paper.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.69571.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) To expand on the overall applicability of the cSNAIL approach, it would be useful to determine whether identified PV-specific sequences using this approach extend to ATAC-seq signal from PV neurons in other species.

We made several substantial computational and experimental advances to address these concerns:</p><p>1. We compared the predictions of machine learning models trained on mouse cortex, mouse striatum, and mouse GPe. High concordance between PV+ neuron-specific predictions in the cortex and striatum suggest generalizability between brain regions where PV+ neurons are similar.</p><p>2. We trained new machine learning models using human single nucleus open chromatin data (Corces et al., 2020). The success of these models shows the applicability of the SNAIL framework for source data and applications beyond the mouse brain.</p><p>3. We demonstrate that PV+ machine learning models trained from human data show substantial correlation to those trained from mouse data. This shows cross-species conservation in the regulatory sequence features that discriminate PV+ neuron-specific enhancers. It also suggests that many machine learning-designed enhancer AAVs chosen from the mouse genome are likely to be transferable to primates and other species. In fact, one of our enhancer candidates SC1 scored as one of the highest predicted PV+ neuron-specific sequences for both mouse and human.</p><p>4. We tested one of our SNAIL PV+ AAVs in the macaque cortex where it exhibited similar selectivity for PV+ neurons. This validates the wide utility of the SC1 SNAIL virus and underscores the generalizability of the SNAIL system to other contexts and species.</p><p>These results of items 2 – 4 above are described in a new section in the text <italic>“Cross-species analyses with SNAIL”</italic> and reference a new main figure, Figure 6.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) In many cases, the computational approaches are not fully described and may introduce confusion for a more general readership.

Some examples include:</p><p>“These models take 500 bp candidate enhancer DNA sequence strings as input and they output, for each sequence, the cell type in which that candidate enhancer is active and an associated score. The similarity between sequences is determined based on gapped k-mer count vectors, i.e. the number of occurrences of all short subsequences of length k, tolerating some gaps or mismatches, as implemented by LS-GKM (Ghandi et al., 2014; Lee 2016).Where there are sufficient reliable sequence features associated with differential enhancer activation between two cell types, the model should learn these principles during the training phase and then be able to apply these principles to determine the cell type-specific activities of new sequences.”</p><p>“CNNs are a type of artificial neural network defined by multiple convolutional layers. The CNNs were trained to take in 1000 bp DNA sequence strings with different accessibility between two cell types, automatically extract predictive sequence features, and output a cell class probability between 0 and 1 (see methods for details). Compared with SVMs, CNNs are better-equipped to learn higher-order interactions between sequence features due to CNNs’ capacity for flexible feature representation and automated feature selection (Cun et al., 1989).”</p><p>“To assess model performance, we used standard classifier metrics, the area under the receiver operator curve (auROC) and the area under the precision-recall curve (auPRC). These scores quantify model performance by comparing the predicted class to the actual class, where a randomly guessing binary classifier would have an auROC score of 0.5 and an auPRC score equal to the fraction of actual positives in the data, and a perfect classifier would have a maximum auROC score of 1.0 and auPRC score of 1.0.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1.

Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) (Cun et al., 1989) and support vector machines (SVMs), for example, have achieved state-of-the-art performance on predicting enhancer activity from sequence (Chen, Fish, and Capra 2018; Kaplow et al., 2021; Kelley 2020).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

Additional experimental evidence may be necessary to confirm the appropriateness of PV+ SNAIL viruses for certain applications outside the cortex.”</p><p>We also added an additional broader comparison of the machine learning models from different brain regions, which shows high agreement between cortical models and striatal models, and a weak relationship between cortical models and GPe models. This result is biologically intuitive, GPe PV+ neurons have major distinguishing phenotypes, including projections to other brain regions (Hernández et al., 2015; Saunders, Huang, and Sabatini 2016).</p><p>“We assessed the correlation between the score outputs of the cortex PV+ vs. PV- SVM with the striatum PV+ vs. PV- or GPe PV+ vs. PV- SVMs for our set of experimentally identified mouse cortical PV+ neuron enhancers sequences. Enhancer scores were well correlated between the cortex and striatum models (pearson = 0.73, spearman = 0.72), indicating shared regulatory sequence determinants between PV+ neurons in the cortex and striatum. There was a low correlation between enhancer scores of the cortex and GPe models (pearson = 0.25, spearman = 0.24), indicating differences in the learned PV+ regulatory sequence properties in these regions.”</p><p>Overall, we believe that the ATAC-seq data from multiple brain regions, as well as the addition of the cross-species analyses, demonstrate high utility for PV SNAIL technologies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The text identifies Err3 and Mef2 motifs as being important for the PV-specific activity of SC1 and SC2 sequences. However, without additional experimental evidence demonstrating that loss or mutation of these motifs abolishes the PV-specific expression pattern of these sequences, this conclusion should be moderated.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that further experimentation is needed to assess this claim, and we have moderated the language in the manuscript. We amended the section title to be “Err3 and <italic>Mef2</italic> motifs are important for the PV+ neuron-specific activity score of SC1 and SC2 sequences” to direct our interpretation to the model score and not necessarily to functional impact. To add to this discussion, we have added predictions for the contributions of these motifs using in silico mutagenesis (Figure 5d). We added related text and moderated conclusions in lines 450 – 453:</p><p>“Disruption of Err3 and <italic>Mef2</italic> motifs within SC1 or SC2 resulted in sharply decreased the prediction of PV+ specificity according to the scores across the SVMs (Figure 5d).

Other reports using open chromatin profiling to identify enhancers for transgene expression in AAV have recently been published (PMID 33789083, 33789096). While these reports are cited here, the Discussion section of this manuscript would benefit from a more systematic comparison of these approaches with the current approach.</p></disp-quote><p>We view SNAIL as a novel addition to existing large screen approaches which could make them more efficient and more accessible for boutique applications. We added to the second paragraph of the discussion to better explain SNAIL in the context of the field:</p><p>“Thus far, success in cell type-specific AAV creation has been limited to intensive screens of dozens of individual AAV enhancer candidates in which most do not produce highly selective expression (Vormstein-Schneider et al., 2020; Mich et al., 2021; Graybuck et al., 2021). In SNAIL, our framework for cell type-specific AAV engineering, we incorporate machine learning classifiers as an additional filter for improved enhancer pre-selection in order to mitigate the experimental burden. On a set of externally tested PV+ enhancer-driven AAVs (Vormstein-Schneider et al., 2020), the average PV+ specificity score across our classifiers was more predictive of PV+ specific AAV expression than the log2 fold difference of snATAC-seq signal, sequence conservation, or accessibility conservation at these loci. With the SNAIL framework, we identified and validated two novel enhancers that drive targeted expression in PV+ neurons in the mouse cortex. While these do not represent enough trials to establish a new conversion rate from cell type-specific OCRs to cell type-specific AAVs, we were encouraged by the immediate success of the first probes we selected. We believe that the incorporation of differential sequence property analyses will continue to improve the throughput of targeted AAV development in new contexts and make cell type-specific enhancer tool development accessible for more researchers.”</p><p>In later sections of the discussion, we go on to emphasize other unique advantages of SNAIL over other approaches, including the interpretability of sequence contributions (beginning in line 503) and the isolatable reporter Sun1GFP (beginning in line 521).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1) Twice the authors compare the PV specificity of their viral vectors to that achieved with the Pvalb-2A-Cre mouse (line 91, line 271), however no data or references are cited to explain what data the authors are comparing from the mouse strain. Published studies using Cre-dependent viruses in adult Pvalb-2A-Cre show excellent specificity for expressing in PV+ neurons, it is when the strain is crossed to other transgenic reporter mice (like the original Ai14 mouse in the Madisen et al., paper) that there is expression outside the PV+ population in the adult brain. This may not reflect Cre expression outside the PV+ population as much as it reflects Pvalb gene activation during development in cells beyond the highly PV+ population of the adult. Therefore, the authors need to clarify what data from the Pvalb-2A-Cre mice to which they are comparing.</p></disp-quote><p>These comparisons reference data collected alongside SC1 and SC2 and available in this paper. For imaging, we compared to PValb-2A-Cre/Ai14 fluorescent expression (~50% specificity to Pvalb+ cells in our images). We have amended the text to be more explicit about this, and to direct readers to the appropriate source data:</p><p>“This was an 11-fold enrichment in precision over the Ef1a promoter and notably, an almost 2-fold enrichment over Cre reporter labeling in Pvalb-2A-Cre/Ai14 double transgenic mice (Figure 2c-e, Figure 2-Source Data 2).”</p><p>For the affinity purification ATAC-seq data, we compared to single transgenic PValb-2A-Cre labeling using cSNAIL. Our claim that SNAIL probes are more specific to PV+ interneurons than the PValb-2A-Cre strain references the experiment comparing all Sun1GFP-purified populations with snATAC-seq (Figure 3d).</p><p>“We also note that cSNAIL PV+ ATAC-seq had an additional 8% overlap with excitatory cluster L5 PT markers (p = 2.5 x 10-45), possibly reflective of Pvalb-2A-Cre line labeling in layer 5 Parvalbumin-expressing excitatory neurons (Tanahira et al., 2009; Jinno and Kosaka 2004; Roccaro-Waldmeyer et al., 2018). These OCRs were absent in SC1- and SC2-isolated cells. In fact, SC1 and SC2 had no enrichment for cluster-specific OCRs of any cluster other than PV+ (≤ 2% overlap, p &gt; 0.1), including the closely related SST+ neuron population. This suggests that SC1 and SC2 SNAIL probes target a stricter subset of the cells than the Pvalb-2A-Cre mouse strain, likely restricted to PV+ inhibitory interneurons.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) in Line 275-276, and Figures 2d-e, the authors state that their PV derived enhancer vectors have a 9-fold increase in PV specificity over the negative control. However, the negative control vector has no promoter and thus should really have no expression (there is certainly exceptionally little expression in Figure 2C in the right hand most panel). If the image is truly representative, then it seems that the authors probably have too few expressing cells to say much that is meaningful in a quantitative way about the specificity of that negative control.</p></disp-quote><p>There were 154 weakly expressing gfp+ cells total across the N.C. images, compared to thousands of gfp+ for SC1 and SC2 (see Figure 2-Source Data 2). We have removed the statement about the 9-fold increase over N.C. because there was a difference between titers. Instead, we use the N.C. data to determine that there is no PV+ bias in background expression. We have changed the text to reflect these differences:</p><p>“The negative control virus was injected at as high of a concentration as possible (14x the concentration of SC1, SC2, and Ef1a injections) to detect any biases in spurious background expression. At this titer, a number of cells exhibited GFP expression (Figure 2-Source Data 2), but these did not appear biased toward PV+ neurons (Figure 2d).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) In line 338 the authors use their motif analysis to suggest a distinction in the MEF2 family members that may control the differentiation of different inhibitory cell types. However, to my knowledge there is no rigorous experimental identification of distinct MEF2A versus MEF2C versus MEF2D binding sites (if the authors are aware of a validated study this reference would be good to add). The slight variations in the motifs in the databases interrogated here may rather reflect differences in the methods of the groups that deposited the motifs. The authors would benefit the field to think broadly about their interpretation of these variations in motif enrichment and what they might mean.</p></disp-quote><p>We have modified the paragraph beginning on line 429 to remove the claims about different <italic>Mef2</italic> motifs. The utility and interpretations are not heavily dependent on the specificities of the <italic>Mef2</italic> family members.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) As to the evidence that MEF2C is required for the PV+ interneuron lineage, what the Mayer 2018 paper actually showed is that conditional knockout of MEF2C in PV+ lineage cells (with Dlx6-Cre) led to loss of PV expression in the adult cortex. However, whether this is loss of PV expression, versus failure of PV cells to develop, was not addressed. The authors should adjust their language here to account for that uncertainty. It is also important that the Mayer study settled on MEF2C because it was more highly expressed in PV interneurons compared with other interneurons (esp. SST interneurons). However, MEF2C is highly expressed in many classes of excitatory neurons especially during development but also in the adult brain. Therefore, MEF2C alone cannot explain cell type specific enhancer function except in collaboration with other cell type specific transcription factors.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the suggestion. We completely agree that MEF2C alone cannot explain cell type-specificity. In fact, the strong performance of our computational models is almost certainly due to their ability to identify how complex combinations of transcription factor binding sites and other sequence signatures influence PV+ neuron-specific enhancer activity. We have added text to the discussion that clarifies the role we propose MEF2C plays in this system.</p><p>“An additional advantage of incorporating classifiers for cell type-specific enhancer selection is increased interpretability of the factors that govern success. The sequence patterns learned by PV+ models reflected known PV+ neuron biology. Common motifs contributing to successful PV+ probe enhancers included Err3, <italic>Mef2</italic>, and Lhx6, important for the specification and maintenance of the cortical PV+ interneuron lineage (Zhao et al., 2008; Mayer et al., 2018; Liodis et al., 2007). It is interesting to note the varying expression patterns of these transcription factors. In the cortex, Err3 expression is mainly restricted to PV+ neurons and Lhx6 is restricted to MGE interneurons, but <italic>Mef2</italic> transcripts are widely expressed in many inhibitory and excitatory neurons. It is likely combinatorial interactions between abundant and cell type-specific transcription factor binding events that specify PV+ neuron enhancer activation. The SNAIL framework provides an opportunity to meaningfully leverage these complex sequence codes.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) In Line 351 the authors highlight the association of open chromatin near BDNF especially at promoter IV. However, this is somewhat surprising, given that BDNF is really not expressed in interneurons (see PMID 24855953). This example highlights that the authors need to consider the possibility that not every region of differentially open chromatin reflects enhancers – these may instead be regions bound by repressors that silence nearby genes, or architectural factors that affect long-distance regulation of gene expression. The authors could strengthen this aspect of their analysis if they compared their differential OCRs to differential gene expression at least for their major cell types of interest.</p></disp-quote><p>We have modified the BDNF OCR discussion and included speculation on this discrepancy.</p><p>“The set of PV+ OCRs enriched in cortical PV+ neurons included 10 regions associated with the Bdnf gene (Ensembl Genes; FDR Q = 0.0035). Bdnf is generally expressed in excitatory forebrain neurons but not PV+ interneurons. The presence of PV+ neuron OCRs near Bdnf could represent genomic regions with non-enhancer functions, enhancers that regulate another gene, the binding regions of repressive TFs, or trace contamination from excitatory populations.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>To sum up the public review, it is not that we don't believe that there is added value in the SNAIL approach, we suspect there definitely is, and would honestly like to try it ourselves once it is published. It just needs to be properly and clearly demonstrated. The ideal way to show this would be to analyse the same tissue twice, once via SNAIL and once via any of the competing approaches discussed above, find areas of non-overlap and see which one works best at making specific vectors, but this is admittedly a big ask, which I am not making. However, there needs to be a bit more to demonstrate how useful it might be… another less onerous way one could do so can be seen in Figure 1 suppl 6, which shows the predicted PV specificity from SNAIL (1S6b) versus accessibility alone (1S6c). Note that the two panels are largely similar, but there are particular enhancers which have wildly different predicted specificity than from chromatin accessibility alone. The authors could illustrate how well their approach worked by taking an enhancer with very different values by the two methods (e.g. E14, E12) and seeing which prediction holds true in an AAV: SNAIL vs. raw accessibility.</p><p>Specific points are below.</p><p>Line 16: &quot;introduce&quot; seems out of place, since cSNAIL was already described in the previous 2020 paper… In general this is a real issue… the paper would be greatly aided by making clearer the functional distinctions between the two acronyms, rather than simply say that cSNAIL is Cre-based. The similarity of the acronyms will be confusing to the casual reader who doesn't look up the prior paper, because they are actually quite distinct in application. It is unclear how much of the paper is about the label versus the algorithm (it's almost entirely the latter). This is central to the novelty of the work, so it should be clearer.</p></disp-quote><p>We have made attempts throughout the manuscript to clarify. Specifically, we note the similarity and difference between cSNAIL and SNAIL at first mention, line 90:</p><p>“Similar to our previously described Cre-activated AAV technology cSNAIL (Lawler et al., 2020), SNAIL probes have the unique advantage of an affinity purification-compatible fluorescent reporter that can be used to isolate rare cell types (Mo et al., 2015; Deal and Henik<sub>off</sub> 2010; Lawler et al., 2020). Unlike cSNAIL, which relies on Cre activation, SNAIL probes are stand-alone AAVs driven by cell type-specific enhancer sequences selected through machine learning models. Thus, SNAIL probes may be used in a wide variety of systems including wild type mice, primates, and other species.”</p><p>We also changed our language to refer to SNAIL throughout the text as a “framework” for machine learning-assisted cell type-specific sequence design. For example:</p><p>“Here, we present a framework for machine learning-assisted engineering of cell type-specific AAVs, which we refer to as Specific Nuclear Anchored Independent Labeling (SNAIL).”</p><p>“In SNAIL, our framework for cell type-specific AAV engineering, we incorporate machine learning classifiers as an additional filter for improved enhancer pre-selection in order to mitigate the experimental burden.”</p><p>“With the SNAIL framework, we identified and validated two novel enhancers that drive targeted expression in PV+ neurons in the mouse cortex.”</p><p>Thank you, it is corrected.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Lines 56 to 68: in this description of selection of enhancers one relevant aspect is overlooked, namely that scATAC-seq is a relatively noisy approach to the prediction of active enhancers. A combination of different chromatin marks would likely be equally effective in selecting relevant enhancers. Naturally, this would be harder to accomplish than a simple scATAC-seq. For example the work by Ernst and Kellis is very useful here (for example PMID: 29120462).</p><p>Discovery of functional elements does not require necessarily any modeling, the addition of K27Ac marks alone for example improves prediction greatly in the case of active promoters and enhancers.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added to that paragraph to note that ATAC-seq is an imperfect proxy for enhancer activity.</p><p>“ATAC-seq (Buenrostro et al., 2013) is an advantageous technique for defining potential cell type-specific enhancer regions because of its high nucleotide resolution and its compatibility with small cell populations and even with single cell technologies (Buenrostro, Wu, Litzenburger, et al., 2015; Cusanovich et al., 2015). Though convenient, chromatin accessibility is a noisy approximation for enhancer activity and differentially accessible sequence elements often fail to produce selective expression in vivo.”</p><p>We agree that the addition of other epigenetic features, including H3K27ac and H3K4me1 (Ernst and Kellis 2017), could potentially improve the predictions. These, and other potential features, are not included in our approach for two reasons. First, these histone modifications tend to be found across broader regions than ATAC-Seq peaks (&gt;1,000bp) (Roadmap Epigenomics Consortium [2015] 2015). In our experience, this can make it more difficult to learn important local sequence features. Second, the availability of this type of data for specific cell types is rare, because of the technical difficulty of ChIP-seq in tiny populations of cells. Overall, our approach helps isolate true cell type-specific sequence characteristics while only requiring convenient ATAC-seq data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 1 – supplement 2 and lines 112-114: even though this presentation is convincing in showing the predictive capabilities of machine learning, it does not put the empirically tested promoters into context of all predicted regulatory elements.

Based on the feedback, we have transitioned away from correlation estimates and toward binary analysis. This is because our models are binary classifiers, which predict a class label (+ or -), and the score should be thought of as a measure of confidence of this label, with scores near 0 being less confident, and scores further from 0 more confident. Therefore, we should not necessarily expect strong correlation between model scores and experimental specificity for enhancers with intermediate performance. A regression model would be more appropriate if trying to recapitulate this trend. Instead, as you note, our classifiers perform great on the best and worst examples. This is useful for narrowing a pool of candidate enhancers down to the best candidates. Essentially, the practical goal is to minimize false positives, where a high LFC might lead you to use an enhancer, but it actually has poor specificity in vivo due to sequence composition. We have revised this analysis to group E1 – E34 into either high experimental specificity (&gt;70%) or low experimental specificity (&lt;70%), and plotted the LFC or model scores in Figure 1—figure supplement 5. The results are described in the text:</p><p>“On the complete set of enhancers, SVM score was predictive of the PV+ specificity group (p = 0.008), and differential activity log2 fold change had a weak association with PV+ specificity group (p = 0.069) (Figure 1—figure supplement 5c). Much of the log2 fold difference association with group PV+ specificity was driven by enhancer sequences with low log2 fold difference and low PV+ specificity. Undesirably, there were some sequences with high log2 fold difference and low in vivo specificity. Within the subset of enhancers with high log2 fold difference (log2 fold difference &gt; 1), the log2 fold difference was not associated with specificity group (p = 0.601), while SVM score was weakly associated (p = 0.057) (Figure 1—figure supplement 5d). Unlike log2 fold difference scores alone, SVM scores may limit false positive candidates and improve efficient enhancer AAV selection.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 1 supplement 5a: according to the predicted activity E10, E7 and E9 are particularly specific for PV+ cells compared to VIP+ cells.

Please include more details on this analysis.</p><p>If this is done right: very strong, excellent to see this working! Absolutely convincing SC1 and SC2 drive PV specific expression.</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, these were all consistently imaged in the primary motor cortex (M1), with representation from all layers. I have added a note to the text of this section.</p><p>“We quantified images with consistent positioning in the primary motor cortex, with representation from all layers.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 297 to 327: Strong, convincing evidence that SC1 and SC2 are indeed PV specific. This is not only interesting for those researching PV cells, but also an indication that the selection of these enhancers based on the in silico models was successful.</p><p>Line 360: it would be interesting to see a GPe or cortical PV+ neuron specific enhancer in a subsequent publication!</p><p>Line 444: most interesting, a good lead into functional understanding of enhancers-TF interaction in particular cell types in the brain.</p><p>Line 449: This sentence seems a bit of an overstatement. As I understand, first OCRs are selected on differential activity. Meaning a requirement of scATAC data with defined and annontated clusters. For this statement to be true, the models need to be run on all peaks, rather than pre-selected regions with differential activity. Perhaps I misunderstood and the models were actually run on the merged lists of peaks, in that case disregard this comment.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer’s interpretation is correct. We have amended to qualify the statement.</p><p>“Here, we showed that sequence was sufficient to discern the directionality of highly differential OCR activity in different neuron subtypes in most cases.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 459: I'm not sure which data this is based on. I don't think a direct comparison was made between the average score in Figure 1.sup5a and b. I would like to see this explicitly state in the text, along with correlation plots for specificity vs. predicted activity and specificity vs. accessibility, with pearson correlations.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now included explicit statements of the binary analysis in the text, which supports this claim.</p><p>“On the complete set of enhancers, SVM score was predictive of the PV+ specificity group (p = 0.008), and differential activity log2 fold difference had a weak association with PV+ specificity group (p = 0.069) (Figure 1—figure supplement 5c). Much of the log2 fold difference association with group PV+ specificity was driven by enhancer sequences with low log2 fold difference and low PV+ specificity. Undesirably, there were some sequences with high log2 fold difference and low in vivo specificity. Within the subset of enhancers with high log2 fold difference (log2 fold difference &gt; 1), the log2 fold difference was not associated with specificity group (p = 0.601), while SVM score was weakly associated (p = 0.057) (Figure 1—figure supplement 5d). Unlike log2 fold difference scores alone, SVM scores may limit false positive candidates and improve efficient enhancer AAV selection.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 491: Could you speculate on the possibility to find or generate regulatory elements specific for cell types in these regions. So, instead of generalization, specification.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added a sentence to state the possibility of using the SNAIL framework to tag specialized populations such as this.</p><p>“It will be interesting to conduct further comparisons of the composition of cell populations that are labeled by these tools in different brain regions and species. We speculate that the SNAIL framework could be strategically employed to design tools for specific subtypes of PV+ neurons or other cell populations that may be brain region or species specific.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Lines 493 to 501: Another limitation, is that when supplemented in mature neurons, the viral vector will not undergo the same developmental, epigenomic modifications. This may result in different levels of expression. At least, in our hands we found discrepancies in expression between transgenically provided genes and virally provided ones. There does not seem to be much literature on this topic though, so a discussion may be beyond the scope of this paper.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added a sentence on this potential limitation.</p><p>“Finally, an enhancer’s activity in AAV may differ from the same enhancer’s activity in the host genome due to the surrounding genomic and epigenomic context. Enhancer activity may also fluctuate in response to different conditions because enhancers are dynamic actors in the regulation of gene expression.”</p><p>References</p><p>Buenrostro, Jason D., Paul G.
