These challenges have fostered the development of innovative population control technologies such as Cas9/guideRNA (Cas9/gRNA) homing-based gene drives (HGDs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Champer et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Esvelt et al., 2014</xref>) which have been laboratory-tested for either population modification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adolfi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carballar-Lejarazú et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gantz et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Li et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Pham et al., 2019</xref>) to spread desirable traits that can impair the mosquitoes’ ability to transmit pathogens (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Buchman et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Buchman et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hoermann et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Isaacs et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Marshall et al., 2019</xref>) or population suppression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hammond et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kyrou et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Simoni et al., 2020</xref>) to reduce and eliminate wild disease-transmitting populations of mosquitoes. Despite significant progress, HGDs are still an emerging technology that can suffer from the formation of resistant alleles, hindering their efficacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adolfi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carballar-Lejarazú et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gantz et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hammond et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kandul et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kyrou et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Li et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Pham et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Simoni et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>In CRISPR/Cas9, the Cas9 endonuclease cuts a programmed DNA sequence complementary to a user-defined short guide RNA molecule (gRNA). To engineer an HGD, leveraging creative designs originally proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Burt, 2003</xref>, CRISPR components are integrated at the target site in the genome. These components are configured so that when they cut the recipient wildtype (<italic>wt</italic>) allele, it is repaired via homology-directed repair (HDR) in heterozygotes, using the donor allele (i.e. allele harboring the HGD) as a template for DNA repair. This enables the HGD to home, or copy, itself into the recipient allele (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Alphey et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Champer et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Esvelt et al., 2014</xref>) (referred to as homing from hereon). This general architecture for HGD was quickly adopted, and many HGDs were developed in several insect species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gantz et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hammond et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kandul et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kyrou et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Li et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Simoni et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Verkuijl et al., 2020</xref>). However, it soon became widely apparent that HGDs unintentionally promote the formation of resistant alleles through mutagenic repair. When these alleles are positively selected, they can hinder HGD spread in laboratory cage populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Champer et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hammond et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kandul et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">KaramiNejadRanjbar et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Oberhofer et al., 2018</xref>), with one exception that targeted a conserved sex determination gene for population suppression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kyrou et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Simoni et al., 2020</xref>). This resistance arises from Cas9/gRNA-directed DNA cuts being repaired by alternative DNA end-joining (EJ) repair pathways, including non-homologous (NHEJ) and microhomology-mediated end-joining (MMEJ), which can introduce insertions or deletions (<italic>indels</italic>) at the target site(s). Many of these <italic>indels</italic> produce loss-of-function (LOF) alleles, which can be selected against if deleterious to the organism. However, functional in-frame EJ-induced <italic>indel</italic> alleles can also be generated, which are unrecognized by the same Cas9/gRNA complex and become drive resistant alleles. When resistant alleles are induced in germ cells, they are heritable and can hinder spread of HGDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Champer et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hammond et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kandul et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">KaramiNejadRanjbar et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Oberhofer et al., 2018</xref>). Both induced and naturally existing resistant alleles can pose significant challenges to engineering a stable HGD capable of spreading and persisting long term in a population.</p><p>To overcome the accumulation of drive resistant alleles, CRISPR-based toxin-antidote (TA) drives, in which embryos are essentially ‘poisoned’ and only those embryos harboring the TA genetic cassette are rescued, were described (Figure S8 in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kandul et al., 2019</xref>) and engineered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Champer et al., 2020a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Oberhofer et al., 2020a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Oberhofer et al., 2020b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Oberhofer et al., 2019</xref>). Generally these designs utilize a toxin consisting of a non-HGD harboring multiple gRNAs targeting a vital gene, and an ‘addictive’ antidote that is a re-coded, cleavage-immune version of the targeted gene. These TA-based drives are Mendelianly transmitted and spread instead by killing progeny that fail to inherit the drive (e.g. 50% perish from heterozygous mother). Alternative HDR-based TA designs were also described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Champer et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Esvelt et al., 2014</xref>), modeled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Noble et al., 2017</xref>), and recently tested in mosquitoes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adolfi et al., 2020</xref>) targeting a recessive non-essential eye pigmentation gene, and in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> targeting either haplosufficient (i.e. the non-functional allele is recessive as a single functional copy of the target gene is sufficient for normal function) genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Terradas et al., 2021</xref>) or a rare haploinsufficient (i.e. the non-functional allele is dominant as a single functional copy of the target gene is not sufficient for normal function) gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Champer et al., 2020b</xref>), each demonstrating drive capacity.</p><p>Building upon prior work, here we describe the development of a home-and-rescue (HomeR) split-drive (i.e. Cas9 separated from the drive) targeting an essential, haplosufficient gene in <italic>D. melanogaster.</italic> We demonstrate that the accumulation of EJ-induced resistant alleles can be reduced by strategically following four design criteria. First, designing the HGD to target the 3’ coding sequence of an essential gene required for insect viability. Second, encoding a dominant rescue of the endogenous target gene into HomeR. Third, using an exogenous 3’ UTR to prevent expected deleterious recombination events between the drive and the endogenous target gene. Fourth, by exploiting a process we previously first described as lethal biallelic mosaicism (LBM) in which maternal carryover of Cas9/gRNA complexes contributes to RNA-guided dominant biallelic disruption of an essential target gene throughout development thereby ensuring recessive non-functional resistant alleles result in dominant deleterious/lethal mutations that can get negatively selected out of a population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kandul et al., 2019</xref>). Importantly, individuals that inherit the drive allele express a dominant re-coded rescue and are protected from LBM. We demonstrate that efficient cleavage of the target sequence by HomeR and rescue are requisites to achieve nearly ~100% transmission in the presence of Cas9, which is accomplished mostly by homing in trans-heterozygous females. Further, we perform multigenerational population drive experiments demonstrating long-term stability and efficient Cas9-dependent drive. Finally, we conduct comprehensive mathematical modeling to demonstrate that HomeR can outperform contemporary gene drive systems for population modification over wide ranges of fitness, transmission rates, introduction frequencies, and release regimens. Given the simplistic design, this system could be adapted to other species.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Selection of <italic>PolG2</italic> as a HomeR drive target</title><p>To develop a HomeR-based drive, we first identified an essential haplosufficient gene to target.

However, functional resistant alleles (R1) that alter the AA sequence of the target can indeed still be generated (e.g. by EJ repair resulting from in-frame <italic>indels,</italic> or nonsynonymous base substitutions) and may hinder drive spread. While these mutations may partially rescue the function of the target gene resulting in viability, it has not escaped our attention that they may still confer detrimental fitness costs to their carriers resulting from incompletely preserving the function of the essential target gene due to the altered AA sequence(s) in a critical domain and may result in negative selection within a population. We therefore refer to these here as ‘non-silent R1’ or ‘non-silent PolG<sup>R1</sup>’ mutations. On the contrary, resistant alleles that alter the nucleotide sequence, but not the AA sequence, can also be generated, and these are referred to here as ‘silent R1’ or ‘silent PolG<sup>R1</sup> mutations’. These silent R1 mutations are expected to be especially problematic to drive spread as these would not be predicted to impose fitness costs on homozygous carriers, and therefore they would be expected to spread at the expense of the drive. Notwithstanding, the generation of both types of R1 functional resistant alleles (non-silent/silent) is a shared problem of all HGDs developed to date.</p><p>To explore this potential, in addition to spread and stability, we initiated three multigenerational cage populations of heterozygous <italic>PolG2<sup>HomeR</sup>/+</italic> flies (50% allelic frequency) in the <italic>nos-Cas9/nos-Cas9</italic> genetic background and assessed if induced resistant alleles could impede drive invasion and stability in 10 discrete generations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

TARE and ClvR force their inheritance by disrupting an essential gene (<italic>EsGene<sup>WT</sup></italic>) in oocytes as well as in embryos using maternal carryover of Cas9/guideRNA (Cas9/gRNA), and rescuing only those embryos that inherit the drive element harboring the re-coded essential target gene, which is resistant to Cas9/gRNA-mediated cleavage. As a result, mating between trans-heterozygous females and <italic>wt</italic> males generates 50% non-viable embryos. The TARE is integrated at the target gene locus (referred to as same-site teal diamond) and uses its native promoter to drive expression of the re-coded rescue, hence it is referred to as <italic>EsGene<sup>TARE</sup></italic>. Panel (<bold>B</bold>) depicts the two-locus version of ClvR, in which a ClvR harbors a re-coded rescue using a non-native promoter and 3’ UTR, and both ClvR and Cas9 are inserted into two distant loci separate from the target gene (referred to as distant-site red ellipse). Since both TARE and ClvR use multiple gRNAs to target an essential gene, only very rare functional resistant alleles (R1) can survive. (<bold>C</bold>) A homing-based gene drive (HGD) with no rescue targeting a non-essential gene (<italic>gene</italic>) can bias transmission in germ cells by cleaving a non-essential gene (<italic>gene</italic>) and homing, or copying itself, at the cut site (<italic>gene<sup>GD</sup></italic>). However, since the disruption of a non-essential gene does not cause lethality and sterility, maternal carryover of Cas9/gRNA disrupts paternal alleles in embryos, and end joining (EJ) induces both R2 and R1 (<italic>gene<sup>R2</sup></italic> and <italic>gene<sup>R1</sup></italic>) resistant alleles that survive and eventually hinder the spread of HGD in a population. (<bold>D</bold>) The HGD with a rescue (HGD+R) targeting a non-essential gene can preserve the function of the target gene and possibly reduce fitness effects. However, given that the gene is non-essential, resistant alleles can accumulate and impede the spread of HGD+R. (<bold>E</bold>) A homing gene drive with HGD+R targeting a haploinsufficient gene (<italic>HiGene</italic>) requires two functional alleles for viability and fertility of its carriers. Therefore, any somatic cleavage that does not result in precise homing during development of the trans-heterozygous individuals can induce high fitness costs via lethal biallelic mosaicism (LBM). Maternal carryover and somatic expression of <italic>Cas9/gRNA</italic> are known to promote generation of resistant alleles and will increase fitness costs of <italic>HiGene<sup>HGD+R</sup></italic>. Ideally this type of drive system needs to function exclusively in the male germline and avoid problematic maternal deposition issues. (<bold>F</bold>) Home-and-rescue (HomeR) drives as a toxin-antidote homing drive designed to target a haplosufficient essential gene. HomeR harbors a re-coded essential gene, and its precise homing at the cut site rescues the <italic>wt</italic> function of the essential gene (<italic>EsGene<sup>HomeR</sup></italic>). Maternal carryover of HomeR’s Cas9/gRNA induces cleavage of paternal <italic>EsGene<sup>WT</sup></italic> alleles in embryos, which are rescued by only <italic>EsGene<sup>HomeR</sup></italic> but not <italic>EsGene<sup>R2</sup></italic> maternal alleles resulting in the removal of non-rescued LOF resistant alleles (<italic>EsGene<sup>R2</sup></italic>) via LBM (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). HomeR targets an essential gene to increase transmission and impair the survival of resistant alleles that disrupt the function of the target gene (R2). Red strikethrough defines an LOF (R2) allele.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-65939-fig3-figsupp1-v2.tif"/></fig></fig-group><p>When one-locus gene drive (GD) systems are compared for ideal parameter values, HomeR outperforms all other GDs in terms of speed of spread, and reaches near fixation in terms of carrier frequency, as do ClvR and TARE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). HGD displays a similar speed of spread to HomeR initially; however, fitness costs from the targeted gene disruption and LOF (R2) alleles slow the introgression and allow functional resistance alleles (R1) to build up over time, preventing fixation. The HomeR design overcomes this fitness reduction and R2 allele build-up by rescuing the <italic>wt</italic> function of a targeted essential gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). ClvR and TARE perform similarly to each other for ideal parameter values, but reach near carrier fixation ~4 generations after HomeR does for ideal parameter values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). When experimental parameters are used for HomeR (HomeR-Exp, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), it reaches near carrier fixation a generation after ClvR; almost on-par with ideal ClvR and TARE systems and significantly better than HGD. HomeR also reaches near carrier fixation for the widest range of fitness and transmission rate parameter values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). As an HGD, HomeR drives to high carrier frequencies provided its inheritance bias (or transmission rate) exceeds its associated fitness cost. In contrast, drive efficacy of ClvR and TARE is strongly dependent on fitness cost and weakly dependent on transmission rate. Indeed, ClvR and TARE can each only tolerate fitness costs less than ~20% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). This is a consequence of their design, employing a TA scheme, which induces a significant fecundity reduction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A–B</xref>) in addition to other fitness costs. A one-locus HGD also exhibits efficacy across a wide range of parameter combinations, but its efficacy is reduced compared to HomeR due to the build-up of R2 and R1 alleles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C–D</xref>), which can potentially block spread of the HGD in large populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).</p><p>In two-locus simulations, Cas9 is separated from drive in all designs and undergoes independent assortment during gametogenesis. The effects of this design change are evident (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Under the same experimental conditions as one-locus simulations, there is significantly more variation in behavior of two-locus GDs, with a reduced speed of introgression into the population and slightly reduced overall efficacy. Nevertheless, general trends remain the same; HomeR with ideal parameters is more capable than comparable drives, though current experimental realizations require improvement. TARE performs significantly worse in a split configuration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Champer et al., 2020a</xref>). ClvR, when completely unlinked, also performs significantly worse, in agreement with results from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Oberhofer et al., 2020a</xref>. Exploring the performance under a range of parameters, we found reduced overall efficacy for all drives (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), but an increased range of lower efficacy for ClvR, HomeR, and TARE. This is consistent with fitness costs applied to the Cas9 locus, which is now separated from the effector gene and gRNAs. HomeR demonstrates the widest range of achieving efficacy as well as the widest range of high expected efficacy.</p></sec><sec id="s2-11"><title>Exploration of multi-release scenarios</title><p>To probe the ability of these drive designs to modify field populations, we implemented an overlapping generation model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sanchez et al., 2019</xref>), performing weekly male releases into a naive population, and tested if the frequency of females carrying the effector allele reached 95% of the female population, and how long that carrier frequency remained above 95%. One-locus constructs of ClvR, TARE, and HomeR were consistently able to reach this threshold, though HomeR achieved these thresholds over the widest range of transmission rates and fitness costs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). HGD never reached this threshold because of R2 allele build-up. This does not indicate that HGD cannot be effective at lower thresholds (indeed, during testing it was), but that even low rates of resistance generation are problematic. HomeR was the only one to consistently remain above a 95% carrier frequency for over 100 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Performance of contemporary gene drive systems for population modification with multiple releases.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Simulations of one-locus designs of ClvR, TARE, HomeR, and HGD in an ecologically consistent model (see 'Materials and methods'). Weekly releases of drive homozygous males (20% of the population size) were performed for up to 13 weeks (3 months, approximately one field season), and the female population was then tested for carrier frequency above 95% at any point within the subsequent 4 years. (<bold>B</bold>) Same setup as (<bold>A</bold>), but now the female populations were measured for how many days the carrier frequency remained above 95%, starting at the first release, lasting up to 4 years.

(<bold>C</bold>) Simulations of two-locus (split-drive) versions of ClvR, TARE, HomeR, and HGD in an ecologically consistent model (see 'Materials and methods').

Male releases were 20% of the total population size, and the female population was measured for drive carrier frequency, not Cas9 frequency, above 95%. (<bold>D</bold>) Using the data from (<bold>C</bold>), we applied the method from (<bold>B</bold>) to measure the WOP, where the drive carrier frequency remained above 95% in the female population.

For split-drive designs, only the first release was homozygous Cas9 and gene drive, while supplementary releases were homozygous Cas9 only (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Faber et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Oberhofer et al., 2020a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Oberhofer et al., 2020b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Oberhofer et al., 2019</xref>). A similar pattern of efficacy is seen for ClvR, TARE, and HomeR, but by splitting the HGD and maintaining the fitness effects on the Cas9 allele, it is now able to reach 95% introgression over a small parameter range. Additionally, as fitness costs are predominantly associated with the Cas9 allele and not the effector gene, all constructs were adequate at maintaining effector allele frequency in the population over a long period of time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Taken together, these results suggest that multi-releases would be sufficient to ensure HomeR spreads and persists stably in a population.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We have engineered a system we term HomeR, for population modification that mitigates some issues related to drive resistance. To limit the potential for inducing functional resistant alleles, an essential gene required for insect viability was strategically targeted. Multigenerational population drive experiments indicate that <italic>PolG2<sup>HomeR</sup></italic> can spread and persist efficiently in the presence of Cas9, and this persistence is not impacted by induced resistant alleles, including functional resistant alleles (non-silent R1), mitigating a major challenge for population modification HGDs that are not designed to target essential genes.</p><p>The re-coded rescue strategy that we used to develop HomeR was also used in previous <italic>Drosophila</italic> TA non-HGDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Champer et al., 2020a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Oberhofer et al., 2020a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Oberhofer et al., 2020b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Oberhofer et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A–B</xref>) and recent HGDs in both <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Champer et al., 2020b</xref>) and <italic>Anopheles stephensi</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adolfi et al., 2020</xref>), though each of these examples suffered from potential drawbacks. For example, both the haplolethal HGD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Champer et al., 2020b</xref>) and the TARE design (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Champer et al., 2020a</xref>) share similar problematic design architectures that can be unstable as they are susceptible to functional resistant alleles induced via recombination between the promoter including sequences 5’ of the coding sequence and 3’ UTR regions, which are identical between the re-coded sequence and the <italic>wt</italic> sequence (Figure 2—figure supplement 1C in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Champer et al., 2020a</xref> and Figure 2 in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Champer et al., 2020b</xref>). Moreover, a haplolethal HGD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Champer et al., 2020b</xref>) that biases transmission in females requires a strict germline-specific promoter that limits maternal carryover, otherwise LBM, either mono- or biallelic, may result in dominant negative fitness costs to its carrier (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1E</xref>) and impede drive spread. In fact, our efforts to find such promoters in <italic>Drosophila</italic> proved exceedingly difficult—with previously tested ‘germline-specific’ promoters such as <italic>nanos</italic> and <italic>vasa</italic> showing significant somatic activity at multiple insertion sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kandul et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kandul et al., 2019</xref>). The recent HGD in <italic>A. stephensi</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adolfi et al., 2020</xref>) was designed to target and rescue a non-essential gene for viability (i.e. the eye pigmentation <italic>kynurenine hydroxylase</italic> gene), whose disruption was pleiotropic and only partially costly to female fecundity and survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adolfi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gantz et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Pham et al., 2019</xref>). Notwithstanding, this drive spread efficiently in small, multigenerational laboratory population cages under several release thresholds; however, many drives did not reach, nor maintain, complete fixation presumably due to the viability and partial fertility of drive generated homozygous LOF resistant alleles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>), underscoring the critical importance of targeting a recessive essential gene for such drives especially for larger releases. Comparatively, the ClvR system is quite stable, however, it can be cumbersome to engineer—requiring re-coding of the essential rescue gene, including all target sequences within the coding sequence (lacking introns), and uses an exogenous promoter and 3’ UTR, necessitating precise titration of expression from a distal genomic location with exogenous sequences to guarantee rescue without imposing deleterious fitness costs. These features may be difficult to accomplish for essential genes requiring complex regulatory elements and networks not directly adjacent to the target gene. In contrast to the aforementioned drives, (i) HomeR relies on the endogenous promoter sequence of the target gene to facilitate rescue expression which significantly simplifies the design and ensures endogenous expression of the rescue using native regulatory machinery, (ii) creatively designed to target the 3’ end of the essential gene to limit the degree of re-coding required for the rescue, (iii) an exogenous 3’ UTR to prevent deleterious recombination, and (iv) exploits LBM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kandul et al., 2019</xref>) by targeting an essential gene to ensure recessive non-functional resistant alleles result in dominant deleterious/lethal mutations that are actively selected out of a population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>), four important design features that distinguish HomeR from other population modification drives.</p><p>Our findings are congruent with previous studies demonstrating reduced homing in <italic>Drosophila</italic> males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Windbichler et al., 2011</xref>). We tested multiple Cas9 lines supporting Cas9 expression in early and/or late germ cells with different levels of specificity and have not achieved high levels of homing as reported in Anopheline mosquito males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gantz et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kyrou et al., 2018</xref>). Achiasmatic meiosis in <italic>Drosophila</italic> males likely correlates with the weak activity of the HDR pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Preston et al., 2006</xref>), which in turn results in inefficient homing in <italic>Drosophila</italic> males. Mosquito males have chiasmatic meiosis and recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kitzmiller, 1976</xref>) that require active HDR machinery in primary spermatocytes, possibly contributing to efficient homing. Reduced homing efficacy in <italic>Drosophila</italic> males should be accounted for when designing HGDs in other species exhibiting achiasmatic meiosis, such as <italic>Drosophila suzukii,</italic> an invasive fruit pest.</p><p>Results from independent multigenerational population cage experiments indicate that <italic>HomeR</italic> spreads and persists efficiently in the <italic>nos-Cas9</italic> genetic background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). As expected, a single copy of the HomeR inserted at an essential gene provides sufficient rescue and complements the corresponding LOF allele. The <italic>PolG2<sup>HomeR</sup></italic> allele persisted for 10 generations in control cage populations without <italic>Cas9</italic> and its frequency drifted &gt;50%, underscoring the lack of major fitness costs to <italic>PolG2<sup>HomeR</sup></italic>. The LOF alleles complemented by <italic>PolG2<sup>HomeR</sup></italic> also persisted for many generations after a carrier frequency reached 100%. Once LOF alleles are complemented by the <italic>PolG2<sup>HomeR</sup></italic> allele, it takes several generations for LOF alleles to combine as lethal homozygotes and be negatively selected out of the population. The slow-acting elimination of LOF alleles takes especially long time by HGDs targeting non-essential genes or genes whose disruption does not cause complete lethality or sterility of homozygous carriers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adolfi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gantz et al., 2015</xref>) underscoring the importance of targeting essential genes.</p><p>Functional resistant (R1) alleles are a problematic feature shared universally by many kinds of gene drives. These alleles can still be induced even when an essential gene required for insect viability is targeted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). However, it should be noted that here we did not identify any silent R1 mutations (i.e. mutations that change the DNA sequence but not the protein AA sequence) which would be expected to be fitness neutral. Each identified in-frame non-silent <italic>PolG2<sup>R1</sup></italic> allele we found changed at least one AA and thus may still affect the fitness of its carrier, especially since we are targeting an essential gene, preventing such alleles from accumulating at the expense of the drive. Indeed, we observed that functional R1 alleles imposed fitness costs on seven female carriers sampled in drive populations #4 and #5. This fitness cost likely limits their accumulation and results in negative selection out of the population, in favor of the <italic>PolG2<sup>HomeR</sup></italic> alleles, over multiple generations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–B</xref>) again underscoring the importance of targeting an essential gene. Nevertheless, multiplexing by encoding additional gRNAs into HomeR may further diminish the probability of inducing functional resistant alleles and further increase drive stability, spread, and persistence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Champer et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">KaramiNejadRanjbar et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Marshall et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Oberhofer et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Splitting HomeR into two genetic loci (<italic>HomeR</italic> and <italic>Cas9</italic>) integrated on different chromosomes serves as an important molecular containment mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Akbari et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Long et al., 2020</xref>). The <italic>HomeR</italic> element is able to home into <italic>wt</italic> alleles and bias its transmission. However, the <italic>Cas9</italic> element, which is inherited Mendelianly, is required for its homing. Therefore, the independent assortment of <italic>Cas9</italic> and <italic>HomeR</italic> limits the spread of <italic>HomeR</italic> and acts as a genetic ‘brake’ for the invasion of HomeR. The spread dynamic of split-HGDs resembles that of high-threshold drives and thus requires a high introduction rate for HomeR to spread into a local population and prevents its spread into neighboring populations, which is an important feature for confining drive spread and may be necessary for initial field testing of gene drives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adelman et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Akbari et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Friedman et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kandul et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Li et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Raban and Akbari, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Raban et al., 2020</xref>). Moreover, HomeR can be further confined by fitness costs to either the HomeR drive itself or to the <italic>Cas9</italic> element, and our experiments revealed that the Cas9 element imposed significant fitness costs that can impede drive invasion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Notwithstanding, even with significant fitness costs, multiple releases of the HomeR could still enable drive spread and long-term persistence as evidenced by mathematical models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). As an additional safety measure, if unintended consequences arise, HomeR’s spread can be reversed by reintroduction of insects harboring <italic>wt</italic> alleles of the gene targeted. Notwithstanding, if desired, HomeR could facilely be converted into a non-localized gene drive by incorporating the Cas9 into the HomeR drive cassette and our modeling illustrates that it could perform quite well under this configuration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B</xref>). Taken together, the split-drive design of HomeR is a safe localized gene drive technology that could be widely adopted and implemented for local population control, and if a non-localized drive is desired for more wide scale spread, HomeR could be adapted for that purpose too.</p><p>In sum, HomeR combines promising aspects of current population modification drives—confinablity, high transmission of HGDs, and resilience to EJ generated resistant alleles (R2 type and R1 type that induces a fitness cost) similar to TA drives (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Modeling illustrates success of both design aspects in linked or split-drive form, demonstrating robust behavior over a range of parameter combinations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>). This underscores its stability and resilience to EJ alleles, overcoming a significant hurdle for current HGD designs. Given the simplicity of the HomeR design, it could be universally adapted to a wide range of species including human disease vectors in the future.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source <break/>or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top"> Strain, strain background (<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>gRNA#1<sup>PolG2</sup></italic></td><td valign="top">159674</td><td valign="top">91378</td><td valign="top">This publication</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"> Strain, strain background (<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>gRNA#2<sup>PolG2</sup></italic></td><td valign="top">159675</td><td valign="top">n/a</td><td valign="top">This publication</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"> Strain, strain background (<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>HomeR<sup>PolG2</sup></italic></td><td valign="top">159676</td><td valign="top">Gene drives cannot be deposited at BDSC</td><td valign="top">This publication</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"> Strain, strain background (<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>HomeR(B)<sup>PolG2</sup></italic></td><td valign="top">159677</td><td valign="top">Gene drives cannot be deposited at BDSC</td><td valign="top">This publication</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"> Strain, strain background (<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>nos-Cas9</italic></td><td valign="top">112685</td><td valign="top">79004</td><td valign="top">30622266</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"> Strain, strain background (<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>vas-Cas9</italic></td><td valign="top">112686</td><td valign="top">79005</td><td valign="top">30622266</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"> Strain, strain background (<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>Uniq-Cas9</italic></td><td valign="top">112687</td><td valign="top">79006</td><td valign="top">30622266</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"> Strain, strain background (<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>Act5C-Cas9</italic></td><td valign="top">n/a</td><td valign="top">54590</td><td valign="top">25002478</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"> Strain, strain background (<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>exuL-Cas9</italic></td><td valign="top">159671</td><td valign="top">91375</td><td valign="top">This publication</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"> Strain, strain background (<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>Rcd1r-Cas9</italic></td><td valign="top">159673</td><td valign="top">91377</td><td valign="top">This publication</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"> Strain, strain background (<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>bTub-Cas9</italic></td><td valign="top">159672</td><td valign="top">91376</td><td valign="top">This publication</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Selection of Cas9/gRNA target sites</title><p>We inserted a HomeR in <italic>DNA Polymerase gamma subunit 2</italic> (<italic>PolG2</italic> or <italic>Pol-γ35</italic>, CG33650). <italic>PolG2</italic> is an essential gene required for insect viability.

Offspring genotype follows a multinomial distribution informed by the composite mated female genotype and the inheritance pattern of the gene drive system. Sex distribution of offspring follows a binomial distribution, assuming equal probability for each sex. Female and male adults from each generation are then sampled equally to seed the next generation, with a sample size of 400 individuals (200 female and 200 male), following a multivariate hypergeometric distribution. Twenty-five repetitions were run for each drive in the trace plots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and C</xref>), and 100 repetitions were run for each parameter combination in the heatmaps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and D</xref>).</p><p>The inheritance pattern is captured by the ‘inheritance cube’ module of MGDrivE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sanchez et al., 2019</xref>). ClvR and TARE constructs were implemented to match their published descriptions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Champer et al., 2020a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Oberhofer et al., 2020a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Oberhofer et al., 2019</xref>). HomeR and HGD were implemented as one- or two-locus systems following equivalent inheritance rules. When Cas9 and gRNAs co-occur in the same individual, <italic>wt</italic> alleles are cleaved at a rate <italic>c<sub>F</sub></italic> (<italic>c<sub>M</sub></italic>) (female- (male-) specific cleavage), with 1-<italic>c<sub>F</sub></italic> (1 <italic>c<sub>M</sub></italic>) remaining <italic>wt</italic>. Given cleavage, successful HDR occurs at a rate <italic>ch<sub>F</sub></italic> (<italic>ch<sub>M</sub></italic>), with 1-<italic>ch<sub>F</sub></italic> (1-<italic>ch<sub>M</sub></italic>) alleles undergoing some form of EJ. Of these, a proportion, <italic>cr<sub>F</sub></italic> (<italic>cr<sub>M</sub></italic>), are in-frame EJ alleles, while the remainder, 1-<italic>cr<sub>F</sub></italic> (1-<italic>cr<sub>M</sub></italic>), are LOF alleles. Maternal carryover (maternal deposition, or maternal perdurance) was modeled to occur in zygotes of mothers having both Cas9 and gRNAs, impacting a proportion, <italic>d<sub>F</sub></italic>, of zygotes. Of the <italic>wt</italic> alleles in impacted zygotes, a proportion, <italic>dr<sub>F</sub></italic>, become in-frame EJ alleles, while the remainder, 1-<italic>dr<sub>F</sub></italic>, become LOF alleles. These inheritance rules apply to both HomeR and HGD, with differing fitness costs.</p><p>ClvR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Oberhofer et al., 2020a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Oberhofer et al., 2019</xref>) was modeled using a 99% cleavage rate in female and male germ cells, as well as in embryos from maternal carryover. For two-locus ClvR, the two loci were assumed to undergo independent assortment (≥50 cM separation), as was assumed for all two-locus systems in this analysis. For both configurations, it was assumed that 0.1% of cleaved alleles were converted to functional resistant alleles (R1 type), and the rest became LOF alleles (R2 type). In addition to the 50% egg-hatching reduction due to the non-homing drive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A–B</xref>), an additional 5% reduction in fecundity was applied to females that harbored Cas9. For consistency, TARE, HGD, and HomeR (for ideal parameters) also used a cleavage rate of 99% in females and males, though TARE demonstrated lower maternal carryover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Champer et al., 2020a</xref>), and was modeled with 95% cleavage. HGD and HomeR (for ideal parameters), which rely on HDR, were simulated with 90% HDR rates in females and males. Cleaved alleles that did not undergo HDR were assumed to be R1 alleles with proportion 0.5%, and R2 LOF alleles the remainder of the time. TARE and HomeR were also modeled with a small (5%) fitness reduction, applied as a reduction of female fecundity. Since an HGD does not provide a rescue for a disrupted target gene, its carriers demonstrate higher fitness costs and were assigned a 20% fitness reduction with the assumption that the HGD is inserting into a non-lethal gene that imposes a low/moderate fitness cost. Experimentally derived parameters for HomeR differed from ideal parameters in two ways: (i) there was no HDR in males (although cleavage remained the same) and (ii) 1% of EJ-repaired <italic>wt</italic> alleles were converted into R1 alleles (cf. 0.5% for the ideal case).</p><p>To determine the number of releases required to introgress effector genes into 95% of the female portion of a population, and ascertain how long that introgression could be effective (up to 4 years; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), we performed simulations using the full version of MGDrivE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sanchez et al., 2019</xref>), implementing overlapping generations and density-dependent growth effects on aquatic stages. All gene drive characteristics were maintained as stated above. For one-locus designs, male releases, up to 13, were performed at 20% of the total population size (10,000). For two-locus designs, the first release was males homozygous for Cas9 and gene drive, but subsequent releases were only homozygous for Cas9. The two-locus releases were 20% of the total population size. Life cycle parameters are: 2 days for egg maturation, 5 days for larval maturation, 1 day for pupal maturation, and an expected adult lifespan of 11 days (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Li et al., 2020</xref>).

eLife publishes the most substantive revision requests and the accompanying author responses.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Acceptance summary:</bold></p><p>The paper describes and tests a gene drive system by inserting a synthetic rescue gene into an essential gene that also contains the gRNA (gene drive) but not the Cas9 (safe split gene drive). Although there are clearly some limitations to the effectiveness of the drive, to a large extent due to the fitness cost of Cas-9, this new strategy will be a useful path to follow in order to thwart evolution of resistance to the drive. This will move the field forward in getting researchers to broaden their efforts in development of gene drives for specific purposes.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>[Editors’ note: the authors submitted for reconsideration following the decision after peer review. What follows is the decision letter after the first round of review.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;A home and rescue gene drive efficiently spreads and persists in populations&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by a Senior Editor, a Reviewing Editor, and four reviewers. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Ernst A Wimmer (Reviewer #2).</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we feel that the paper is of significant conceptual and practical interest but it is lacking in several points that should absolutely be addressed before the paper can be considered. I therefore we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered for publication in <italic>eLife</italic> but we strongly encourage you to submit a new manuscript once these points have been addressed carefully, which should take a significant amount of time. I wish to emphasize that the reviewers would like this paper to be published in <italic>eLife</italic> but it needs this additional work. The reviewers all also strongly believe that the presentation of the paper needs to be seriously fixed to make it simpler and targeted to a wide audience, which will be very interested by these results.</p><p>The following points must be addressed as they are the two main points the manuscript is trying to make but they are not well supported:</p><p>– The major claim of the paper, the release of the drive into a wild type population with no Cas9 must be investigated as there is no practical demonstration of a split drive.</p><p>– There is also no final demonstration of the repression of R1 alleles: The strategy for sampling resistance appears to not be appropriate and must be changed as suggested by reviewer #4.</p><p>– The paper claims to have used an ultra conserved gene. As so much importance is placed on the drive design overcoming resistance, this must be demonstrated. A gene that is considered as ultra conserved would require that there is little or no nucleotide variation (e.g. <italic>dsx</italic> in the Kyrou et al.,). Conservation at the protein level does little to protect against synonymous mutants that would constitute resistance. A better justification for this choice and a demonstration that it was indeed the right choice must be presented.</p><p>– The data are really presented in a very difficult way and the paper must be extensively revised with a much broader audience in mind.</p><p>– The reviewers did a very thorough review of the paper that should help you to improve it. The individual reviews are included below.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This paper shows that Cas 9 mediated homology directed repair can be used to insert at synthetic rescue gene into an essential gene, here mitochondrial <italic>Pol-γ35</italic> was chosen. The insertion is marked by an eyeless-GFP reporter and also contains the gRNA (gene drive) but not the Cas9 (considered as a safe split gene drive). 'Homing' of the eye-GFP is assayed to detect insertion at the homologous locus when Cas9 is present by HDR.</p><p>The authors show that this works well in the female germline with various tested Cas9 lines (vas, nos, Act5C and ubiq-Cas9). In all cases close to 100% transmission to the homologous locus on the homologous chromosome is achieved when an effective guide RNA is used. Hence, eye GFP transmits (“homes”) in a “super-Mendelian” ratio at the chosen target. A male specific transmission works less well (exuL-Cas9).</p><p>The reason why it works well appears to be that the chosen target is an essential gene (<italic>Pol-γ35</italic>) in which small changes caused by NHEJ that result in homing “resistant” alleles will be loss of function alleles and hence will not spread in the population.</p><p>Unfortunately, the authors did not test, how the drive could spread in a wild type population (no Cas9 expression). I am also missing a test relevant for pest studies that would achieve the spread of a potentially deleterious or beneficial insertion that could kill a population or make it resistant to a disease.</p><p>1) This paper is very hard to read. Sentences are excessively long and complicated. References to the Figures appear not always correct.</p><p>2) Figure 1. Genotypes in Figure 1A are unreadable in the print version because of the small font. Are the 2 crossing schemes required that only differ in gRNA1 or gRNA2? The surviving progeny should be quantified as in Figure 1B. Figure 1B shows nos-Cas9 and not act-Cas9 results (several typos in subsection “Design and testing of gRNAs targeting an essential gene”).</p><p>Figure 1C: the incidence of heterozygous, homozygous and “resistant” cells is schematic and not supported by data, hence questionable if Figure 1C should be shown in results.</p><p>3) Figure 2. Genotypes not readable in print. Is it necessary to show schemes of the procedure how transgenic flies were generated and how the <italic>Pol-γ 35</italic> HomeR were made with all chromosomes detailed (Figure 1D)? This could move to the Materials and methods, as it is standard and we learn not much new.</p><p>4) More typos: Subsection “Assessment of germline transmission and cleavage rates”: Figure 2B is the wrong reference; Actic 5C should read Actin 5C.

This is similar to Figure 4C, but the only the Home R males or females would carry the Cas9.

However, before publication can be supported there are a number of things that should be addressed to improve the manuscript for better comprehension by readers.</p><p>Overall the manuscript presents a load of data. But the presentation of these data could be made in a better digestible way. The authors should go over their maunscript with a reader in mind, that is interested but not necessarily knows all the relevant literature in the very detail.</p><p>Abstract: Please remove &quot;inherently confinable&quot; from the Abstract. The drive is indeed designed in a split drive design, however, all the experiments were done in a homozygous Cas9 background. Therefore, there are no experimental data for a split drive provided in this manuscript. The split situation seems to be here more of a practical reason to be allowed to do the experiments in a less stringent laboratory environment. Thus there are no experimental data that would support the confineable nature of this drive. Actually there are not even modelling data to this. Thus, such a statement should not be put in the Abstract. This manuscript is not a demonstration of a confineable drive.</p><p>Results: How was <italic>Pol-γ35</italic> identified? It would be interesting to the reader to get to know about the exact reasoning, why this gene was chosen. Or were there several ones chosen before and this turned out to work the best or was the easiest to design. This could be very interesting considerations important to the field.</p><p>Results (Figure 1B; Figure 1C) and Materials and methods and Figure 1 (both Figure and legend):</p><p>The addressing of the Figure panels and the writing to it don't fit. Has there been a rearrangement of the Figure that was not worked through the text?</p><p>When referring to &quot;B&quot; in the text, it is still about Act5C-Cas9 and the nos-Cas9 data are in the text referred to Figure 1C. But Figure 1C is BLM.</p><p>In current panel Figure 1B, what does &quot;all&quot; mean below the X-axis? This is not comprehensible. Panel C is not really described in the Figure legend.</p><p>Results, Discussion, and Figure 1—figure supplement 4 legend. &quot;converting recessive non-functional resistant alleles into dominant deleterious /lethal mutations&quot; is completely misleading. There is no &quot;conversion&quot; and how should that be done molecularly. There is a continuous removal of such alleles from the population because of lethal transheterozygous conditions caused in the drive. However, there is no active conversion of such alleles into dominant lethal ones. This needs to be clearly rewritten to avoid the misleading idea.</p><p>Figure 1—figure supplement 4 also seems to have a slight conceptional problem. What are &quot;cells&quot; (rectangles) with a red frame and a green core? Green means at least one wt allele (this must include the recoded rescue allele.). Red means biallelic knock-out: thus a red cell cannot have a wt allele. Thus what is a red-framed green core cell?</p><p>To explain the removal of R2 alleles, a depiction of yellow framed red core cells in the germ line would be helpful, since this would explain how R2 alleles are selected against and might be continuously removed from the population.</p><p>Results: Before going into the modelling, the reader should be clearly informed about all the different approaches that are now to be compared. This is currently not done well, if at all. Thus moving current Figure 6 before current Figure 5 might clearly help. Also a better explanation of the panels in Figure 6 is necessary as well as a correction of Fig6 Panel E.</p><p>A comparison of a great number of the currently approached toxin-antidote (gene destruction – rescue, but not killer-rescue.) systems is greatly appreciated. However, the authors cannot expect the general reader to know about the small detailed differences between the systems that are compared here. Thus the authors need to do some explanation and categorization of the different approaches here and also cite all the respective literature.</p><p>– First subdivision: Non-homing (interference-based drives) VERSUS Homing (thus overreplication-based drives). This will also help then to better understand, why the interference-based drives (TARE and ClvR) are more sensitive to fitness parameters than overreplication drives.</p><p>– Second subdivision: same-site VERSUS distant site. This is important to understand the difference between the here modelled TARE and the CLvR. Actually ClvR is a TARE, but you use TARE here more specifically as the results in the respective paper are demonstrating only a same-site TARE. But this needs to be clearly stated here.</p><p>– Third subdivision: viable VERSUS haplosufficient VERSUS haploinsufficient. This also needs to be clearly depicted in labellling panels C to F of Figure 6, which are currently hard to grasp what the essential differences are, before looking at the panels in detail:</p><p>C: HGD of viable gene (HGD)</p><p>D: HGD of viable gene with rescue (HGD+R)</p><p>E: HGD of haploinsufficient gene with rescue (HGD-hi+R). This panel needs major correction.</p><p>F: HGD of haplosufficient (essential) gene with rescue (HomeR)</p><p>– Fourth subdivision: split VERSUS non-split. Here for the split HGD situation, the respective papers of which the current authors are co-authors should be cited: Kandul et al., 2020 and Li et al. 2020. In addition, it is also important to state clearly that &quot;split or two locus&quot; is completely independent of the &quot;distant site&quot; concept.</p><p>The reader needs to understand the differences of the systems that are compared here, without having the reader to go to the respective publications themselves and then try to find out what the differences really are. This is not so obvious and the current authors have a clear chance here to do that and help the reader in the mists of all this similar but still distinct approaches.</p><p>Figure 6 Panel E: This depiction is not consistent within itself, not consistent with the legend, and not consistent with the cited literature.</p><p>– Why should the rescuing drive construct over the wt allele be lethal as indicated in the right two boxes?</p><p>– The cited paper Champer et al., 2020b clearly states that there is maternal carry over, which actually makes it so hard to use and is probably only working via male propagation. In the Figure legend it is said that &quot;maternal carryover and somatic expression.… are empirically unavoidable&quot;, which is contrast to the depiction. The legend then also states that this is &quot;unachievable&quot;. This should be better replaced by &quot;hard to achieve&quot;, since the approach is published and seems to drive, even though probably just via the males. Thus the depiction of panel E needs to be thoroughly revised.</p><p>Discussion: The haplolethal HGD works (admittingly poorly) despite the maternal carryover (Champer et al., 2020b). Therefore, your statement needs to be refined or deleted: &quot;requires germline-specific promoter that lacks maternal carryover&quot; is not consistent with the published paper. The drive could go via the males because then you do not have maternal carry over. And homing based drives can go via males and do not necessarily have to be promoted through females, see also KaramiNejadRanjbar et al., 2018.</p><p>Discussion. This sentence is based on an old but clearly overruled idea. NHEJ repair is not restricted to a time before the fusion of the paternal and maternal genetic material. It has been clearly demonstrated that R1 and R2 alleles are generated in the early embryo also after the zygote state (Champer et al., 2017, KaramiNejadRanjbar et al., 2018). Actually, all of the authors' Figure 1C and Figure 1—figure supplement 4 are about NHEJ mutation in the early embryo causing &quot;BLM&quot;. Thus this sentence is inconsistent with current believes and also with the authors' own writing.</p><p>Figure 4: Panel C graph: Why is in the controls the transgene consistently and significantly higher inherited to the next generation (0). It is about 75% progeny sired by the transgenic fathers compared to the wild type fathers? Was there an age advantage of the transgenic ones or whatever other fitness factor? This is surprising and no explanation is given at all.</p><p>In contrast, in the Cas9 background, in generation 0 less than 50% carry the drive allele, which is probably due to induced lethality. But this should also be commented on.</p><p>In the legend it is stated that 7 of 9 flies carried an R1 allele heterozygous to an R2 allele. What about the other two?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The authors are to be commended for the effort put into careful experimental design and clear presentation of methods and results.</p><p>My main concern with the manuscript is that the claim about their specific polymerase gene being &quot;ultraconserved&quot; is not backed up with their own data or by citations from the literature. If the gene sequence was ultra-conserved, I wouldn't have expected the authors to be able to do so much recoding of the gene without fitness consequences. Furthermore, it is clear that homozyogous-viable NHEJ mutations did develop in the experiment. Without explanation, this seems to be a fatal flaw in the design.</p><p>This manuscript describes a modification of the general homing gene drive concept by use of a split drive system that increases the frequency of a recoded polymerase gene that replaces a cleavage susceptible, naturally occurring, haplosufficient, conserved polymerase gene. This approach is taken in order to limit the evolution of cleavage resistance in the naturally occurring gene.</p><p>As mentioned in the summary, I am not convinced that the research presented achieves the intended goals. I did a quick look for literature on the &quot;ultraconserved&quot; polymerase pol-y35 gene a could find none. I am not sure if the conservation is at the DNA sequence level or at the amino acid level. If at the amino acid level, then it makes sense that resistance alleles can form at the DNA level that don't impact the protein at all. Figure 2A shows the 22 and 27 recoded nucleotides for the two guide RNA sites. The authors say that these changes to the sequences didn't seem to impede fitness. Did the authors try many other recodings and finally decide on these because all others caused loss of fitness, or is it just that this gene is robust to substitutions even though the protein is conserved.</p><p>Figure 4C shows that the frequency of flies with at least one copy of the pol-y35home R1 increased from about 25% to about 50% between the parental and F0 generation when there was no Cas9 present. As long as the transgenic males were competitive with the wild flies this makes sense because the released flies were homozygous for that allele and the offspring should all have inherited one copy of the gene. What doesn't make sense is that when the work was done with all flies harboring the Cas9, the pol-y35home R1 increased less than in the former case, from the parental to generation F0, the frequency of flies with the pol-y35home R1. In some replicates the frequency of such flies didn't increase at all. It should be noted that the parents were always homozygous. This certainly indicates a fitness cost to the flies with a combination of Cas9 and the homing construct.</p><p>In this same Figure, results from the model are plotted. It seems like the model assumes no fitness cost because it shows an exact increase from 25% to 50% flies carrying at least on copy of the pol-y35home R1 theoretical construct. In later generations the experimental results outperform the model. Presumably, this model is used to construct Figure 6. This mismatch needs to be addressed in the manuscript.</p><p>The fact that in all three replicates of the experiment without Cas9, the F0 is above 50% indicates that something else may be going on that is unrelated to gene drive. It could be due to heterosis between the two slightly different strains of flies. When wildtype males mate with wildtype females, the offspring are more inbred than when a transgenic male mates with a wildtype female. -just a hypothesis.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #4:</italic></p><p>Gene drives can be used for sustainable control of disease vectors, and there is a need for a different gene drive strategies that can be tailored to the particular species, timescale, and desired spatial spread. Kandul and colleagues present a welcome new addition to the growing number of strategies for gene drive, called HomeR, that combines elements of killer-rescue and homing-based drive to exert spatiotemporal control over its spread, whilst counteracting the rise of resistant mutations. Whilst it is extremely promising, some major claims of this manuscript are inaccurate or unsupported by the evidence. The authors could easily address the most important concerns by expanding their sequencing analysis to better detect and quantify resistant mutations, paying careful attention not to overstress the potential of this drive to mitigate resistance, and by comparing the relative strengths of different drive strategies instead of focussing only on features that are most flattering to the HomeR strategy.</p><p>1) The drive release strategy of Figure 4A and 4C are primed to underestimate and potentially mask resistance. In Figure 4A, where the authors search for signs of resistance, the population was seeded with males that were all homozygous for the drive, meaning that 100% of their G0 progeny will inherit it. As the rate of homing is close to 99%, only a small fraction of their G1 could have inherited a non-drive (potentially resistant allele) allele. In a realistic release scenario, resistant alleles will have ample opportunity to be generated and subsequently selected. Though still far from adequate, resistance testing would have been better performed on samples collected from the lower frequency releases in panel C. This experiment should not be used to draw strong conclusions about resistance to pHomeR, but should be used to make broader observations regarding the spread and stability of the construct.</p><p>2) The strategy for sampling resistance will obscure almost all resistance in the population, and would fail to detect even a strong selection for it. Flies were only selected for resistance genotyping if they lacked GFP, meaning they carry two non-HomeR alleles (i.e. homozygous for the R1 allele or transheterozygous with another R1/R2/WT). One would expect most resistant alleles to be heterozygous in a population that was seeded with almost complete drive homozygosity. The authors could, and should, have done more to identify and quantify these. Amplicon sequencing was used to sample the full diversity of alleles in a larger pool of individuals (including GFP+ flies) collected at G10, why was this approach not used throughout? By adopting the approach earlier they would have been able to track the changing frequencies of R1 and R2 alleles over time.</p><p>3) The impression given in the Figure and main text is that R1 alleles were rare (or entirely absent), when they were not. In spite of the incredible advantage given to the drive, and a bias in sampling method that would mask the presence of resistant alleles, resistance was observed in every generation tested (G2, G3 and G10). The authors claim that because GFP- individuals were not observed in later generations, the resistant alleles had not come under positive selection. This logic is flawed, and indeed their own amplicon sequencing analysis performed on G10 flies revealed several resistant alleles, including an R1 present in 80% of non-drive alleles. The two most frequent mutant alleles detected were in frame, and I do not agree that these are likely to be deleterious recessive (as the authors speculated). These could be functionally resistant mutations. I believe there were many more R1 alleles in heterozygosity with the HomeR allele, these alleles could have been spreading, but were excluded from the genotyping analysis. Could these putative R1 individuals not have been specifically tested to see if they do, or do not confer resistance?</p><p>4) The modelling takes a very limited approach to comparing different drive strategies, and by comparing proof-of-principle designs, important differences are obscured. For example, simple modifications that would mitigate resistance are likely to be included in many designs – such as multiplexing gRNAs. The nuances of each design are lost in a discussion focused on the rate of spread, which is largely irrelevant now because all of drives are predicted to spread well.</p><p>5) The authors did not discuss the relevance of having performed releases in a population that was already homozygous for Cas9. Do the release experiments and model really suggest the drive could spread if released into an otherwise WT population? I'm not sure the data presented in this manuscript can support that claim.</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your revised article &quot;A home and rescue gene drive efficiently spreads and persists in populations&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

The finding that the Cas9 has a fitness cost explains some of the previous results. This must have been a lot of work, but I think it was worth the effort.</p><p>I appreciate that the authors have removed the term &quot;ultra-conserved&quot;, but I am still not comfortable with their use of the term &quot;conserved&quot; in relationship to the focus of the manuscript on gene drive. It's not just the term, but the expectation that this will be a stable drive system. Even with the small sample size in the current laboratory experiments (compared to what would be expected for the size of the target population in a field release) mutations arose that seemed to have no fitness consequence in males even as single copies with an LOF copy. Isn't it therefore reasonable to expect mutations to arise due to NHEJ that wouldn't have fitness effects on males and females? Beyond that, wouldn't a natural population be expected to already harbor some genotypes that would be immediately resistant to this drive? The authors should clearly address why they don't expect this problem with using their design outside of the lab.</p><p>In Figure 1—figure supplement 4, the authors show amino acid sequences that appear to be consensus sequences. What is important for this paper is understanding how much variation exists in the DNA sequence for the 3' end part of the domain of the gene for <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> and other potential targets of gene drive. At least for <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> there are many sequences available. Such data may also be available for some other pest insects. Before this paper is accepted, I think it behooves the authors to provide information on this issue that could predict whether this drive would really thwart resistance evolution.</p><p>I commend the authors for having done quite a bit of work to simplify the presentation, although, as they say, there is a limit to how much simplification can be done.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>1) The main point from my last review was considering the significance of this study. I suggested to test if this gene drive can spread in wild-type populations not expressing Cas9. The authors have now included data that test this and find the gene drive does not spread, possibly because expressing Cas9 comes at cost of fitness.</p><p>Considering this negative result, I do see limited impact of the presented data as the method does not work in wild populations. This new result contrasts what the authors state at the end of their abstract, that HomeR would work for wild populations. Hence, I feel this paper should be more suitable for a specialized journal. However, I am not a population geneticist. I leave this issue of impact to the other reviewers/editor. I am also not able to judge the usefulness and accuracy of the new simulations presented in Figure 3 and 4, comparing to other methods without doing any experiments.</p><p>2) I appreciate that the authors tried to make this paper more readable. However, I feel there is still a long way to go. Several sentences are still excessively long. 2nd sentence in the introduction extends across 9 lines. Fourth last sentence of intro: 11 lines. Many non-standard abbreviations are used throughout the paper (HG, LBM, EJ, GD, MMEJ, HACK .).</p><p>Figure 1—figure supplement 1C. The genotypes on the crosses shown are still much very small and hence unreadable without zooming in. Why do the authors need to show 2 identical crossing schemes with the only difference that gRNA#1 or #2 was used? This information could simply be listed in a table or as done in FigS1D. The authors describe in an extremely complicated way in the text the simple fact that expression of gRNA#1PolG2 in the presence of Act-Cas9 is killing flies more effectively than gRNA#2 PolG2.</p><p>Fig S2B. Why do we need a figure that shows how to make transgenes in 2 different ways for both HomeR drives? This should be in the methods. There is no discovery shown. In the end, only one line for each HomeR construct in the PolG2 gene is used for the population experiments. Which method was applied to generate this one is not clear. Again, this distracts from the message and makes the paper hard to read.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.65939.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the authors resubmitted a revised version of the paper for consideration.

To strengthen this paper, we have now included a total of three separate multigenerational population cage experiments (15 experiments with replicates in total). These include release of Homer:Cas9 males at 50% in Cas9 background (3 replicates, followed for 10 generations – reaches fixation), and release of Homer:Cas9 males at 25% in Cas9 background (5 replicates, followed for 10 generations – reaches fixation). We also perform a negative control experiment by releasing Homer males at 25% in WT background (3 replicates, followed for 10 generations, does not reach fixation as expected since drive is Cas9 dependent and inherently confineable). In addition to these experiments, we also have included additional experimental data illustrating the behavior of the HomeR system in a wildtype population released at two introduction frequencies. These include the release of HomeR:Cas9 males at50% into a WT background (2 replicates, followed for 6 generations) and the release of HomeR:Cas9 males at75% into a WT background (2 replicates, followed for 6 generations). As expected from all these experiments, the HomeR drive persists/spreads in a Cas9 dependent manner, making the drive inherently confineable.

The drive is indeed designed in a split drive design, however, all the experiments were done in a homozygous Cas9 background.

The split situation seems to be here more of a practical reason to be allowed to do the experiments in a less stringent laboratory environment.

We have modified the figure legend to match the depiction in panel E. The reviewer asks, “Why should the rescuing drive construct over the wt allele be lethal as indicated in the right two boxes?” This results from maternal deposition/somatic expression of Cas9/gRNA acting on the “WT” allele resulting in disruption of that allele. Given that this is targeting a Haploleathal gene – having only one functional copy is not sufficient – hence lethality. From our experiences using the Nanos-Cas9 line, which is the same line used by Champer et al., 2020, we find significant maternal deposition and somatic activity. That said, the reviewer is correct, Champer et al., 2020 reportedly had “minimal somatic expression” from Nanos-Cas9 and therefore we have updated this figure to reflect these findings.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The cited paper Champer et al., 2020b clearly states that there is maternal carry over, which actually makes it so hard to use and is probably only working via male propagation. In the Figure legend it is said that &quot;maternal carryover and somatic expression.… are empirically unavoidable&quot;, which is contrast to the depiction. The legend then also states that this is &quot;unachievable&quot;. This should be better replaced by &quot;hard to achieve&quot;, since the approach is published and seems to drive, even though probably just via the males.

The drive could go via the males because then you do not have maternal carry over.

In general, we were able to identify both allele from sequencing 7 clones.

We thank the reviewer for this comment and have removed the term “ultraconserved” from the manuscript. We have also expanded the discussion on resistant alleles that were viable, and assess their fitness. It should be noted that every drive system is susceptible to resistant alleles and these cannot be 100% avoided by any design. We have not identified any silent R1 allele: every sampled in-frame resistant alleles changes the amino acid sequence of PolG2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>This manuscript describes a modification of the general homing gene drive concept by use of a split drive system that increases the frequency of a recoded polymerase gene that replaces a cleavage susceptible, naturally occurring, haplosufficient, conserved polymerase gene. This approach is taken in order to limit the evolution of cleavage resistance in the naturally occurring gene.</p><p>As mentioned in the summary, I am not convinced that the research presented achieves the intended goals. I did a quick look for literature on the &quot;ultraconserved&quot; polymerase pol-y35 gene a could find none. I am not sure if the conservation is at the DNA sequence level or at the amino acid level. If at the amino acid level, then it makes sense that resistance alleles can form at the DNA level that don't impact the protein at all. Figure 2A shows the 22 and 27 recoded nucleotides for the two guide RNA sites. The authors say that these changes to the sequences didn't seem to impede fitness. Did the authors try many other recodings and finally decide on these because all others caused loss of fitness, or is it just that this gene is robust to substitutions even though the protein is conserved.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment, the term “ultraconserved” was removed from the manuscript. In terms of the fitness question, we did not observe any significant decreases in fitness. Moreover, when Homer was released at 25% allele frequency – it remained relatively stable in 3 multigenerational population cage experiments observed for 10 generations (Figure 2B). Additionally, we targeted the 3’ end of the gene to minimize the degree of recoding required to further minimize potential fitness impacts. To help illustrate the degree of conservation we are referring to – we have provided the sequence alignments in Figure 1—figure supplement 1B.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 4C shows that the frequency of flies with at least one copy of the pol-y35home R1 increased from about 25% to about 50% between the parental and F0 generation when there was no Cas9 present. As long as the transgenic males were competitive with the wild flies this makes sense because the released flies were homozygous for that allele and the offspring should all have inherited one copy of the gene. What doesn't make sense is that when the work was done with all flies harboring the Cas9, the pol-y35home R1 increased less than in the former case, from the parental to generation F0, the frequency of flies with the pol-y35home R1. In some replicates the frequency of such flies didn't increase at all. It should be noted that the parents were always homozygous. This certainly indicates a fitness cost to the flies with a combination of Cas9 and the homing construct.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this comment and agree that there seems to be a major fitness cost when Cas9 is present. In this revision we have provided additional multigenerational population cage experiment data to support this claim. For example, Figure 2C shows HomeR:Nos-Cas9 male releases at two thresholds (25% and 37.5% allele frequencies) into a WT background. In the first couple generations we can see a bit of stochasticity – however at generation 2-onward we see the Nos-Cas9 allele rapidly decline in frequency – heading toward elimination. This illustrates the inherent fitness cost the Cas9 allele carries which can explain the discrepancy this reviewer highlights.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In this same Figure, results from the model are plotted. It seems like the model assumes no fitness cost because it shows an exact increase from 25% to 50% flies carrying at least on copy of the pol-y35home R1 theoretical construct. In later generations the experimental results outperform the model. Presumably, this model is used to construct figure 6. This mismatch needs to be addressed in the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>Our original fits indicated that males experienced very few issues due to expression of Cas9, leading to the near perfect inheritance seen by the reviewer. However, we believe that was an artifact of a Cas9 population, and have since updated our work to reflect the new cage experiments, current Figure 3C, HomeR:Nos-Cas9 released into a WT background. These experiments allowed us to uncover a significant mating reduction in males, due to expression of Cas9, which is also reflected in HomeR-Exp. simulations in figure 5A and 5C. This fitness cost aligns our model with the current experimental work. The model does indeed take into account finess costs and these are more impactful later in the drive spread – but it does not take into account mating competition / inbreeding.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The fact that in all three replicates of the experiment without Cas9, the F0 is above 50% indicates that something else may be going on that is unrelated to gene drive. It could be due to heterosis between the two slightly different strains of flies. When wildtype males mate with wildtype females, the offspring are more inbred than when a transgenic male mates with a wildtype female. -just a hypothesis.</p></disp-quote><p>Heterosis is an interesting hypothesis. We think this is more likely due to stochasticity resulting from small caged populations in addition to the fitness costs associated with Cas9 as articulated above. Regardless, we have provided ample additional multigenerational population data (15 in total) further supporting the conclusion that HomeR can spread in a Cas9 dependent manner.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #4:</p><p>Gene drives can be used for sustainable control of disease vectors, and there is a need for a different gene drive strategies that can be tailored to the particular species, timescale, and desired spatial spread. Kandul and colleagues present a welcome new addition to the growing number of strategies for gene drive, called HomeR, that combines elements of killer-rescue and homing-based drive to exert spatiotemporal control over its spread, whilst counteracting the rise of resistant mutations. Whilst it is extremely promising, some major claims of this manuscript are inaccurate or unsupported by the evidence. The authors could easily address the most important concerns by expanding their sequencing analysis to better detect and quantify resistant mutations, paying careful attention not to overstress the potential of this drive to mitigate resistance, and by comparing the relative strengths of different drive strategies instead of focussing only on features that are most flattering to the HomeR strategy.</p><p>1) The drive release strategy of Figure 4A and 4C are primed to underestimate and potentially mask resistance. In Figure 4A, where the authors search for signs of resistance, the population was seeded with males that were all homozygous for the drive, meaning that 100% of their G0 progeny will inherit it. As the rate of homing is close to 99%, only a small fraction of their G1 could have inherited a non-drive (potentially resistant allele) allele. In a realistic release scenario, resistant alleles will have ample opportunity to be generated and subsequently selected. Though still far from adequate, resistance testing would have been better performed on samples collected from the lower frequency releases in panel C. This experiment should not be used to draw strong conclusions about resistance to pHomeR, but should be used to make broader observations regarding the spread and stability of the construct.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with this reviewer and appreciate this comment. The experiments in Figure 4A (new Figure 2A) were designed to mostly explore the stability of HomeR and “fish out” any frequent R1 resistant allele(s) induced in generation 0. In this new revision we have provided ample new multigenerational population cage experiment data – assessing the performance of HomeR when seeded at lower frequencies (e.g. 25% and 37%). These lower release frequencies have indeed provided opportunities for resistant alleles to be generated and selected at the expense of the HomeR allele, this did not happen. In the presence of Cas9, HomeR spread to the fixation (new Figure 2B). The Drives in new Figure 2C also spread or were able to persist at moderate frequency – but the Cas9 allele had too high of a fitness cost and quickly fell out of the populations – limiting the drive spread ability. That said, we did sample additional R1 resistant alleles from the drives in new Figure 2B – indicating again that these alleles can indeed be generated. However, we crudely assessment of fertility of the sampled R1 alleles before genotyping them; and found the sampled R1 alleles imposed fitness cost to the HomeR- viable females.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The strategy for sampling resistance will obscure almost all resistance in the population, and would fail to detect even a strong selection for it. Flies were only selected for resistance genotyping if they lacked GFP, meaning they carry two non-HomeR alleles (i.e. homozygous for the R1 allele or transheterozygous with another R1/R2/WT). One would expect most resistant alleles to be heterozygous in a population that was seeded with almost complete drive homozygosity. The authors could, and should, have done more to identify and quantify these. Amplicon sequencing was used to sample the full diversity of alleles in a larger pool of individuals (including GFP+ flies) collected at G10, why was this approach not used throughout? By adopting the approach earlier they would have been able to track the changing frequencies of R1 and R2 alleles over time.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that by sequencing every generation would be an ideal approach to assess the fate of all resistant alleles, and would be extremely beneficial for the gene drive field. However, it was beyond the scope and goal of this project. This would be a large, very interesting, and expensive project endeavour, that we would prefer to save for work in an actual pest species (i.e. mosquitoes). Illumina amplicon sequencing was undertaken primarily to see if the R1 alleles identified in generations 2 and 3 persisted until generation 10. Just as a note, we think that due to the HomeR design R2 alleles are not going to block its spread, they can only slow its genotypic fixation. Whereas R1 alleles can block the spread of any homing based gene drive system, including HomeR. We understand that our approach with 320 heterozygous flies at generation 0 is limited -- R1 alleles are hidden by HomeR alleles. WT alleles in heterozygous females will be converted into HomeR alleles, but many WT alleles in heterozygous males will be passed to the next generation as WT, R1 or R2 alleles. Moreover, we have provided additional multigenerational population cage experiments to support the drive propensity, stability and confineability of HomeR. We have also sampled additional R1 resistant alleles from these cage experiments and crudely assess the fitness of their carriers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The impression given in the Figure and main text is that R1 alleles were rare (or entirely absent), when they were not. In spite of the incredible advantage given to the drive, and a bias in sampling method that would mask the presence of resistant alleles, resistance was observed in every generation tested (G2, G3 and G10). The authors claim that because GFP- individuals were not observed in later generations, the resistant alleles had not come under positive selection. This logic is flawed, and indeed their own amplicon sequencing analysis performed on G10 flies revealed several resistant alleles, including an R1 present in 80% of non-drive alleles. The two most frequent mutant alleles detected were in frame, and I do not agree that these are likely to be deleterious recessive (as the authors speculated). These could be functionally resistant mutations. I believe there were many more R1 alleles in heterozygosity with the HomeR allele, these alleles could have been spreading, but were excluded from the genotyping analysis. Could these putative R1 individuals not have been specifically tested to see if they do, or do not confer resistance?</p></disp-quote><p>We removed any indication that these R1 alleles were rare events since they were observed at each generation tested. Moreover, we removed the logic that GFP- individuals were not observed in later generations, the resistant alleles had not come under positive selection. We also added a note into the description of this data indicating the limitation of this analysis: “we cannot rule out the possibility that there were many other potential resistant alleles that were present in the population – that could have been masked by the HomeR allele.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The modelling takes a very limited approach to comparing different drive strategies, and by comparing proof-of-principle designs, important differences are obscured. For example, simple modifications that would mitigate resistance are likely to be included in many designs – such as multiplexing gRNAs. The nuances of each design are lost in a discussion focused on the rate of spread, which is largely irrelevant now because all of drives are predicted to spread well.</p></disp-quote><p>While we appreciate the reviewer’s comments, we consider such “proof-of-principle” constructs demonstrative of any mitigating modifications to these designs. We also think that the rate of gene drive spread is an important parameter since the slower spread can be blocked by the immigration of existent R1 alleles from neighboring populations. Moreover, we have provided additional modelling to this manuscript taking into consideration multi-releases, fitness and transmission rates. We hope these models will help the reader understand and compare the HomeR system to other contemporary drive designs (see response to #5 below).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The authors did not discuss the relevance of having performed releases in a population that was already homozygous for Cas9. Do the release experiments and model really suggest the drive could spread if released into an otherwise WT population? I'm not sure the data presented in this manuscript can support that claim.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct, we did not provide experimental data of HomeR releases into a WT population in our first version of this paper. That said, this revision includes new multigenerational population cage experiments (15 experiments in total – this was A LOT of work) demonstrating HomeR’s drive potential, stability and confineability. Additionally, we have provided additional mathematical models, determining the required number of releases of HomeR, into a naive population, to reach a population frequency of 95%. These simulations implement overlapping generations and density-dependent effects in larval stages (reflecting biological conditions), along with drive efficacy and fitness parameters estimated from the new cage trails, to accurately estimate the behavior of HomeR in the field.</p><p>[Editors’ note: what follows is the authors’ response to the second round of review.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>I commend the authors for conducting additional experiments that enable assessment of the drive dynamics of their strategy under conditions when the split drive is introduced into a lab population without Cas9 and testing the Cas9 independently. The finding that the Cas9 has a fitness cost explains some of the previous results. This must have been a lot of work, but I think it was worth the effort.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this feedback. We agree, this was a significant amount of work – but it was essential to include this additional data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I appreciate that the authors have removed the term &quot;ultra-conserved&quot;, but I am still not comfortable with their use of the term &quot;conserved&quot; in relationship to the focus of the manuscript on gene drive. It's not just the term, but the expectation that this will be a stable drive system. Even with the small sample size in the current laboratory experiments (compared to what would be expected for the size of the target population in a field release) mutations arose that seemed to have no fitness consequence in males even as single copies with an LOF copy. Isn't it therefore reasonable to expect mutations to arise due to NHEJ that wouldn't have fitness effects on males and females? Beyond that, wouldn't a natural population be expected to already harbor some genotypes that would be immediately resistant to this drive? The authors should clearly address why they don't expect this problem with using their design outside of the lab.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this comment and have removed the word conserved throughout the manuscript. We stressed further in the revised version of the manuscript that some functional resistant alleles can exist in natural populations and together with induced functional resistance alleles they can slow down the spread of HomeR and hinder its spread. We agree with the reviewer that eventually functional resistant alleles can be sampled or induced, and no homing gene drive system is completely stable in the face of natural selection. We offer suggestions on how to improve HomeR drive stability by multiplexing gRNAs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Figure 1—figure supplement 4, the authors show amino acid sequences that appear to be consensus sequences. What is important for this paper is understanding how much variation exists in the DNA sequence for the 3' end part of the domain of the gene for <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> and other potential targets of gene drive. At least for <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> there are many sequences available. Such data may also be available for some other pest insects. Before this paper is accepted, I think it behooves the authors to provide information on this issue that could predict whether this drive would really thwart resistance evolution.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you, this is a very great suggestion. We previously sequenced the targeted area in PolG2 in a few <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> lines available in the lab (Oregon, Canton S, etc.), but did not explore the SNP datasets available for <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>. To explore these datasets, we downloaded the <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> Genetic Reference Panel 2 (http://dgrp2.gnets.ncsu.edu) that includes natural variation in genome architecture among 205 <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> Genetic Reference Panel lines (Mackay et al., 2012; Huang et al., 2014) to search for SNPs mapped to the target sequences. Interestingly, we did not find any SNPs mapped to the target sequences. The nearest SNP is located 8 bases downstream from the PAM sequence of gRNA#1 (the blue C in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>). A description of this analysis was added to the revised manuscript. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref> shows the alignment of 63 bases including both gRNAs of 13 <italic>Drosophila</italic> species (consensus) sequences.</p><fig id="sa2fig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-65939-resp-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I commend the authors for having done quite a bit of work to simplify the presentation, although, as they say, there is a limit to how much simplification can be done.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this feedback.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>1) The main point from my last review was considering the significance of this study. I suggested to test if this gene drive can spread in wild-type populations not expressing Cas9. The authors have now included data that test this and find the gene drive does not spread, possibly because expressing Cas9 comes at cost of fitness. Considering this negative result, I do see limited impact of the presented data as the method does not work in wild populations. This new result contrasts what the authors state at the end of their abstract, that HomeR would work for wild populations. Hence, I feel this paper should be more suitable for a specialized journal. However, I am not a population geneticist. I leave this issue of impact to the other reviewers/editor. I am also not able to judge the usefulness and accuracy of the new simulations presented in Figure 3 and 4, comparing to other methods without doing any experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>We have described a novel design of the homing gene drive (HomeR) and thoroughly showed that it spreads via homing by scoring the egg-to-adult rate. The assessment of egg-to-adult rate has only recently become a golden standard for assessment of drive mechanism. We have built HomeR as a split-drive (two-locus) to engineer a biocontainment (safety feature) into its design. The HomeR drive is dependent upon Cas9. When Cas9 levels are high in a population the HomeR spreads to fixation (Figure 2A,B). When Cas9 is introduced at low frequency (25%) and continues to reduce in frequency in subsequent generations (nearing 0 by Gen 6), resulting from inherent fitness costs, HomeR spreads in the first few generations (while Cas9 is higher in frequency) then persists (above &gt;50% frequency in all 4 independent populations tested). This should not be misinterpreted as “ authors have now included data that test this and find the gene drive does not spread, possibly because expressing Cas9 comes at cost of fitness.” This result demonstrates that HomeR can spread and its spread is limited by the availability of Cas9. This result was expected, since it is a biocontainment safety switch incorporated into a split-drive design, and is not a “negative result.” Moreover, it should be noted that we only used one release threshold here, and by providing mathematical modeling we can see that HomeR would perform well under a multi-release scenario (Fig 4) against a WT population. Limiting the spread of a split-drive has been a desirable outcome - and a HomeR drive performed well for this purpose in a WT population.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) I appreciate that the authors tried to make this paper more readable. However, I feel there is still a long way to go. Several sentences are still excessively long. 2nd sentence in the introduction extends across 9 lines. Fourth last sentence of intro: 11 lines. Many non-standard abbreviations are used throughout the paper (HG, LBM, EJ, GD, MMEJ, HACK .).</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this feedback. These sentences have been corrected. In terms of non-standard abbreviations, unfortunately these are all terms that have been used throughout the literature to describe processes related to DNA repair: End Joining (EJ), Microhomology Mediated End Joining (MMEJ), loss-of-function (LOF) alleles, Homology assisted CRISPR Knock-In (HACK), or used throughout the gene drive literature; Homing Gene Drive (HGD) and Lethal Biallelic Mosaicism (LBM). In fact, none of the terms listed are original to this paper and have been adopted from other published work. Therefore, these are standard abbreviations used in this field.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 1-figure supplement 1C. The genotypes on the crosses shown are still much very small and hence unreadable without zooming in. Why do the authors need to show 2 identical crossing schemes with the only difference that gRNA#1 or #2 was used? This information could simply be listed in a table or as done in FigS1D. The authors describe in an extremely complicated way in the text the simple fact that expression of gRNA#1PolG2 in the presence of Act-Cas9 is killing flies more effectively than gRNA#2 PolG2.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this feedback and have increased the font size of Figure 1-figure supplement 1C. We opted to show both crossing schemes as we wanted to be clear which genotypes are perishing. Given that this is a supplemental figure and we are not limited by space - we prefer to keep this figure as is. We have modified the text to make it less complicated as the reviewer suggests.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Fig S2B. Why do we need a figure that shows how to make transgenes in 2 different ways for both HomeR drives? This should be in the methods. There is no discovery shown. In the end, only one line for each HomeR construct in the PolG2 gene is used for the population experiments. Which method was applied to generate this one is not clear. Again, this distracts from the message and makes the paper hard to read.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this comment and have added the relevant information to the methods. We thank that the method may be difficult for some readers and hence have made this figure a supplemental figure. We think this figure is important to help readers understand the methods we used to generate the gene drive lines and therefore would prefer to keep this supplemental figure.</p></body></sub-article></article>
