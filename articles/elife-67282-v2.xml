However, the direct effects of SSNA1 on microtubules are not known. We employed in vitro reconstitution with purified proteins and TIRF microscopy to investigate the activity of human SSNA1 on dynamic microtubule ends and lattices. Our results show that SSNA1 modulates all parameters of microtubule dynamic instability—slowing down the rates of growth, shrinkage, and catastrophe, and promoting rescue. We find that SSNA1 forms stretches along growing microtubule ends and binds cooperatively to the microtubule lattice. Furthermore, SSNA1 is enriched on microtubule damage sites, occurring both naturally, as well as induced by the microtubule severing enzyme spastin. Finally, SSNA1 binding protects microtubules against spastin’s severing activity. Taken together, our results demonstrate that SSNA1 is both a potent microtubule-stabilizing protein and a novel sensor of microtubule damage; activities that likely underlie SSNA1’s functions on microtubule structures in cells.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>SSNA1</kwd><kwd>cytoskeleton</kwd><kwd>in vitro reconstitution</kwd><kwd>microtubule dynamics</kwd><kwd>microtubule damage</kwd><kwd>spastin</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32CA119925</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lawrence</surname><given-names>Elizabeth J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35GM119552</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zanic</surname><given-names>Marija</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MCB2018661</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zanic</surname><given-names>Marija</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>SSNA1 is a potent microtubule stabilizer and novel sensor of microtubule damage, acting on both microtubule ends and lattices to regulate microtubule dynamics and protect microtubules against severing activity.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Sjogren’s syndrome nuclear autoantigen-1 (SSNA1/NA14) is a microtubule-associated protein (MAP) that plays important roles in cilia, cell division, and neuronal development. In cilia, SSNA1 localizes to basal bodies and axonemes where it is required for proper cilium assembly and intraflagellar transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lai et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Pfannenschmid et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Schoppmeier et al., 2005</xref>). In dividing cells, SSNA1 is enriched at the spindle poles and midbody, and is necessary for proper cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Goyal et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Pfannenschmid et al., 2003</xref>). Finally, SSNA1 promotes axon elongation and branching in developing neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Basnet et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Goyal et al., 2014</xref>). Although SSNA1 is involved in a range of microtubule-driven cellular processes, its direct effects on microtubules are not known.</p><p>SSNA1 is a small (~14 kDa), coiled-coil protein that self-assembles into higher-order fibrils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Basnet et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ramos-Morales et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rodríguez-Rodríguez et al., 2011</xref>). A recent in vitro study using cryo-EM/ET reported that SSNA1 fibrils bind longitudinally along stabilized microtubules, induce microtubule branching, and promote microtubule nucleation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Basnet et al., 2018</xref>). Growing microtubules undergo dynamic instability; a phenomenon whereby individual microtubules alternate between phases of growth and shrinkage via the transitions referred to as catastrophe and rescue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mitchison and Kirschner, 1984</xref>). Given its direct interaction with microtubules and localization to sites of dynamic microtubule growth in cells, SSNA1 is well-positioned to impact microtubule dynamics. Nonetheless, whether SSNA1 regulates dynamic microtubules has not been investigated.</p><p>Microtubule regulation is not restricted to the dynamic microtubule ends. For example, microtubule-severing enzymes, motor proteins, and mechanical forces induce microtubule lattice damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Théry and Blanchoin, 2021</xref>). The damaged microtubule lattice can be recognized and stabilized by MAPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aher et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aumeier et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">de Forges et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Schaedel et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Schaedel et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Théry and Blanchoin, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Triclin et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Vemu et al., 2018</xref>). SSNA1 has been identified as a binding partner of spastin, a microtubule-severing enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Errico et al., 2004</xref>); and both SSNA1 and spastin localize to spindle poles and neuronal branch points (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Basnet et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Goyal et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yu et al., 2008</xref>).

Previous work implicated SSNA1 in spontaneous microtubule nucleation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Basnet et al., 2018</xref>). To build upon these observations, we assessed the ability of SSNA1 to promote templated microtubule nucleation from GMPCPP-stabilized microtubule seeds, which better reflects microtubule nucleation in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wieczorek et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We performed a titration of soluble tubulin from 3 µM to 10 µM with and without 2.5 µM SSNA1 and found that SSNA1 promoted templated nucleation compared to the tubulin alone condition, thus supporting the role of SSNA1 in microtubule nucleation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Human SSNA1 promotes microtubule nucleation and suppresses microtubule dynamicity.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative images of a templated microtubule nucleation assay in which microtubule extensions (gray) were nucleated from GMPCPP-stabilized seeds (red) in the presence and absence of SSNA1.

While the average cellular concentration of SSNA1 is estimated to be ~200 nM (HeLa cells; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Itzhak et al., 2016</xref>), given that the SSNA1 localization is highly restricted to centrosomes, basal bodies, and axonal branch points (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Basnet et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Goyal et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Pfannenschmid et al., 2003</xref>), the effective local concentration of SSNA1 is likely significantly higher. Therefore, we investigated the effects of up to 3 µM SSNA1 on microtubule dynamics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). We found that SSNA1 suppressed microtubule dynamicity (defined as the total length of growth and shrinkage divided by the total time spent in growth and shrinkage) at both plus and minus ends (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Further, by quantifying the individual microtubule dynamic parameters, we found that at the lowest concentrations tested, SSNA1 primarily suppressed microtubule catastrophe and shrinkage rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E and F</xref>), while at higher concentrations SSNA1 additionally suppressed microtubule growth rate and promoted microtubule rescue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Therefore, we demonstrate that SSNA1 is a microtubule-stabilizing protein that suppresses microtubule dynamicity by modulating all parameters of dynamic instability.</p><media id="video1" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-67282-video1.mp4"><label>Video 1.</label><caption><title>SSNA1 stabilizes dynamic microtubules.</title><p>Dynamic microtubules were grown from GMPCPP-stabilized seeds with 9 µM Alexa-647 tubulin alone (control, left) and in the presence of 5 µM SSNA1 (right).

To investigate this further, we tracked the ends of microtubules grown in the presence of 3 µM SSNA1 for up to 30 min and calculated the velocity of the microtubule ends over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Quantification of the microtubule end velocity revealed a statistically significant slowdown in the mean microtubule velocity (from 7.6 ± 0.9 nm/s at 3 min to 3.1 ± 0.8 nm/s at 15 min, mean ± SEM, N=23, p&lt;0.001, unpaired t-test).</p><p>To visualize SSNA1 localization on growing microtubule ends we chemically labeled purified SSNA1. First, we confirmed that labeling did not interfere with SSNA1’s ability to self-assemble into fibrils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Next, we used our TIRF microscopy assay and observed SSNA1 localization on growing microtubules over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref>). We tracked the ends of microtubules grown in the presence of 5 µM labeled SSNA1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) and calculated the velocity of the microtubule ends over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Once again, we found that the majority of microtubule ends experienced a significant slowdown in growth velocity (from 8.4 ± 1.4 nm/s at 3 min to 5.0 ± 0.7 nm/s at 15 min, mean ± SEM, N=16 and N=25, respectively, p=0.01, unpaired t-test), although individual microtubules displayed a notable variability in both the timing and the rate of growth slowdown. Quantitative measurements of SSNA1 intensity at the microtubule end region revealed that SSNA1 intensity increased over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) (from 0.33 ± 0.07 a.u. at 3 min to 0.67 ± 0.09 a.u. at 15 min, mean ± SEM, N=16 and N=25, respectively, p=0.01, unpaired t-test) and inversely correlated with the microtubule end velocity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). However, on an individual microtubule level, we observed that the slowdown in growth rate often coincided with local SSNA1 enrichment at the microtubule tip (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, yellow arrow). Therefore, the microtubule growth rate progressively slows down in the presence of SSNA1, but the extent and onset of the slowdown vary between individual microtubules.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>The progressive slowdown in microtubule growth correlates with SSNA1 accumulation on microtubule ends.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A representative kymograph of a microtubule grown with 9 µM Alexa-647-labeled tubulin and 5 µM Alexa-488-labeled SSNA1 (7% labeled) showing the progressive localization of 488-SSNA1 to the microtubule end region over time.

To investigate whether SSNA1 has a binding preference for specific microtubule lattice regions, we performed wash-in experiments in which we first grew dynamic microtubule extensions with 15 µM tubulin from GMPCPP-stabilized seeds in the absence of SSNA1 and then introduced 15 µM tubulin and 2.5 µM 488-SSNA1 into the reaction mix ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A, B</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">Video 3</xref>). This experimental setup allowed us to determine whether SSNA1 preferred to bind to GMPCPP-stabilized microtubule seeds (thought to mimic the GTP-cap); pre-existing, old microtubule lattices (GDP); or new microtubule lattices that were grown in the presence of SSNA1. Measurements of the mean SSNA1 intensity revealed that the SSNA1 binding was similar on GMPCPP-seeds versus the pre-existing GDP lattice, indicating that SSNA1 does not specifically recognize the tubulin nucleotide state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>).

Interestingly, we observed that the SSNA1 stretches expanded over time, and these expansions proceeded exclusively in the direction of microtubule growth at both microtubule ends (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). In addition, we found that SSNA1 stretches could resolve, allowing the microtubule end to continue to grow dynamically (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). SSNA1 stretches could subsequently serve as stable rescue sites on the microtubule lattice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Taken together, we conclude that SSNA1 may recognize a specific structural feature that appears at growing microtubule ends, and that such structural feature can persist along the newly polymerized microtubule lattice, resulting in stretches of SSNA1 accumulation.</p><p>Additionally, we observed that ends of microtubules grown in the presence of SSNA1 could become highly curled over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G, H</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Videos 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">2</xref>). Although SSNA1 was enriched on curled ends, our quantitative analysis revealed that the SSNA1 intensity did not correlate with the degree of microtubule curvature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>). To further investigate whether SSNA1 recognizes regions of increased microtubule curvature, we assessed its localization on Taxol-stabilized microtubules, which inherently display a broad range of curvatures when polymerized with tubulin alone in the absence of SSNA1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J, K</xref>). We found that SSNA1 does not specifically localize to curved microtubule regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3L</xref>). We thus conclude that SSNA1 is not a sensor of microtubule curvature, but rather induces microtubule curling at growing microtubule ends.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>SSNA1 binds cooperatively to microtubules</title><p>To further probe the kinetics of SSNA1-microtubule binding, we investigated SSNA1 localization on stabilized microtubules. The binding of 1 µM labeled SSNA1 to GMPCPP-stabilized microtubules showed that the SSNA1 fluorescence intensity increased linearly over time across all microtubule lattices in the field of view until the SSNA1 signal saturated at ~5 min (<xref ref-type="video" rid="fig4video1">Figure 4—video 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Using a low concentration of labeled SSNA1 (5 nM) allowed us to probe microtubule binding on a single-molecule level. Quantification of the single-molecule dwell times of labeled SSNA1 on GMPCPP-stabilized microtubules revealed that individual SSNA1 molecules bound to the microtubule with mean durations of 12 ± 2 s (SE, N=142) during the first 5 min after SSNA1 was introduced. The observed dwell times of single molecules remained the same in the consecutive 5 min after SSNA1 introduction (10 ± 2 s, SE, N=107, p=0.2 Wilcoxon rank test) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A, B</xref>). To investigate potential cooperativity between SSNA1 molecules in a higher concentration regime, we performed single-molecule ‘spiking’ experiments, probing the 647-SSNA1 single-molecule dwell times in the background of 1 µM 488-SSNA1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Interestingly, we found that the single-molecule dwell times were longer in the presence of excess SSNA1 with a mean dwell time of 19 ± 3 s (SE, N=144) in the first 5 min, which further increased to 39 ± 4 s (SE, N=294, p&lt;0.001 compared to the single-molecule control, Wilcoxon rank test) in the second 5 min after SSNA1 introduction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C–E</xref>). Additionally, quantification of SSNA1 binding events revealed that SSNA1 association rates in the spiking conditions also increased over time from (0.96 ± 0.08)×10<sup>–3</sup> events µm<sup>–1</sup> nM<sup>–1</sup> s<sup>–1</sup> to (2.4 ± 0.1)×10<sup>–3</sup> events µm<sup>–1</sup> nM<sup>–1</sup> s<sup>–1</sup> (p&lt;0.001, Welch’s t-test). Combined, the differences in binding kinetics between the single-molecule control and spiking conditions demonstrate cooperativity in SSNA1 localization on the microtubule lattice.

To address this, we incubated GMPCPP-stabilized microtubules with or without 1 μM 488-SSNA1 for 10 min and then introduced 200 nM spastin. We found that, while spastin was able to efficiently sever control microtubules, no severing was observed for the SSNA1-coated microtubules over 30 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video5">Video 5</xref>). To further elucidate the interplay of spastin with SSNA1, we used a GFP-labeled truncated (del227) human spastin construct, which retains full severing activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). We assessed GFP-spastin’s localization and activity on a mixed population of Taxol-stabilized microtubules that were either coated or not coated with 2 µM 647-SSNA1 (see Materials and methods for details). First, we determined whether SSNA1 prevented spastin binding by adding 25 nM GFP-spastin to the microtubules in the presence of 1 mM AMPPNP, a non-hydrolyzable ATP analog that allows spastin binding, but not severing of microtubules. We observed that GFP-spastin bound to both the SSNA1-coated and non-coated microtubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Quantitative fluorescence intensity analysis of the microtubules in the field of view confirmed that the GFP-spastin intensity was not significantly different between the populations of SSNA1-coated and non-coated microtubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B, C</xref>). Thus, SSNA1 does not prevent spastin from binding to microtubules under these conditions. We then assessed the effect of SSNA1 on GFP-spastin’s microtubule severing activity by introducing 25 nM GFP-spastin to the microtubules in the presence of 1 mM ATP. Similar to our results with the unlabelled full-length spastin, we observed that the non-coated microtubules were severed within a few minutes, while the microtubules that were coated with SSNA1 were protected against spastin-induced severing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D–H</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video6">Video 6</xref>).

Studies in cells and in vitro report that tau forms oligomers on the outer microtubule surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Al-Bassam et al., 2002</xref>), and stabilizes microtubules against depolymerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Drechsel et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Prezel et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ramirez-Rios et al., 2016</xref>). Similarly, SSNA1 forms fibrils that bind longitudinally on microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Basnet et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rodríguez-Rodríguez et al., 2011</xref>). Our work demonstrates that SSNA1 simultaneously modulates all four parameters of microtubule dynamic instability—slowing down the rates of growth, shrinkage, and catastrophe, and promoting rescue. Thus, SSNA1 is a potent microtubule-stabilizing protein and this activity likely underlies its cellular function.</p><p>In contrast to tau, which has been reported to promote microtubule growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Drechsel et al., 1992</xref>), the growth rate slows down in the presence of SSNA1. One way to slow down microtubule growth is through sequestration of soluble tubulin—this is the mechanism employed by Op18/Stathmin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arnal et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Belmont and Mitchison, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cassimeris, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gupta et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Steinmetz, 2007</xref>). However, tubulin sequestration would affect the growth rate of all microtubules simultaneously; this is not the case with SSNA1, where the onset of slowdown occurs at different times for individual microtubules. Instead, we find that suppression of microtubule growth rate correlates with the progressive SSNA1 accumulation on microtubule ends over time. Microtubule growth slowdown may be a consequence of perturbations in the dynamic end structure, including incomplete tubules, exposed protofilaments or ragged microtubule ends. Indeed, a slowdown in growth is typically observed just prior to microtubule catastrophe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Farmer et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Maurer et al., 2014</xref>). Notably, previous data from cryo-ET experiments indicate that SSNA1 can bind to partial tubule structures, as it supports the growth of protofilaments away from the mother microtubule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Basnet et al., 2018</xref>). We note that, in our study, we did not observe SSNA1-induced microtubule branching events previously reported in conditions where microtubules were grown in the presence of GMPCPP and much higher concentrations of SSNA1 from different species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Basnet et al., 2018</xref>). Nevertheless, both previous and our current studies raise the possibility that SSNA1 recognizes specific dynamic end structures that are incompatible with continued unperturbed growth.</p><p>It has recently been proposed that taxanes, microtubule-stabilizing compounds widely used in cancer therapy, recognize microtubule ends that are in a pre-catastrophe state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Rai et al., 2020</xref>). Significantly, the behavior of SSNA1 on dynamic microtubules is highly reminiscent of taxanes: at sub-saturating concentrations, taxanes accumulate at growing microtubule ends following growth perturbations, and form persistent patches that stabilize the microtubule lattice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Rai et al., 2020</xref>). While taxanes show a preference for GMPCPP-grown parts of the microtubule lattice, which mimic the extended GTP-tubulin conformation, we do not see enhanced localization of SSNA1 on the GMPCPP-lattice regions. Therefore, we do not think that nucleotide state recognition is the primary mechanism for SSNA1 localization. Electron microscopy data demonstrate that taxanes accumulate on incomplete microtubule lattice structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Rai et al., 2020</xref>). Similarly, we find that stretches of SSNA1 accumulate on dimmer regions of microtubule lattices (i.e., incomplete tubules) and growing microtubule ends. Thus, our data support a mechanism in which SSNA1 binding is determined by the structure of the microtubule lattice. Furthermore, we demonstrate that SSNA1 detects sites of spastin-mediated lattice damage. Hence, like taxanes, SSNA1 senses microtubule lattice damage.</p><p>Several lines of evidence support an important functional interplay between SSNA1 and spastin: SSNA1 is a binding partner of spastin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Errico et al., 2004</xref>); SSNA1 and spastin colocalize in dividing cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Goyal et al., 2014</xref>); SSNA1 and spastin promote axonal branching in developing neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Basnet et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Goyal et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yu et al., 2008</xref>); and SSNA1’s putative spastin-binding domain is required to promote axonal branching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Goyal et al., 2014</xref>). Our data demonstrate that SSNA1 can both inhibit spastin activity and detect spastin-induced damage, further highlighting the interplay between the two proteins. Similarly, tau condensates on microtubule lattices were recently found to protect against severing by both spastin and katanin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Siahaan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tan et al., 2019</xref>). SSNA1’s microtubule-stabilizing activity is similar to that of CAMSAP2 and CAMSAP3: minus-end stabilizing proteins that associate with new minus ends and form stretches of stabilized lattice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jiang et al., 2014</xref>). Interestingly, katanin interacts with CAMSAP2 and CAMSAP3 and limits the length of CAMSAP2-stretches on the microtubule minus ends. Thus, balancing the activity of microtubule severing and stabilizing proteins may represent a general mechanism for regulating microtubule number and mass in cells. Perhaps counterintuitively, spastin is implicated in microtubule network amplification by generating new microtubules fragments after severing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kuo and Howard, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kuo et al., 2019a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kuo et al., 2019b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Vemu et al., 2018</xref>). Whether synergy between SSNA1’s stabilizing activity and spastin’s severing activity is critical for microtubule network amplification in cells presents an important area for future work.</p><p>Microtubule dynamics and network organization are influenced by the properties of both the microtubule end and lattice. Herein, we have identified SSNA1 as a microtubule-stabilizing protein and a sensor of microtubule damage. Our work thus provides mechanistic insight into an important but understudied microtubule regulatory protein with essential functions in cilia, cell division, and developing neurons.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>DNA constructs</title><p>The cDNA encoding human SSNA1 (NM_003731.2) with an N-terminal 6xHis-tag in a pReceiver-B01 vector was purchased from GeneCopoeia, Rockville, MD (product ID: Q0661).

The window was then shifted to the next 2-min interval and fitting procedure was repeated until the end of the trajectory. To focus on the characterization of microtubule growth over time, the segments with negative velocity at the beginning of a trajectory were eliminated (i.e., segment contains shrinkage phase), such that each trajectory starts with a positive velocity segment, while subsequent segments with negative velocity were kept. For each 2-min segment, position data were color-coded based on the determined velocity and plotted as a function of time. For further analysis of growth segments, segments determined to have velocities smaller than –2.5 nm/s were classified as shrinking segments, and were not included.

At the end of SSNA1 incubation, we added more microtubules into the flow chamber and allowed them to immobilize on coverslip surface. This resulted in two populations of microtubules that were either coated or non-coated with SSNA1 in the same field of view. To test whether SSNA1 prevents spastin binding, we added 25 nM GFP-spastin(del227) with 1 mM AMPPNP and imaged for 10 min every 15 s. To test whether SSNA1 prevents spastin-mediated severing, we then added 25 nM GFP-spastin(del227) with 1 mM ATP and imaged for 10 min every 15 s. The analysis was performed using ImageJ and MATLAB. First, we registered the image time series using ImageJ plugins ‘Template Matching,’ ‘Image Stabilizer’ and ‘Image Stabilizer Log Applier’ Next, we used ImageJ plugin ‘JFilament’ to trace microtubules using the first frame of the time series and exported the pixel coordinates. Background subtraction was then performed using a rolling ball with a 5-pixel radius in ImageJ. A binary mask was generated in MATLAB using the exported coordinates. The average intensity of SSNA1 and spastin per microtubule in the AMPPNP condition was averaged over time (between 3 min and 5 min, normalized with intensity values between 0 min and 1 min). Outlier analysis was then performed using MATLAB 'isoutlier' function, which identified four outliers each in populations of 83 and 76 microtubules, respectively. Finally, we calculated weighted mean and standard error for a population of microtubules using inverse square of standard error of intensity per microtubule. For the ATP condition, we first determined the time point at which normalized tubulin intensity fell below 20% for two consecutive frames for each field of view for the control condition (i.e., non-SSNA1 coated), and then determined the intensity of SSNA1-coated microtubules at the same time point. Outlier analysis was performed using MATLAB 'isoutlier' function as above, which identified one outlier in the population of SSNA1-coated microtubules out of 67 microtubules analyzed. Finally, we calculated weighted mean and standard error for a population of microtubules using inverse square of standard error of intensity per microtubule.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Writing - original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Conceptualization, Funding acquisition, Supervision, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec id="s6" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="transrepform"><label>Transparent reporting form</label><media mime-subtype="pdf" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-67282-transrepform1-v2.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec id="s7" sec-type="data-availability"><title>Data availability</title><p>All data generated or analyzed during this study are included in the manuscript and supporting files.</p></sec><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors thank S Hall for help with protein purification, C Strothman for the MATLAB dynamics analysis script, and R McKenney (University of California Davis) for the GFP-spastin DNA construct.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Suzanne Pfeffer as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Marcus Braun (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. Please provide a saturation curve for SSNA1 on GMPCPP and taxol stabilized microtubules to inform the reader of SSNA1 binding affinities. Since the SSNA1 concentrations used are very high, it would be good to show that, under the conditions used, SSNA1 is binding reversibly to the microtubule lattice (i.e. doesn't come in protein clusters sticking non-specifically). Also, provide quantification of certain parameters (such as catastrophe frequency) of the microtubule dynamics experiments at physiological concentrations &lt;100 nM. The conclusion might be that catastrophe and shrinking are affected, while growth and rescue are not, making the ones shown to be more convincing/relevant.</p><p>2. The question of SSNA1 localization and non-uniform-distribution need to be addressed, and, importantly, quantifications need to be provided. Please provide quantification for Figures 2C, 2D, and S4. Please see comments from Reviewer 1 and 3, as they had similar comments for 2D.</p><p>3. All three reviewers were curious about whether you observed branched nucleation in any of your assays. Please provide data and/or discussion for your observations in more detail in the paper. Please refer to the additional comments on this subject from all three reviewers.</p><p>4. All three reviewers asked if SSNA1 binds the microtubule cooperatively. This could be tested by performing titration experiments or by comparing the dwell times of SSNA1 in regions of low density to the dwell times in regions of high density (FRAP or single molecule fluorescent imaging in a background of non-labeled SSNA1). Either experiment could also provide more information as to accumulation at specific sites on the microtubule.</p><p>5. For Figure 3, please provide images of the SSNA1 for these assays.</p><p>6. There are a few concerns that should be addressed either textually or with additional data with regards to the proteins used in the study: 1) Why is SSNA1 not expressed with a GFP fusion as published for many other proteins from the same lab? Does it interfere with function or solubility? 2) Please provide gel filtration chromatograms for SSNA1 and spastin, as well as gels for the purified spastin and stathmin proteins.</p><p>7. All three reviewers agree that the spastin/damage experiments could be the most exciting conceptual advance of this paper, but at the moment this part of the paper is underdeveloped. The major requests are: Reviewer 1: does SSNA1 prevent spastin binding or severing? The authors should observe spastin in the absence of ATP, both in the absence or presence of SSNA1 to determine if spastin is prevented from binding the MT in the presence of SSNA1. Also, the authors should include images of the spastin on the MT for Figure 4A. There are some sites that appear to become severed even in the presence of SSNA1 and it would be helpful to the reader to see where the spastin is accumulating (or not accumulating). The authors should show a timelapse of the entire process. For example, they could take images every ~2 min of spastin + MTs, showing both channels, then wash out spastin and flow in SSNA1 and take images again every ~1-2 min to watch the accumulation of SSNA1 at the sites of damage. (This reviewer also asks to look for tubulin incorporation at these damage sites, but this is not necessary). Reviewer 2: Can you exclude that SSNA1 binds to spastin at the damage sites and not to damaged microtubules directly? If you introduce both SSNA1 and spastin at the same time, is this as protective? Does SSNA1 oligomerise to achieve protective function?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.67282.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1.

We find that the build-up of SSNA1 on microtubules is linear and gradual and does not occur by the landing of large protein clusters or aggregates (Figure 4 – Supplemental Figure 1). Furthermore, we have significantly expanded our single molecule analysis to determine SSNA1 landing rates and dwell times, both in single-molecule, as well as in spiking conditions, as suggested by the reviewers. Our data show that single molecules of SSNA1 bind reversibly to the GMPCPP-stabilized microtubule lattices (Figure 4A, B). In the spiking conditions, where single molecules of 647-SSNA1 (5 nM) are visualized binding to microtubules in the background of 1 µM 488-SSNA1 (Figure 4C, D), we find that SSNA1 still binds in a reversible manner as single molecules and not as large protein aggregates. Interestingly, we find that the dwell time of SSNA1 molecules is increased in the spiking condition compared to the true single molecule condition, suggesting interactions between SSNA1 molecules in the higher concentration conditions. Moreover, both the dwell times and the landing rates of SSNA1 in spiking conditions increase over time (Figure 4E). Thus, our results demonstrate that SSNA1 binding to microtubules is cooperative. This finding is consistent with previous reports that SSNA1 forms fibrils which can localize along the microtubule lattice (Rodriguez-Rodriguez et al. 2011, Basnet et al. 2018).</p><p>Furthermore, we appreciate the concern about the physiologically-relevant SSNA1 concentrations. To that end, please note that the average cellular concentration of SSNA1 has been reported to be: ~200 nM in Hela cells (Itzhak et al. 2016) (http://www.mapofthecell.org/), which is within the range of conditions we investigated in our titration experiments (125 nM to 3 µM). At these lower concentrations of SSNA1, we indeed find that the major effect on microtubule dynamicity is due to SSNA1’s effects on microtubule catastrophe and shrinkage rate (Figure 1EF), rather than growth and rescue (Figure 1 – Supplemental Figure 2). Nevertheless, imaging of SSNA1 in HeLa cells demonstrated that SSNA1 localizes to the centrosomes in these cells (Goyal et al. 2014). Furthermore, in neurons SSNA1 localization is restricted to branch points (Goyal et al. 2014, Basnet et al. 2018), while in cells with primary cilia, SSNA1 is localized to the basal bodies (Lai et al. 2011). Hence, we argue that the local concentrations of SSNA1 in physiologically-relevant conditions are likely to be much higher than 200 nM. As a back-of-the-envelope calculation, assuming a typical centrosome radius of 2 µm (see e.g. Baumgart et al. JCB 2019), the estimated centrosome volume is ~30 µm<sup>3</sup>, which is ~2 orders of magnitude smaller than the typical volume of the HeLa cell (~ 2600 µm<sup>3</sup>, https://bionumbers.hms.harvard.edu). Therefore, we think that understanding SSNA1 activity at higher effective concentrations is of physiological relevance, given its restricted subcellular localization. In particular, SSNA1 could help to nucleate and then stabilize the nascent microtubules in the centrosome, based on our findings that SSNA1 promotes nucleation and suppresses catastrophe at concentrations in the hundreds of nanomolar. Along those lines, please note that a previous in vitro study of SSNA1’s effects (Basnet et al. 2018) used significantly higher protein concentrations (30 µM SSNA1) and/or high concentrations of crowding agents (i.e. 200 nM SSNA1 with 7.5% PEG).</p><p>Nevertheless, to showcase the effects of SSNA1 at lower concentrations, as requested by the reviewers, we now present effects on catastrophe and shrinkage rates for concentrations below 1 µM SSNA1 in the revised main Figure 1, and have included the full titration results with all of the individual parameters of microtubule dynamics in the presence of up to 3 µM SSNA1 in the supplement (Figure 1 – Supplemental Figure 2). We have also added a representative kymograph showing the effects of 500 nM SSNA1 on microtubule dynamics in the main figure (Figure 1C, middle kymograph). Finally, we included a sentence on physiologically-relevant SSNA1 concentrations in the main text (lines 66-69).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The question of SSNA1 localization and non-uniform-distribution need to be addressed, and, importantly, quantifications need to be provided. Please provide quantification for Figures 2C, 2D, and S4. Please see comments from Reviewer 1 and 3, as they had similar comments for 2D.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that quantification of these data is important to substantiate our findings. As such, we have now quantified SSNA1 intensity as a function of microtubule end curvature for both Taxolstabilized microtubules (Figure 3J, K, L, previously S4) and curved dynamic microtubule ends (Figure 3G, H, I, previously 2C). On Taxol-stabilized microtubules, which are naturally curved, our quantification demonstrates that SSNA1 localization is not enhanced on curved microtubule regions (Figure 3L). Furthermore, we find that, while SSNA1 is enriched on the curled growing microtubule ends, the SSNA1 intensity does not correlate with the degree of microtubule end curvature (Figure 3I). Taken together, our data are consistent with the model in which SSNA1 recognizes open microtubule lattice at growing microtubule ends, incorporates along the newly grown microtubule lattice and directly induces microtubule end curvature, but is not itself a sensor of microtubule curvature.</p><p>In addition, we have expanded our quantitative analysis of SSNA1 localization on dynamic microtubules. Our quantification of SSNA1 localization in dynamic wash-in experiments (Figure 3A-D, previously 2D) shows that SSNA1 does not preferentially localize to the stabilized GMPCPP-microtubule seeds (which would be expected if it recognized GTP-nucleotide state of tubulin), over dynamically-grown (GDP-tubulin) extensions. Our analysis shows that stretches of SSNA1 accumulation start at the growing microtubule end and expand in the direction of microtubule growth (Figure 3F), preferentially decorating the portions of microtubule lattice grown in the presence of SSNA1 (Figure 3B, D). Our expanded quantitative analysis of SSNA1 localization is now presented in a new figure of the revised manuscript (Figure 3).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.

Please refer to the additional comments on this subject from all three reviewers.</p></disp-quote><p>Basnet et al., 2018 previously observed microtubule branching when microtubules were grown in the presence of GMPCPP and very high concentrations of SSNA1. Interestingly, in none of our experiments, under our particular experimental conditions, did we observe any microtubule branching events. Possible reasons for this include our use of human SSNA1, as opposed to the <italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</italic> SSNA1 used in Basnet et al., or that the microtubules were grown with GMPCPP in Basnet et al., while we used GTP. Furthermore, Basnet et al., used much higher concentrations of SSNA1 (30 µM – 75 µM) than used in our manuscript (100 nM – 5 µM, which could explain the additional branching activity observed. We have now added a sentence to this effect in the discussion:</p><p>“We note that, in our study, we did not observe SSNA1-induced microtubule branching events previously reported in conditions where microtubules were grown in the presence of GMPCPP and much higher concentrations of SSNA1 from different species (Basnet et al. 2018).” (lines 235-238)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4.

This could be tested by performing titration experiments or by comparing the dwell times of SSNA1 in regions of low density to the dwell times in regions of high density (FRAP or single molecule fluorescent imaging in a background of non-labeled SSNA1). Either experiment could also provide more information as to accumulation at specific sites on the microtubule.</p></disp-quote><p>Prompted by reviewers’ comments, we have now significantly expanded our single-molecule analysis to include ‘spiking’ experiments, where we analyzed the dwell times and landing rates of single SSNA1 molecules, both alone and in the background of 1 µM SSNA1. From these experiments, we found that the dwell times of SSNA1 were extended in the presence of excess SSNA1 (from 10 s ± 2 s, SE, N=107 to 39 s ± 4 s, SE, N=294, measured in the 2<sup>nd</sup> 5 minutes after SSNA1 introduction, p&lt;0.001, Wilcoxon rank test). Additionally, we found that both the dwell times and the landing rates increased over time. Thus, we can indeed conclude that SSNA1 binding to microtubules is cooperative. These data are now presented in a new figure in the revised manuscript (Figure 4).</p><p>Furthermore, our expanded analysis of regions displaying enhanced SSNA1 localization (new Figure 3) showed that stretches of SSNA1 initiate at growing microtubule ends (either plus or minus), increase over time and always extend only in the direction of microtubule growth (either plus or minus). SSNA1 stretches appear on many, but not all, growing microtubules, and the initial binding events on different microtubule ends occur at distinct times. Notably, SSNA1 patches can be resolved, such that a microtubule continues with dynamic growth beyond the extension of the SSNA1 patch, indicating a potential damage-repair event. Thus, rather than the site of initial SSNA1 localization serving as a seed for subsequent SSNA1 fibril elongation in either direction, our results suggest that SSNA1 binding actively detects microtubule damage as it is built into the microtubule lattice. Taken together, we can conclude that SSNA1 indeed detects microtubule damage occurring at growing microtubule ends, and that at higher concentrations SSNA1 molecules interact with each other, prolonging the dwell time of individual molecules, potentially through formation of SSNA1 fibrils, as previously reported (Basnet et al., 2018).</p><p>Our new extended analysis of SSNA1 single-molecule and stretch localization is presented in newly added Figures 3 and 4 and the corresponding discussion in the main text of the manuscript (lines 103-159).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. For Figure 3, please provide images of the SSNA1 for these assays.</p></disp-quote><p>The experiments in former Figure 3 (catastrophe induced by tubulin dilution and stathmin) were performed with unlabeled SSNA1 and therefore SSNA1 was not imaged. In restructuring the manuscript from its initial focus on microtubule dynamics towards the SSNA1’s microtubule damage recognition, as suggested by the reviewers, we have decided not to pursue additional experiments focusing on the anti-catastrophe effects. We find that this previous result does not provide additional insights relevant to the current manuscript, and have thus omitted it in the revised version. Nevertheless, our expansion of quantitative SSNA1 localization analysis (new Figure 3) now provides additional new insights into SSNA1 localization on microtubules.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. There are a few concerns that should be addressed either textually or with additional data with regards to the proteins used in the study: 1) Why is SSNA1 not expressed with a GFP fusion as published for many other proteins from the same lab? Does it interfere with function or solubility? 2) Please provide gel filtration chromatograms for SSNA1 and spastin, as well as gels for the purified spastin and stathmin proteins.</p></disp-quote><p>SSNA1 is approximately 15 kDa and forms fibrils by a head-to-tail interaction between SSNA1 dimers (Basnet et al., 2018). Since GFP is approximately 27 kDa (almost twice as large as SSNA1), we reasoned that it could interfere with SSNA1 protein function. Furthermore, GFP tags are usually expressed on the C- or N-terminus of the protein; we feared this may impede the ability of SSNA1 to self-oligomerize into fibrils since fibril formation depends on key residues in the N- and C- termini of SSNA1 (Basnet et al., 2018). For those reasons, we opted to chemically label SSNA1 with small Alexa-647 and Alexa-488 dyes. We have confirmed that this labeling procedure did not prevent SSNA1 fibril formation (Figure 2—figure supplement 2).</p><p>The protocols for purification of SSNA1 and spastin did not include a gel-filtration step (see Methods). Our protocols were based on the published protocols for SSNA1 and spastin purifications which did not include gel-filtration purification steps (Basnet et al., 2018, Tan et al. 2021). We note that our added GFP-spastin(del227) purification was performed by GenScript, and did include a gel-filtration step. We have now provided a gel showing the purified spastin and GFP-spastin proteins (Figure 5 – Supplemental Figure 2), in addition to the gel, Western Blot and mass-spec analysis of SSNA1 (Figure 1 – Supplemental Figure 1). Please note that stathmin is no longer used in the revised version of the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. All three reviewers agree that the spastin/damage experiments could be the most exciting conceptual advance of this paper, but at the moment this part of the paper is underdeveloped. The major requests are: Reviewer 1: does SSNA1 prevent spastin binding or severing? The authors should observe spastin in the absence of ATP, both in the absence or presence of SSNA1 to determine if spastin is prevented from binding the MT in the presence of SSNA1. Also, the authors should include images of the spastin on the MT for Figure 4A. There are some sites that appear to become severed even in the presence of SSNA1 and it would be helpful to the reader to see where the spastin is accumulating (or not accumulating).

Reviewer 2: Can you exclude that SSNA1 binds to spastin at the damage sites and not to damaged microtubules directly? If you introduce both SSNA1 and spastin at the same time, is this as protective? Does SSNA1 oligomerise to achieve protective function?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers that the spastin/SSNA1 experiments are of high interest and should be explored further. To this end, we have expressed and purified recombinant GFP-spastin, which allowed us to visualize spastin localization on microtubules that were either coated or noncoated with SSNA1 under severing and non-severing conditions. The mixed microtubule population was achieved by flowing microtubules into the imaging chamber and incubating with SSNA1 and then flowing in a second batch of microtubules which were not coated with SSNA1.</p><p>First, we asked whether SSNA1 prevents spastin binding to microtubules by introducing spastinGFP with 1 mM AMPPNP to the mixed microtubule population. We found that SSNA1 did not prevent spastin-GFP binding to microtubules. Next, we asked whether SSNA1 inhibits spastinmicrotubule binding under severing conditions. When GFP-spastin was introduced to the mixed microtubule population in the presence of 1 mM ATP, we found that, while GFP-spastin localized to all microtubules, only those that were not coated with SSNA1 were severed. Therefore, from these new experiments with labelled spastin, we now conclude that SSNA1 inhibits spastin severing but does not prevent spastin binding to microtubules. These results are now presented in a new figure of the revised manuscript (Figure 6).</p><p>Our data observing SSNA1 localization on Taxol-stabilized microtubules demonstrates that SSNA1 recognizes spontaneously occurring damage sites on the microtubule lattice, as evidenced by enhanced SSNA1 localization at sites of lower tubulin signal (i.e. damage). Since these damage sites were generated without spastin, we are confident in concluding that SSNA1 specifically detects microtubule damage (rather than binding to spastin at damage sites). To emphasize this distinction, we now have a dedicated supplemental figure showing SSNA1 localization at damage sites on Taxol-microtubules, which also includes examples of SSNA1 enrichment at sites of spontaneous damage on GMPCPP-stabilized microtubules, and on dynamic GDP microtubule extensions (Figure 5-Supplemental Figure 1).</p><p>We agree with the reviewer that SSNA1 oligomerization could be involved in SSNA1’s protective activity. Indeed, our spiking analysis revealed that SSNA1 binding to microtubules is cooperative, so it is possible that formation of higher-order SSNA1 structures protects microtubules against severing. We have also performed a limited number of experiments in which SSNA1 and spastin were simultaneously introduced to microtubules (data not shown). Under the specific conditions tested (up to 200 nM spastin with 1 µM SSNA1), SSNA1 was not able to protect against spastin activity, which could further indicate that SSNA1 must first oligomerize to efficiently protect against spastin, or that the microtubule needs to be fully coated with SSNA1 in order to be protected (i.e. if spastin can access uncoated tubulin dimers in the lattice then it will remove them). Indeed, even in conditions with as low as 250 nM SSNA1, we could observe protection against spastin, as long as a preincubation step was included. Given the low association rates of SSNA1 to microtubules, this observation is consistent with the idea that higher-order structures or full microtubule coverage are needed. A possible way to test the hypothesis that SSNA1 fibril formation is necessary for microtubule protection would be to first polymerize SSNA1 fibrils and then introduce these onto microtubules along with spastin to assess severing activity, compared to when spastin is introduced with non-filamentous SSNA1. These technically challenging experiments will be the focus of subsequent research efforts in our lab.</p></body></sub-article></article>
