The sense of proprioception is produced in the brain using peripheral sensory input from receptors such as the muscle spindle, which detects changes in the length of skeletal muscles. Despite its importance, the molecular composition of the muscle spindle is largely unknown. In this study, we generated comprehensive transcriptomic and proteomic datasets of the entire muscle spindle isolated from the murine deep masseter muscle. We then associated differentially expressed genes with the various tissues composing the spindle using bioinformatic analysis. Immunostaining verified these predictions, thus establishing new markers for the different spindle tissues. Utilizing these markers, we identified the differentiation stages the spindle capsule cells undergo during development.

Proprioceptive information is produced by specialized mechanosensory organs located in muscles, tendons, and joints, which detect the stretch, tension, and force experienced by the muscles. This information is then transferred to the central nervous system, where input from populations of proprioceptive neurons is integrated to generate the sense of position and movement of limb and trunk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kiehn, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Proske and Gandevia, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sherrington, 1907</xref>).</p><p>In mammalians, the muscle spindle is one of the main proprioceptive mechanosensory organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Proske and Gandevia, 2012</xref>). The spindle is composed of specialized muscle fibers, termed intrafusal fibers, which are innervated by proprioceptive sensory neurons at their central region and by γ-motoneurons at their polar ends. This structure is partially isolated from its surroundings by a capsule rich in extracellular matrix (ECM) that is secreted by capsule cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bewick and Banks, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kröger and Watkins, 2021</xref>). The development of the muscle spindle starts in utero and continues postnatally. This process is initiated when sensory neuron afferents contact immature myofibers and induce their differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hippenmeyer et al., 2002</xref>). Nonetheless, the molecular events that regulate spindle development are largely unknown.</p><p>Previous work from our lab demonstrated that the proprioceptive system regulates several aspects of musculoskeletal development and function and that impaired proprioceptive signaling causes musculoskeletal pathology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Assaraf et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blecher et al., 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Blecher et al., 2017b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bornstein et al., 2021</xref>). These findings significantly increase the importance of the proprioceptive system and emphasize the need to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying its development and function.</p><p>In recent years, attempts have been made to uncover the molecular composition of the spindle. Single-cell RNA analysis of dorsal root ganglion (DRG) proprioceptive neurons revealed their molecular diversity, subdividing these neurons to five to eight subgroups and identifying specific markers for the proprioceptive neurons composing muscle spindle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Oliver et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wu et al., 2021</xref>). Single-nucleus transcriptomic analysis of spinal cord motoneurons identified the transcriptional profile of γ-motoneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blum et al., 2021</xref>). These studies greatly advance our molecular understanding of proprioceptive and γ-motoneurons. However, these datasets contain RNA transcripts expressed at the neuron cell body and nucleus, missing information on transcript expression at the terminal ends. Because gene expression in neurons is regulated locally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Holt and Schuman, 2013</xref>), information on localized expression in specialized sensory regions is central to our understanding of spindle biology. Another recent advance in spindle research was made by single-nucleus sequencing of intrafusal fibers, which identified six nuclear compartments within these fibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kim et al., 2020</xref>). However, the molecular compositions of intrafusal versus extrafusal fibers were not compared. Another missing piece of information is the molecular composition of the spindle capsule.</p><p>To address these knowledge gaps and to provide comprehensive gene expression profiles of the muscle spindle, we took a holistic approach and performed transcriptomic and proteomic analyses on intact spindles. We then analyzed the obtained datasets to identify novel markers for the different spindle tissues. Finally, we used these markers to study postnatal development and maturation of capsule cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Transcriptomic analysis provides a molecular characterization of the intact muscle spindle</title><p>The molecular details of the muscle spindle and the various tissues that compose it are largely missing. To provide a comprehensive molecular characterization of this complex organ, we isolated intact muscle spindles and subjected them to transcriptomic and proteomic analyses. Two major hurdles in studying the muscle spindle are its small size and infrequent occurrence within different muscles. To overcome these hurdles, we isolated intact spindles from the deep masseter muscle, which is known to be rich in these receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lennartsson, 1980</xref>). To recognize the spindles inside the masseter belly, we marked them genetically by crossing <italic>Piezo2<sup>EGFP-IRES-Cre</sup></italic> deleter mice with a <italic>Rosa26<sup>tdTomato</sup></italic> reporter line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Madisen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Woo et al., 2014</xref>). <italic>Piezo2</italic> was previously shown to be expressed by proprioceptive sensory neurons in the spindle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Woo et al., 2015</xref>). To verify the specific expression of tdTomato in spindles of <italic>Piezo2<sup>EGFP-IRES-Cre</sup>;Rosa26<sup>tdTomato</sup></italic> mice, we first examined sections through the masseter and found a strong signal in the spindles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We then compared <italic>Piezo2</italic> expression, as indicated by GFP signal, to the expression of tdTomato (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). As reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Woo et al., 2015</xref>), GFP was detected in sensory neuron soma in the DRG and at the proprioceptive neuron endings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Interestingly, while tdTomato expression was not detected in the sensory endings, it was expressed in DRG sensory neurons, intrafusal muscle fibers, and capsule cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). The expression of tdTomato in the DRG but not in the neuron endings was probably due to lack of transport of the reporter to the terminal ends. Moreover, the expression of tdTomato, but not GFP, in intrafusal fibers and capsule cells suggests that <italic>Piezo2</italic> was expressed in the progenitors of these lineages. Nonetheless, this broad tdTomato expression enabled us to manually dissect out the intact spindle from the masseter belly. From each mouse, we obtained intact muscle spindles as well as extrafusal muscles fibers adjacent to the spindle, referred to as muscle. The muscle samples were used as a reference tissue by which to identify spindle-specific genes and to eliminate possible contamination with extrafusal fibers.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Transcriptomic analysis of intact muscle spindles identified genes expressed in the different spindle tissues.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Confocal images of longitudinal sections of the deep masseter muscle of adult (&gt;P90) <italic>Piezo2<sup>EGFP-IRES-Cre</sup>;Rosa26<sup>tdTomato</sup></italic> mice.

To identify RNA transcripts that could derive from these two neuron types, we performed ranked gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) to compare between differentially expressed genes that were upregulated in spindle samples and the expression profiles of isolated DRG proprioceptive neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zheng et al., 2019</xref>) and γ-motoneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blum et al., 2021</xref>).

We found that while γ-motoneuron genes were enriched for processes related to synapse organization, proprioceptive neurons genes were related to neuron differentiation and development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Furthermore, we found strong enrichment for processes such as synapse organization and trans-synaptic signaling in the 178 genes that were shared between the two neuron types. This result is consistent with previous findings that the peripheral endings of proprioceptive neurons have a number of synapse-like structural components, including synaptic-like vesicles, synapsins, and synaptobrevin/VAMP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bewick et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bewick and Banks, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Than et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Proprioceptive sensory neurons can be subdivided into three types of afferent fibers, namely Ia and II, which innervate muscle spindles, and Ib, which innervates the Golgi tendon organ (GTO) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Proske and Gandevia, 2012</xref>). To study the specificity of the spindle afferent genes we identified, we examined the overlap between our list of 260 potential proprioceptive neuron genes and markers for the three proprioceptive neurons subtypes identified by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wu et al., 2021</xref>. While we found many genes that are common to all subtypes, 22 genes exclusively overlapped with type Ia neurons, 45 genes with type II neurons, and 2 genes with both (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2F</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>). These results suggest that these 69 genes are expressed by muscle spindle afferents and not by GTO afferents. To explore the specificity of our potential γ-motoneuron genes, we sought to filter out genes that are expressed in α-motor and proprioceptive neurons. For that, we generated a list of α-motoneurons genes by performing ranked GSEA on our data using published expression profiles of these neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blum et al., 2021</xref>). Then, we compared between the three lists of neuronal genes, that is, those associated with γ-motoneuron, α-motoneurons, and proprioceptive neurons, and found a large overlap between the three lists (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2G</xref>).

Cluster 3 mainly contains myosins, suggesting that it includes proteins expressed in the intrafusal fibers. Clusters 4 and 5 contain proteins highly expressed in the muscle sample as compared to the spindle sample.

However, in agreement with our results in the masseter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), we did not detect GLUT1 expression around the spindle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A and B</xref>). At P7, while TdTomato expression extended to the spindle periphery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, quantified in G), GLUT1 expression was restricted to the central domain of the spindle, covering the coil structure formed by proprioceptive neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>).

Here, we generated comprehensive transcriptomic and proteomic datasets of the entire muscle spindle. By analyzing these datasets, we have identified a set of new markers for the different tissues that compose the spindle. Finally, using these markers, we studied the development of the capsule that envelops the spindle and revealed several differentiation steps. Together, these findings provide a new tool for future studies of muscle spindle biology and pathology.</p><p>For many years, the molecular composition of muscle spindle was neglected. In recent years, the molecular identities of proprioceptive sensory neurons, γ-motoneurons, and intrafusal fibers have been uncovered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blum et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kim et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Oliver et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wu et al., 2021</xref>). Although these studies advanced our understanding of these tissues, a comprehensive, organ-level account of gene expression profiles of all tissues composing the spindle was still missing. Several factors contributed to this shortage. First, there was no transcriptional data on the muscle spindle capsule cells. Second, proprioceptive sensory neurons and γ-motoneurons RNA data were collected from their soma, not necessarily reflecting the expression in the neuron endings. Finally, most of these studies were performed at a single-cell or single-nucleus resolution, hence lacking deep RNA coverage. In this study, we filled these gaps by providing deep sequencing data combined with proteomic data of the intact muscle spindle.</p><p>Local translation of mRNA into protein was shown to regulate multiple aspects of axonal and dendritic biology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Holt and Schuman, 2013</xref>). Because our study was performed on intact muscle spindle, including neuron endings, we could identify genes and proteins that are most likely expressed in terminals. By comparing our RNA-seq data to the expression profiles of isolated DRG proprioceptive neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zheng et al., 2019</xref>) and γ-motoneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blum et al., 2021</xref>), we identify RNA transcripts that potentially derive from these two neuron types. Interestingly, GO enrichment analysis identified a number of enriched synapse-related terms in the neuronal endings of both proprioceptive neurons and γ-motoneurons. Indeed, the peripheral endings of proprioceptive neurons were shown to have presynapse-like structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bewick et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bewick and Banks, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Than et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>). The presence of many presynaptic genes in our RNA dataset reinforces these findings and provides a strong indication to our ability to collect data from these terminals.</p><p>The main problem in the study of muscle spindle is the lack of molecular markers for its different compartments. Our study provides a list of putative markers for the different spindle tissues, which was generated by crossing between our transcriptomic and proteomic datasets. Several of these candidates, which were verified using immunohistochemistry, can be used to study spindle development and pathology.</p><p>The biology of the capsule and the cells that compose it is largely unknown. Questions relating, for example, to the origin of capsule cells, their level of heterogeneity, or the coordination of their differentiation with the development of other spindle tissues are still open. Indication of the significance of the capsule comes from studies on muscular dystrophy, where capsule thickening is observed in both patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cazzato and Walton, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kararizou et al., 2007</xref>) and mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ovalle and Dow, 1986</xref>). By using the markers we have identified, we provide spatiotemporal information on capsule development. We show that the outer capsule cells undergo several steps of differentiation and ECM secretion. Moreover, we found that spatially, the differentiation wave starts at the center of the spindle and propagates to its polar ends. These finding are in agreement with previous studies showing that intrafusal fibers and neurons undergo postnatal maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Maeda et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Soukup et al., 1995</xref>) and indicate developmental coordination between the different tissues of the spindle. It is tempting to speculate about the nature of the molecular mechanism that coordinates this process, which we predict to involve secreted molecules. Interestingly, several secreted growth factors, such as BMPs and FGFs, were identified by our transcriptomic analysis and are therefore potential candidates to coordinate spindle development.</p><p>The spindle capsule is composed of ECM molecules such as collagens type IV and VI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Maier and Mayne, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ovalle and Dow, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sanes, 1982</xref>). Our database contains many ECM genes, some of which likely contribute to the capsule. For example, we showed that VCAN is expressed in the capsule ECM. Furthermore, we identified two novel capsule cell markers, namely GLUT1 for outer capsule cells and Gli1 for outer and inner capsule cells. These findings raise questions regarding the origin of the capsule cells. Since muscle spindles contain both muscle and neuronal tissues, capsule cells may originate either in muscle mesenchyme or in the nervous system. Moreover, the difference we observed between gene expression profiles in inner and outer capsule raise the possibility that these are two distinct cell populations of different origins. Indeed, several lines of evidence suggest that capsule cells have two different origins within the nervous system. First, ultrastructural studies using electron microscopy identified high similarity between outer capsule and perineurial cells and between inner capsule cells and endoneurial fibroblasts of the peripheral nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dow et al., 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Edwards, 1975</xref>). Indeed, we show that the outer capsule cells express perineurial markers, further supporting the perineurial origin of the outer capsule. However, to verify this hypothesis and rule out muscle origin, detailed lineage tracing studies are needed.</p><p>Recent findings show that the proprioceptive system and, specifically, muscle spindles play vital regulatory roles in skeletal development and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Assaraf et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blecher et al., 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Blecher et al., 2017b</xref>). These findings suggest that spindle pathology would have a broad effect on the musculoskeletal system, highlighting the importance of uncovering the molecular composition of the muscle spindle. The molecular data we provide herein will thus support future studies of muscle spindle as well as musculoskeletal biology.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor Benjamin Prosser and Anna Akhmanova as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>All on the reviewing team found the paper to be of high significance and quality, and with the potential to significantly benefit the field. We would be happy to consider a revised manuscript that addresses the issues listed below, with particular emphasis on the two main concerns noted by reviewer 2, which may require some additional immunofluorescence characterization.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>– Please remember to add page and line numbers in your future manuscripts, it makes life much easier!</p><p>– In the introduction, third paragraph: the recent work of Lallemend and colleagues (Wu et al., Nat. Comm. 2021) needs to be cited along with &quot;(Oliver et al., 2021; Wu et al., 2019)&quot;.</p><p>– Please add in the manuscript how many spindles were collected (and from how many mice) for transcriptomics and proteomics analysis.</p><p>– Results section, second paragraph: markers for intrafusal fibres, proprioceptive-SN and extrecellular matrix are discussed but not for γ-MN. It would be great to add a sentence here about the most relevant that popped out in the screen.</p><p>– &quot;The 40 proteins that were differentially expressed in spindle vs muscle samples were grouped into five distinct clusters (Figure 2B).&quot; In Figure 2B it says that &quot;missing data are in white&quot; not sure how to interpret it and there are many white boxes. Do the white boxes mean that the protein is not detected in the sample? or that there is something wrong with analysis? either way, how can you be sure this is a biological difference or just a technical issue and therefore validate the comparison? This point should be made clear.</p><p>– Figure 3BIII.

This could be assessed by phalloidin staining for example and give us information on the potential biphasic specialization of this structure: a first common stage with extrafusal myofibers, then a second phase where the identity of intrafusal myofibers would be activated.</p><p>– In Figure S5, the ends of the fibers have been cut off. If the authors have pictures of these ends, they should provide them: what do the myotendinous junctions of the muscle spindles look like? In Figure 5, the ends of the myofibers are not shown, why? In Figure 5H, the capsule cells and capsule ECM cover the ends of the muscle spindle as if it was not attached to the tendons. The authors should be more specific.</p><p>–The legends of the supplementary tables are not provided</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.81843.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>– Please remember to add page and line numbers in your future manuscripts, it makes life much easier!</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment, following which we have added page and line numbers to our manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– In the introduction, third paragraph: the recent work of Lallemend and colleagues (Wu et al., Nat.

How do you know apart from polar position that those fibers are γ-MN? it would be great to add a marker, VAChT?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that adding a marker such as VAChT would confirm our identification of γ – MN innervation of the muscle spindle. Unfortunately, the suggested co-labeling with VAChT is challenging, because both the anti-ATP1a3 and the commonly used anti-VAChT antibodies are produced in rabbit. We tried using a goat antibody for VAChT and got no staining, even in neuromuscular junctions.</p><p>We concluded that the fibers in 3BIII are γ – MN based on three points: the anatomical location of innervation, on the polar ends of the intrafusal fibers; the unique morphology of these fibers, which is distinct from those of Ia and II innervations in the center of the spindle; and, the previously shown expression of ATP1a3 in γ – MN (Edwards et al., 2013).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Overall, the data presented and the conclusions are very significant and based on well-conducted experiments. If the authors have the space, it would also be relevant to mention the major findings in the literature regarding the establishment of the muscle spindle by myogenic regulatory factors (MRFs of the MyoD family).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that the involvement of MRFs in muscle spindle development is a fascinating subject. Given that muscle spindle differentiation occurs only after the generation of myotubes, MRFs mediate the initial myogenic stages of intra- and extrafusal fibers in a similar way. However, to our knowledge, this question has yet to be examined directly. Nevertheless, following this comment, we have added a description of spindle development (lines 50-54).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Do extrafusal and intrafusal formation rely on the same mechanisms with PAX7+ myogenic stem cells enabling postnatal muscle spindle growth?</p></disp-quote><p>The involvement of Pax7+ stem cells in postnatal muscle spindle growth is a very interesting question. Indeed, Pax3 and Pax7 are expressed by muscle spindle satellite cells (Kirkpatrick, et al., 2008; Kirkpatrick, et al., 2009), and depletion of Pax7-expressing cells results in atrophy of intrafusal fibers, thickening of muscle spindle-associated extracellular matrix and loss of motor coordination (Jackson et al., 2015). These findings indicate that satellite cells and, possibly, Pax7 have an unexplored role in adult muscle spindle function. We believe that the tools we provide in this manuscript will enable future studies of the effect of satellite cells on muscle spindle development and function.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Are myotendinous junctions also required at the ends of the muscle spindles to anchor these spindles in the tendons?</p></disp-quote><p>In our understanding, the myotendinous junctions are not required at the ends of muscle spindles. We and others observed that many spindle poles end well within the belly of a muscle (Banks et al., 2009; Banks et al., 2015). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref> shows the intrafusal fibers (marked by Myh7b) ending within the muscle belly (arrows), which raises the question of the mechanism that anchors these fibers.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>The anchoring of muscle spindles.</title><p>Confocal images of whole-mount EDL muscle from adult mice stained for Myh7b (green), to mark bag 2 intrafusal fiber, and ATP1a3 (magenta).

This could be assessed by phalloidin staining for example and give us information on the potential biphasic specialization of this structure: a first common stage with extrafusal myofibers, then a second phase where the identity of intrafusal myofibers would be activated.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this insight. Indeed, at early stages, Myl2 is not detected but the sarcomeric organization is already established. In order to better visualize this organization, we added a new Figure 4 —figure supplement 2, which shows phalloidin staining at various stages.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– In Figure S5, the ends of the fibers have been cut off. If the authors have pictures of these ends, they should provide them: what do the myotendinous junctions of the muscle spindles look like?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment, and we have changed Figure 3 —figure supplement 2D to include the ends of the fibers as well.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Figure 5, the ends of the myofibers are not shown, why? In Figure 5H, the capsule cells and capsule ECM cover the ends of the muscle spindle as if it was not attached to the tendons. The authors should be more specific.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment and we changed Figure 5 accordingly. We have added the ends of the myofibers in E and we corrected the scheme in H.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>–The legends of the supplementary tables are not provided</p></disp-quote><p>We have added supplementary table legends.</p></body></sub-article></article>
