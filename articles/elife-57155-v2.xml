activity, yet their role in mammalian behavior remains incompletely understood. Especially unclear is whether, and if so how, astrocyte activity regulates contextual fear memory, the dysregulation of which leads to pathological fear-related disorders. We generated <italic>GFAP-ChR2-EYFP</italic> rats to allow the specific activation of astrocytes in vivo by optogenetics. We found that after memory acquisition within a temporal window, astrocyte activation disrupted memory consolidation and persistently decreased contextual but not cued fear memory accompanied by reduced fear-related anxiety behavior. In vivo microdialysis experiments showed astrocyte photoactivation increased extracellular ATP and adenosine concentrations. Intracerebral blockade of adenosine A<sub>1</sub> receptors (A<sub>1</sub>Rs) reversed the attenuation of fear memory. Furthermore, intracerebral or intraperitoneal injection of A<sub>1</sub>R agonist mimicked the effects of astrocyte activation. Therefore, our findings provide a deeper understanding of the astrocyte-mediated regulation of fear memory and suggest a new and important therapeutic strategy against pathological fear-related disorders.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Memory is the record of what we learn over time and is essential to our survival. But not all memories are helpful. Repeatedly recalling a traumatic event – such as an assault – can be harmful. About 1 in 3 people who experience severe trauma go on to develop post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), in which they re-live the traumatic event in the form of flashbacks and nightmares. Others develop panic disorder, phobias or depression.</p><p>Preventing this chain of events is challenging because fear memories form rapidly and last a long time. Current treatments involve re-exposing individuals to the traumatic event. This could be real-life exposure in the case of a phobia. Or it could involve visualizing the event, in the case of PTSD. Controlled re-exposure can help individuals learn new coping strategies. But it does not erase the initial fear memory.</p><p>A better approach might be to take advantage of the fact that new memories are unstable. To form a long-lasting memory trace, newly acquired information must go through a process called consolidation to stabilize it. This process takes place in an area of the brain called the hippocampus. If consolidation does not occur, new memory traces can fade away.</p><p>Li, Li et al. now show that preventing consolidation in the rat brain stops the animals from forming lasting memories of a stressful event, namely a foot shock. In the study, the rats first learned to associate a foot shock with a tone. This training took place inside a specific chamber. After learning the association, the rats began to freeze – a sign of fear – whenever they entered the chamber. This happened even if the tone was not played. But Li, Li et al. showed that they could reduce this fear response by activating cells in the hippocampus known as astrocytes, shortly after the learning episode.</p><p>Activating the astrocytes made them release a substance called adenosine. Molecules of adenosine then bound to and activated proteins called adenosine A<sub>1</sub> receptors. Administering a drug that activated these receptors directly had the same effect as activating the astrocytes themselves. This suggests that drugs of this type could one day help patients with fear-related disorders such as PTSD and phobias. For this to become a reality, new studies must test different drugs and find the best ways of administering them. After testing in animal models, the next step will be preliminary clinical trials in people.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>astrocyte</kwd><kwd>memory

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Astrocytes are the most abundant glial cells in the central nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Allen and Barres, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bushong et al., 2002</xref>) and are recognized for their classical supportive, metabolic, and protective roles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Allaman et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Oliveira et al., 2015</xref>). In addition, increasing evidence has shown that they are actively involved in modulating synaptic transmission and plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Allen and Eroglu, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Weiss et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zhang et al., 2003</xref>). Astrocytes respond to neuronal activity with a transient increase in the cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration, as a result triggering the release of gliotransmitters, which in turn causes feedback regulation of neuronal activity and synaptic transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Araque et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zhang et al., 2003</xref>). However, most of these studies were performed at the synaptic or cellular level, and the roles of astrocytes in mammalian behavior remain incompletely understood.</p><p>Memory is the biological process of retaining and retrieving what we learn over time, and it is crucial for survival. However, remembering traumatic fearful events can be maladaptive, leading to both inappropriate behavioral responses and grave physical or psychological harm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Izquierdo et al., 2016</xref>). In humans, this can lead to various psychiatric disorders including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), panic disorder, phobias, and depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Maren et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Parsons and Ressler, 2013</xref>). The estimated lifetime prevalence of fear- and stress-related disorders is close to 29% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kessler et al., 2005</xref>). Yet limiting pathological fear is a considerable challenge since fear memories are rapidly acquired and temporally enduring. Fear extinction, such as exposure therapy, is a fundamental behavioral method to reduce fear and anxiety in humans. However, exposure therapy is a context-dependent learning process that does not erase the initial fear memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Parsons and Ressler, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tovote et al., 2015</xref>). Fear memory could spontaneously recover or renew when patients are exposed to contexts similar or identical to those in which they first experienced trauma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Britton et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Maren, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tovote et al., 2015</xref>). Therefore, it is urgent to find new therapeutic strategies for treating these disorders. Memory consolidation is a process by which newly acquired information is gradually stabilized by molecular and cellular processes after initial training (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mednick et al., 2011</xref>). New memories are labile and vulnerable to disruption during early consolidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abraham and Williams, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Dudai, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Izquierdo et al., 1999</xref>). Therefore, a feasible and more effective strategy for treating pathological fear would be to prevent fear memory consolidation soon after a traumatic event.</p><p>Context and cue processing are two major components of fear learning and memory. Moreover, context processing is essential for understanding the meaning of cues in a particular context. The dysregulation of contextual fear processing may lead to pathological fear-related disorders such as PTSD, phobias, panic disorder and depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Maren et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Parsons and Ressler, 2013</xref>). The hippocampus is thought to be critical in the formation of contextual fear memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bast et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Besnard et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Daumas et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Maren, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Maren et al., 2013</xref>). Hippocampal pyramidal neurons and interneurons have received much attention related to the contextual fear memory process in the mammalian brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lamsa and Lau, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Roy et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Xia et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zhu et al., 2014</xref>). In vivo animal and human studies have found dynamic morphological and molecular changes in astrocytes during hippocampus-based contextual or spatial memory processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Choi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sagi et al., 2012</xref>), indicating the functional involvement of astrocytes in memory processes. However, as to whether and how astrocyte activity regulates contextual fear memory remains unclear.</p><p>It has been demonstrated that channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) expression is nontoxic, safe, stable, and functional (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Aravanis et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cardin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Deisseroth, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Doroudchi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zhang et al., 2006</xref>). At present, ChR2 is widely used to explore the role of glia in regulating rodent behavior and circuits by precisely manipulating their Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Figueiredo et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gourine et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nam et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Perea et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Yamashita et al., 2014</xref>). Our previous work showed that the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> elevation induced by ChR2 in astrocytes is entirely from the extracellular space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yang et al., 2015</xref>). Due to its proximity to the plasma membrane where exocytosis occurs, transmembrane Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx may be more efficient in inducing gliotransmitter release than Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from intracellular stores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yang et al., 2015</xref>). Rats are well-adapted to the natural environment and are generally considered to perform well in learning and memory tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Crawley, 2007</xref>). The rat brain is relatively large, so injury from optical fibers is relatively small, thus photostimulation can be delivered specifically to the hippocampus. To clarify the exact role of astrocytes in fear memory and fear-related anxiety, we generated transgenic rats with astrocyte-specific ChR2 expression. We found that the optogenetic activation of astrocytes in CA1 within a critical time window after fear conditioning disrupted memory consolidation and persistently reduced contextual fear memory and fear-related anxiety. Conversely, reducing astrocyte Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity increased fear memory. Notably, our data revealed that the gliotransmitter adenosine and adenosine A<sub>1</sub> receptors (A<sub>1</sub>Rs) were responsible for the fear memory attenuation and anxiolytic effect. Furthermore, intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of the A<sub>1</sub>Rs agonist 2-chloro-N6-cyclopentyladenosine (CCPA) within the defined time window also decreased contextual fear memory and fear-related anxiety. Therefore, our findings demonstrate that astrocytes participate in the regulation of contextual fear memory through purinergic signaling. This provides a deeper understanding of the astrocyte-mediated regulation of fear memory and suggests an important therapeutic strategy against pathological fear-related disorders.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Generation of transgenic rats with ChR2 uniquely expressed in astrocytes</title><p>ChR2 induces calcium elevation in astrocytes and it has been used as a tool for astrocyte activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gourine et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yang et al., 2015</xref>). To specifically manipulate the activity of astrocytes in the brain, we generated ChR2 knock-in rats (<italic>GFAP-ChR2-EYFP</italic>) with astrocyte-specific promoter-glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). Co-staining of GFAP in EYFP-positive cells in the hippocampus verified the specific expression of ChR2 in astrocytes. We observed that 96.7% of the EYFP-positive astrocytes were GFAP-positive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>). Furthermore, 92.5% of the GFAP-positive astrocytes in CA1 expressed EYFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and C</xref>).

To determine whether the fear memory attenuation induced by astrocyte activation was mediated by ATP or its degradation product, adenosine, we implanted infusion cannulae bilaterally into dorsal CA1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). ATP-γ-S, the specific P2Y receptor agonist 2-(methylthio)adenosine 5'-diphosphate (MesADP), or vehicle were separately injected into the dorsal CA1 bilaterally after fear conditioning, then we assessed contextual fear memory on day 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>).

There was no difference in contextual fear memory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>). Further, agonists of adenosine receptors were bilaterally delivered to the dorsal CA1 immediately after fear conditioning. The rats given the non-hydrolyzable adenosine analog 5′-(N-ethylcarboxamido)adenosine (NECA) and the specific A<sub>1</sub>R agonist CCPA displayed significantly decreased contextual fear memory on day 2 compared with vehicle-treated rats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref>), while the specific adenosine A<sub>2A</sub> receptor (A<sub>2A</sub>R) agonist CGS 21680 hydrochloride had no effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4J</xref>). NECA and CCPA in the dorsal CA1 did not affect spontaneous locomotor activity or center zone exploration time in the OFT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A–E</xref>). These results showed that the activation of A<sub>1</sub>Rs after memory acquisition mimicked the effects of astrocyte activation on contextual fear memory, indicating that A<sub>1</sub>Rs mediate the contextual fear memory attenuation.</p><p>To further confirm that adenosine participates in the astrocyte activation-induced attenuation of contextual fear memory, we separately injected into CA1 the ectonucleotidase inhibitor ARL 67156 trisodium salt hydrate, which prevents ATP from converting into adenosine, the specific A<sub>1</sub>R antagonist 8-cyclopentyl-1,3-dimethylxanthine (CPT), or the specific A<sub>2A</sub>R antagonist SCH 58261. Vehicle and drug treatment were paired with photostimulation of astrocytes in CA1 immediately after fear conditioning, and contextual fear memory was examined on day 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A and B</xref>). Control rats (without photostimulation or pharmacological treatment), photostimulated rats (without pharmacological treatment), and photostimulated rats paired with vehicle or drug treatment had comparable learning curves for fear conditioning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C–E</xref>). Compared to controls, astrocyte activation alone or paired with vehicle significantly decreased contextual fear memory to a comparable level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F–H</xref>).

These results indicate that the fear memory attenuation induced by astrocyte activation is abrogated with diminished levels of adenosine. CPT treatment also dramatically blocked the attenuation of fear memory induced by astrocyte photostimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>), indicating that astrocyte activation attenuates fear memory in an A<sub>1</sub>R-dependent manner.

Previous studies have reported the essential role of astrocytes in memory processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gao et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Robin et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Suzuki et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Vignoli et al., 2016</xref>). However, it remains unclear whether and how astrocyte activity regulates contextual fear memory. We provide evidence for the first time that astrocyte activation by precise optogenetic stimulation within a defined time window (1 hr) disrupts memory consolidation and dramatically reduces contextual fear memory and the related anxiety. The fear memory attenuation is robust and persistent, while learning capacity remains intact. On the contrary, reducing Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity in astrocytes increased fear memory. Our further results reveal that astrocyte activation increases the extracellular ATP and adenosine concentrations, and the fear memory attenuation and anxiolytic effect are mediated by A<sub>1</sub>R activation. Thus, our findings provide a deeper understanding of astrocyte-mediated regulation of fear memory and the complexity of the functional consequences of astrocyte regulation.</p><p>The hippocampus is essential for the formation of contextual fear memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bast et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Daumas et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Maren, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Maren et al., 2013</xref>), and hippocampal lesions selectively affect contextual fear memory but not cued fear memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kim and Fanselow, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Phillips and LeDoux, 1992</xref>). Context plays a central role in understanding the meaning of cues, abstracting the surrounding information and anticipating the future in a particular context. Disorders in contextual processing may lead to fear-related diseases, including PTSD, panic disorder, phobias and depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Maren et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Parsons and Ressler, 2013</xref>). PTSD may be the most representative of context-processing diseases, given that its core features involve recurrent and intrusive recollections (flashbacks) of an experienced traumatic event (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rosenbaum, 2004</xref>). Finding new mechanisms underlying contextual memory processing is thus critical in developing strategies for relieving sufferers from pathological fear. Memory consolidation is a molecular and cellular processes by which newly-acquired information is gradually stabilized by strengthening synaptic connections after the initial training (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Dudai, 2004</xref>). It has been proposed that long-term potentiation (LTP), a form of synaptic plasticity, is an intrinsic property of this consolidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abraham and Williams, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kandel et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Yang et al., 2018</xref>). Once LTP or memory has passed into the protein synthesis-dependent phase, LTP is highly resistant to disruption, while memory becomes more difficult to erase and is said to have been consolidated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abraham and Williams, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mednick et al., 2011</xref>). So if the time between learning and interference is sufficiently long for the processes associated with LTP to have occurred, the memory trace would be less vulnerable. Our present study showed that photoactivation of astrocytes in CA1 within the early memory consolidation phase (1 hr) but not beyond it (2 hr, 3 hr or during retrieval) after a fear stimulus produced a long-lasting attenuation of contextual fear memory and an anxiolytic effect. This finding is in accordance with reports that new memories are sensitive to interference within a short time (1 hr) after learning, but not after a relatively long interval (6 hr) during which the memory trace becomes consolidated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mednick et al., 2011</xref>). More importantly, our results suggest a new strategy of astrocyte-based disruption of memory consolidation, which leads to persistent fear memory attenuation with attenuated spontaneous recovery of fear memory.</p><p>Astrocytes respond to neuronal activity and release different neuroactive molecules, among which ATP (adenosine), glutamate, D-serine, and gamma-aminobutyric acid are the major gliotransmitters identified as regulators of synaptic transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Araque et al., 2014</xref>). Recent study showed that activating astrocytes by chemogenetic or optogenetic recruitment of their Gq-coupled signaling before or during memory acquisition induces N-methyl-D-aspartate-dependent <bold>long-term potentiation</bold> in CA1 through the release of D-serine and enhances memory acquisition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adamsky et al., 2018</xref>). However, another study showed that chemogenetic activation of astrocytes before memory retrieval reduces the expression of an acquired cued fear response, which is mediated by inhibiting excitatory synapses from the basolateral amygdala via A<sub>1</sub>R activation and enhancing inhibitory synapses from the lateral subdivision of the central amygdala via <bold>A<sub>2A</sub></bold> activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Martin-Fernandez et al., 2017</xref>). These contradictory results indicate that different patterns of stimulation may induce astrocytes to release different substances which then activate their associated receptors on nearby neurons, leading to different forms of synaptic regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Covelo and Araque, 2018</xref>).</p><p>Previous work in our lab established that the gliotransmitters ATP and adenosine but not glutamate and D-serine are involved in astrocyte-mediated synaptic suppression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zhang et al., 2003</xref>). Astrocyte-derived ATP increases the activity of cholecystokinin-expressing interneurons through the activation of P2Y1 receptors and decreases pyramidal neuron activity through the activation of A<sub>1</sub>Rs in CA1, resulting in the downregulation of the whole network activity in the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tan et al., 2017</xref>). Similarly, a recent publication showed that adenosine degraded from the astrocyte-derived ATP upregulates the synaptic inhibition of pyramidal neurons by somatostatin-expressing interneurons via A<sub>1</sub>R activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Matos et al., 2018</xref>). The activation of A<sub>1</sub>Rs inhibits adenylate cyclase, which causes a decrease in the second messenger cAMP, inhibits voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels and activates G-protein-coupled inwardly rectifying K<sup>+</sup> channels through Gi/o βγ-subunits, and decreases the excitability of pyramidal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Burnstock et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fields and Burnstock, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wetherington and Lambert, 2002</xref>). Previous studies demonstrate that neurons with relatively high intrinsic excitability promote memory integration (via co-allocation to overlapping engrams), while decreased excitability promotes memory separation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Josselyn, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Josselyn and Frankland, 2018</xref>). Our in vivo microdialysis experiments showed that photostimulation of astrocytes led to significant increase in extracellular ATP and adenosine concentrations. Both an ectonucleotidase inhibitor (which prevents ATP from converting to adenosine) and a specific A<sub>1</sub>R antagonist dramatically reversed astrocyte activation-induced fear memory attenuation. But a specific A<sub>2A</sub>R antagonist did not have this effect. Furthermore, A<sub>1</sub>R agonist application within the critical time window mimicked the effects of astrocyte activation on fear memory and the anxiolytic effect. Therefore, we demonstrate that the astrocyte-mediated attenuation of contextual fear memory and the related anxiety found in our experimental conditions depends on A<sub>1</sub>Rs, which could act as potential new molecular targets for the treatment of fear-related disorders.</p><p>Together, our results identify a functional role of astrocytes in contextual fear memory and the related anxiety and reveal that astrocytes are essential elements in fear memory processing through purinergic signaling in the hippocampus. Consequently, our findings provide a deeper understanding of astrocyte-mediated regulation of fear memory and suggest a new and important therapeutic strategy against pathological fear-related disorders. An attempt to use this strategy in clinic could be very promising.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>Rattus norvegicus</italic>, male/female)</td><td>Sprague-Dawley rats</td><td valign="top">Shanghai SLAC Laboratory Animal C.,Ltd</td><td valign="top">N/A</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>R. norvegicus</italic>, male/female)</td><td><italic>GFAP-ChR2-EYFP</italic> rats</td><td valign="top">Institute of Neuroscience, Chinese Academy of Sciences</td><td valign="top">N/A</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent (virus)</td><td valign="top">pZac2.1 GfaABC1D mCherry-hPMCA2w/b</td><td>Addgene</td><td>Cat# 111568</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent (virus)</td><td valign="top">AAV5 GfaABC1D mCherry-hPMCA2w/b</td><td valign="top">Vigene Biosciences</td><td valign="top">N/A</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent (virus)</td><td valign="top">AAV5 GfaABC1D tdTomato</td><td valign="top">Vigene Biosciences</td><td valign="top">N/A</td><td/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Anti-GFAP, rabbit polyclonal</td><td valign="top">Millipore</td><td valign="top">Cat# AB5804</td><td valign="top">(1:500)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Anti-NeuN, mouse monoclonal</td><td valign="top">Millipore</td><td valign="top">Cat# MAB377</td><td valign="top">(1:400)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Anti-DsRed, rabbit polyclonal</td><td valign="top">Clontech</td><td valign="top">Cat# 632496</td><td valign="top">(1:500)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Alexa Fluor 568 donkey anti-rabbit IgG (H+L)</td><td valign="top">Invitrogen</td><td valign="top">Cat# A10042</td><td valign="top">(1:1000)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Alexa Fluor 647 donkey anti-mouse IgG (H+L)</td><td valign="top">Invitrogen</td><td valign="top">Cat# A31571</td><td valign="top">(1:1000)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Alexa Fluor 488 donkey anti-mouse IgG (H+L)</td><td valign="top">Invitrogen</td><td valign="top">Cat# A21202</td><td valign="top">(1:1000)</td></tr><tr><td>Commercial assay or kit</td><td valign="top">ATP Assay Kit</td><td valign="top">Sigma-Aldrich</td><td valign="top">Cat# FLAA</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Commercial assay or kit</td><td valign="top">Adenosine Assay Kit</td><td valign="top">BioVision</td><td valign="top">Cat# K327-100</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">ATP-γ-S</td><td valign="top">Sigma-Aldrich</td><td valign="top">Cat# A1388;

To generate <italic>GFAP-ChR2-EYFP</italic> knock-in rats, we designed the single guide (sg) RNA near the stop codon in the last exon of the GFAP gene, and constructed a donor plasmid containing the ChR2-EYFP sequence. The plasmid was used as a template to repair the double-strand break by homologous recombination. Super-ovulated female Sprague-Dawley rats were mated to Sprague-Dawley males, and fertilized embryos were collected from the oviducts. Cas9 mRNA, sgRNAs, and donor were mixed and injected into the cytoplasm of fertilized eggs using a Narishige IM300 microinjector and the zygotes were cultured for several hours. Thereafter, 20–25 embryos were transferred into the oviducts of pseudopregnant Sprague-Dawley rats. The genotypes of mutant mice were determined by PCR of genomic DNA extracted from the tail.</p><p>Experiments were conducted on 2- to 4-month-old male and female <italic>GFAP-ChR2-EYFP</italic> rats and WT Sprague-Dawley rats. The rats were housed with food and water available ad libitum in a temperature-controlled room with a 12 hr light/dark cycle (lights on at 07:00). Rats were singly housed after surgery. All experimental procedures were approved by the Animal Advisory Committee at Zhejiang University (2019–2#) and were performed in strict accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (2006–398#). All surgeries were performed under sodium pentobarbital anesthesia, and every effort was made to minimize suffering.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Stereotactic surgery for optical fiber and cannula implantation and in vivo optogenetic manipulation</title><p>Rats were deeply anesthetized with pentobarbital sodium (1%, wt/vol) and placed on a stereotaxic frame (Kopf, USA). Body temperature was kept stable throughout the procedure with a heating pad. A scalp incision was made with eye scissors. The skull was exposed and perforated with a stereotaxic drill at the target region. For optogenetic fiber implantation, two optical fibers (core diameter 200 µm, NA 0.37; Newdoon, China) were bilaterally implanted into CA1 (AP, –3.75 mm; ML,±2.46 mm; DV, –2.63 mm relative to bregma) for optogenetic manipulations. The optical fibers were connected to a laser source using a fiber optic patch cord (Newdoon, China). The intensity of laser stimulation was measured before each experiment at the tip of the optical fiber via a laser power meter (LP1, Sanwa, Japan). For pharmacological experiments, two guide cannulae (RWD Life Science, China) were bilaterally implanted into CA1 at the above coordinates for drug infusion. For photostimulation coupled with pharmacological experiments, an optical fiber (AP, –3.75 mm; ML, 1.85 mm; DV, –3.10 mm relative to bregma, at a 12° angle) and an infusion cannula (AP, –3.75 mm; ML, 3.01 mm; DV, –1.76 mm relative to bregma, at a 15° angle) were unilaterally implanted into CA1 for simultaneous photostimulation and drug infusion. The optical fibers and cannulae were fixed to the skull with dental cement. After the implantation surgery, rats were allowed to recover for 7 days before behavioral tests. After experiments, the positions of the optical fibers and cannulae were verified histologically. Rats with incorrect positioning of optical fibers or cannulae were excluded.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>In vivo virus microinjection</title><p>pZac2.1-GfaABC1D-mCherry-hPMCA2w/b was from Baljit Khakh Lab Plasmids in Addgene (Addgene plasmid # 111568). AAV5 GfaABC1D mCherry-hPMCA2w/b (7.0 × 10<sup>12</sup> viral genomes/ml) and AAV5 GfaABC1D tdTomato (6.0 × 10<sup>12</sup> viral genomes/ml) were constructed by Vigene Biosciences (Shandong, China). Rats were anesthetized with pentobarbital sodium (1%, wt/vol) and placed on a stereotaxic frame (Kopf, USA). Viruses were injected bilaterally into the dorsal CA1 (450 nl, 50 nl/min) via a microsyringe. The needle was left in place for 15–20 min after the end of infusion to allow diffusion of the virus. After injection, mice were allowed 3 weeks of recovery and then performed behavioral tests.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Fear-conditioning task</title><p>The fear-conditioning task was carried out in a 25 × 25 × 25 cm conditioning chamber (Panlab Harvard Apparatus, Spain) placed inside a sound-protected box. This task consisted of three phases: fear conditioning (training), testing for contextual fear (a hippocampus-dependent test) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kim and Fanselow, 1992</xref>), and cued fear (a hippocampus-independent test) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Phillips and LeDoux, 1992</xref>). Rats were handled for 3 days before training was begun. On day 1, rats were placed into a fear conditioning chamber with a grid floor capable of delivering foot shocks, after the chamber was cleaned with 70% alcohol. The baseline freezing level was measured during a 2-min exploration period prior to the first conditioned stimulus (CS). Rats were then exposed to a 30 s tone (CS, 2 kHz, 85 dB) that co-terminated with a 2 s scrambled foot shock (unconditioned stimulus, US, 0.6 mA). A total of three tone-shock pairings were delivered with an inter-tone interval of 60 s. The rats remained in the conditioning chamber for a 90 s consolidation period following the last US. The conditioning phase lasted for 7 min, and all the processes were carried out in a relatively dark chamber. Twenty-four hours after conditioning, the rats were placed in the conditioning chamber for a 5-min contextual test. The cued test was carried out in a relatively bright chamber that had a context and smell different from the conditioning chamber (cleaned with 1% acetic acid). In the cued test, rats received a CS recall test (3 presentations of the 30 s CS alone with a 30-s inter-tone interval). The rats were considered to freeze if no movement was detected for 2 s. In the contextual test, the freezing level was calculated as the percentage of freezing time during 5 min in context. In fear-conditioning and the cued test, the freezing level was calculated as the percentage of freezing time during three presentations of the CS. The data were automatically recorded using commercial software (FREEZING, Panlab Harvard Apparatus, Spain).</p><p>When assessing the effect of astrocyte activation on fear memory, the rats received photostimulation for 15 min (473 nm, 10 Hz, 20 ms pulses, 1<bold>–</bold>3 mW at the fiber tip, 30 s light on, 30 s light off) immediately after fear conditioning or with an interval of 1, 2, and 3 hr. Sham operation was defined as surgery including the implantation of optical fibers and cannulae but without photostimulation. For pharmacological manipulations, drugs or vehicle were delivered by intracerebral or i.p. injection immediately after fear conditioning.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Anxiety-like behavioral test</title><p>The OFT is a classical test to measure anxiety-like behavior in rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cai et al., 2018</xref>). Rats were placed in the corner of a black open field arena (100 × 100 × 40 cm) at the start of the experiment and allowed to freely explore for 5 min. The center of the open field was defined as the central 50% of the arena. The locomotor activity of the rats in the open field was video-recorded and analyzed with automatic behavioral tracking software (ANY-maze, Stoelting Co., USA). The open field chamber was cleaned with 70% alcohol between animals. In the optogenetic studies, the total test time of 9 min was divided into three consecutive 3-min epochs consisting of stimulation off, stimulation on, and stimulation off periods (OFF-ON-OFF). The total distance was defined as the distance moved in a 3- or 5 min OFT. The center zone time was defined as the exploration time in the center area of the open field during a 3- or 5-min test.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Object location recognition (OLR)</title><p>Rats were habituated to a square testing arena (100 cm ×100 cm × 40 cm) for 10 min per day for 3 consecutive days. After habituation, the OLR task was divided into a sample phase and a test phase, each lasting 5 min. In the sample phase, each rat was placed in the arena, exposed to two identical objects, and then returned to its home cage. After a 24 hr delay, each rat was returned to the arena for the test phase when it was exposed to the same objects as in the sample phase except that one of these objects (displaced object, DO) was moved to a novel location in the arena. The other (undisplaced object, UDO) remained in the original location. The time spent in exploring each object was recorded. Exploration was defined as touching the object with the nose or directing the nose to the object at a distance of no more than 2 cm. The percentage of time spent exploring an object was defined as: (time at novel or familiar)/(time at novel + time at familiar). The discrimination index was calculated as: (time at novel − time at familiar)/(time at novel + time at familiar), where novel refers to the object in a novel location, and familiar refers to the other object.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Microdialysis</title><p>Microdialysis was conducted on awake, freely moving rats as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nam et al., 2016</xref>) with modifications.

Microdialysis sampling was started after 6 days of recovery from surgery. On the day of sampling, a microdialysis probe (CMA 12 Elite, membrane length 2 mm, CMA Microdialysis AB, Sweden) was inserted into CA1 through the probe cannula 3 hr before the start of microdialysis. The probe was connected to a syringe pump (CMA 402) with polyethylene tubing and perfused continuously with artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) at a constant flow rate of 1.5 μl/min. After pre-washing (30 min) and recovery (1 hr), 40 min samples of baseline dialysate were collected by an 820 microsampler (Univentor, Malta) as the first microdialysis. Then the second microdialysis for 40 min began with 15 min photostimulation. Extracellular fluid was collected in plastic vials in the presence of the ectonuclease inhibitor ARL67156 (100 μM final concentration).

A calibration curve was generated with standard ATP samples and the luminescence of the dialysis medium was measured as the background ATP level. A 50 µl sample was added to 50 µl of ATP assay mix containing luciferase-luciferin buffer.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers including Margaret M McCarthy as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Laura Colgin as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Long-Jun Wu (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As the editors have judged that your manuscript is of interest, but as described below that additional experiments are required before it is published, we would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Li et al., present a well-written, well-organized and potentially impactful study on the role of astrocyte signaling in fear memory using optogenetic manipulation specifically in astrocytes. The authors generated GFAP-ChR2-EYFP rats to enable optogenetic manipulation of astrocytes in rats. They found that optogenetic activation of astrocytes impaired memory consolidation.

We agree with the reviewer that adenosine lowers arousal. However, our major conclusion of photostimulation- and drug-induced fear memory attenuation is supported by evidence including: (a) we delivered the photostimulation and drugs after but not before or during the Pavlovian fear conditioning. Our protocol aimed to affect the memory consolidation process rather than the learning process, and indeed the learning curves of control and treated rats were similar, showing that they had similar performance in learning (Figure 2, Figure 4, Figure 5 and Figure 6); and (b) astrocyte activation by photostimulation in hippocampal CA1 specifically decreased the hippocampus-dependent contextual fear memory but not the hippocampus-independent cued fear memory (Figure 2). Arousal changes the general state of rats. By affecting arousal, the animal would show a general variation in fear memory without selectivity for contextual or cued fear memory. These results showed that astrocyte activation specifically decreased contextual fear memory through the disruption of memory consolidation, suggesting that these cannot be the result of changes in arousal.</p><p>Following the reviewer's valuable suggestion, we further tested whether astrocyte activity is required for fear memory attenuation. Astrocyte Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling was attenuated by the expression of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-extruder PMCA2w/b (plasma membrane Ca<sup>2+</sup> ATPase isoform 2 splice variant w/b) in hippocampal astrocytes (Yu et al., 2020; Yu et al., 2018). So, we used an adeno-associated virus (AAV5) expressing human PMCA2w/b (hPMCA2w/b) with an astrocyte-specific GfaABC1D promoter to reduce hippocampal astrocyte Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling (Figure 2G and H). In the control group, we microinjected tdTomato instead of hPMCA2w/b (Figure 2—figure supplement 4A and B). We ran behavioral tests 21 days after viral injection and found that control and hPMCA2w/b rats did not differ in distance moved and center zone exploration time in the open field test (Figure 2—figure supplement 4C and D). To assess whether fear memory is affected by reducing hippocampal astrocyte Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling, we used the Pavlovian fear conditioning paradigm again, and the contextual and cued fear memory were measured on day 2 after fear acquisition. We found that control and hPMCA2w/b rats had comparable learning curves for fear conditioning (Figure2—figure supplement 4E). Interestingly, contextual fear memory but not cued fear memory (Figure 2J and K) was significantly increased in hPMCA2w/b rats. These results demonstrated that hippocampal astrocyte activity is indeed required for contextual fear memory.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Microdialysis experiments indicated an increase in adenosine from ~3 nM to ~3.5 nM following photostimulation.

Along the similar line, the specific time window (within one hour after fear conditioning) of effective photostimulation on behaviors is quite amazing, but needs more explanation.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for raising this important concern.</p><p>Our explanation is:</p><p>a) Microdialysis experiments showed an increase of adenosine (first, 2.88 ± 0.17 μM, <sup>second</sup>, 3.42 ± 0.11 μM) following photostimulation (Figure 4). The increase is statistically significant and is ~0.5 μM in absolute value. And the real extracellular adenosine concentration is higher than that in the dialysate because adenosine is metabolized extremely fast, and in the process of sample collection, the material in the probe and tubing, flow rate, probe length, and recovery can influence the quantitative estimation of extracellular fluid concentrations (Hammarlund-Udenaes, 2017). So, the actual increase in absolute adenosine concentration may be higher in vivo.</p><p>b) The adenosine A<sub>1</sub> receptor (A<sub>1</sub>R) is a G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that preferentially couples to inhibitory Gi/o heterotrimeric G proteins. In the pharmacology of the GPCR-ligand complex, a very small increase in the fractional receptor occupancy can cause a dramatic increase in the tissue response as shown in the most common hyperbolic relationship between the receptor occupancy of acetylcholine in guinea-pig ileum and the tissue response (Kenakin, 2017). These data indicate that when the adenosine level rises to reach a certain A<sub>1</sub>R occupancy threshold in vivo, a profound effect on memory can occur. We have discussed how adenosine and A<sub>1</sub>Rs influence the neuronal excitability and memory in the Discussion section in the revised manuscript.</p><p>c) We followed the reviewer's suggestion and provided further explanation and references for the specific time window in the Discussion section in the revised manuscript: &quot;Memory consolidation is a molecular and cellular processes by which newly-acquired information is gradually stabilized by strengthening synaptic connections after the initial training (Dudai, 2004). It has been proposed that long-term potentiation (LTP), a form of synaptic plasticity, is an intrinsic property of this consolidation (Abraham and Williams, 2008; Kandel et al., 2014). Once the LTP or memory has passed into the protein synthesis-dependent phase, LTP is highly resistant to disruption, while memory becomes more difficult to erase and is said to have been consolidated (Abraham and Williams, 2008; Mednick et al., 2011). So if the time between learning and interference is sufficiently long for the processes associated with LTP to have occurred, the memory trace would become less vulnerable. Our present study showed that photoactivation of astrocytes in CA1 within the early memory consolidation phase (1 hour) but not beyond it (2 hours, 3 hours or during retrieval) after a fear stimulus produced a long-lasting attenuation of contextual fear memory and an anxiolytic effect. This finding is in accordance with reports that new memories are sensitive to interference within a short time (1 hour) after learning, but not after a relatively long interval (6 hours) during which the memory trace becomes consolidated (Mednick et al., 2011).&quot;</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors investigated the effects of ATP and ADP by infusing stable forms of these compounds (ATP-γ-S or MeSADP) into the hippocampus.

However, both of these compounds in the mM range should certainly evoke large astrocyte calcium activity through Gq-coupled P2Y or ionotropic P2X receptors expressed on astrocytes. The authors showed that their ChR2 activation increases astrocyte calcium activity (Figure 1), and this increase in calcium (potentially through non-selective cation flux through ChR2) is presumably upstream of increased ATP release and adenosine levels. So why does the potential for high astrocyte calcium activity with local ATP-γ-S or MeSADP infusion not feed into the upstream mechanism for fear memory impairment?</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer's comments.</p><p>Our explanation is:</p><p>a) P2X and P2Y receptors are widely distributed throughout the brain, in both neurons and glia. ATP-γ-S and MesADP induce a [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> increase in many types of neurons and glia. These signals are naturally complex and involve both P2Y-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from the intracellular stores and P2X-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx (Burnstock et al., 2011; Lalo et al., 1998). It is likely that the potential effect of astrocyte Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity with local ATP-γ-S or MesADP infusion on fear memory was obscured by their effects on neurons.</p><p>b) Specific ChR2 expression induces Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevation in astrocytes and has been used as a tool for astrocyte activation (Chen et al., 2013; Figueiredo et al., 2011; Gourine et al., 2010; Tan et al., 2017). Our previous work showed that the ChR2-induced [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> elevation in astrocytes is entirely due to Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx from the extracellular space, and this is mostly attributed to the Na<sup>+</sup>-Ca<sup>2+</sup> exchanger following Na<sup>+</sup> influx through ChR2 channels (Yang et al., 2015). Unlike the activation of metabotropic receptors by local ATP-γ-S or MesADP, the ChR2-induced [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> elevation is the result of membrane channel-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry from the extracellular space, but not from intracellular ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> release. Due to the proximity to the plasma membrane where exocytosis occurs, transmembrane Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx may be more efficient in inducing gliotransmitter release than Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from intracellular stores (Chen et al., 2013; Tan et al., 2017; Yang et al., 2015). Some description has been added into the Introduction in the revised manuscript.</p><p>c) In addition, previous studies have demonstrated that different stimulation patterns may induce astrocytes to release different substances that then activate their corresponding receptors on nearby neurons, leading to different forms of synaptic regulation (Covelo and Araque, 2018). Therefore, a local ATP-γ-S- and MeSADP-induced increase of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> did not affect fear memory probably due to their different stimulation patterns compared to photostimulation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Only hippocampus is stimulated.

Epidemiological investigations have shown that females are twice as likely to develop PTSD as males (Breslau, 2001; Parsons and Ressler, 2013). However, the chance of exposure to traumatic events such as military combat, disaster, and criminal violence is higher in males than females (Breslau, 2001; Parsons and Ressler, 2013). In populations such as war veterans, police officers, and firefighters who work in highly exposed traumatic situations, there are more males. The Pavlovian fear conditioning paradigm is a commonly-used animal model of PTSD (Mahan and Ressler, 2012). Many studies have used male mice or rats to study the cellular mechanisms and circuitry of fear memory for the potential therapy of PTSD (Han et al., 2009; Khalaf et al., 2018; Rossetti et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2020).</p><p>Incorporating both sexes would aid to more comprehensively understand and infer links with clinical symptoms (McCarthy et al., 2017). Following the reviewer's suggestion, we examined the effect of astrocyte activation on fear memory in female rats. Photostimulation in the dorsal CA1 followed the Pavlovian fear conditioning paradigm, and contextual and cued fear memory were measured on day 2 after fear acquisition (Figure 2—figure supplement 1A). Consistent with the results in male rats, the photostimulated female rats showed no difference in freezing levels during fear conditioning compared with controls (sham operation) (Figure 2—figure supplement 1B). Contextual fear memory but not cued fear memory (Figure 2—figure supplement 1C and D) was significantly decreased in the photostimulated females. These results showed that the fear memory attenuation induced by astrocyte activation is present in both males and females.

The plasmid was used as a template to repair the double-strand break by homologous recombination. Super-ovulated female Sprague-Dawley rats were mated to Sprague-Dawley males, and fertilized embryos were collected from the oviducts. Cas9 mRNA, sgRNAs, and donor were mixed and injected into the cytoplasm of fertilized eggs using a Narishige IM300 microinjector and the zygotes were cultured for several hours. Thereafter, 20–25 embryos were transferred into the oviducts of pseudopregnant Sprague-Dawley rats. The genotypes of mutant mice were determined by PCR of genomic DNA extracted from the tail.&quot;</p><p>In addition, we followed the reviewer's suggestion by performing IHC experiments and confirmed the specific expression of ChR2 in different brain areas such as the motor cortex, lateral posterior thalamic nucleus, and dorsomedial hypothalamic nucleus. We observed the co-localization of EYFP labeling with the specific astrocytic marker GFAP, but not with the neuronal marker NeuN.

It has been demonstrated that ChR2 expression is nontoxic, safe, stable, and functional (Aravanis et al., 2007; Cardin et al., 2010; Deisseroth, 2011; Doroudchi et al., 2011; Zhang et al., 2006). At present, ChR2 is widely used to explore the role of glia in regulating rodent behavior and circuits by precisely manipulating their Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling (Bang et al., 2016; Figueiredo et al., 2011; Gourine et al., 2010; Nam et al., 2016; Perea et al., 2014; Yamashita et al., 2014). We have added the above statement to the Introduction in the revised manuscript.</p><p>In the present study, we found that photostimulation of astrocytes triggered increased ATP and adenosine concentrations in CA1. The gliotransmitter adenosine and A<sub>1</sub>Rs were responsible for the fear memory attenuation and anxiolytic effect. Similarly, astrocytic ATP release has also been induced by optogenetic stimulation of ChR2-expressing spinal astrocytes and induces pain hypersensitivity through adenosine receptors (Nam et al., 2016).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Figure 3D-G, why did the rats with retraining at D27 have very low freezing baseline?

On day 27 the photostimulated rats (conditioned) performed the object location recognition (OLR) task and spent percentages of time exploring the object similar to controls in the sample phase (Figure 3H), indicating that astrocyte activation does not affect new learning. Furthermore, in the test phase of OLR on day 28, the conditioned rats spent more time exploring the object in a novel location relative to the object in a familiar location (Figure 3I) and the discrimination index was similar to controls (Figure 3J). These data suggest that astrocyte activation does not affect new memory formation.
