be tightly regulated to generate protective but limit self-reactive immune responses. While loss of humoral tolerance has been associated with microbial infections, the pathways involved in balancing protective versus autoreactive antibody responses in humans are incompletely understood. Studies in classical mouse model systems have provided evidence that balancing of immune responses through inhibitory receptors is an important quality control checkpoint. Genetic differences between inbred mouse models and the outbred human population and allelic receptor variants not present in mice; however, argue for caution when directly translating these findings to the human system. By studying <italic>Borrelia burgdorferi</italic> infection in humanized mice reconstituted with human hematopoietic stem cells from donors homozygous for a functional or a non-functional FcγRIIb allele, we show that the human inhibitory FcγRIIb is a critical checkpoint balancing protective and autoreactive immune responses, linking infection with induction of autoimmunity in the human immune system.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>humanized mouse</kwd><kwd>borrelia burgdorferi</kwd><kwd>autoimmunity</kwd><kwd>arthritis</kwd><kwd>Fc-receptor</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>TRR130-P13</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nimmerjahn</surname><given-names>Falk</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FOR 2886</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nimmerjahn</surname><given-names>Falk</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FOR2886</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lux</surname><given-names>Anja</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004563</institution-id><institution>Bavarian State Ministry of Education, Science and the Arts</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dudziak</surname><given-names>Diana</given-names></name><name><surname>Gessner</surname><given-names>André</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>In the absence of human FcgRIIb function, an infection with <italic>Borrelia burgdorferi</italic> triggers enhanced autoreactive immune responses in humanized mice in vivo.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>B cells are an essential part of the adaptive immune system and antibody responses mounted during microbial infections protect the host from re-infection, ideally inducing sterile immunity. Loss of humoral tolerance is associated with the development of several severe autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ludwig et al., 2017</xref>). A variety of well-defined inbred mouse model systems have firmly established that autoantibodies can directly cause tissue inflammation and destruction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hogarth and Pietersz, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nimmerjahn and Ravetch, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Takai, 2002</xref>). Of note, there is a link between infections and the induction of autoimmune diseases, suggesting that during the initiation of pathogen-specific immune responses self-reactive responses may be triggered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brownlie et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Smith and Clatworthy, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Waisberg et al., 2011</xref>). One prime example for such a scenario is an infection with <italic>Borrelia burgdorferi</italic>, which can lead to the development of joint inflammation and induction of autoimmune arthritis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arvikar et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Steere and Glickstein, 2004</xref>). Thus, checkpoints must be in place to limit the production of self-reactive immune responses while simultaneously promoting pathogen-specific immune system activation. Studies in inbred mouse model systems have identified the inhibitory Fcγ-receptor IIb (FcγRIIb) expressed on B cells as one key factor for regulating humoral immune responses at several stages of B cell development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Daëron et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Smith and Clatworthy, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Takai, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Tarasenko et al., 2007</xref>). Mice with altered FcγRIIb expression or a B-cell-specific/ubiquitous deletion of FcγRIIb show higher levels of IgM and IgG antibody responses, have an impaired germinal center reaction, and develop a systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) like disease on susceptible genetic backgrounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bolland and Ravetch, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bolland et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Espéli et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Li et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Su et al., 2004a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Su et al., 2004b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Takai et al., 1996</xref>). In contrast, mice with a general or a B-cell-specific overexpression of FcγRIIb showed reduced autoantibody production and autoimmune disease development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brownlie et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">McGaha et al., 2005</xref>). As mice generated on the C57BL/6 background developed a less pronounced autoimmune phenotype it was suggested that other genes act in concert with FcγRIIb to break humoral tolerance in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Boross et al., 2011</xref>). Apart from regulating the level and quality of antibody responses, isolated triggering of FcγRIIb on plasma cells was shown to induce apoptosis, suggesting that FcγRIIb may also regulate plasma cell homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Xiang et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>In humans, the level of inhibitory Fcγ-receptor IIb expression correlated with the development and severity of several autoimmune diseases. Patients with SLE and chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, for example, were shown to express lower levels of FcγRIIb on mature B cells and failed to upregulate FcγRIIb expression on memory B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mackay et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tackenberg et al., 2009</xref>). Moreover, polymorphisms in the fcgr2b promoter and in the FcγRIIb transmembrane domain have been associated with the development of SLE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Floto et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kono et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Niederer et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Su et al., 2007</xref>). Interestingly, the human FcγRIIb-232T allele, in which an isoleucine residue in the transmembrane domain of the receptor is replaced with a threonine residue, resulting in an altered plasma membrane localization and decreased receptor function, was shown to be enriched in areas with malaria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Clatworthy et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Waisberg et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Willcocks et al., 2010</xref>). Thus, under negative selection pressure, a decreased level of FcγRIIb expression may provide a competitive advantage for mounting faster parasite-specific immune responses at the potential risk of inducing autoimmunity.</p><p>While the results obtained in the human system support a model in which human FcγRIIb may be involved in controlling both, protective and autoreactive humoral immune responses, the lack of model systems allowing to study the human immune system in vivo has prevented more in depth analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lux and Nimmerjahn, 2013</xref>). To study this in more detail in the context of a human immune system, we made use of a humanized mouse model system, in which animals are reconstituted with hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) from donors carrying either the fully functional (FcγRIIb-232I) or the functionally impaired allelic variant (FcγRIIb-232T) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baerenwaldt et al., 2011</xref>). By infecting humanized mice harbouring functional or non-functional FcγRIIb allelic variants with <italic>Borrelia burgdorferi (B. burgdorferi),</italic> we now show that mice with a non-functional FcγRIIb allele mount greater T-cell-independent pathogen-specific antibody responses leading to a lower pathogen burden. Of note, humanized mice with impaired FcγRIIb function developed strong autoreactive antibody responses during infection, suggesting that human FcγRIIb is regulating both, the quality and quantity of human humoral immune responses. Extending these observations to the human clinical situation, we further demonstrate that humans infected with <italic>Borrelia spec.</italic> also developed an autoantibody response in parallel to the initiation of pathogen-specific antibody responses.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The human immune system ameliorates lyme arthritis in humanized mice</title><p>To study human FcγRIIb function in vivo, we chose a humanized mouse model of Lyme borreliosis. In humans and select mouse strains, such as severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice, an infection with <italic>Borrelia burgdorferi</italic> (<italic>B. burgdorferi</italic>) triggers an inflammatory response (Lyme arthritis) caused by spirochete lipoproteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barthold et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Schaible et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Steere and Glickstein, 2004</xref>). If a treatment with antibiotics early after infection is not initiated or fails, this represents a major health issue. Based on previous studies in inbred mouse model systems, it has been suggested that the humoral immune system and especially the early T-cell-independent IgM and IgG3 response plays a critical role in controlling <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> spread (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barthold et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barthold et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fikrig et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">LaRocca and Benach, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">McKisic and Barthold, 2000</xref>). Furthermore, non-obese diabetic (NOD)/SCID/γc-/- (NSG) mice transplanted with a human immune system were shown to develop a relapsing fever phenotype upon infection with <italic>Borrelia hermsii</italic> similar to the human disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Vuyyuru et al., 2011</xref>). These findings suggest that hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) humanized mice may provide a suitable model system to study whether human FcγRIIb controls pathogen and concomitant self-reactive immune responses during an infection with B. <italic>burgdorferi</italic>. To test if humanized NSG mice are able to respond to an infection with <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic>, humanized and non-humanized NSG mice were infected subcutaneously via needle injection in the right hind foot pad and followed for signs of Lyme disease, which is characterized by an initial unilateral arthritis in the ankle tissue of the infected side followed by systemic pathogen spread through the blood resulting in inflammation of the contralateral joint. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref> both, non-humanized and humanized mice developed progressive inflammation starting in the infected (right foot) ankle joint followed by swelling of the contralateral non-infected (left foot) joint. If mice were humanized, however, joint inflammation of both paws was strongly delayed, suggesting that the human immune system participates in limiting pathogen burden. While one week after infection of humanized mice <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> was still largely confined to the infected joint (and in about half of the animals detectable in the blood), two weeks after infection bacterial spread to the blood, heart and ears became detectable. Around 5 weeks after infection, <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> was very prominent in skin (ears) and in the left foot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>), consistent with the initiation of inflammation in the contralateral joint (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Concomitant with the infection, humanized mice developed a human IgM response directed against a variety of <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> antigens including p39 and the outer surface protein C (OspC), which was comparable to the IgM response detectable in <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> infected patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Furthermore, human and mouse immune cell infiltrates, consisting of mouse neutrophils and human myeloid cells, B cells, and CD4+ and CD8+ T cells could be detected in the joints of infected mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">2</xref>). Compared to the blood, especially T cells and B cells showed an activated phenotype, identified by increased expression of CD69 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,C,H,I,K,L</xref>). In contrast, no major change in serum complement C3 levels was observed during the course of infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>). In summary, these results suggest that cells of the human innate and adaptive immune system respond to the infection with <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> and may help in limiting pathogen burden in humanized mice in vivo.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The human immune system controls <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> infection.</title><p>(<bold>A, B</bold>) Humanized and non-humanized mice were infected with <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> and followed for signs of joint inflammation and pathogen spread.

In contrast to the rapid recovery of peripheral blood B cells, the reduction of serum IgM and impaired production of <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic>-specific antibodies was maintained over 4 weeks and only started to recover around 5 weeks post B cell depletion therapy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C,D</xref>).

To study this, we generated humanized mouse colonies homozygous either for the functional (FcγRIIb-232I) or the non-functional FcγRIIb allele (FcγRIIb-232T), by reconstituting NSG mice with human hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) from donors homozygous for the respective FcγRIIb alleles. Four months after HSC transplantation, both mouse colonies were infected with <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> and analyzed in parallel with respect to the pathogen-induced immune response and the development of joint inflammation. As demonstrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref>, humanized mice with the non-functional FcγRIIb allele showed a clearly detectable expansion of CD138+ plasma blasts in the blood, whereas plasma blasts did not increase in mice with the functional FcγRIIb allele. Moreover, plasma blast expansion in humanized mice with the non-functional FcγRIIb allele occurred in two separate waves peaking at 1 and 4 weeks after infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). In line with the increased level of plasma blasts in FcγRIIb-232T humanized mice, a stronger increase in serum IgM and <italic>B. burgdorferi-</italic>specific IgM responses was detectable in these animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C,D</xref>).

While results from inbred mouse model systems strongly suggest that mouse FcγRIIb is a critical regulator of humoral and innate immune responses, they have also emphasized that the mouse genetic background can modulate the observed phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bolland and Ravetch, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bolland et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Boross et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nimmerjahn and Ravetch, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Smith and Clatworthy, 2010</xref>). Moreover, differences in the level of FcγRIIb expression between mice and humans, with humans having a much lower level of expression especially on innate immune cells, argue for caution when transferring results from classical mouse models to the outbred human immune system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lux and Nimmerjahn, 2013</xref>). To account for these interspecies differences, we have developed a humanized mouse model system in which immunodeficient mice are reconstituted with a human immune system homozygous for the functional or non-functional FcγRIIb allele (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baerenwaldt et al., 2011</xref>). In the present study, we used this humanized mouse model system to address how FcγRIIb modulates humoral immune responses during an episode of a bacterial infection. We used a model of <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> infection, as the spread of the pathogen and the pathogen induced pathology in immunodeficient mouse strains mimics many features of the human disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Steere and Glickstein, 2004</xref>). Consistent with previous studies using <italic>Borrelia hermsii</italic>, we demonstrate that NSG mice develop an inflammation of the infected joint, followed by systemic pathogen spread and a delayed arthritis of distant joints during later stages of infection with <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barthold et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Vuyyuru et al., 2011</xref>). Humanized NSG mice showed a delayed joint inflammation suggesting that the human immune system in humanized mice participates in controlling the infection and concomitant immune pathology. Indeed, human B cells, T cells and myeloid cells infiltrated the infected joints and showed a highly activated phenotype, similar to observations in human patients with Lyme arthritis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gross et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yssel et al., 1991</xref>). As removal of B cells but not CD4+T cells impaired pathogen control, the human T helper cell independent humoral immune response was dominantly involved in limiting <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> pathology, in line with previous results in inbred mouse strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barthold et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barthold et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">LaRocca and Benach, 2008</xref>). Altogether this supports the notion that the humanized mouse model of <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> infection recapitulates important aspects of the human infection, allowing to investigate how the human inhibitory FcγRIIb controls the humoral immune response during infection in vivo. By comparing the immune response in humanized mice with functional (FcγRIIb-232I) and non-functional (FcγRIIb-232T) FcγRIIb alleles side by side, our results suggest that human FcγRIIb indeed is a critical regulator of the magnitude and quality of the human immune response in humanized mice. Thus, in the presence of the non-functional FcγRIIb-232T allele, a lower pathogen burden in the directly infected joint and in the skin, heart and distal joint was observed. Most strikingly, humanized mice with the non-functional FcγRIIb allele demonstrated a stronger and biphasic expansion of plasma blasts in the blood and correlated with a higher level <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> specific antibodies in the serum. The increased level of plasma blasts in FcγRIIb-232T humanized mice may be explained via two possible mechanisms. Firstly, a broader panel of naïve B cells may become activated and develop into plasma blasts in the absence of FcγRIIb function, as has been observed in FcγRIIb-deficient mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nakamura et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Takai et al., 1996</xref>). This may also explain the simultaneous priming of autoreactive B cell responses, again in line with data from FcγRIIb-deficient mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bolland and Ravetch, 2000</xref>). Interestingly, the increased appearance of autoantibodies in FcγRIIb-232T humanized mice coincided with the second wave of plasma blasts, whereas increased levels of pathogen-specific immune responses were detectable much earlier. These results may indicate that either the continued presence of the pathogen increases the likelihood to develop secondary autoreactive immune responses if FcγRIIb function is missing; or, that the induction of autoantibody responses is developing in parallel but at a reduced strength. It is important to note that in this scenario lack of FcγRIIb function on human DCs present in humanized mice may also contribute to the induction of autoreactive immune responses, by lowering the threshold for DC activation and (auto)antigen presentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Desai et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dhodapkar et al., 2005</xref>). Furthermore, FcγRIIb on DCs was shown to participate in presenting intact antigen to B cells, which may be another pathway along which DCs contribute to the induction of humoral immune responses in humanized mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bergtold et al., 2005</xref>). This will need to be investigated in more detail in future studies. Secondly, FcγRIIb cross-linking on plasma cells residing in the bone marrow was shown to trigger plasma cell apoptosis, allowing newly formed plasma cells to access survival niches in the bone marrow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Xiang et al., 2007</xref>). Thus, in the absence of FcγRIIb function more plasma blasts/cells may accumulate in the periphery due to a reduced level of plasma cell apoptosis in the bone marrow.</p><p>Overall, our results are consistent with reports demonstrating that in humans the non-functional FcγRIIb allele is enriched in regions with malaria and protects from certain cerebral forms of the disease, while simultaneously increasing the risk to develop autoimmune diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Clatworthy et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Waisberg et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Willcocks et al., 2010</xref>). Indeed, especially the GPI-specific immune response showed a clear correlation with the induction of <italic>B. burgdorferi-</italic>specific antibodies, while the DNA-specific autoantibody responses mostly correlated in mice with a very high antibody response. As GPI-specific immune responses have been demonstrated to be causative for inflammatory arthritis in mouse models and have been detected at least in subsets of human arthritis patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Korganow et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Monach et al., 2004</xref>), our findings may provide evidence for a direct link between the initial <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> infection and the development of autoimmune arthritis occuring several years after the initial infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arvikar et al., 2017</xref>). While our results show that humanized mice reconstituted with hematopoietic stem cells from donors homozygous for select FcγRIIb alleles may be a valuable pre-clinical model system to study the impact of FcγRIIb function on human disease, some caveats of this model system need to be considered. First of all, apart from the difference in FcγRIIb function, the genetic background of the individual HSC donors is different. Thus, it cannot be excluded that other genes impacting pathogen recognition, humoral tolerance or immune cell activation may contribute to the observed phenotypes. This, however, will be similar in a human patient population and could only be circumvented if transgenic mice selectively expressing the human FcγRIIb alleles on a mouse FcγRIIb knockout background would be used. A second major difference to a human patient population is that the human immune system in humanized mice has been developing only for three months. Thus, not all immune cell subsets have reached their steady-state abundance, which is mirrored by the fact that B cells and IgM antibody responses dominate the immune response during this early developmental stage. Especially the low level of IgG antibody responses may result in a more moderate disease pathology as only IgG antibodies are efficiently able to recruit FcγR-dependent effector pathways. Furthermore, humanized mice are kept under well-controlled conditions avoiding infections, which human patients will have encountered during their lifetime and which may alter consecutive immune responses. Despite all these points to be considered, the fact that the humoral immune response observed in humanized mice closely resembles at least in part the antibody response in humans, underscores the value of this pre-clinical model system.</p><p>In summary, our study revealed that the human inhibitory FcγRIIb is critical to limit self-reactive immune responses during the early phase of an infection with <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic>. Considering that a link between a primary infection with <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> and the development of arthritis later in life has been suggested it will be of great interest to study if humans with this non-functional FcγRIIb allele are more prone to develop arthritis, while they are more resistant to infection at the same time. As the presence of this polymorphism in the Caucasian population is rare, the challenge will be to obtain enough samples from <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> infected patients homozygous for the non-functional FcγRIIb allele. We are currently increasing the number of new and longitudinal serum samples in our patient cohort to address if humans with the non-functional FcγRIIb232T allele are more prone to develop autoreactive antibody responses during the primary infection with <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> and Lyme arthritis later in life.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials

In fact, the previous and also the newly added experiments show that the bacterial load but not the spreading is reduced. We have now included new data quantifying <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> infection of heart and ears between 24 and 35 days after infection, demonstrating a clear trend towards a lowered bacterial burden, but not a change in organ tropism or spread. We have now edited the text accordingly. As our animal permit does not allow us to perform further experiments with B cell depleting antibodies we would hope that the new data and adjusted text is now sufficient for the reviewer. A new animal license would take at least a year for approval under normal circumstances and under the current Corona pandemic even longer.</p></body></sub-article></article>
