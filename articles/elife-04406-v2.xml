However, the pathways underlying ILC development remain unclear. Here we show that the transcription factor NFIL3 directs the development of a committed bone marrow precursor that differentiates into all known ILC lineages. NFIL3 was required in the common lymphoid progenitor (CLP), and was essential for the differentiation of αLP, a bone marrow cell population that gives rise to all known ILC lineages. Clonal differentiation studies revealed that CXCR6<sup>+</sup> cells within the αLP population differentiate into all ILC lineages but not T- and B-cells. We further show that NFIL3 governs ILC development by directly regulating expression of the transcription factor TOX. These findings establish that NFIL3 directs the differentiation of a committed ILC precursor that gives rise to all ILC lineages and provide insight into the defining role of NFIL3 in ILC development.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.04406.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04406.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04406.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The mucus-covered tissues that line the nose, mouth, and the digestive tract play an important role in protecting the body from infection. These mucosal tissues are the first line of defense against any pathogens we inhale or ingest, and help to keep communities of helpful bacteria—such as those that aid digestion—in place so that they can perform their beneficial functions without causing disease.</p><p>A special group of immune cells called innate lymphoid cells helps to prevent infection in the mucosal tissues and to repair damage to these tissues. There are several different types of innate lymphoid cells, with each type performing a different function. All innate lymphoid cells originate from precursor cells in the bone marrow. Some of these precursor cells had been identified previously, but were able to develop into only some of the different innate lymphoid cell types. Scientists suspected that a precursor cell existed that could develop into all types of innate lymphoid cell, but the identity of this cell had remained elusive.</p><p>Yu, Wang et al. now identify a precursor cell in the bone marrow that can produce all of the currently known different types of innate lymphoid cells. A protein called NFIL3 coaxes stem cells in the bone marrow into becoming these precursor cells, which only develop into innate lymphoid cells, and not into other immune cell types such as B cells and T cells.</p><p>Yu, Wang et al. find that NFIL3 causes some of these previously identified precursor cells to become dedicated producers of innate lymphoid cells by regulating another protein called TOX. Furthermore, gene therapy using NFIL3- or TOX-encoding DNA can help to restore normal numbers of innate lymphoid cells in mice whose bone marrow progenitor cells lack the NFIL3 gene.</p><p>These new details about how bone marrow stem cells develop into innate lymphoid cells may help scientists looking for new ways to treat infections or diseases that hamper the innate immune system.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.04406.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04406.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>innate lymphoid cells</kwd><kwd>bone marrow progenitor</kwd><kwd>innate immunity</kwd><kwd>stem cell</kwd><kwd>intestinal immunity</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DK070855</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hooper</surname><given-names>Lora V</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000861</institution-id><institution>Burroughs Wellcome Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>New Investigators in the Pathogenesis of Infectious Diseases Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hooper</surname><given-names>Lora V</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hooper</surname><given-names>Lora V</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The transcription factor NFIL3 is essential for the development of a committed bone marrow precursor that gives rise to all known innate lymphoid cell lineages in mice.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) are a recently identified family of lymphocytes that perform a variety of immune functions at barrier surfaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Spits and Cupedo, 2012</xref>). Although ILCs share a common developmental origin with B- and T-cells, they lack antigen-specific receptors. Instead, they exert their immune functions through cytokine secretion in a manner similar to T helper cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Spits et al., 2013</xref>). Despite their important contributions to immunity, the pathways that regulate ILC development remain poorly understood.</p><p>There are three known ILC groups. ILC1, which include conventional NK (cNK) cells, require the transcription factors T-BET and/or EOMES, produce interferon-γ (IFNγ) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kiessling et al., 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gordon et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fuchs et al., 2013</xref>), and promote immunity to intracellular pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Yokoyama et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Klose et al., 2014</xref>). ILC2 require the transcription factor GATA-3, produce IL-5/13 and amphiregulin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Moro et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Neill et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Monticelli et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hoyler et al., 2012</xref>), and promote tissue repair and anti-helminth immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Monticelli et al., 2012</xref>). ILC3, which include lymphoid tissue inducer (LTi) cells, depend on the transcription factor RORγt and secrete IL-17/22 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Eberl and Littman, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Satoh-Takayama et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Luci et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Takatori et al., 2009</xref>). ILC3 are especially important for the defense of barrier surfaces as they promote anatomical containment of commensal bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sonnenberg et al., 2012</xref>), regulate CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell responses to commensal bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hepworth et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Qiu et al., 2013</xref>), and stimulate epithelial cells to produce antibacterial proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sanos et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>All ILC differentiate from the common lymphoid progenitor (CLP), which resides in the bone marrow and also gives rise to B- and T-lymphocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Possot et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hoyler et al., 2012</xref>). Committed ILC progenitors that are positioned developmentally downstream of the CLP have been identified, and give rise to various ILC subsets. For example, an <italic>Id2</italic> (<underline>i</underline>nhibitor of <underline>D</underline>NA binding 2)-expressing progenitor, known as the common ‘helper-like’ innate lymphoid progenitor (CHILP), gives rise to ‘helper-like’ ILC lineages including ILC2, ILC3 and a subgroup of ILC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Klose et al., 2014</xref>). PLZF-positive progenitors, termed ILCP, differentiate into non-NK ILC1, ILC2, and ILC3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Constantinides et al., 2014</xref>). However, these progenitors do not differentiate into cNK cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Constantinides et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Klose et al., 2014</xref>), suggesting that a precursor that gives rise to all ILC subtypes remains to be identified.</p><p>NFIL3 (also known as E4BP4) is a basic leucine zipper transcription factor that controls a number of different immune processes, including cytokine expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kashiwada et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kobayashi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Motomura et al., 2011</xref>), IgE class switching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kashiwada et al., 2010</xref>), and T<sub>H</sub>17 cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yu et al., 2013</xref>). It was identified several years ago as an essential transcription factor in the differentiation of cNK cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gascoyne et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kamizono et al., 2009</xref>). More recently, NFIL3 has been shown also to be required for the development of non-NK ILC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Klose et al., 2014</xref>), ILC2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Geiger et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Seillet et al., 2014a</xref>), ILC3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Geiger et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Klose et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kobayashi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Seillet et al., 2014a</xref>), and LTi cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Geiger et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Seillet et al., 2014a</xref>). Thus, NFIL3 is essential for the development of all ILC lineages.</p><p>Here we show that NFIL3 is required for the development of a common ILC progenitor from the CLP. The progenitor population is marked by CXCR6, and resides in the α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>7</sub><sup>+</sup> αLP bone marrow population, which can give rise to all ILC lineages. Clonal differentiation assays show that the CXCR6<sup>+</sup> precursors are committed ILC progenitors that differentiate into all ILC lineages but not B- or T-cells. Finally, we show that NFIL3 directs progenitor differentiation by directly regulating the expression of TOX, a known driver of ILC differentiation. These findings provide new insight into the defining role of NFIL3 in the differentiation of innate lymphoid cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>Nfil3<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice are deficient in bone marrow ILC progenitors downstream of the CLP</title><p>NFIL3 has recently been shown to be essential for the development of all ILC lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Geiger et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Seillet et al., 2014a</xref>).

Thus, <italic>Nfil3</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice have reduced numbers of precursors that give rise to cNK cells, non-NK ILC1, ILC2 and ILC3.

Similarly, ILC2Ps are lineage-specified progenitors of ILC2s with no appreciable potential to differentiate into cNK cells or ILC3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hoyler et al., 2012</xref>). The broad ILC deficiency (including cNK cells) and impaired ILC precursor development in <italic>Nfil3</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice thus suggested that the NFIL3 might be required for the generation of a common ILC progenitor that lies developmentally upstream of the previously identified ILC precursors.

This idea is supported by expression profiles of key transcription factors known to be involved in ILC development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Similar to CLP and CHILP, αLPs do not express transcription factors that specify ILC lineages, such as RORγt, GATA3, T-BET and EOMES, suggesting an undifferentiated phenotype. However, in contrast to CHILPs, which uniformly express high levels of ID2, only a small fraction of αLPs are ID2<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). The majority of αLPs express ID2 at levels that are markedly lower than those in CHILPs. Because ID2 is virtually undetectable in CLPs, this suggests that αLPs may represent a transitional stage between CLP and CHILP. This is further supported by the fact that αLPs do not express PLZF while a major fraction of CHILPs express PLZF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Klose et al., 2014</xref>), which defines another group of ILC precursors (ILCP) that lack cNK cell differentiation potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Constantinides et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>To determine whether αLP can also give rise to ILC2, we co-cultured purified αLP with bone marrow stromal OP9 cells (OP9-GFP) or OP9 cells expressing the Notch ligand Delta-like 1 (OP9-DL1), which support ILC differentiation in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Holmes and Zúñiga-Pflücker, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Possot et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hoyler et al., 2012</xref>).

As an alternative, we found that NFIL3 regulates <italic>Tox</italic> expression in EL4 cells, a mouse lymphoma cell line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Knockdown of NFIL3 in EL4 cells with two independent shRNA constructs led to dose-dependent down-regulation of <italic>Tox</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Conversely, overexpression of NFIL3 in EL4 cells increased <italic>Tox</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>), indicating that <italic>Tox</italic> expression is sensitive to NFIL3 levels in EL4 cells in a manner similar to CLPs. A chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay with an NFIL3-specific antibody (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yu et al., 2013</xref>) demonstrated that NFIL3 directly bound to the <italic>Tox</italic> promoter (nt −2105 to −1867) and that overexpression of NFIL3 enhanced this binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Finally, NFIL3 activated <italic>Tox</italic> promoter activity as assessed by a luciferase reporter assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>)<italic>.</italic> Thus, NFIL3 activates <italic>Tox</italic> expression by directly binding to its promoter. EL4 cells are derived from T lymphocytes, a CLP-derived lineage, and thus we cannot exclude the possibility that the regulatory relationship between <italic>Nfil3</italic> and <italic>Tox</italic> differs between T lymphocytes and CLPs. Nevertheless, our studies on CLPs and EL4 cells both support the idea that NFIL3 is an activator of <italic>Tox</italic> expression.</p><p>Because <italic>Tox</italic> is known to be essential for cNK and ILC3 development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aliahmad et al., 2010</xref>), we postulated that lowered <italic>Tox</italic> expression leads to the broad ILC deficiency in <italic>Nfil3</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice and that restoring <italic>Tox</italic> expression would rescue ILC development. To test this idea, we cloned <italic>Tox</italic> coding sequences into a bicistronic vector (MSCV-IRES-hCD2), which allowed expression of the native form of TOX and also marked cells with the cell surface marker hCD2. We then delivered the TOX-encoding plasmid or the empty vector into purified <italic>Nfil3</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> LSK cells (CD45.2<sup>+</sup>) by retroviral transduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zheng et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Spencer et al., 2014</xref>), followed by transfer of these cells into lethally irradiated wild-type mice (CD45.1<sup>+</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). Compared to the empty vector control, transduction of the TOX-encoding plasmid led to increased numbers of cNK cells in spleen, non-NK ILC1 cells in liver, and ILC2 and ILC3 in the small intestines of recipient mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). We observed that rescue of ILC development from <italic>Nfil3</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> LSK cells by <italic>Tox</italic> was largely comparable to rescue by <italic>Nfil3</italic> in the same setting, supporting the idea that <italic>Tox</italic> acts downstream of <italic>Nfil3</italic> in ILC development. Though ILC2 cells developing from <italic>Tox</italic>-rescued LSK cells were generally fewer than those from <italic>Nfil3</italic>-rescued LSK cells, the difference between the two groups was not statistically significant. Thus, ILC development is rescued by restoring <italic>Tox</italic> expression in <italic>Nfil3</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> progenitors, indicating that NFIL3 drives ILC development in part by regulating <italic>Tox</italic> expression.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>NFIL3-dependent ILC development is essential for host defense against Citrobacter rodentium infection</title><p>IL-22 is produced both by ILC3 and T<sub>H</sub>17 cells and is essential for protection against <italic>Citrobacter rodentium</italic> infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Satoh-Takayama et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zheng et al., 2008</xref>). <italic>Nfil3</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice show elevated susceptibility to intestinal pathogens such as <italic>Citrobacter rodentium</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Geiger et al., 2014</xref>).

ILCs arise in the bone marrow from the CLP, and thus share a common developmental origin with T- and B-cells. The pathways that govern ILC differentiation downstream of the CLP have recently begun to be unraveled. Here we present new insight into the fundamental role of the basic leucine zipper transcription factor NFIL3 in ILC development. We show that NFIL3 directs the development of bone marrow precursors, derived from the CLP, which give rise to all known ILC lineages including cNK cells. Additionally, we show that NFIL3 regulates the expression of the transcription factor TOX, and provide evidence that a NFIL3-TOX transcription factor cascade is central to the development of all ILC lineages.</p><p>Several transcription factors are known to play essential roles in ILC development. For example, all ILC subsets express Id2, an antagonist of E proteins that control B- and T- cell commitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kee, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hoyler et al., 2012</xref>). Deletion of <italic>Id2</italic> in mice abrogates the development of multiple ILC lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Yokota et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hoyler et al., 2012</xref>), although NK developmental defects arise only during NK maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Boos et al., 2007</xref>). The HMG factor TOX is required for the development of cNK cells and ILC3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aliahmad et al., 2010</xref>), and the transcription factor PLZF is required for the differentiation of non-NK cell ILC subsets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Constantinides et al., 2014</xref>). Most recently, the basic leucine zipper transcription factor NFIL3 was found to be essential for the development of all known ILC lineages, including cNK cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Geiger et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Seillet et al., 2014a</xref>).</p><p>Lineage tracing studies with <italic>Id2</italic> and <italic>Zbtb16</italic> (encoding PLZF) reporter mice have identified two distinct progenitor populations that develop into multiple ILC lineages but not cNK cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hoyler et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Constantinides et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Klose et al., 2014</xref>). The PLZF-dependent ILCP differentiates into non-NK ILC1, ILC2, and ILC3, but not cNK cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Constantinides et al., 2014</xref>). Similarly, the common ‘helper-like’ innate lymphoid progenitor (CHILP) can differentiate into non-NK ILC1, ILC2 and NK1.1<sup>+</sup> NKp46<sup>+</sup> ILC3 but not cNK cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Klose et al., 2014</xref>). This suggests that the ILCP and the CHILP may lie downstream of a common ILC progenitor that gives rise to all ILC lineages including cNK cells.</p><p>We have provided evidence that NFIL3 is required for the differentiation of a multipotent ILC precursor population, the αLP, from the CLP. αLP gave rise to all ILC lineages including cNK cells. Although αLP lack B cell differentiation potential, they retain some residual T cell differentiation potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Possot et al., 2011</xref>). However, the CXCR6<sup>+</sup> αLP subpopulation, which accounted for ∼4% of αLP cells in adult bone marrow, differentiated into all ILC lineages including cNK cells, but not B- or T-cells. This suggests that CXCR6<sup>+</sup> αLP represent committed ILC precursors that give rise to all ILC lineages including cNK cells. Thus, these cells are likely to lie developmentally upstream of the described ILCP and CHILP populations.</p><p>Our findings suggest that NFIL3 activation of TOX expression is a key mechanism by which NFIL3 directs ILC development. NFIL3 is required for <italic>Tox</italic> expression in the CLP, and directs <italic>Tox</italic> expression through direct binding to the <italic>Tox</italic> promoter. Since TOX has been shown to direct the development of multiple ILC lineages, including cNK cells and ILC3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aliahmad et al., 2010</xref>), this suggests that activation of TOX expression is a key mechanism by which NFIL3 influences ILC development. This idea is supported by our finding that forced <italic>Tox</italic> expression in <italic>Nfil3</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> bone marrow progenitors rescues the ILC developmental defect and restores differentiation of cNK, non-NK ILC1, ILC2, and ILC3. Together, these data support the idea that a NFIL3-TOX transcription factor cascade plays a fundamental role in the development of all ILC lineages. Recent studies have shown that forced expression of <italic>Eomes</italic> can rescue cNK cell development from <italic>Nfil3</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> hematopoietic progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Male et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Seillet et al., 2014b</xref>). However, because <italic>Eomes</italic> is not expressed in CLPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>) and <italic>Eomes</italic> deficiency only impacts cNK cells but no other ILCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Klose et al., 2014</xref>), <italic>Eomes</italic> is unlikely to mediate the NFIL3-dependent development of non-NK ILCs, and may lie developmentally downstream of NFIL3-TOX during NK cell development.</p><p>Although NFIL3 is required for the development of the major ILC types and their precursors, some ILC subtypes appear to be NFIL3-independent. For example, certain NK cells, including salivary gland NK cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cortez et al., 2014</xref>) and tissue-resident NK cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sojka et al., 2014</xref>), are not impacted by <italic>Nfil3</italic> deficiency, in contrast to conventional NK cells. Extramedullary development of thymic NK cells is also independent of NFIL3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Crotta et al., 2014</xref>). In addition, during mouse cytomegalovirus infection, NK cells in <italic>Nfil3</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice expand to numbers similar to those in wild-type mice through an IL-15-dependent mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Firth et al., 2013</xref>). This suggests that the requirement for NFIL3 can be overridden by cytokine signaling during infection. Finally, despite the strict requirement for NFIL3 in bone marrow ILC precursor development (αLP and CHILP), <italic>Nfil3</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice appear to have normal lymph nodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Spits and Di Santo, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Seillet et al., 2014b</xref>) and only moderately impaired Peyer's patch development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Geiger et al., 2014</xref>). One possibility is that fetal LTi cell function may be preserved in the absence of <italic>Nfil3</italic>, which could account for the presence of lymph nodes in <italic>Nfil3</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice.</p><p><italic>Nfil3</italic> is regulated by the circadian clock and thus its expression varies diurnally in multiple tissues and cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5a">Duez et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yu et al., 2013</xref>). We previously showed that <italic>Nfil3</italic> expression varies diurnally in T cells and that NFIL3 synchronizes T<sub>H</sub>17 lineage specification to the day-night light cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yu et al., 2013</xref>). Synchronization is essential for T<sub>H</sub>17 cell homeostasis, as circadian disruption by chronic light cycle perturbation elevates intestinal T<sub>H</sub>17 cell frequencies and increases susceptibility to intestinal inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yu et al., 2013</xref>). The finding that NFIL3 is required for the development of committed ILC precursors suggests that precursor differentiation may also be synchronized with diurnal light cycles through a similar mechanism. Future studies will examine whether <italic>Nfil3</italic> expression is diurnally regulated in the CLP, whether precursor generation is synchronized to circadian light cycles in an NFIL3-dependent manner, and whether disruption of circadian light cycles leads to dysregulated ILC development.</p><p>Altogether, our findings provide new insight into the defining role of NFIL3 in ILC development. Identification of a committed pan-ILC precursor should allow further insight into the developmental pathways that drive ILC cell fate decisions. Because of the general importance of ILCs in immune defense, NFIL3-dependent pathways may provide new targets for treatment of inflammatory and infectious diseases.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice</title><p><italic>Nfil3</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice were obtained from Dr. Paul B.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Tadatsugu Taniguchi (Senior editor), a Reviewing editor, and 3 reviewers.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The manuscript presents a substantial body of data supporting the idea that the transcription factor NFIL3 is crucial for the entire innate lymphoid cell (ILC) lineage commitment by showing, inter alia, that NFIL3 deficiency results in a strong reduction of the 'alpha-LP' lymphoid progenitor (aLP) cells that contain precursors for cNK and ILC3 cells, as well as a loss of the putative downstream common 'helper-like' innate progenitor (CHILP) cells. Further, the manuscript significantly extends earlier observations by showing that the ILC progenitor potential in aLP compartment is likely to be contained in the previously identified CXCR6-expressing sub-population. Finally, using a transcriptome survey, the manuscript generates the hypothesis that Tox is a downstream target of Nfil3 relevant for ILC development, and tests it with Tox-specific siRNA and overexpression approaches to correlate Nfil3 expression with Tox, to show that TOX is a downstream target of NFIL3, and to demonstrate that it can rescue ILC development of NFIL3-/- precursors.</p><p>While other groups have recently published similar findings, this manuscript makes important extensions in the cellular-molecular understanding of ILC development. The data are of high quality and rapid publication is warranted. However, some issues of concern as detailed below should be resolved prior to publication.</p><p>1) Since Nfil3-deficient mice appear to have lymph nodes (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Spits and Di Santo, 2011</xref>) and Peyer's patches albeit fewer and smaller (present manuscript), it is arguable that LTi cell function is largely preserved during the fetal period in them. Also, NKp46- ILC3 are only mildly reduced in Nfil3-deficient mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). On the other hand, the authors show convincing data for the deficiency of the CHILP compartment, shown to be a common progenitor for helper-like ILCs including LTi cells, in the absence of Nfil3. Is it possible, for example, that Nfil3 is required for the maintenance of ILC progenitors in adult mice but not as strictly required for ILC fate decisions in the fetus? There is also literature suggesting Nfil3-indepedent generation of some ILC subsets; salivary gland NK cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cortez et al., 2014</xref>), cNK cells after MCMV infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Firth et al., 2013</xref>), as also the mild reduction in NKP cells in Nfil3-deficient mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Male et al., 2014</xref>). The discussion would benefit from acknowledgment and attempted resolution of these issues.</p><p>2) A fair proportion of the molecular connections between Nfil3 and Tox have been derived from studies with the EL4 lymphoma cell line. While it is appreciated that performing many of these analyses in CLP cells is not feasible, the manuscript needs to acknowledge that EL4 cells are relatively unrelated to any of the cell types being considered and therefore there may be caveats for the interpretations based on data from them.</p><p>3) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, it is unclear how the authors excluded contamination of the aLP by CHILP, which might skew the obtained results.</p><p>4) The authors refer to literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Male et al., 2014</xref>) for the impact of NFIL3 on NKP cells, but that study found only a small reduction of NKP cells in Nfil3-deficient mice. It would therefore be helpful if the authors could present data for NKP cells in Nfil3-deficient mice in their hands.</p><p>5) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> shows that Nfil3 deficiency results in a 90% reduction in total aLP cells. Nonetheless, T and B cell development is not affected. It would be very useful to show if the CXCR6+ aLP subset specifically and substantially depleted in Nfil3-deficient mice, or if depletion occurs in the CXCR6- aLP cells as well.</p><p>6) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>, the ILC profile from the Nfil3-deficient CD45.2+ hCD2- donor cells (without TOX overexpression) would be an important and interesting control.</p><p>7) Since the authors later show that only the CXCR6+ subset of aLP have the potential to give rise to all ILC lineages, it would be helpful if they could show the ILC transcription factor profile of these cells. Do they express any Id2? Do they express RORgt, since <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Possot et al. (2011)</xref> showed that 40% of the CXCR6+ aLP in fetal liver were RORgt+?</p><p>8) The developmental rescue of NFIL3-/- precursors by TOX is of interest, but its quantitative significance would be best interpreted in comparison with the efficiency of rescue of these Nfil3-/- precursors with Nfil3 itself.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04406.017</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) Since Nfil3-deficient mice appear to have lymph nodes (e.g.,</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47"><italic>Spits and Di Santo, 2011</italic></xref><italic>) and Peyer's patches albeit fewer and smaller (present manuscript), it is arguable that LTi cell function is largely preserved during the fetal period in them.

However, because CHILP do not give rise to cNK cells (Klose et al., <italic>Cell</italic> vol. 157, p. 340 [2014]), our data identify a distinct CXCR6<sup>+</sup> αLP committed precursor that gives rise to all four ILC lineages including cNK cells (revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). This precursor must therefore lie developmentally upstream of the CHILP. Additionally, in support of our <italic>in vitro</italic> findings, we now include data (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>) showing that the CXCR6<sup>+</sup> αLP cells also give rise to all four ILC lineages (including cNK cells) <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p><italic>4) The authors refer to literature (</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24"><italic>Male et al., 2014</italic></xref><italic>) for the impact of NFIL3 on NKP cells, but that study found only a small reduction of NKP cells in Nfil3-deficient mice. It would therefore be helpful if the authors could present data for NKP cells in Nfil3-deficient mice in their hands</italic>.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Male et al. (2014)</xref> actually shows a marked decline in NKP frequencies and absolute numbers in <italic>Nfil3</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> mice. We note that the data are shown in log scale, compressing the visual differences. The percentages of both preNKP and rNKP cells among Lin- bone marrow cells declines by ∼8-10-fold in <italic>Nfil3</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> mice. Likewise, there is an approximately 10-fold decline in the absolute numbers of both preNKP and rNKP cells in <italic>Nfil3</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> mice. Therefore, the Male et al. paper strongly supports the idea that NFIL3 is essential for the differentiation of NKP cells.</p><p><italic>5)</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2A</italic></xref> <italic>shows that Nfil3 deficiency results in a 90% reduction in total aLP cells. Nonetheless, T and B cell development is not affected. It would be very useful to show if the CXCR6+ aLP subset specifically and substantially depleted in Nfil3-deficient mice, or if depletion occurs in the CXCR6- aLP cells as well</italic>.</p><p>We have now included an analysis of CXCR6<sup>+</sup> αLP cells in wild-type and <italic>Nfil3</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> mice. The percentages of CXCR6<sup>+</sup> cells among αLP are comparable between wild-type and <italic>Nfil3</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4-figure supplement 1</xref>). As a result, the number of CXCR6<sup>+</sup> αLP cells is markedly diminished in <italic>Nfil3</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) in parallel with the decrease in total αLP cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). These data support the idea that CXCR6<sup>+</sup>αLPs require NFIL3 for their development.</p><p>Since αLP cells do not give rise to B cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), it is not surprising that B cell development is not impaired in Nfil3-/- mice despite the marked αLP deficiency. Though αLP cells retain some T cell differentiation potential (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), it is not clear to what extent αLP-derived T cells contribute to the total T cell pool in mice. There is evidence that LSK cells, which are present in normal numbers in Nfil3-/- mice, can enter the circulation and seed the thymus to initiate T cell development (Reviewed in Bhandoola and Sambandam, From stem cell to T cell: one route or many? Nat Rev Immunol. vol.6(2), p. 117-26[2006].) Thus, the marked αLP deficiency in <italic>Nfil3</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> mice is consistent with the relatively normal T cell numbers in these mice.</p><p><italic>6) In</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"><italic>Figure 5F</italic></xref><italic>, the ILC profile from the Nfil3-deficient CD45.2+ hCD2- donor cells (without TOX overexpression) would be an important and interesting control</italic>.</p><p>The TOX encoding plasmid was delivered into LSK cells by retroviral transduction/infection. It is well-documented that retroviral infection of bone marrow progenitors can by itself impact their ability to differentiate (reviewed in Banerjee et al., Hematopoietic stem cells and retroviral infection. <italic>Retrovirology</italic> vol. 7, p. 8-17 [2010]). Therefore, comparison of hCD2<sup>+</sup> and hCD2<sup>-</sup> donor cells will not provide interpretable information about the impact of TOX expression on the differentiation potential of the cells. For this reason, we have restricted our analysis to a comparison between <italic>Tox</italic>-expressing hCD2<sup>+</sup> donor cells and vector-only hCD2<sup>+</sup> donor cells.</p><p><italic>7) Since the authors later show that only the CXCR6+ subset of aLP have the potential to give rise to all ILC lineages, it would be helpful if they could show the ILC transcription factor profile of these cells. Do they express any Id2? Do they express RORgt, since</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31"><italic>Possot et al. (2011)</italic></xref> <italic>showed that 40% of the CXCR6+ aLP in fetal liver were RORgt+?</italic></p><p>This is a great suggestion. However, the number of CXCR6<sup>+</sup> αLP cells in adult mouse bone marrow is exceptionally small, perhaps due to the fact that these cells represent a transitional stage between αLP and CXCR6<sup>+</sup> α4β7<sup>-</sup> cells that lie downstream of αLP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Possot et al., 2011</xref>). The small number of cells makes such an analysis exceptionally challenging. As shown in revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, we detect ∼5 CXCR6<sup>+</sup> αLP cells per 3.3 million Lineage-negative bone marrow cells. As there are, on average, approximately 12 million Lineage-negative bone marrow cells per femur/tibia, this equates to ∼40 CXCR6<sup>+</sup> αLP cells per femur/tibia. The rarity of these cells makes it extremely difficult to accurately assess transcription factor expression across the population in adult mouse bone marrow by flow cytometry. The analysis in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Possot et al. (2011)</xref> was performed on fetal liver CXCR6<sup>+</sup> αLP cells, which account for roughly 0.15% of Linage-negative fetal liver cells and are thus much more abundant than in adult bone marrow. Finally, Possot et al. used quantitative RT-PCR to show that <italic>Rorc</italic> (encoding RORγt) expression is undetectable in CXCR6<sup>+</sup> cells from adult bone marrow.</p><p><italic>8) The developmental rescue of NFIL3-/- precursors by TOX is of interest, but its quantitative significance would be best interpreted in comparison with the efficiency of rescue of these Nfil3-/- precursors with Nfil3 itself</italic>.</p><p>This is a great suggestion and we have now included data showing the efficiency of developmental rescue of <italic>Nfil3</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> precursors with NFIL3 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>. The results show that developmental rescue is comparable between TOX and NFIL3, with no statistically-significant differences between the two across the various ILC subsets. Although the average rescue efficiency for the ILC2 subset trended higher with NFIL3, the overall difference was not statistically significant.</p></body></sub-article></article>
