role in vascular barrier maintenance at baseline and after injury. We previously demonstrated that a sharp drop in Tie2 expression observed across various murine models of critical illnesses is associated with increased vascular permeability and mortality. Matrix metalloprotease (MMP)−14-mediated Tie2 ectodomain shedding has recently been recognized as a possible mechanism for Tie2 downregulation in sepsis. Here, we identified the exact MMP14-mediated Tie2 ectodomain cleavage sites and could show that pharmacological MMP14 blockade in experimental murine sepsis exerts barrier protective and anti-inflammatory effects predominantly through the attenuation of Tie2 cleavage to improve survival both in a pre-treatment and rescue approach. Overall, we show that protecting Tie2 shedding might offer a new therapeutic opportunity for the treatment of septic vascular leakage.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>permeability</kwd><kwd>vascular barrier function</kwd><kwd>Tie2</kwd><kwd>MMP14</kwd><kwd>endothelial cells</kwd><kwd>Sepsis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DA1209/4-3</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>David</surname><given-names>Sascha</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Matrix metalloprotease (MMP)-14 cleaves Tie2 at three distinct sites within the fibronectin type-III (FN3) domain and its pharmacological blockade inhibits Tie2 pathological shedding to exert barrier protective effects.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Sepsis is a life-threatening clinical syndrome characterized by an overwhelming host’s response to an infection leading to organ dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cao et al., 2019</xref>). Its incidence world-wide continues to evolve (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cao et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Suarez De La Rica et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fleischmann et al., 2016</xref>). Thus far, research on the pathogenesis of sepsis has primarily focused on inflammatory responses which have proven unsuccessful in the translational approach from bench to bedside (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fisher et al., 1996</xref>). The clinical picture of the syndrome however suggests that the host response in sepsis is characterized by a vascular phenotype with endothelial inflammation, disturbed interaction between the endothelium and the coagulatory system and widespread vascular leakage which directly contributes to morbidity and mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Leligdowicz et al., 2018</xref>). Hence, therapeutic strategies aiming to reduce vascular pathologies might be a treatable part of the injurious host response to ameliorate sepsis morbidity and mortality.</p><p>Tie2, a classical transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptor, plays a pivotal role in vascular barrier maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Parikh, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Jongman et al., 2019</xref>). Although attenuation of Tie2 receptor signaling upon infection has been observed for many years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Parikh, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Parikh, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ghosh et al., 2016</xref>), most of the research in the field has focused on manipulating its circulating ligands - the angiopoietins (Angpt) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">David et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Witzenbichler et al., 2005</xref>). Recent advances have shown that besides its activation, reduced Tie2 expression also directly contributes to pathological permeability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ghosh et al., 2016</xref>). In our previous study, Tie2 ectodomain shedding was identified as one of the possible mechanisms for Tie2 down-regulation upon various inflammatory stimuli. MMP14 was implicated as being the principal Tie2 sheddase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Thamm et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>We (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Thamm et al., 2018</xref>) and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Sung et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Findley et al., 2007</xref>) have shown that global blockade of MMP activity is sufficient to prevent Tie2 cleavage and thereby vascular leakage in vitro and to improve pulmonary vascular leakage and ultimately, survival in a rat sepsis model in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Steinberg et al., 2003</xref>). However, the deleterious side effects observed in cancer clinical trials raised severe concerns about its clinical applicability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Vanlaere and Libert, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Coussens et al., 2002</xref>). In contrast, the use of a selective inhibitor for MMP14 might not only help to reduce treatment-associated side effects but might also be an ideal tool to study the mechanistic link between MMP14 and Tie2 shedding in health and disease.</p><p>Here, we test the therapeutic potential of selectively inhibiting MMP14 using an affinity matured exosite inhibitor termed E2C6 with the primary aim of preventing endothelial Tie2 shedding in vitro in endothelial cells (ECs) and in vivo in murine sepsis and endotoxemia models. Furthermore, we seek to find the exact MMP14 mediated Tie2 cleavage site(s) to develop potential novel therapeutic strategies in the future. Our study may offer novel insights into the molecular regulation of Tie2 on endothelial barrier stabilization during sepsis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>MMP14-dependent Tie2 cleavage occurs at the fibronectin type III domain</title><p>First, to better characterize Tie2 ectodomain shedding, we set up to identify the exact site where Tie2 is proteolytically cleaved. We identified a 75–80 kDa Tie2 ectodomain fragment in the supernatant of HUVECs stimulated with TNF-α (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) similar to that described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Findley et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Reusch et al., 2001</xref>). Next, we incubated in a cell-free assay recombinant Tie2 protein with the catalytic domain of MMP14 (i.e. cMMP14) and found that cleavage occurs in a concentration-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Attempts to immunoprecipitate and isolate the Tie2 protein from these membranes, followed by mass spectrometry (MS) did not reveal any consistent results. We resorted to an in silico analysis to predict the catalytic sites of MMP14 on Tie2. Using the ‘cleavepredict’ software potential MMP14 cleavage sites of Tie2 could be identified, i.e. T<sup>633</sup>-L, N<sup>644</sup>-I, S<sup>648</sup>-N and D<sup>740</sup>-L. To validate this prediction, we designed two synthetic Tie2 polypeptides spanning the predicted catalytic sites for MMP14 (<sup>630</sup>T–<sup>652</sup>H and <sup>736</sup>Q–<sup>745</sup>K). We then analyzed the cleavage patterns after digestion with the recombinant catalytic domain of MMP14. MS analyses followed by MS/MS fragmentation of selected peptide precursors revealed that one of the polypeptides <sup>630</sup>T–<sup>652</sup>H was indeed cleaved at three particular sites I<sup>637</sup>, N<sup>644</sup> and S<sup>648</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). The second polypeptide remained uncleaved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). We further confirmed functional relevance of these newly identified Tie2 cleavage sites by site-directed mutagenesis analysis. Isoleucine<sup>637</sup>, asparagine<sup>644</sup> and serine<sup>648</sup> of Tie2 were mutated to valine, histidine and threonine, respectively. Mutation at I637V and S648T led to a 31% and 32% reduction of Tie2 fragment released into the conditioned media by cMMP14. Meanwhile, mutation at N644H and triple mutation of all three sites led to an 80% and 90% reduction of soluble Tie2 in conditioned media (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). These results revealed three cleavage sites of Tie2 by MMP14 all within the fibronectin type III domain. In summary, this demonstrates that Tie2 is cleaved by MMP14 possibly at three different sites and targeting these sites might represent a promising therapeutic intervention to treat vascular leakage in sepsis.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>MMP14 cleaves Tie2 at the Fibronectin type-III domain on the cell surface.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative Tie2 ectodomain (AB33) immunoblot of the total cell lysates and conditioned media from TNF-α (50 ng/ml) treated HUVECs.

An ELISA technique was used to detect the extracellular N-terminal epitope of Tie2 under baseline and stimulated conditions (i.e. sTie2). Under baseline conditions, E2C6 was able to reduce spontaneous Tie2 shedding by 60% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, bars 1 and 3). Moreover, we observed that pretreatment of HUVECs with 100 nM of E2C6 before TNF-α (50 ng/mL) stimulation led to a decrease in the detectable concentration of sTie2 fragments in cell culture supernatants compared to control-treated cells by 85% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, bars 2 and 4). Given that E2C6 inhibited Tie2 shedding, we went further to analyze cell lysates for (the remaining) total (t)Tie2 abundance via immunoblot. As expected, reduced sTie2 in the supernatant of the E2C6 group came along with an increased amount of tTie2 within the cell lysate compartment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B–C</xref>). Consistently, endotoxemic mice pretreated with E2C6 were protected from LPS-induced Tie2 cleavage shown by reduced sTie2 in the serum of LPS challenged mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). On the cellular/tissue level LPS-induced loss of tTie2 in the pulmonary vasculature (as a result of shedding) was protected by E2C6 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E–F</xref>). These data suggest that pharmacological inhibition of MMP14 is sufficient to prevent Tie2 proteolytic cleavage both in vitro and in vivo.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>MMP14 blockade inhibits Tie2 cleavage both in vitro in HUVECs and in vivo in murine experimental sepsis.</title><p>Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) pretreated with or without E2C6 (100 nM) for 1 hr were analyzed 24 hr after stimulation with 50 ng/mL TNF-α.

HUVECs that have been challenged with TNF-α showed a typical phenotype of severe gaps between adjacent cells caused by increased cytoskeletal forces via F-actin polymerization leading to disrupted cell-cell contacts. Again, E2C6 treatment was sufficient to prevent this formation of intercellular gaps compared to control-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–B</xref>). Functionally, E2C6 attenuated TNF-α induced increase in the macromolecular passage in an in vitro HRP permeability assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). This finding was confirmed using real-time electrical transendothelial resistance (TER) measurements with TNF-α, and E2C6 treated HUVECs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). In vivo permeability was analogously assessed both on the morphological and functional level. We found that E2C6 pretreatment attenuated LPS induced perivascular cuffing - a histological surrogate of lung edema (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E–F</xref>). A functional Evans Blue assay quantitatively supported this qualitative observation indicative of a reduced vascular leakage in endotoxemic mice that have been pretreated with E2C6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). These results indicate that MMP14 blockade attenuates Tie2 cleavage thus alleviating endothelial permeability.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>MMP14 blockade attenuates sepsis-induced hyperpermeability.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative images of fluorescence immunocytochemistry staining for VE-cadherin (green), F-actin (magenta) and the nuclei (cyan) on confluent HUVECs, pretreated with or without E2C6 (100 nM) for 1 hr, were analyzed 6 hr after stimulation with TNF-α. Arrows (white) indicate inter-endothelial gaps.

We found that the increase of both ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 mRNA could be ameliorated (but not prevented) if E2C6 treatment was applied to HUVECs upon TNF-α stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–C</xref>) or mice challenged with LPS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D–F</xref>). Of note, there was no effect on E-selectin expression in both settings. Physiologically, ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 are involved in the transmigration of neutrophils into the tissue by progressing the rolling process towards a firmer adhesion. Consistently, MMP14 blockade profoundly reduced pulmonary Gr-1 neutrophil infiltration in LPS-induced endotoxemia in mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G–H</xref>). From these results, we inferred that MMP14 blockade prevents Tie2 shedding, which in turn might protect the endothelium against systemic endothelial inflammation and pathological systemic neutrophil recruitment. Reduced tissue infiltration of inflammatory cells further suggests that MMP14 blockade might also exert an additional protective effect by dampening local cytokine release in all organs. To test this, we analyzed a panel of serum levels in endotoxemic mice treated with E2C6 or control Ab. Indeed, interferon (IFN) γ, interleukin (IL)−6, macrophage chemoattractant protein (MCP)−1, and TNF-α were significantly reduced in E2C6 treated group compared to the IgG treated control group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–D</xref>).

Most importantly, site-directed mutagenesis revealed that a single N644H mutation is sufficient to counteract most of the Tie2 cleavage paving the road towards novel, innovative treatment approaches. As a proof of principle, we used an affinity matured exosite antibody termed E2C6 against MMP14 and found that it is sufficient to completely block the injurious process of Tie2 ectodomain shedding. Functionally, E2C6 ameliorated endothelial vascular leakage and inflammation in vitro and in vivo and even improved hard outcome in murine experimental sepsis.</p><p>Our results further support the concept by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ghosh et al., 2016</xref> that intact Tie2 expression (asides from activation) is necessary for canonical downstream signaling and thereby for barrier defense. Further in this regard, a recent study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Braun et al., 2020</xref> reported that endothelial Tie2 activation limits diapedeses induced leakage. The cleavage of the Tie2 ectodomain prevents protective Angiopoietin-1-Tie2 ligation and the cleaved Tie2 receptor can even function as a ligand trap in the circulation further inhibiting protective Angpt-1 activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alawo et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>). Besides these effects on Tie2 activation by ligands, we found that the inhibition of shedding to protect Tie2 surface expression is sufficient to ameliorate sepsis-induced vascular barrier breakdown.</p><p>One can speculate that MMP14 inhibition with E2C6 will affect canonical Tie2 downstream signals other than permeability. And indeed, we have observed additional anti-inflammatory effects as shown by a decrease in endothelial adhesion molecule expression, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kim et al., 2001</xref>) neutrophil influx and local cytokine production. Asides from Tie2 signaling, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kaneko et al., 2016</xref> showed that MMP14 blockade can directly modulate macrophage cytokine production in vitro, as well as promote changes in macrophage polarization favoring an anti-inflammatory phenotype. It is also noteworthy that besides the global decrease in LPS-induced pro-inflammatory cytokines upon MMP14 blockade, a slight increase was observed in the anti-inflammatory IL-10 cytokine in our study. This observation underlines potential off-target anti-inflammatory properties possibly explained by phenomena such as macrophage polarization.</p><p>By preventing Tie2 cleavage together with anti-inflammatory properties, it was of no surprise that E2C6 treated mice subjected to CLP had a better survival both in the pretreatment and rescue scenario compared to the IgG control group. These findings underline that MMP14 blockade might be an interesting therapeutic target against a key component of the hosts’ response to infection.</p><p>Based on the newly identified Tie2 cleavage sites, a possible future approach for the treatment of capillary leakage in sepsis might be to develop an antibody or small molecule that specifically binds with high affinity to the Tie2 cleavage sites hence preventing MMP14 mediated cleavage.</p><p>Overall the current study has some limitations; first, our findings on the identified Tie2 cleavage sites and the site-directed mutation of these sites were based on in silico and in vitro studies alone, it might be necessary to validate our finding in vivo. Also, we did not show whether the effect of MMP14 blockade is systemic or organ-specific; however, given the broad expression of Tie2 in various endothelial cells and the presumably broad effect of MMP14 on Tie2 shedding, we would predict that MMP14 blockade has a systemic rather than organ-specific effect. This is supported by the observation that soluble Tie2 (sTie2) in the serum of endotoxemic mice compared to control mice is increased accompanied by a decrease in total Tie2 (tTie2) abundance in lung homogenates. We decided to focus on the lungs because of its hallmark clinical role in sepsis together with the known high abundance of endothelial cells per organ tissue. Furthermore, we did not show whether MMP14 blockade regulates other endothelial and non-endothelial proteins to exert its protective effect. Further experiments might be required to identify possible off-target regulations upon E2C6 treatment. Lastly, given that MMP14 does not work in isolation but rather in complex enzymatic cascades triggering the activation of other enzymes, there is also a risk for adverse events if used in human trials. However, considering the timing aspect for a sepsis therapeutic compared to an adjunctive in an oncology trial, this risk might be of minor relevance.</p><p>In conclusion, for the first time we demonstrated that Tie2 is indeed cleaved at three distinct sites within the extracellular fibronectin type III domain leading to 75–80 kDa soluble receptor fragments (sTie2). Moreover, this study is the first to suggest that pharmacological MMP14 inhibition in sepsis exerts barrier protective effects predominantly through the inhibition of the injurious Tie2 cleavage at these ectodomain sites.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or <break/>reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Tie2 (C-20) (Rabbit polycloned IgG)</td><td>Santa Cruz</td><td>Cat#: SC-324</td><td>WB: 1:1000</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>GAPDH <break/>(Rabbit polycloned IgG)</td><td>Santa Cruz</td><td>Cat#: SC-25778</td><td>WB: 1:1000</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>β-Tubulin <break/>(Rabbit polycloned IgG)</td><td>Santa Cruz</td><td>Cat#: SC-9104</td><td>WB: 1:1000</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>RAT anti Mouse Ly-6B.2 ALLOANTIGEN</td><td>Bio-Rad</td><td>Cat#: MCA771G</td><td>IF:1:200</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>CD144 (VE-cadherin)</td><td>BD Biosciences</td><td>Cat#: 555661</td><td>IF:1:100</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Human IgG2 isotype control</td><td>BioXcell</td><td>Cat# BE0301</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Anti-MMP14 (E2C6)</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Botkjaer et al., 2016</xref></td><td>PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26934448">26934448</ext-link></td><td>A kind gift from Prof. Gillian Murphy and Dr. Yoshifumi Itoh</td></tr><tr><td>Commercial assay or kit</td><td>Human Tie-2 DuoSet</td><td>R and D</td><td>Cat#: DY5159</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Commercial assay or kit</td><td>Mouse Tie-2 Quantikine ELISA Kit</td><td>R and D</td><td>Cat#: MTE200</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Commercial assay or kit</td><td>CBA Mouse Inflammation Kit</td><td>BD</td><td>Cat#: 552364</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Peptide, recombinant protein</td><td>Recombinant Human TNF-alpha</td><td>R and D</td><td>Cat#: 210-TA-020</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Peptide, recombinant protein</td><td>Recombinant Human MMP14 <break/>(catalytic domain)</td><td>Enzo</td><td>Cat#: ALX-201–098 C010</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Peptide, recombinant protein</td><td>Recombinant Human TIE2 protein</td><td>Sino Biological</td><td>Cat#: 10700-H03H</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>ImageJ</td><td>NIH, <break/>Bethesda, MD <break/>(Version 1.52P)</td><td/><td><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/">https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>Prism8</td><td>Graphpad</td><td/><td><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.graphpad.com/scientific-software/prism/">https://www.graphpad.com/scientific-software/prism/</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>Flowjo</td><td>BD</td><td/><td><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.flowjo.com/solutions/flowjo/downloads">https://www.flowjo.com/solutions/flowjo/downloads</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td>Other</td><td>LPS <break/><italic>Escherichia coli</italic> serotype O111:B4</td><td>Sigma-Aldrich</td><td>Cat#: L4130</td><td/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell culture, stimulation, transfections, antibodies, DNA constructs, and reagents</title><p>HEK293T cells were purchased while Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were isolated from human umbilical veins upon informed consent from donors and approval from the ethical committee of Hannover Medical School (Nr. 1303–2012).

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Frank L van de Veerdonk as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Matthias Barton as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Jaap D Van Buul (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, we are asking editors to accept without delay manuscripts, like yours, that they judge can stand as <italic>eLife</italic> papers without additional data, even if they feel that they would make the manuscript stronger. Thus the revisions requested below only address clarity and presentation.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors show that downregulation of Tie2 in endothelial cells is an important feature in in sepsis and have further explored the mechanisms leading to Tie2 downregulation in a murine model and in vitro. The authors show that this is MMP14 dependent and continue to show that blocking MMP14-mediated Tie2 shedding protects the loss of vascular barrier and has anti-inflammatory effects using experimental murine sepsis. This work may provide a new therapeutic target for vascular leakage during sepsis. The work is novel, straightforward and the data support the conclusions.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>This is in potential a very strong measure and the work is novel, and done thoroughly. The conclusions drawn make sense and the experiments carried out are of high quality and include the proper controls. I have some comments that I wish to see being addressed by the authors.</p><p>1) Tie 2 shedding would also reduce inflammation. How then? Does it directly target NF-kB activation?</p><p>2) They report that the MMP14 inhibition works in the lungs. What about other organs? In other words, is the effect systemic or is there any organ specificity? Can they discuss this in the Discussion section, or perhaps have data to include?</p><p>3) As the inhibition of tie2 cleavage results in the prevention of (LPS-induced) loss of resistance/permeability, did they carefully check junction protein expression, e.g. VE-cadherin but in particular the tight junction proteins, known to control permeability in full-grown Ec monolayers (e.g. claudins, occludins).</p><p>4) Recently, a study by Braun et al., Blood 2020, from the group of Vestweber was published and reported on the fact that Tie2 activation limits the leakage that is induced by transmigrating leukocytes. This study would be complementary to theirs and should be cited in the Discussion section.</p><p>5) How sure can you be there are no cleavage sites outside of the synthetic Tie2 sites you generated? I am not familiar with the reliability of the software used, but apparently it at least wrongly predicted a cleavage site in D740-L. If the authors aren't sure these are the only three cleavage sites, perhaps the conclusion should be changed to leave open the possibility that MMP14 cleaves elsewhere (subsection “MMP14-dependent Tie2 cleavage occurs at the Fibronectin type III domain”).</p><p>6) In the in vitro experiments, TNFa was used to induce inflammation, whereas in the in vivo experiments LPS was used. I understand that LPS is not as effective as TNFa in HUVEC, but perhaps the authors could explain possible other reasons for this.</p><p>7) In Figure 3A, the holes between cells look really large.

In our setting and in the experiments that we performed, Tie2 shedding did not relevantly reduce inflammation. That being said we also didn’t focus on this but rather on the regulation of the vascular barrier. Nevertheless, others have shown that Tie2 activation is sufficient to inhibit the expression of surface adhesion molecules ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 (1) (all of which are downstream of the NF-κB pathway) by recruiting the adaptor protein growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 (ABIN2) (2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) They report that the MMP14 inhibition works in the lungs. What about other organs? In other words, is the effect systemic or is there any organ specificity? Can they discuss this in the Discussion section, or perhaps have data to include?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer. Given the broad expression of Tie2 in various endothelial cells and the presumably broad effect of MMP14 on Tie2 shedding, we would predict that MMP14 blockade has a systemic rather than organ-specific effect. This is supported by the observation that soluble Tie2 (sTie2) in the serum of endotoxemic mice compared to control mice is increased (Figure 2D) accompanied by a decrease in total Tie2 (tTie2) abundance in kidney (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>) and lung homogenates (Figure 2E). We decided to focus on the lungs because of its hallmark clinical role in sepsis together with the known high abundance of endothelial cells per organ tissue. As suggested, this has been included in the Discussion section.</p><p>Discussion:</p><p>“Also, we did not show whether the effect of MMP14 blockade is systemic or organ-specific; however, given the broad expression of Tie2 in various endothelial cells and the presumably broad effect of MMP14 on Tie2 shedding, we would predict that MMP14 blockade has a systemic rather than organ-specific effect.

In our current work, we did not focus on the mechanisms that regulate permeability downstream of Tie2 but rather on acute (posttranslational) events that occur on the receptor level per se. However, we could show in vitro that VE-cadherin expression might be affected by Tie2 cleavage (Figure 3A). Others have shown that the anti-permeability effect of Tie2 is mostly mediated via changes in small GTPases (predominately RhoA) (3). Downstream signaling was beyond the scope of this project.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Recently, a study by Braun et al., 2020, from the group of Vestweber was published and reported on the fact that Tie2 activation limits the leakage that is induced by transmigrating leukocytes.

We agree that we cannot exclude the possibility of other unidentified cleavage sites within the Tie2 ectodomain. However, we believe that the observed 90% reduction of Tie2 cleavage by site-directed mutagenesis makes a strong case that these sites are indeed relevant. Nevertheless, as suggested we have made necessary corrections in the revised manuscript to acknowledge this important issue.</p><p>Results:</p><p>“In summary, this demonstrates that Tie2 is cleaved by MMP14 possibly at three different sites and…”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) In the in vitro experiments, TNFa was used to induce inflammation, whereas in the in vivo experiments LPS was used.

There, we found TNFα to be the most reproducible mediator of Tie2 changes in vitro. Consequently, we used TNF analogously for this study. Nevertheless, based on your suggestion we have repeated a key experiment to analyze potential mediator-associated differences. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2</xref> shows similar potency with regard to Tie2 shedding (***P&lt;0.001 Compared with control in Turkey`s multiple comparisons test. n=4 per group).</p><fig id="sa2fig2"><label>Author response image 2.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-59520-resp-fig2-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) In Figure 3A, the holes between cells look really large.

Yes, this is a representative image as indicated in the manuscript. The numbers of holes induced by TNFα are represented by the white arrows. We believe the HRP permeability experiment in Figure 3C is a better quantitative approach to measure the amount of permeability. Nevertheless, based on your suggestion we have quantified the holes.
