Recent research has provided evidence of distinct differences in the gut microbiota of patients with gout and hyperuricemia compared to healthy individuals. However, the link between gut microbiota and age-related gout remained underexplored. Our study found that gut microbiota plays a crucial role in determining susceptibility to age-related gout. Specifically, we observed that age-related gut microbiota regulated the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome pathway and modulated uric acid metabolism. More scrutiny highlighted the positive impact of ‘younger’ microbiota on the gut microbiota structure of old or aged mice, enhancing butanoate metabolism and butyric acid content. Experimentation with butyrate supplementation indicated that butyric acid exerts a dual effect, inhibiting inflammation in acute gout and reducing serum uric acid levels. These insights emphasize the potential of gut microbiome rejuvenation in mitigating senile gout, unraveling the intricate dynamics between microbiota, aging, and gout. It potentially serves as a therapeutic target for senile gout-related conditions.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>gout</kwd><kwd>hyperuricemia</kwd><kwd>gut microbe</kwd><kwd>age</kwd><kwd>butyrate</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100019491</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China - State Grid Corporation Joint Fund for Smart Grid</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>3220889</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Naisheng</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100019491</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China - State Grid Corporation Joint Fund for Smart Grid</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31972749</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Naisheng</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007847</institution-id><institution>Natural Science Foundation of Jilin Province</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2022010304JC</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Wenlong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Gut microbiota from young mice can alleviate gout and hyperuricemia in aged mice, further revealing that the metabolic product butyrate derived from the gut microbiota exerts similar therapeutic effects.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Gout, the most common inflammatory arthritis in elderly individuals, results from the deposition of monosodium urate (MSU) crystals in articular and nonarticular structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dalbeth, 2016</xref>), particularly among individuals aged 75–84 years, and the occurrence rate in this population can reach 4% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Stamp and Jordan, 2011</xref>). The development of gout is primarily attributed to the significant risk posed by a high serum urate concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Stamp and Jordan, 2011</xref>). Pathological hyperuricemia is defined by a serum urate concentration exceeding 408 μmol/L (6.8 mg/dL), which forms MSU crystals in vitro at physiological pH and temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chhana et al., 2015</xref>). The reason why the elderly population commonly experiences gout is complicated by the fact that the population is also aging, and the treatment of this disease is often intricate due to the presence of comorbidities and medications prescribed for concurrent conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Stamp and Jordan, 2011</xref>). Although the basic principles for the prevention and treatment for gout remain the same across different age groups, elderly individuals often exhibit lower tolerance for medication dosages, types, side effects, and surgical procedures due to their physiological factors. Moreover, despite the increasing severity of gout among elderly individuals, research on this issue remains scarce.</p><p>The gut microbiota plays essential roles in regulating energy and metabolism, as revealed by recent studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Duttaroy, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adak and Khan, 2019</xref>), which have shown that individuals with hyperuricemia and gout exhibit dysbiosis of the gut microbiota (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Guo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Tiejuan et al., 2017</xref>). Moreover, because the gut microbiota can directly participate in the metabolism of purines and uric acid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Yamada et al., 2016</xref>), it may play a crucial role in gout and hyperuricemia development. Although numerous studies have examined the relationship between the microbiome and early life stages, the impact of the microbiome’s on aging and frailty in later life needs to be explored. Furthermore, studies have shown that the structure of the gut microbiota undergoes a gradual ‘aging’ process with advancing age, and this process is characterized by a decrease in the microbial diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Buford, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lynch and Pedersen, 2016</xref>). In addition, transplantation of a young microbiota can improve central nervous system inflammation and retinal inflammation in aged mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Parker et al., 2022</xref>), and counteract age-related behavioral deficits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Boehme et al., 2021</xref>). We hypothesize that the high prevalence of gout in the elderly population may be closely related to its ‘aging’ gut microbiota. The association between the ‘aging’ gut microbiota and gout in elderly individuals has not been reported. Hence, we conducted a study to elucidate the influence of the aging gut microbiota on the occurrence and progression of gout in elderly individuals.</p><p>In this study, we first tested the sensitivity to MSU in different age groups and conducted a microbiota clearance (Abx) on mice of different age groups to assess their sensitivity to MSU again. At the same time, we also tested their serum uric acid (SUA) levels. We found that sensitivity to MSU increased with age, but changed after clearing the gut microbiota in terms of sensitivity to MSU and SUA levels. Then, we performed cross-age fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) and subsequently stimulated the mice with MSU with the aim of how mice belonging to different age groups exhibit sensitivity to MSU after undergoing FMT. Because hyperuricemia is a necessary physiological factor for gout, we also evaluated the expression levels of uric acid-producing enzymes and uric acid transport proteins in the mice. Surprisingly, transplantation of the gut microbiota from aged mice into young mice significantly increased their sensitivity to MSU. Conversely, the transplantation of the gut microbiota from young mice into aged mice significantly decreased their sensitivity to MSU. These findings suggest that the gut microbiota of older individuals plays a promoting role in the occurrence and progression of gout. Moreover, an analysis of the SUA levels of the mice after cross-age FMT yielded similar results. To investigate the underlying mechanisms of how gut microbiota influences gout and hyperuricemia, we performed 16S rDNA sequencing and untargeted metabolomics analysis of fecal samples. We then observed a significant increase in the abundance of <italic>Bifidobacterium</italic> and <italic>Akkermansia</italic> in the gut microbiota of young mice and old or aged mice after transplantation of the gut microbiota from young mice. To further investigate the potential biological pathways affected by the gut microbiota, we performed functional metagenomic analysis using Tax4FUN software and found that butanoate metabolism was more robust in young mice than in aged mice. Furthermore, we also observed that transplantation of the gut microbiota from young mice to aged mice enhanced the butanoate metabolism of the recipient mice. Due to the limitations of untargeted metabolomics, we did not observe any differences in the levels of butyric acid among the different groups. However, the pathway data obtained by fecal untargeted metabolomics also yielded similar results. Based on the above-described results, we hypothesize that butyrate may play a significant role in these processes. Excitingly, the results from a short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) analysis support our hypothesis. Furthermore, a supplementation experiment using butyrate revealed that the results aligned well with the cross-age FMT findings, which suggests that transplantation of the gut microbiota from young mice into aged mice can effectively prevent gout and hyperuricemia, and that butyrate is likely the critical factor playing a crucial role. Our research findings demonstrate the potential of young gut microbiota in preventing gout in elderly individuals and provide new insights and perspectives for the prevention and treatment of gout in elderly individuals.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Gout susceptibility increases with age, related to gut microbiota</title><p>In this study, we used the male C57BL/6 mice belonging to three age groups: young (~3 months), old (~18 months), and aged (~24 months) mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). To investigate the impact of age on gout, we used a mouse model in which subcutaneous injections of MSU crystals were administered to the dorsal aspect of the hind paws (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Schauer et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Yang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Mariotte et al., 2020</xref>). The result showed that the old group exhibited a significant increase in footpad swelling compared with the young group, and the levels of IL-1β were significantly elevated in the old and aged groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b and c</xref>). The level of IL-6 was significantly elevated in the old and aged groups after MSU was stimulated. A prominent correlation was found between the occurrence of gout and the concentration of SUA, which exhibits an upward trend with advancing age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Stamp and Jordan, 2011</xref>). Thus, we also measured the SUA level and found uric acid levels significantly increase with age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). There are reports indicating a close relationship between gut microbiota and gout (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Guo et al., 2016</xref>). Therefore, we simultaneously tested the gut microbiota of mice at different ages. The results showed that as age increases the amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) showed a declining trend (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>). Moreover, the principal coordinates analysis (PCoA) results revealed distinctive differences in the phylogenetic community structures between these groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>). Then, we carried out antibiotics (ABX) cocktail on mice of different age groups, found changes in the footpad swelling, IL-1β, and discovered no differences in the level of SUA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1g–i</xref>). These data highlight that aging-associated changes in the gut microbiota exacerbate gout attacks.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Gout susceptibility increases with age, related to gut microbiota.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Mice of different ages.

The experimental design and timeline are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>. To investigate the impact of cross-age FMT on gout, we used a gout mouse model as aforementioned. The results of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1a</xref> showed that young mice transplanted with fecal microbiota from mice in the old or aged group (Young + Old or Young + Aged) exhibited a significant increase in footpad swelling compared with the control group (Young + PBS).

Subsequently, we conducted a comparative analysis of H&amp;E-stained tissue sections (scar, 1000 μm), derived from mice with cross-age FMT and MSU-induced acute gout. We found that the Young + Old and Young + Aged group showed more inflammatory cell infiltration in the subcutaneous soft tissues than the Young + PBS group, whereas the Old + Young and Aged + Young groups showed less inflammatory cell infiltration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). The inflammatory factors in the foot tissue of the mice with cross-age FMT were then examined. The levels of IL-1β, IL-6, and TNFα were significantly elevated in the Young + Aged group and significantly lower in the Aged + Young group compared with the Aged + PBS group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c–e</xref>). Meanwhile, to investigate the impact of cross-age FMT on MSU-induced inflammation, we utilized an animal model of C57BL/6 mice administered an intraperitoneal injection of 2.5 mg of MSU (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Goldberg et al., 2017</xref>). Then, 6 hr after MSU intraperitoneal injection, we washed the mouse peritoneal cavity with sterile PBS and collected the peritoneal fluid and peritoneal cells separately. Simultaneously, we also examined the levels of inflammatory cytokines in mouse serum. Consistent with the acute gout model, the Young + Old or Young + Aged group exhibited more pronounced activation of IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α in peritoneal fluid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f–h</xref>) and serum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1b–d</xref>). Although no differences in the IL-6 levels of serum and peritoneal fluid were found between the Old + PBS and Old + Young groups or between the Aged + Young and Aged + PBS groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2g</xref>), a significant reduction in IL-1β and TNF-α was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1b and d</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f and h</xref>).

We primarily examined proteins of foot tissue and peritoneal cells associated with the NLRP3 inflammasome pathway.

However, the Old + Young and Aged + Young groups showed lower protein levels of caspase-1 and IL-1β compared with the control group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c–f</xref>), which suggests that the gut microbiota of elderly mice may make them more sensitive to MSU stimulation, whereas the gut microbiota of young mice can effectively resist the MSU stimulation and inhibit caspase-1 cleavage and IL-1β secretion. Meanwhile, the NLRP3 inflammasome pathway also was investigated in peritoneal cells, and similar results were obtained in the gout model.

Surprisingly, we observed an elevation in the average SUA levels in the Young + Old or Young + Aged group, whereas the Old + Young or Aged + Young group exhibited decreases in the SUA levels compared with the same-age control group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>). Our study showed that compared with those of the same-age control group, the serum levels of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) were elevated in the Young + Old and Young + Aged groups, although the differences were not significant, whereas the Aged + Young groups exhibited modest decreases in these levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1a and b</xref>). Furthermore, similar trends were found for indicators (Crea and BUN) of renal function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1c and d</xref>). Hyperuricemia is attributed to increased uric acid synthesis and decreased uric acid excretion in the body. We first measured the activity of enzymes involved in uric acid synthesis, namely adenosine deaminase (ADA), guanine deaminase (GDA), and xanthine dehydrogenase (XOD), in the liver and that of (XOD) in the kidney. The activity of ADA, GDA, and XOD in the liver, and the activity of XOD in the kidney of the Young + Old and Young + Aged groups did not significantly differ from those of the same-age control groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b–e</xref>). The fecal microbiota from mice in the young group induced a notable decrease in the activity of enzymes related to uric acid synthesis, and the most prominent reductions were found for ADA and XOD activity in the liver and XOD activity in the kidney (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b, d and e</xref>). We then examined the mRNA levels of relevant proteins involved in uric acid transport. We initially measured the renal injury marker <italic>Havcr1</italic> (KIM-1) and observed that the fecal microbiota from mice in the young group contributed to attenuating the mRNA expression levels of this marker compared with the same-age control group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4f</xref>). The urate transporter <italic>Slc22a12</italic> (URAT1), which is responsible for uric acid reabsorption, exhibited a similar trend (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4g</xref>). However, cross-age FMT did not significantly impact the mRNA expression of another uric acid reabsorption protein, <italic>Slc2a9</italic> (GLUT9) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4h</xref>). The Young + Aged group showed lower mRNA expression levels of the uric acid excretion proteins <italic>Slc22a6</italic> (OAT1) and <italic>Slc22a8</italic> (OAT3) compared with the Young + PBS group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4i and j</xref>). Although the mRNA expression levels of Slc22a6 (OAT1) and Slc22a8 (OAT3) did not show significant differences, a significant increasing trend was found for the other uric acid excretion protein, Abcg2 (ABCG2), in aged mice transplanted with fecal microbiota from mice in the young group exhibited a significant increasing trend (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4k</xref>). Because Abcg2 (ABCG2) is also expressed in the intestine, we examined its mRNA expression levels in the colon and found that the fecal microbiota from mice in the aged group could inhibit its expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1e</xref>). Similar trends were found for the mRNA expression levels of mice in <italic>Tjp1</italic> (ZO-1) and <italic>F11r</italic> (JAMA) in the colon of the Young + Aged group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1g and h</xref>). No significant alterations in the colonic Ocln (Occludin) mRNA expression levels were observed among all the groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1f</xref>).

These results suggest that the fecal microbiota from mice in the old or aged group leads to insufficient uric acid excretion, whereas the fecal microbiota from mice in the young group promotes uric acid elimination, inhibits reabsorption, and may contribute to the integrity of the intestinal barrier structure and the maintenance of normal physiological function.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Beneficial effects of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) from young to aged mice on uric acid metabolism.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) All groups’ serum concentrations of uric acid (n = 6).

These findings are in line with other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ghosh et al., 2022</xref>), indicating declines in the richness and diversity of the gut microbiota during aging. Moreover, the PCoA results revealed distinctive differences in the phylogenetic community structures between these groups. We showed that the Young + Old and Young + Aged groups tended to be closer to the Old + PBS and Aged + PBS groups, and the Old + Young and Aged + Young groups tended to be closer to the Young + PBS group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>).

Considering the results from the analysis modifications in the gut microbiota composition after cross-age FMT, both <italic>Bifidobacterium</italic> and <italic>Akkermansia</italic> metabolites include SCFAs.

Subsequently, we observed that the butyric acid content in the feces of Young + PBS group was significantly higher than that in the Aged + PBS group. Simultaneously, the butyric acid content in the feces of mice in the Aged + Young was also significantly higher than that in the Aged + PBS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7a</xref>). 2-Methylvalerate and 3-methylvalerate were not detected, and 4-methylvaleric was detected in only a subset of samples, thus, these results are not presented. The difference analysis of the detected SCFAs is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1a–h</xref>. Therefore, mice were supplemented with butyrate for 14 days and then subjected to intraperitoneal injections of MSU into the dorsal aspect of the hind paws to observe its anti-inflammatory effects in acute gout. The experimental results showed that butyrate exerted significant anti-inflammatory effects in the acute gout model with inflammation induced by intraperitoneal injection of MSU. Mice with gout model supplemented with butyrate showed significant reductions in the foot thickness ratio (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7b</xref>) and the levels of inflammatory factors (IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α) in their foot tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7c–e</xref>).

There is scarce research on the impact of butyrate on SUA levels, and the effects of butyrate on hepatic uric acid production or renal uric acid excretion have not been investigated. Additionally, the impact of butyrate on the SUA levels in aged mice remains unexplored. Aged mice were supplemented with butyrate for 14 days, and we found that butyrate supplementation significantly reduced the SUA levels in 18-month-old and 24-month-old mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8a</xref>). In this regard, we also assessed the activity of enzymes implicated in uric acid synthesis, namely, ADA, GDA, and XOD in the liver, as well as that of XOD in the kidney. In addition to identifying that butyrate can reduce the activity of ADA in 24-month-old mice (Aged) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8b</xref>), and supplementation with butyrate did not have significant effects on the activities of enzymes involved in uric acid production in both 18-month-old and 24-month-old mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8c–e</xref>). Butyrate may not necessarily lower the SUA levels by inhibiting uric acid production. Because butyrate might exert its influence on SUA levels by affecting uric acid transport, we subsequently examined the expression of relevant transporter mRNA in mouse kidneys and the expression of the colonic Abcg2 (ABCG2) transporter that facilitates uric acid excretion. The expression of the renal injury marker <italic>Havcr1</italic> (KIM-1) was significantly decreased in mice supplemented with butyrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8f</xref>). In contrast to the results obtained cross-age FMT, no significant difference in the expression of Slc22a12 (URAT1) was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8g</xref>). However, the expression of Slc2a9 (GLUT9) was significantly decreased in 24-month-old mice after butyrate supplementation, whereas no significant difference was observed in the 18-month-old mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8h</xref>). We also found that the supplementation of old or aged mice with butyrate resulted in an increased mRNA expression level of uric acid transporters involved in uric acid excretion and significantly increased the expression of Slc22a6 (OAT1) and Slc22a8 (OAT3) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8i and j</xref>). Although no significant difference in the expression of Abcg2 (ABCG2) was detected in old mice, a significant increased in its expression was observed in aged mice after supplementation with butyrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8k</xref>). Meanwhile, the mRNA expression of Abcg2 (ABCG2) in the colons was significantly increased in old or aged mice after supplementation with butyrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8l</xref>). Moreover, supplementation with butyrate significantly increased the mRNA expression of <italic>Tjp1</italic> (ZO-1), Ocln (Occludin), and F11r (JAMA) in the colons of mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1a–c</xref>).

However, research on gout among the elderly population is relatively limited. Previous studies have confirmed a close relationship between gout and the gut microbiota (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Méndez-Salazar and Martínez-Nava, 2022</xref>), but the specific connection between the gut microbiota of older individuals and gout remains unexplored. FMT from young to old mice also reportedly alleviates age-related stroke <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Lee et al., 2020</xref> and other benefits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Parker et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kim et al., 2022</xref>). There are also studies indicating older patients demonstrate heightened inflammatory reactions during gout attacks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Yang et al., 2024</xref>). Based on this finding, we hypothesize that the gut microbiota of different age groups may exert varying effects on gout. Therefore, we conducted cross-age FMT to investigate the interaction between the gut microbiota in different age groups and gout.</p><p>This study demonstrated that FMT from young to aged mice effectively alleviated the inflammatory response caused by MSU and improved uric acid metabolism in elderly mice, reducing the symptoms of gout. In contrast, FMT from old or aged to young mice exacerbated gout, indicating the importance of the gut microbiota composition in gout development. Activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome has been implicated in the pathogenesis of gout, leading to the production of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α. The beneficial effects of FMT from young to aged mice could be attributed to inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome pathway. A ‘younger’ gut microbiota could suppress the activation of NLRP3, caspase-1, and IL-1β, thereby reducing the inflammatory response in gout. Furthermore, the modulation of uric acid metabolism in old or aged mice played a role in the effects of young gut microbiota transplantation. Additionally, the improvement in the intestinal tight junction integrity observed after transplantation of the gut microbiota from young to old or aged mice may contribute to enhanced elimination of uric acid. Recent studies have also shown a direct relationship between hyperuricemia and gut microbiota. Certain anaerobic microbial communities are capable of effectively degrading purines and uric acid and thereby regulate the abundance of purines in the body to maintain the body’s uric acid balance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Liu et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kasahara et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Pan et al., 2020</xref>). Our study also showed that the gut microbiota plays a role in maintaining the balance of SUA in the body. The ‘aging’ gut microbiota is more likely to elevate the levels of SUA in the body by suppressing the expression of uric acid excretion transporter (OAT1, OAT3). The ‘younger’ gut microbiota helps restrain the increase of SUA levels in old or aged mice by suppressing the expression of uric acid reabsorption transporters (URAT1) and the activity of uric acid-producing enzymes (mainly XOD) and also promotes the expression of uric acid excretion transporters (ABCG2) in aged mice. We also found that old or aged mice exhibited stronger purine metabolism (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2a and b</xref>). These results may explain the reason for the high levels of uric acid detected in elderly individuals.</p><p>Moreover, through 16S rDNA sequencing analysis, we found that the abundance of <italic>Bifidobacterium</italic> and <italic>Akkermansia</italic> was higher in young mice. Additionally, FMT from young to old or aged mice increased the abundance of the <italic>Akkermansia</italic> genus. There are existing reports regarding the therapeutic effects of <italic>Bifidobacterium</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Vieira et al., 2015</xref>) and <italic>Akkermansia</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Zhang et al., 2022</xref>) on gout and hyperuricemia. Therefore, we performed further investigation, and using microbiome-predicted functional and untargeted metabolomics data, we observed a significant enhancement in butanoate metabolism in young mice. Surprisingly, using untargeted metabolomics data, comparisons of the results after FMT from young to old or aged mice with those of old or aged mice also identified the secondary bile acid biosynthesis pathways. Studies have indicated that transplantation of the gut microbiota from healthy mice to progeroid mice can enhance the enrichment of secondary bile acid biosynthesis pathways, and the restoration of secondary bile acids may potentially contribute to extension of the healthspan and lifespan in progeroid mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bárcena et al., 2019</xref>). The current investigation into the impact of secondary bile acids on gout and hyperuricemia is still in its incipient phase, with the intrinsic mechanisms remaining largely unelucidated, thereby rendering this domain a pivotal subject of profound scientific inquiry. Moreover, old or aged mice transplanted with gut microbiota from young mice also exhibited an increase in butanoate metabolism. Upon comparison, we discovered other bacteria genera that produce butyrate, such as <italic>Lachnoclostridium</italic>. Additionally, literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Zhao et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Rios-Covian et al., 2015</xref>) reports have indicated that <italic>Bifidobacteria</italic> combined with other genera can enhance the production of butyrate. Meanwhile, <italic>Akkermansia</italic>, particularly the species <italic>Akkermansia muciniphila</italic>, has been found to confer several beneficial traits, as evidenced by preclinical studies. These traits include promoting the growth of butyrate-producing bacteria through the production of acetate, which leads to a decrease in the loss of the colonic bilayer and subsequent reduction in inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ghosh et al., 2022</xref>). These findings led us to hypothesize that butyric acid might play a role in this phenomenon. Although <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> does show a similar trend for acetic and propionic acids as for butyric acid. However, considering the predictive data of microbial function and the non-targeted metabolomic data, there is an enhancement of Butanoate_metabolism in both young mice and elderly mice receiving young mouse intestinal microbiota transplants. Therefore, we prioritized butyrate as the subject of our study. Due to the scarcity of elderly mice, we are unable to conduct subsequent experiments with acetic and propionic acids, which is one of the limitations of this study. This work will be addressed in our follow-up research. Subsequently, we selected the Young + PBS, Aged + PBS, and Aged + Young groups for analysis of the SCFA levels and discovered that the fecal butyric acid content in young mice was higher than that in aged mice, and that FMT from young mice led to an increase in fecal butyric acid content in aged mice. Consistent with previous reports, the content of SCFAs in the feces of elderly mice was lower than that in the feces of young mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Yuan et al., 2024</xref>). This result shifted our focus to butyric acid. Butyric acid, an SCFA derived from the gut microbiota, has been found to play a crucial role in host health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Vinolo et al., 2011</xref>). Emerging evidence indicates that among SCFAs, butyrate plays a pivotal role as a regulator in mediating metabolic control of the microbiota (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>). The anti-inflammatory effects of butyric acid have been extensively reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Li et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen et al., 2018</xref>), but only a few studies have investigated its impact on gout. Similarly, research on the anti-hyperuricemia effects of butyric acid is relatively scarce. We then conducted experiments using gout and peritonitis models, and found that mice supplemented with butyrate exhibited relief in symptoms of gout and inflammation. Butyrate could also reduce the SUA levels in old or aged mice by promoting the expression of uric acid excretion transporters.</p><p>The findings of this study demonstrate the positive effects of gut microbiota transplantation from young to aged mice in mitigating gout symptoms. Inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome pathway was found to modulate uric acid metabolism and increase butyric acid levels. The gut microbiota of young mice effectively alleviated the inflammatory response and improved uric acid metabolism in aged mice. We enhanced butanoate metabolism in the gut microbiota of young mice, while the opposite was observed in aged mice. Furthermore, we observed higher levels of butyrate in the feces of young mice. Moreover, butyrate has excellent anti-inflammatory and uric acid-lowering effects. These findings highlight the potential of targeting the gut microbiota as a therapeutic approach for the prevention and treatment of senile gout-related conditions.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Preparation of MSU crystals</title><p>A solution consisting of 10 mM uric acid and 154 mM NaCl (both from Sigma) was adjusted to pH 7.2 and agitated for 7 days to produce MSU crystals.

Authors should carefully interpret the data in Figure 1G-H.</p></disp-quote><p>Sorry for the inadequate clarification on your question. We utilize antibiotics for treatment in order to establish the relationship between gut microbiota, age, and gout. Our research findings indicate that there is a trend for serum uric acid levels to increase with age, and we also observe that the older the age, the more pronounced the stimulation to MSU. We found that after clearing the gut microbiota and then stimulating with MSU, the trend of inflammation factors and serum uric acid level changing with age disappears. Thus, we can preliminarily draw the conclusion that the gut microbiota is closely associated with age, gout, and hyperuricemia.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The response to comment 2: I understand the importance of evaluating a range of indicators, but food thickness is the most crucial clinical marker for diagnosing goats. Please move the data from Supplemental Figure 1A to the main figure.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your suggestions. We have included the most significant results in the main figure, and the description of “foot thickness” has already been provided descriptively in the manuscript. Additionally, considering the layout and arrangement of the images, we have placed it in the supplementary figures 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The response to comment 3: The immunostaining for ZO-1 and Occludin is unclear. Please provide higher magnification images to confirm the specific staining.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your valuable feedback. We have enhanced the clarity of the images. In addition to adding immunohistochemical images in Supplementary Material 4, we have also submitted independent images.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The response to comment 4: The authors still haven't directly addressed my comment.</p></disp-quote><p>Please accept our sincere apologies for not providing a clearer response to your question. The indicators related to uric acid-producing enzymes and uric acid transporters have been separately analyzed according to different age groups. The specific results are detailed in section &quot; The expression of uric acid-producing enzymes activity and uric acid transporters at the mRNA level across different age groups&quot; of Supplementary Material 4.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>No response was given for comment 5. Please address it.</p></disp-quote><p>In a PCoA plot, the distance between samples reflects the similarity in the structure of the microbial communities: the closer the distance, the more similar the composition of the communities; the greater the distance, the more pronounced the differences. We judge based on the relative distances of each group in the plot, observing their degree of proximity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The response to comment 6: I understand the author's statement, and I suggest incorporating it into the discussion section of the revised manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your suggestions. We have incorporated the relevant content into our discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The response to comment 7: Again, please incorporate this statement into the discussion section of the revised manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your suggestions.

The study provides valuable insights into the therapeutic potential of microbiota interventions and metabolites for managing hyperuricemia and gout. While the authors have addressed many of the previous concerns, a few areas still require clarification and improvements to strengthen the manuscript's clarity and overall impact.</p><p>(1) While the authors mention that outliers in the data do not affect the conclusions, there remains a concern about the reliability of some figures (e.g., Figure 2D-G). It is recommended to provide a more detailed explanation of the statistical analysis used to handle outliers. Additionally, the clarity of the Western blot images, particularly IL-1β in Figure 3C, should be improved to ensure clear and supportive evidence for the conclusions.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your suggestion. We respond as follows: (1) Outliers can occasionally constitute intrinsic elements of the dataset, reflecting genuine occurrences within the experimental context. The elimination of such outliers has the potential to introduce bias into the results, thereby facilitating misconceptions regarding the underlying phenomenon under investigation. In order to maintain the transparency and integrity of the dataset, we have elected to retain the outliers within our analysis. This decision is based on the recognition that these values may represent genuine experimental observations or unique conditions that are inherently meaningful to the phenomenon under investigation. By preserving these data points, we aim to provide a comprehensive and unbiased representation of the experimental results, allowing for a more nuanced interpretation of the findings. (2) Due to the scarcity of samples, we are unable to fulfill your request in the short term. Furthermore, we have noted that the band for IL-1β in Figure 3C is indeed visible and we consider it suitable for subsequent analysis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The manuscript raises a key question about why butyrate supplementation and FMT have different effects on uric acid metabolism and excretion. While the authors have addressed this by highlighting the involvement of multiple bacterial genera, it is still recommended to expand on the differences between these interventions in the discussion, providing more mechanistic insights based on available literature.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your suggestion. We have enriched the discussion in the manuscript and included additional comparisons</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) It is noted that IL-6 and TNF-α results in foot tissue were requested and have been added to supplementary material. However, the main text should clearly reference these additions, and the supplementary figures should be thoroughly reviewed for consistency with the main findings. The use of abbreviations (e.g., ns for no significant difference) and labeling should also be carefully checked across all figures.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your valuable feedback. We have revised the manuscript in accordance with your suggestions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) The manuscript presents butyrate as a key molecule in gout therapy, yet there are lingering concerns about its central role, especially given that other short-chain fatty acids (e.g., acetic and propionic acids) also follow similar trends. The authors should consider further acknowledging these other SCFAs and discussing their potential contribution to gout management. Additionally, the rationale for focusing primarily on butyrate in subsequent research should be made clearer.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your input. We have incorporated additional evidence into the discussion, explaining why we ultimately chose butyrate in subsequent research.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) The full-length uncropped Western blot images should be provided as requested, to ensure transparency and reproducibility of the data.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your suggestion. We have already included the relevant explanations in the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) Despite the authors' revisions, several references still lack page numbers. Please ensure that all references are properly formatted, including complete page ranges.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your suggestions; we will make more detailed revisions to the references.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript has improved with the revisions made, particularly regarding clarifications on experimental design and the inclusion of supplementary data. However, some concerns about data quality, mechanistic insights, and clarity in the figures remain. Addressing these points will enhance the overall impact of the work and its potential contribution to the understanding of the gut microbiome in gout and hyperuricemia. A final revision, with careful attention to both major and minor points, is highly recommended before resubmission.</p></disp-quote><p>Once again, we are grateful for your suggestions and recognition. Your input has been of immense help to our manuscript and has also provided us with a valuable learning opportunity.</p></body></sub-article></article>
