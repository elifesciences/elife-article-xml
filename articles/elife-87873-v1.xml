including anticancer effects. Heliomycin was first described in the 1960s, but its clinical applications have been hindered by extremely low solubility. A series of 4-aminomethyl derivatives of heliomycin were synthesized to increase water solubility; studies showed that they had anti-proliferative effects, but the drug targets remained unknown. In this study, we conducted cellular thermal shift assays (CETSA) and molecular docking simulations to identify and validate that heliomycin and its water-soluble derivative, 4-(dimethylaminomethyl)heliomycin (designated compound 4-dmH) engaged and targeted with sirtuin-1 (SIRT1) in p53-functional SAS and p53-mutated HSC-3 oral cancer cells. We further addressed the cellular outcome of SIRT1 inhibition by these compounds and found that, in addition to SIRT1, the water-soluble 4-dmH preferentially targeted a tumor-associated NADH oxidase (tNOX, ENOX2). The direct binding of 4-dmH to tNOX decreased the oxidation of NADH to NAD<sup>+</sup> which diminished NAD<sup>+</sup>-dependent SIRT1 deacetylase activity, ultimately inducing apoptosis and significant cytotoxicity in both cell types, as opposed to the parental heliomycin-induced autophagy. We also observed that tNOX and SIRT1 were both upregulated in tumor tissues of oral cancer patients compared to adjacent normal tissues, suggesting their clinical relevance. Finally, the better therapeutic efficacy of 4-dmH was confirmed in tumor-bearing mice, which showed greater tNOX and SIRT1 downregulation and tumor volume reduction when treated with 4-dmH compared to heliomycin. Taken together, our in vitro and in vivo findings suggest that the multifaceted properties of water-soluble 4-dmH enable it to offer superior antitumor value compared to parental heliomycin, and indicated that it functions through targeting the tNOX-NAD<sup>+</sup>-SIRT1 axis to induce apoptosis in oral cancer cells.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>apoptosis</kwd><kwd>heliomycin</kwd><kwd>resistomycin</kwd><kwd>sirtuin 1</kwd><kwd>sirt1</kwd><kwd>tumor-associated nadh oxidase</kwd><kwd> tnox</kwd><kwd>enox2</kwd><kwd>oral cancer cells</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>The Ministry of Sciences and Technology, Taiwan</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MOST 106-2320-B-005-008-MY3</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chueh</surname><given-names>Pin Ju</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>The Minsitry of Sciences and Technology, Taiwan</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MOST 108-2923-B-005-001-MY3</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chueh</surname><given-names>Pin Ju</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002261</institution-id><institution>Russian Foundation for Basic Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Project 19-53-52008</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shchekotikhin</surname><given-names>Andrey E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Chung Hsing University and Changhua Christian Hospital</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NCHU-CCH 11105</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Che-Wei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Multifaceted properties of the water-soluble derivative of antibiotic heliomycin enable it to offer greater antitumor value than its parent compound by inhibiting the tNOX-NAD<sup>+</sup>-SIRT1 axis to induce apoptosis.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Heliomycin (also known as resistomycin) was identified as a secondary metabolite produced by <italic>Streptomyces resistomycificus</italic> and has been reported to have antiviral (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brazhnikova et al., 1958</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Slesarchuk et al., 2020</xref>), antifungal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>), antibacterial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adinarayana et al., 2006</xref>), antimicrobial, RNA synthesis-inhibiting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arora, 1985</xref>), and HIV-1 protease-suppressing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Roggo et al., 1994</xref>) activities.

Interestingly, heliomycin isolated from marine sponges was reported to inhibit histone deacetylases (HDACs), as assessed by colorimetric assays and in silico docking studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abdelfattah et al., 2018</xref>). Among the HDACs, sirtuin-1 (SIRT1), a member in the Sir2 family of histone deacetylases, acts in different cellular compartments to remove acetyl groups from histone and non-histone proteins, and thereby modulate various cell functions, including metabolism, healthspan, tumorigenesis, apoptosis, and autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Xu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Garcia-Peterson and Li, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wang et al., 2021b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Vaquero et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Houtkooper et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Donmez and Guarente, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Song and Surh, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Choupani et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lee et al., 2008</xref>). Given its position at the intersection between apoptosis and autophagy, it is not surprising that SIRT1 contributes to a complex regulatory network in which conventional signaling molecules undergo multifaceted interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sun et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Karbasforooshan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Yousafzai et al., 2021</xref>); however, no study has investigated the link between SIRT1 and heliomycin.</p><p>In an effort to identify cellular targets of heliomycin, we previously conducted a cellular thermal shift assays (CETSA), which is based on the concept that ligand binding augments the heat resistance of a target protein in intact cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Martinez Molina et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Martinez Molina and Nordlund, 2016</xref>). Data from CETSA and molecular docking simulations provided direct and experimental evidence linking heliomycin to SIRT1, which exhibited an enhanced melting temperature when incubated with heliomycin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lin et al., 2022</xref>). Our results also demonstrated that heliomycin treatment downregulated SIRT1 expression and that the binding of heliomycin to SIRT1 triggered autophagy to repress the growth of bladder cancer cells. Given that the medical applications of heliomycin have been limited due to its extremely low solubility in aqueous media, we synthesized a series of chemically modified heliomycin derivatives. We found that their cytotoxicity was similar to that of the reference anticancer drug doxorubicin in several cancer cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nadysev et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Tikhomirov et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). To continue with this line of investigation, we herein sought to elucidate the molecular mechanism and identify the cellular targets of the novel water-soluble 4-((dimethylamino)methyl)heliomycin (designated 4-dmH). We report that in addition to targeting SIRT1, as does its parental heliomycin, 4-dmH engages with the tumor-associated NADH oxidase (tNOX, ENOX2), as analyzed by CETSAs and molecular docking studies. Upon this binding, tNOX is ubiquitinylated and degraded, which in turn attenuates signaling by the tNOX-NAD<sup>+</sup>-SIRT1 regulatory axis and induces apoptosis in oral cancer cells.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Structures of heliomycin and 4-(dimethylaminomethyl)heliomycin (designated 4-dmH).</title></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-87873-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Both heliomycin and its water-soluble derivative, 4-dmH, target intracellular SIRT1</title><p>We previously synthesized a series of heliomycin-derived Mannich bases with enhanced water solubility and demonstrated that they possessed anticancer activity against different cancer cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nadysev et al., 2018</xref>); however, the cellular targets and molecular mechanisms of heliomycin and these derivatives remained unknown. Very recently, SIRT1 was shown to function as a cellular target for heliomycin, and this targeting was identified as being important for the anticancer activity of heliomycin in bladder cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lin et al., 2022</xref>). To assess whether the same was true for one of our novel water-soluble derivatives, 4-dmH, we first generated CETSA-based isothermal dose-response fingerprint curves (ITDRF<sub>CETSA</sub>). Our results indicated that the heat resistance of SIRT1 was positively and dose-dependently associated with the water-soluble 4-dmH, with an OC<sub>50</sub> value of 1.0 Î¼M for SAS cells and 0.9 Î¼M for HSC-3 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>).

As heliomycin was reported to induce autophagy in bladder cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lin et al., 2022</xref>), we used AO staining (which detects acidic vesicular organelles) to assess whether heliomycin and/or water-soluble 4-dmH induced autophagy in oral cancer cells. Our results showed that heliomycin markedly enhanced autophagy in SAS cells at 1 and 2 Î¼M and in HSC-3 cells at 2 Î¼M; on the contrary, water-soluble 4-dmH largely failed to provoke autophagy in either line at concentrations up to 2 Î¼M (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>). The lack of autophagic activity of 4-dmH prompted us to explore apoptosis, which is a cell death-related pathway previously reported to be triggered by a different heliomycin derivative in bladder cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lin et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nadysev et al., 2018</xref>). Interestingly, we found that 2 Î¼M of 4-dmH, but not the parental heliomycin, effectively triggered JC-1 staining; this denotes a loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), which is an indicator of apoptosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>). The heliomycin-induced autophagy was accompanied by upregulation of autophagy markers, ULK1, Atg5/Atg7, and cleaved LC3-II, but downregulation of Bcl-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref> top). The ineffective apoptosis by heliomycin was evidenced by the downregulation of pro-apoptotic Bak and Puma and a lack of caspases 3-directed PARP cleavage and c-Flip downregulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref> bottom). Alternatively, the water-soluble 4-dmH upregulated Bax, Noxa, Puma, and PARP cleavage; this suggested the possible relevance of a p53-dependent apoptotic pathway in these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>). Noteworthily, the 4-dmH-induced downregulation of SIRT1 was concurrent with an increase in c-Myc acetylation, leading to downregulation of anti-apoptotic c-Flip in p53-mutated HSC-3 cells, suggesting the possible involvement of a p53-independent pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref> right). The absence of upregulation of ULK1, Atg 5, Atg7, and cleaved LC3-II provided evidence for the inadequate autophagy by 4-dmH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref> bottom).</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Heliomycin and 4-dmH provoked different cell death pathways in oral cancer cells.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Cells were exposed to heliomycin or 4-dmH and the percentage of the autophagic population was determined by AO staining using flow cytometry.

Being an NAD<sup>+</sup>-dependent protein deacetylase, SIRT1 activity is primarily governed by NAD<sup>+</sup>/NADH ratio, thus, there exists a positive correlation between these two (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mouchiroud et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">He et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Donmez, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Teertam and Phanithi, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Li et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bai et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ma et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fulco et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Yang et al., 2022</xref>).

The discrepancy in their ability to reduce NAD<sup>+</sup> generation led us to explore the role of a tumor-associated NADH oxidase (tNOX, ENOX2) in 4-dmH-suppressed SIRT1 and apoptosis induction. We have previously reported that tNOX inhibition reduced the intracellular NAD<sup>+</sup>/NADH ratio and SIRT1 deacetylase activity, increasing p53 acetylation and apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tikhomirov et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lin et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2017</xref>). In the light of this information, we assessed the effect of the compounds on tNOX expression and found that 4-dmH, but not heliomycin, considerably diminished tNOX protein expression in a concentration-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7b</xref>). Pretreatment with the proteasome inhibitor, MG-132, competently recovered the tNOX downregulation triggered by 1 or 2 Î¼M 4-dmH in both cell lines, suggesting that the proteasomal degradation pathway may be associated with 4-dmH-mediated tNOX downregulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7c</xref>).

The simulated protein structures appear slightly different from the original tNOX structure. Overall, the root mean square difference between the original tNOX structure and the structures with residues substituted by alanine or glycine amino acids was estimated at 3.339 or 4.024 angstroms (Ã), respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9âfigure supplement 1a</xref>). The simulated protein structures were also employed to conduct the docking analysis for 4-dmH. The results of further docking analysis revealed that 4-dmH could bind within the same pocket of different types of tNOX structures but with varying orientations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9âfigure supplement 1b</xref>). This observation also suggests that the replacement of both key residues with alanine or glycine could result in a reduction of the binding affinity of 4-dmH to tNOX, with values of â8.2 and â7.6 kcal/mol, respectively. Moreover, the substitution of both key residues with alanine or glycine also reduces the number of the original interacting residues and interaction forces in core moieties in the 4-dmH-tNOX complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9âfigure supplement 1c and d</xref>). Together, our experimental results and molecular docking simulations are consistent with the notion that 4-dmH possesses a better affinity ability for tNOX than for SIRT1.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>4-dmH exhibits greater therapeutic efficacy in vivo</title><p>Given our observations indicating that SIRT1 and tNOX are cellular target(s) for heliomycin or 4-dmH, we next investigated the therapeutic effects of these compounds in vivo. Mice were inoculated with SAS cells, and tumor-bearing animals (average tumor diameter 0.5â1 cm) were randomly split into three groups and intratumorally injected with buffer, 200 Î¼g heliomycin in water, or 200 Î¼g 4-dmH in vehicle buffer. We found that 4-dmH treatment yielded a significant reduction in tumor sizes at day 6, and continued to do so until animals were terminated at day 10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10a</xref>). By comparison, heliomycin treatment appeared to be less effective in diminishing tumor growth compared to 4-dmH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10a and b</xref>). Protein analysis of mouse tumor tissues further showed that 4-dmH exhibited greater inhibition of tNOX expression compared to heliomycin, but the two compounds were similar in their abilities to downregulate SIRT1 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10c</xref>). Interestingly, tNOX knockdown was reported to partially attenuate SIRT1 expression and repressed growth in various cancer cell types, such as lung (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lee et al., 2015</xref>), bladder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lin et al., 2016</xref>), and stomach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2017</xref>). We also observed that tNOX is acetylated/ubiquitinated under certain stresses and the SIRT1 depletion affects tNOX expression (data not shown). It is speculated that SIRT1 deacetylates tNOX and modulates its protein stability. Thus, there is a reciprocal regulation between tNOX and SIRT1. Although heliomycin does not bind to tNOX, its inhibition of SIRT1 activity/expression might have an impact on tNOX expression. Consistent with our in vitro data, heliomycin enhanced the levels of autophagy-associated markers, such as Atg 5, Atg 7 and cleaved LC3. 4-dmH treatment was associated in vivo with upregulations of pro-apoptotic Bak and caspase 3-directed PARP cleavage, and the concurrent downregulation of anti-apoptotic Flip (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10c</xref>), suggesting that the greater inhibition of tumor volume by this water-soluble derivative of heliomycin was related to apoptosis induction.</p><fig id="fig10" position="float"><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><title>Therapeutic potential of heliomycin and 4-dmH in oral cancer.</title><p>(<bold>aâc</bold>) In a tumor-bearing mouse xenograft model, control mice were intratumorally injected with vehicle buffer and treatment group mice were intratumorally treated with heliomycin or 4-dmH as described in the Methods.

Protein analysis of tissues from oral cancer patients indicated that both tNOX and SIRT1 were upregulated in four out of five tumor samples compared to their adjacent normal tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10d</xref>). Data mining in the Kaplan-Meier plotter (pan-cancer RNA-seq dataset; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.kmplot.com/">https://www.kmplot.com/</ext-link>), revealed that high tNOX expression was associated with a poor prognosis for overall survival [hazard ratio (HR): 2.81, log-rank p=0.008] among 78 stage-III head-neck cancer patients. The median overall survival in the low tNOX expression cohort was 213.9 months, compared to 28.7 months in the high tNOX expression cohort (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10e</xref>). However, we did not find any significant correlation between tNOX and the survival rate in the earlier stages of the disease. The expression of SIRT1 did not appear to significantly contribute to predicting overall survival at any stage of head-neck cancer.</p><p>In sum, we herein show that in addition to targeting SIRT1, as does its parental heliomycin, the enhanced water solubility and preferential targeting of tNOX by 4-dmH grants it superior therapeutic value compared to heliomycin. Upon this binding, tNOX is ubiquitinylated and degraded, which in turn attenuates signaling by the tNOX-NAD<sup>+</sup>-SIRT1 regulatory axis and induces apoptosis in oral cancer cells, as evidenced by the results of in vitro and in vivo studies.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Oral cancers, a disease of epithelial origin, are commonly found in the lining of the lips, mouth, and upper throat. The updated data in GLOBOCAN 2020 estimated that there were nearly 0.38 million new cases and over 0.17 million deaths worldwide from cancers in the lip and oral cavity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sung et al., 2021</xref>). Unfortunately, the prognosis and 5-year overall survival of oral cancer patients remain disappointing, despite countless efforts to improve early diagnosis and expand treatment options (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">SievilÃ¤inen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lacas et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carvalho et al., 2005</xref>). In conjunction with surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy, targeted therapy has emerged as a promising therapy for oral cancers, such as by targeting proteins that are overexpressed in cancer cells (e.g. EGFR and PD1; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Li et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cheng et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cao et al., 2022</xref>). In this regard, we explored the possibility of the antibiotic heliomycin and a water-soluble heliomycin derivative as therapeutic strategies and identified their cellular targets. Here, we report that the water-soluble heliomycin derivative, 4-dmH exhibits a higher affinity for tNOX compared to its parental heliomycin, and that tNOX has a stronger affinity than SIRT1 for the 4-dmH. In addition to the action of 4-dmH on SIRT1, its preferential targeting of tNOX resulted in greater therapeutic efficacy in diminishing oral cancer cell proliferation and inhibiting tumor growth by inhibiting tNOX activity, increasing its protein degradation, and ultimately provoking apoptosis in p53-functional and p53-mutated oral cancer systems (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10f</xref>).</p><p>Heliomycin (also called resistomycin) was originally isolated from marine sponges and shown to possess a wide range of activities, including HDAC inhibitor activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abdelfattah et al., 2018</xref>). HDAC inhibitors are currently under investigation for playing important roles in cancer epigenetic pathways, exhibiting antitumor activity, and decreasing tumor resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Basha and Basavarajaiah, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sun et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Contreras-SanzÃ³n et al., 2022</xref>).

SIRT1, which belongs to class III of the HDAC super-family, has the unique feature of being NAD<sup>+</sup>-dependent; it contributes to inflammatory oral diseases and oral cancer by modulating many transcription factors and antioxidant enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Pan et al., 2022</xref>). In the present study, we observed upregulation of SIRT1 in tumor tissues of animals and oral cancer patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). However, data mining using a pan-cancer RNA-seq dataset (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.kmplot.com/">https://www.kmplot.com/</ext-link>) suggests that SIRT1 expression does not have significant importance in predicting overall survival at any stage of head-neck cancer. A potential correlation between SIRT1 expression and prognosis for head-neck cancer may warrant further discussion. Using molecular docking simulations and cell-based studies, we herein demonstrated that both 4-dmH and heliomycin targeted SIRT1 and inhibited its activity and expression, to attenuate the growth of oral cancer cells. Given that SIRT1 contributes to a complex regulatory network, it is of primary importance to understand the fundamental regulatory mechanisms of SIRT1 in cell death regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wang et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wang et al., 2021a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lee et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Zhu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ran et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Being an NAD<sup>+</sup>-dependent protein deacetylase, it is not surprising that SIRT1 activity is primarily governed by NAD<sup>+</sup>/NADH ratio (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mouchiroud et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">He et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Donmez, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Teertam and Phanithi, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Li et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bai et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ma et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fulco et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Yang et al., 2022</xref>). We further investigated the molecular events underlying the prominent inhibition of intracellular NAD<sup>+</sup>/NADH ratio by 4-dmH, but not heliomycin. tNOX functions as a terminal hydroquinone oxidase, catalyzing not simply the oxidation of the reduced form of NADH but also the transfer of protons and electrons to molecular oxygen across the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hostetler et al., 2009</xref>). tNOX exhibits relatively low expression in non-transformed cells, but is highly correlated with the hallmarks of cancer cells; positively regulates cell proliferation, and its downregulation is associated with cell-death-related pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hostetler et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sumiyoshi et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Liu et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Ronconi et al., 2016</xref>). In recent years, efforts to target tNOX with RNA interference or conventional anticancer drugs have shown promising results in reducing cancer, not just in cell-based functional studies but also in animals inoculated with cancer cells of colon cancer and melanoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Liu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Islam et al., 2021</xref>). Specifically, tNOX-depletion in cancer cells abolishes cancer phenotypes, reducing NAD<sup>+</sup> production, proliferation, and migration/invasion while increasing apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lee et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Liu et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cheng et al., 2016</xref>). Here, we report consistent findings in oral cancer cells, validating the essential role of tNOX in cell death regulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7e</xref>). Moreover, tNOX-overexpressing in non-cancerous cells stimulates the growth of cells, decreases doubling time, and enhances cell migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Islam et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Su et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Zeng et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chueh et al., 2004</xref>). We further substantiated the clinical relevance of tNOX in oral cancer by showing that the majority of our oral cancer patients exhibit higher tNOX protein expression in tumor tissues compared to their normal counterparts and there is a reverse correlation between tNOX expression and overall survival in a Kaplan-Meier analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). Given that tNOX contributes to regulating SIRT1 activity, we propose that tNOX targeting is a better operational strategy for reducing cancer growth in both in vitro and in vivo studies.</p><p>Another significant finding of this study is the cellular thermal shift as analysis (CETSA)-based results showing the direct binding capacities of heliomycin and 4-dmH toward SIRT1 and tNOX. Moreover, 4-dmH and doxorubicin have very similar predicted affinities for tNOX protein. Based on our previous report, we postulated that the NADH-binding motif of tNOX is located within the range from Gly590 to Leu595 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chueh et al., 2002</xref>). However, our simulation results indicated that the binding site of the studied compounds is located well away from the NADH-binding motif of the tNOX protein. The consistent interacting residues involved in the hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions of the studied compounds were predicted to be Ile90, Lys98, Pro111, Pro113, Leu115, Pro117, and Pro118 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9D</xref>), which are not located in the NADH-binding motif. At this point, we are uncertain of the exact mechanism(s) by which these compounds inhibit tNOX. However, we speculate that the hydrophobic moieties and extra hydrogen bonds formed between 4-dmH or doxorubicin and the interacting residues of tNOX protein might affect its substrate binding. To clarify this issue, further efforts involving the co-crystallization of tNOX/inhibitor complexes are warranted.</p><p>Taken together, our present results show that the superior anticancer activity of 4-dmH over its parental heliomycin resides in its direct targeting of tNOX and SIRT1, and suggest that the tNOX-NAD<sup>+</sup>-SIRT1 regulatory axis contributes to inducing apoptosis independent of p53 status, as evidenced by the results of in vitro and in vivo studies of oral cancer.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In conclusion, we focused on the identification and validation of the intracellular targets of heliomycin and its water-soluble derivative, 4-dmH, by CETSA and molecular docking simulations in p53-functional SAS and p53-mutated HSC-3 oral cancer cells.

In addition to targeting SIRT1, as does its parental heliomycin, the enhanced water solubility of 4-dmH can maximize its anticancer effects and inhibit cooperatively tNOX and SIRT1 to induce apoptosis in oral cancer cells independent of their p53 status. Considering that tNOX not only supports but also exerts functions independent of SIRT1, the tNOX- and SIRT1-inhibiting function of 4-dmH, thus, results in the different biological outcomes from the SIRT1-binding heliomycin, as evidenced by the results of in vitro and in vivo studies of oral cancer.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Materials</title><p>The anti-SIRT1 (# 2496), anti-Atg5 (# 2630), anti-ULK1 (# 6439), anti-LC3 (# 4108), anti-PARP (# 9542), anti-Bak (# 12105), anti-Bax (# 2772), anti-Puma (# 4976), anti-Noxa (# 14766), anti-Bcl2 (# 15071), anti-c-Flip (# 56343), anti-c-Myc (# 5605), HA-tag (# 3724), and anti-cleaved caspase-3 (# 9661) antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology, Inc (Beverly, MA, USA).

The samples were subjected to three freeze-thaw cycles, wherein they were exposed to liquid nitrogen for 3 min, placed in a heating block at 25 Â°C for 3 min, and vortexed briefly. The samples were then heated at 54 Â°C for 3 min and cooled for 3 min at room temperature. Insoluble proteins were separated by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 Â°C, and the supernatants (containing soluble proteins) were subjected to SDS-PAGE and western blot analysis using an antibody against SIRT1 or antisera to tNOX. Î²-Actin was used as a loading control.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Western blot analysis and immunoprecipitation</title><p>Cell extracts were prepared in the lysis buffer described above. Volumes of extract containing equal amounts of proteins (40 Âµg) were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membranes (Schleicher &amp; Schuell, Keene, NH, USA), and the membranes were blocked, washed, and probed with the indicated primary antibody overnight. The membranes were washed, incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 hr, and developed using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) reagents (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ, USA) according to the manufacturerâs protocol.</p><p>For immunoprecipitation, protein extracted from cells grown in 100 mm dishes were pre-cleared with 20 Î¼l of Protein G Agarose Beads (for rabbit antibodies) for 1 hr at 4 Â°C with rotation. Ubiquitin antibodies or control IgG were incubated onto beads in 500 Î¼l of lysis buffer, overnight with rotation at 4 Â°C. Beads were precipitated by centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 2 min at 4 Â°C. Beads were washed three times with lysis buffer and samples were prepared for western blotting analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Determination of SIRT1 deacetylase activity in vitro</title><p>SIRT1 deacetylase activity was determined using a SIRT1 Direct Fluorescent Screening Assay Kit (Cayman Chemical Company, Ann Arbor, MI) according to the manufacturerâs protocol. Briefly, substrate solution was prepared by adding 240 Î¼l of NAD<sup>+</sup> solution and 850 Î¼l of diluted Assay Buffer to 15 Î¼l of the p53 peptide Arg-His-Lys-Lys(Îµacetyl)-AMC, to yield a final concentration of 125 Î¼M peptide (substrate) and 3 mM of NAD<sup>+</sup>. Using a 96-well plate, the background was determined in wells containing 30 Î¼l of Assay Buffer and 5 Î¼l of DMSO. Maximal initial activity (defined as 100%) was determined in wells containing 5 Î¼l of diluted human recombinant SIRT1, 25 Î¼l of Assay Buffer, and 5 Î¼l of DMSO. To measure the ability of the test compound to modulate SIRT1 activity, 5 Î¼l of 2 Î¼Î compound was added to wells containing 25 Î¼l of Assay Buffer and 5 Î¼l of diluted human recombinant SIRT1. Reactions were initiated by adding 15 Î¼l of Substrate Solution to each well. The plate was then covered and incubated on a shaker for 45 min at room temperature. Reactions were stopped by adding 50 Î¼l of Stop/Developing Solution to each well and incubating the plate for 30 min at room temperature. Plates were read in a fluorimeter using an excitation wavelength of 350â360 nm and an emission wavelength of 450â465 nm.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Measurement of the intracellular NAD<sup>+</sup>/NADH ratio</title><p>The oxidized and reduced forms of intracellular NAD were determined using an NADH/NAD Quantification Kit (BioVision Inc Milpitas, CA, USA), as described by the manufacturer. Briefly, 2Ã10<sup>5</sup> cells were washed with cold PBS, pelleted, and extracted by two freeze/thaw cycles with 400 Âµl of NADH/NAD<sup>+</sup> extraction buffer. The samples were vortexed and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 5 min. The extracted NADH/NAD<sup>+</sup>-containing supernatant (200 Âµl) was transferred to a microcentrifuge tube, heated to 60 Â°C for 30 min (to decompose NAD<sup>+</sup> but not NADH), and then placed on ice. The samples were then centrifuged and transferred to a multiwell plate. Standards and an NAD<sup>+</sup> cycling mix were prepared according to the manufacturerâs protocol. The reaction mix was distributed at 100 Âµl/well to wells of a 96-well plate pre-loaded with NADH standards and samples, and the plate was incubated at room temperature for 5 min to convert NAD<sup>+</sup> to NADH. The provided NADH developer solution was added to each well, and plates were incubated at room temperature for 15 or 30 min. The reaction was stopped with 10 Âµl of stop solution per well, and absorbance was measured at 450 nm.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Molecular docking simulation</title><p>A crystal structure of the SIRT1 catalytic domain bound to an EX-527 analog (PDB: 4I5I) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Zhao et al., 2013</xref>) was employed for our molecular docking study. EX-527 is a nanomolar SIRT1 inhibitor with an IC<sub>50</sub> value as low as 38 nM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Solomon et al., 2006</xref>); therefore its co-crystal structure of SIRT1 protein was judged to be suitable for our docking analysis. The water molecule and ligand molecule of the initial crystal structure were removed using the PyMOL program (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pymol.org/">https://pymol.org/</ext-link>; accessed on 1 November 2022; PyMOL Molecular Graphics System, Schrodinger, New York, NY) to prepare for the docking analysis. A predicted full-length structure of the tNOX protein was obtained from the AlphaFold Protein Structure Database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jumper et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Varadi et al., 2022</xref>) and used in this study. Molecular docking was performed using the AutoDock Vina package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Trott and Olson, 2010</xref>) in the PyRx software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dallakyan and Olson, 2015</xref>) to assess the probable binding modes of heliomycin and its derivative in the SIRT1 catalytic domain and the protein structure of tNOX. The docking site was determined according to the inhibitor binding site of the EX-527 analog in the crystal structure of SIRT1, which was used as the setting in the grid selection. Because we lacked information about the ligand-bound pocket, blind docking was performed by adopting the whole-protein structure of tNOX, as the grid selection. Each compound was optimized in its molecular geometry, torsional barriers, and intermolecular-interaction geometry using the MMFF94 forcefield in CHARMM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brooks et al., 2009</xref>). The best docking conformation of each compound, which was chosen based on the lowest binding energy, was employed in the interaction analyses. The interaction diagram was generated using the LigPlot +software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Laskowski and Swindells, 2011</xref>) to display the hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic moieties. The docking pose of each compound was visualized using the PyMOL program.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Homology modeling of tNOX protein structure</title><p>To evaluate the impact of key interacting residues derived from post-docking analysis, the key residues on the tNOX protein were substituted with alanine or glycine amino acid and then conducted the protein structure simulation. The tNOX structure from the AlphaFold database was used as a template during these processes. The 3D structures of the modified tNOX protein sequences were homology-modeled using the I-TASSER standalone package version 5.2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Yang et al., 2015</xref>) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://zhanggroup.org/I-TASSER/download/">https://zhanggroup.org/I-TASSER/download/</ext-link>) with default parameters. The simulated structures were also applied in the molecular docking study to assess possible binding affinity and binding modes between 4-dmH and the modified tNOX protein.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>In vivo xenograft studies</title><p>Specific pathogen-free (SPF) ASID mice were purchased from the National Laboratory Animal Center (Taipei, Taiwan). The animal use protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of National Chung Hsing University (Taichung, Taiwan) (IACUC No. 108â127). Mice were subcutaneously inoculated with 100 Î¼l containing 2Ã10<sup>6</sup> live SAS cells in PBS. The tumor-bearing animals were randomized divided into three groups (n=4 per group) when the tumor mass reached an average diameter of 0.5â1 cm. Mice were intratumorally injected with vehicle buffer (20% DMSO in PBS) as untreated control (Vehicle group), with 200 Î¼g heliomycin in vehicle buffer (Heliomycin group), with 200 Î¼g 4-dmH in vehicle buffer (4-dmH group). Intratumoral therapy was performed three times at 1 week intervals. The tumor size was recorded every 2 days and the tumor volume was calculated using the formula: length Ã width<sup>2</sup>Ã0.5. Mice were euthanized 4 days after the final treatment. The significance of differences in tumor size was determined by a one-way ANOVA.</p></sec><sec id="s4-17"><title>Patient specimens</title><p>Five pairs of cancer tissues and their corresponding normal counterparts were obtained from Changhua Christian Hospital in Taiwan (CCH IRB No. 130616).

Here, they show that one of the analogs, 4-dmH, binds to tNOX, a NADH oxidase which supports SirT1 activity, in addition to SirT1, while heliomycin only binds to SirtT1 but not tNOX, using CETSA and in silico molecular docking studies, in human oral cancer cells. The additional binding activity of 4-dmH to tNOX might explain the different biological outcome from heliomycin. 4-dmH induces ubiquitination and degradation of tNOX protein, in dependent of p53 status. The tumor suppressive effect of 4-dmH (by intra-tumoral injections) is better than heliomycin. TCGA data base analysis suggests that high tNOX mRNA expression is correlated with poor prognosis of oral cancer patients.</p><p>This group has been a leading lab of chemical and biological characterization of heliomycin and its analogs. Their findings are interesting and advance their previous findings. The revised manuscript well responded to the reviewers' concerns.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.87873.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author Response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Islam</surname><given-names>Atikul</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>National Chung Hsing University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Taichung</named-content></addr-line><country>Taiwan</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Chang</surname><given-names>Yu-Chun</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>National Chung Hsing University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Taichung</named-content></addr-line><country>Taiwan</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Xiao-Chi</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>National Chung Hsing University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Taichung</named-content></addr-line><country>Taiwan</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Weng</surname><given-names>Chia-Wei</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>National Chung Hsing University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Taichung</named-content></addr-line><country>Taiwan</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Chien-Yu</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>National Chung Hsing University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Taichung</named-content></addr-line><country>Taiwan</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Che-Wei</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>National Chung Hsing University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Taichung</named-content></addr-line><country>Taiwan</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Mu-Kuan</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Changhua Christian Hospital</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Changhua</named-content></addr-line><country>Taiwan</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Tikhomirov</surname><given-names>Alexander S</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Gause Institute of New Antibiotics Russian Academy of Medical Sciences</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Moscow</named-content></addr-line><country>Russian Federation</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Shchekotikhin</surname><given-names>Andrey E</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Gause Institute of New Antibiotics Russian Academy of Medical Sciences</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Moscow</named-content></addr-line><country>Russian Federation</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Chueh</surname><given-names>Pin Ju</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>National Chung Hsing University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Taichung</named-content></addr-line><country>Taiwan</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authorsâ response to the original reviews.</p><p>Responses to reviewersâ comments</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(1) The rationale of selecting tNOX/ENOX2 as a potential target of 4-dmH, but not heliomycin, is unclear by taking a biased approach. Thus, there is high possibility that 4-dmH binds to other proteins involved in apoptosis inhibition. An unbiased screen to identify 4-dmH-binding proteins would be a better approach unless there is a clear and logical rationale.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for this oversight. In response to this comment, we rewrote the abstract, reorganized the results, and added more references to better introduce tNOX/ENOX2.</p><p>A) Under the â4-dmH, but not heliomycin, targets intracellular tNOX, an upstream regulator of SIRT1â result section:</p><p>We next addressed the molecular mechanisms underlying SIRT1 inhibition and concurrent cell death by these two compounds in oral cancer cells. Being an NAD+-dependent protein deacetylase, SIRT1 activity is primarily governed by NAD+/NADH ratio, thus, there exists a positive correlation between these two [1-9]. We then questioned whether these two compounds inhibit SIRT1 by affecting the intracellular NAD+/NADH levels, and were surprised to find that 4-dmH, but not heliomycin, caused a prominent inhibition of intracellular NAD+/NADH ratio (revised Fig. 7a). The discrepancy in their ability to reduce NAD+ generation led us to explore the role of a tumor-associated NADH oxidase (tNOX, ENOX2) in 4-dmH-suppressed SIRT1 and apoptosis induction. We have previously reported that tNOX inhibition reduced the intracellular NAD+/NADH ratio and SIRT1 deacetylase activity, increasing p53 acetylation and apoptosis [10-13]. In the light of this information, we assessed the effect of the compounds on tNOX expression and found that 4-dmH, but not heliomycin, considerably diminished tNOX protein expression in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 7b).</p><p>B) To demonstrate that our results from ligand-binding assays (CETSA) were specific to tNOX, we conducted more CETSA experiments to exclude PARP or NOX4 targets of 4-dmH. PARP acts as a DNA damage sensor and also a NAD+-consuming enzyme, affecting many cellular functions [14]. NOX4 belongs to the NOX family of NADPH oxidases that mediate electron transport through intracellular membranes and is also shown to be involved in tumorigenesis [15, 16]. We show that 4-dmH treatments did not seem to increase the melting temperature of PARP or NOX4, excluding those two proteins as potential targets of 4-dmH (revised Fig. 8c).</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-87873-sa2-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The authors should show whether heliomycin indeed does not induce apoptosis, while 4-dmH cannot induce autophagy.</p></disp-quote><p>We have reorganized and revised our manuscript and figures (Fig. 5 and Fig. 6) to better demonstrate the different cell death pathways associated with heliomycin and 4-dmH. Using flow cytometry, we show that heliomycin, but not 4-dmH, induced autophagy in two lines of oral cancer cells (Fig. 5a). In the revision, we moved up the analysis of apoptosis by JC-1 staining to Figure 5 (revised Fig. 5b). We also reorganized the protein analysis to demonstrate better the downregulation of pro-apoptotic Bak and Puma and a lack of caspase 3-directed PARP cleavage, indicating the ineffective apoptosis by heliomycin (revised Fig. 5c). Similarly, we found that the absence of upregulation of ULK1, Atg 5, Atg7, and cleaved LC3-II provided evidence for the inadequate autophagy by 4-dmH (revised Fig. 5d).

Our results indicate that the tNOX-depletion effectively provoked spontaneous apoptosis and autophagy in SAS cells (revised Fig. 7e). However, given that SIRT1 per se is not the focus of this present study and SIRT1-knockdown has been shown to increase apoptotic population by other groups [17] [18], we decided not to pursue it further.</p><fig id="sa2fig3" position="float"><label>Author response image 3.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-87873-sa2-fig3-v1.tif"/></fig><p>B) In our earlier studies, we have adequately demonstrated that tNOX confers a survival advantage for cancer cells. For example, tNOX-deficiency by RNA interference in cancer cells abolishes cancer phenotypes, reducing NAD+ production, proliferation, and migration/invasion while increasing apoptosis [19-22]. On the other hand, tNOX-overexpressing in non-cancerous cells stimulates the growth of cells, decreases doubling time, and enhances cell migration [23-26].</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) The authors should examine whether overexpression of SirT1 or tNOX in cells treated with heliomycin or 4-dmH could nullify heliomycin-induced autophagy and 4-dmH-induced apoptosis. Also, instead of overexpressing tNOX, they can supplement NAD into cells treated with 4-dmH.</p></disp-quote><p>A) The utilization of tNOX overexpression has been previously reported in several studies, demonstrating that tNOX-overexpressing in non-cancerous cells stimulates the growth of cells, decreases doubling time, and enhances cell migration [23-26]. However, in our experiences, the effect of tNOX overexpression in cancer cells is much less apparent than that in non-cancerous cells. Thus, we decided not to study it further, given that our results from tNOX knockdown have evidently signified the role of tNOX in the regulation of apoptosis and autophagy.</p><p>B) Since SIRT1 is not the major focus of this present study and SIRT1-overexpression has been shown to reduce stress-mediated apoptosis by other groups [27, 28], we decided not to pursue it further.</p><p>C) The systemic deterioration in NAD+ level has been correlated with many diseases and aging [29-31]. In this regard, NAD+ administration was reported to attenuate doxorubicin-induced apoptosis in the liver of mice, suggesting a protective effect [32]. The administration of nicotinamide riboside (NR), a precursor of NAD+, was also demonstrated to prevent ROS generation and apoptosis in the mouse sepsis models [33]. With data from these animal studies already demonstrating the benefits of NAD+ supplements, we decided not to conduct similar experiments in a cell-based setting.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) Related to Fig. 5C and 6a, the authors should examine the effects of heliomycin and 4-dmH on the cell cycle profiles, Annexin V positivity, and colony formation.</p></disp-quote><p>We added the results from colony-forming assays and revealed that both compounds exhibited high growth-suppressive ability against oral cancer cells (revised Fig. 6c). Nevertheless, we showed that the diminution in growth by the compounds was least likely to arise from cell cycle arrest mediated by these two compounds (revised Fig. 6d). Due to the possible interference of the fluorescence wavelength of heliomycin/derivative, we examined JC-1 staining rather than Annexin V positivity. The apoptotic effect of the compounds was demonstrated in revised Fig. 5b in the revision.</p><fig id="sa2fig4" position="float"><label>Author response image 4.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-87873-sa2-fig4-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) They should also examine whether either or both heliomycin and 4-dmH induce reactive oxygen species (ROS).</p></disp-quote><p>In our previous report, we examined the effects of heliomycin and 4-dmH on oxidative stress utilizing H2DCFDA [34]. The dye fluoresces in the presence of intracellularly generated reactive oxygen species (ROS). We showed that 4-dmH significantly induced the generation of ROS generation. However, no marked ROS generation was observed in cells exposed to heliomycin.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) Related to Fig. 9d, they should mutate amino acid residue(s) in tNOX that are crucial for the 4-dmH-tNOX binding, including Ile 90, Lys98, Pro111, Pro113, Leu115, Pro117, and Pro118, to examine whether these mutants lose the binding to 4-dmH and fail to rescue 4-dmH-induced apoptosis, unlike wild-type tNOX.</p></disp-quote><p>For further evaluation of the importance of the consistent interaction residues in the three docked compound-tNOX complexes, the seven interaction residues on tNOX were substituted with alanine or glycine amino acids and then simulated the protein structures. The simulated protein structures appear slightly different from the original tNOX structure. Overall, the root mean square difference between the original tNOX structure and the structures with residues substituted by alanine or glycine amino acids was estimated at 3.339 or 4.024 angstroms (Ã), respectively (Fig. S1a). The simulated protein structures were also employed to conduct the docking analysis for 4-dmH. The results of further docking analysis revealed that 4-dmH could bind within the same pocket of different types of tNOX structures but with varying orientations (Fig. S1b). This observation also suggests that the replacement of both key residues with alanine or glycine could result in a reduction of the binding affinity of 4-dmH to tNOX, with values of -8.2 and -7.6 kcal/mol, respectively. Moreover, the substitution of both key residues with alanine or glycine also reduces the number of the original interacting residues and interaction forces in core moieties in the 4-dmH-tNOX complexes (Fig. S1c and S1d). Together, our experimental results and molecular docking simulations are consistent with the notion that 4-dmH possesses a better affinity ability for tNOX than for SIRT1.</p><fig id="sa2fig5" position="float"><label>Author response image 5.</label><caption><title>The simulated tNOX structures (a, b) and the binding modes of 4-dmH after docking study (c, d).</title><p>(a) Superimposition of three types of tNOX structures, including the original tNOX structure (orange) and the critical residues in tNOX protein substituted with alanine (magenta) or glycine (cyan).

They should compare the effects of heliomycin and 4-dmH on reducing the protein levels of tNOX. If heliomycin does not change the tNOX protein levels, then they need to discuss why heliomycin reduces tNOX levels in vivo.</p></disp-quote><p>In our previous studies, we have shown that tNOX knockdown partially attenuates SIRT1 expression and represses growth in various cancer cell types, such as lung [22], bladder [20], and stomach [13]. We also observed that tNOX is acetylated/ubiquitinated under certain stresses and SIRT1 depletion affects tNOX expression (data not shown). It is speculated that SIRT1 deacetylates tNOX and modulates its protein stability. Thus, there is a reciprocal regulation between tNOX and SIRT1. Although heliomycin does not bind to tNOX, its inhibition of SIRT1 activity/expression might also have an impact on tNOX expression.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(9) Related to Fig. 10F, if tNOX is an upstream regulator of SirT1 and both heliomycin and 4-dmH ultimately target SirT1, it is unclear why heliomycin and 4-dmH cause different biological outcomes. One explanation is that tNOX has apoptosis-inhibiting function other than supporting (or independent of) SirT1 and hence 4-dmH-mediated tNOX inhibition causes apoptosis rather than autophagy. They should explain and discuss more about whether tNOX-inhibiting/binding function of 4-dmH is sufficient to explain the different biological outcomes from heliomycin.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this valuable suggestion. Indeed, in our earlier studies, we have adequately demonstrated that tNOX-deficiency by RNA interference in cancer cells abolishes cancer phenotypes, reducing NAD+ production, proliferation, and migration/invasion while increasing apoptosis; thus, tNOX confers a survival advantage for cancer cells [19-22]. On the other hand, tNOX-overexpressing in non-cancerous cells stimulates the growth of cells, decreases doubling time, and enhances cell migration [23-26]. With these lines of evidence, we believe that tNOX not only supports but also exerts functions independent of SIRT1. The tNOX- and SIRT1-inhibiting function of 4-dmH, thus, results in the different biological outcomes from the SIRT1-binding heliomycin.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(10) They should examine the effects of heliomycin and 4-dmH on cell viability of non-tumor cells to examine their toxicities.</p></disp-quote><p>Using cell impedance measurements, we also examined the effects of heliomycin and 4-dmH on the proliferation of human non-cancerous BEAS-2B cells. Our results demonstrated that heliomycin did not exhibit cytotoxicity toward human non-cancerous BEAS-2B cells (revised Fig. 6a). Furthermore, the water-soluble 4-dmH effectively diminished cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner in oral cancer cells, but much less apparent in that of BEAS-2B cells (revised Fig. 6b). Similar results were reported in our previous study, indicating that 4-dmH displayed much higher IC50 values against non-cancerous human dermal microvascular endothelium HMEC-1 cells compared to those of tumor cells [34].</p><fig id="sa2fig6" position="float"><label>Author response image 6.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-87873-sa2-fig6-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(11) They should consistently use either tNOX or ENOX2 to avoid confusion.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the suggestion.
