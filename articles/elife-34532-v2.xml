In yeast, this proteaphagy occurs upon nitrogen starvation but not carbon starvation, which instead stimulates the rapid sequestration of proteasomes into cytoplasmic puncta termed proteasome storage granules (PSGs). Here, we show that PSGs help protect proteasomes from autophagic degradation. Both the core protease and regulatory particle sub-complexes are sequestered separately into PSGs via pathways dependent on the accessory proteins Blm10 and Spg5, respectively. Modulating PSG formation, either by perturbing cellular energy status or pH, or by genetically eliminating factors required for granule assembly, not only influences the rate of proteasome degradation, but also impacts cell viability upon recovery from carbon starvation. PSG formation and concomitant protection against proteaphagy also occurs in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, suggesting that PSGs represent an evolutionarily conserved cache of proteasomes that can be rapidly re-mobilized based on energy availability.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34532.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Proteins perform many jobs within an organism, including providing structure and support, and protecting against infection. The levels of the many proteins in a cell need to be carefully controlled so that the correct amounts are present at the right place and time to perform these tasks. This control can be achieved by balancing the production of new proteins with the break down (or degradation) of proteins that are no longer required or become dysfunctional.</p><p>Most cells have two pathways for degrading proteins. One pathway breaks down individual proteins specifically marked for elimination; this causes them to be recognized by a structure called the proteasome, which chops proteins into smaller pieces. Larger protein assemblies – including the proteasome itself – are to big for the proteasome and thus need to be degraded by another pathway called autophagy. This process engulfs and delivers parts of a cell to a membrane-bound compartment called the vacuole, which ‘digests’ and recycles these larger constituents.</p><p>Proteasomes are degraded by autophagy when they are not working correctly and when nitrogen (a crucial nutrient) is in short supply. However, proteasomes are not degraded when cells lack carbon, even though this starvation is known to activate autophagy in the same way that an absence of nitrogen does. So how do proteasomes escape degradation when cells are starved for carbon?</p><p>Marshall and Vierstra now show that upon carbon starvation, proteasomes rapidly exit the cell nucleus and cluster together in the main part of the cell (termed the cytosol). These clusters are known as proteasome storage granules (PSGs). In fungi and plants, mutations or conditions inside the cell that make it difficult for PSGs to assemble cause proteasomes to instead be broken down in the vacuole when carbon availability is low. Clustering into PSGs therefore protects proteasomes from autophagy. This clustering appears advantageous to cells; yeast cells that could form PSGs were better able to start growing again when their nutrient supply improved.</p><p>Protein clustering (also known as aggregation) is an important strategy that cells use to survive stressful conditions. However, it can also be harmful when proteins aggregate inappropriately, such as occurs in Alzheimer’s disease. Researchers may be able to use PSG assembly as a convenient model to study the causes and consequences of protein aggregation; this knowledge could ultimately be applied to improve human health and crop productivity.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>autophagy</kwd><kwd>proteasome</kwd><kwd>proteaphagy</kwd><kwd>proteasome storage granules</kwd><kwd>starvation</kwd><kwd>ubiquitin</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>A. thaliana</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000015</institution-id><institution>U.S. Department of Energy</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DE-FG02-88ER13968</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Vierstra</surname><given-names>Richard D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>IOS-1329956</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Vierstra</surname><given-names>Richard D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-GM124452-01A1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Vierstra</surname><given-names>Richard D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Proteasomes are protected from autophagic elimination upon carbon starvation by sequestration into cytoplasmic storage granules, which aid cell fitness by providing a cache of proteasomes that can be rapidly remobilized when carbon availability improves.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Protein homeostasis (proteostasis) is an essential process by which cells attempt to maintain proteome integrity by regulating protein synthesis, folding, transport and degradation. Key features are mechanisms that control the abundance of regulators necessary for developmental transitions or stress survival; re-cycle the cellular complement of amino acids; and clear mis-folded or dysfunctional proteins and protein complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hipp et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Vilchez et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Sala et al., 2017</xref>). Importantly, failure to remove aberrant proteins often allows the accumulation of cytotoxic protein aggregates that are frequent hallmarks of aging and an array of degenerative diseases collectively termed aggregation-prone pathologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Menzies et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hjerpe et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Yerbury et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Two major pathways for protein degradation in eukaryotes are the ubiquitin-26S proteasome system (UPS) and autophagy. UPS substrates are first tagged with a poly-ubiquitin chain using a highly polymorphic E1-E2-E3 enzymatic cascade, which facilitates their recognition and degradation by the 26S proteasome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Finley et al., 2012</xref>). This 2.5-MDa proteolytic machine is composed of two functionally distinct sub-complexes; the 20S core protease (CP) and the 19S regulatory particle (RP; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lander et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bhattacharyya et al., 2014</xref>). The CP houses the peptidase active sites responsible for cleaving substrates into short peptides, whereas the RP contains activities for substrate recognition, deubiquitylation, unfolding, and translocation into the CP lumen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Collins and Goldberg, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dikic, 2017</xref>).</p><p>While the UPS is exquisitely designed to catabolize proteins individually, it is often not compatible with turnover of larger protein-containing structures. Cells instead employ macroautophagy (henceforth referred to as autophagy), where portions of cytosol are engulfed by a double-membrane-bound structure termed an autophagosome, which is then delivered to the vacuole (in plants and yeast) or lysosome (in animals) for breakdown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Reggiori and Klionsky, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dikic, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Galluzzi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Marshall and Vierstra, 2018</xref>). The delivery of substrates to autophagy is driven by an array of dedicated receptors that recognize appropriate cargo and tether them to the Atg8 (or LC3) protein that coats the enveloping autophagic membrane. In this way, specific proteins, macromolecular complexes, protein aggregates, whole organelles, and even invading pathogens can be selectively eliminated. In addition, less-selective autophagy of cytoplasmic constituents in bulk is often induced upon nutrient starvation as a mechanism to replenish amino acid pools.</p><p>Besides inducing autophagy, starvation triggers global re-arrangements in cellular transcriptomes, proteomes and metabolomes that ultimately result in cessation of cell growth and entry into quiescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Laporte et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Marguerat et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Valcourt et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Honigberg, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Roche et al., 2017</xref>). ATP levels decline during the transition from proliferation to quiescence as glucose depletion restricts glycolysis and thus oxidative phosphorylation. This transition is also accompanied by a drop in intracellular pH and a reduction in protoplasmic fluidity that impacts the dynamics of soluble proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Parry et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Munder et al., 2016</xref>). Widespread re-organization of proteins into membrane-less condensates/granules is also a common phenomenon that might serve to partition, freeze, and/or protect cellular activities until growth resumes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Laporte et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Narayanaswamy et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">O'Connell et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lee et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Franzmann et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Holehouse and Pappu, 2018</xref>).</p><p>In yeast, one prominent example of cytoplasmic condensates that accumulate as cells enter into stationary phase is the re-localization of proteasomes from the nucleus into cytoplasmic foci known as proteasome storage granules (PSGs; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Laporte et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chowdhury and Enenkel, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lee et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Yedidi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gu et al., 2017</xref>). A current model proposes that proteasomes first accumulate at the inner face of the nuclear envelope, pass through the nuclear pore, and then gather in an early cytoplasmic intermediate that finally yields mature PSGs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Peters et al., 2016</xref>). The drop in ATP levels destabilizes the CP-RP interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bajorek et al., 2003</xref>), and although the CP and RP localize to the same PSGs, they are thought to be targeted by different mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Weberruss et al., 2013</xref>). Upon replenishment of the culture medium with a fresh carbon source, ATP levels rapidly increase to trigger the resumption of cell growth, the dissociation of PSGs, and the resorption of proteasomes into the nucleus, all within just a few minutes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Laporte et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>How and why PSGs assemble remains unclear. Factors influencing their formation include intracellular pH, with low pH stimulating PSG formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Peters et al., 2013</xref>), the NatB N-terminal acetylation complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">van Deventer et al., 2015</xref>), the alternative CP capping protein Blm10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Weberruss et al., 2013</xref>), and the C-terminal region of Rpn11, an intrinsic proteasomal deubiquitylase (DUB; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Saunier et al., 2013</xref>). More recently, a high-throughput screen by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gu et al. (2017)</xref> identified 45 genes required for sequestration of the CP into PSGs, 21 of which were also required for sequestration of the RP. Included were factors involved in protein ubiquitylation (including ubiquitin itself) and energy regulation. However, with the exception of Blm10 and ubiquitin, none of these proteins accumulated in PSGs, hence their role(s) in PSG formation remain largely obscure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gu et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>In addition to entering PSGs, it was recently reported that proteasomes are rapidly degraded by autophagy via a process termed proteaphagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Marshall et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Marshall et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Marshall and Vierstra, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cohen-Kaplan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Waite et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Nemec et al., 2017</xref>). Two separate pathways are evident: one that clears inactive proteasomes, and a second that responds to nitrogen deprivation. This former pathway involves the Hsp42-dependent concentration of proteasomes into another cytoplasmic granule termed the insoluble protein deposit (IPOD), extensive ubiquitylation of the particle, and then recognition by the ubiquitin-binding autophagic receptors RPN10 (in plants) or Cue5 (in yeast) for eventual deposition into autophagosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Marshall et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Marshall et al., 2016</xref>). The machinery underpinning the latter nitrogen-sensitive pathway is less resolved. Besides requiring the core autophagy system, the nutrient-responsive Atg1 kinase complex, and the sorting nexins Snx4/Atg24, Snx41 and/or Snx42 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Marshall et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Marshall et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Nemec et al., 2017</xref>), the DUB Ubp3 is needed, implying that the deubiquitylation of an unknown factor is important (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Waite et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Given the contrasting roles of PSGs and proteaphagy in controlling proteasome abundance during carbon and nitrogen starvation, respectively, we hypothesized that the two are inter-related, with the intriguing scenario that proteasomes are specifically recruited to PSGs upon carbon starvation to safeguard them from proteaphagy. Here, we tested this idea by examining a number of conditions and mutants known to impact PSG assembly, and assaying their consequences for proteaphagy. In all cases, PSG assembly and proteaphagy were antagonistic; for example, when PSG formation is blocked, proteaphagy occurs. We confirmed that Blm10 is required for incorporation of the CP into PSGs, and identified the RP-associated protein Spg5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hanna et al., 2012</xref>) as integral to the incorporation of the RP into PSGs, thus linking both to proteasome protection. Ubp3 activity is also required for carbon-starvation-induced proteaphagy in the absence of PSG formation, as it is upon nitrogen starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Waite et al., 2016</xref>). Culture growth studies revealed that the ability to form PSGs improves cell fitness, presumably by providing a cache of stored proteasomes that can be rapidly re-mobilized when carbon availability improves. Finally, we demonstrated that <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> also assembles PSGs upon fixed-carbon starvation via a process requiring the Blm10 ortholog PA200, making it highly likely that this proteasome protective granule is conserved among eukaryotes.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Proteasomes are rapidly degraded by autophagy in response to nitrogen but not carbon starvation</title><p>While yeast proteasomes undergo rapid proteaphagy in response to nitrogen starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Marshall et al., 2016</xref>), recent results from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Waite et al., 2016</xref> suggested that proteasomes are not similarly degraded in response to carbon starvation, even though both conditions activate bulk autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Takeshige et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adachi et al., 2017</xref>). To further investigate this possibility, we exploited haploid strains in which the CP subunit Pre10 (α<sub>7</sub>) or the RP subunit Rpn5 were expressed with C-terminal GFP tags. These reporters allowed us to track proteaphagy by ‘GFP-release’ immunoblot assays that detect the liberation of stable, free GFP from the fusion proteins following their autophagic transport to vacuoles, and by confocal fluorescence microscopy that visualizes the movement of GFP-tagged proteasomes from the nucleus, where over 80% of the particles reside (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Enenkel et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Russell et al., 1999</xref>), to other cellular locations such as the vacuole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Marshall et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Waite et al., 2016</xref>). Importantly, by measuring the ratio of free GFP to the fusion, and by morphometric analysis of confocal images (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>), we could quantitatively assess proteasome fates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Marshall et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Marshall et al., 2016</xref>). As shown by the GFP-release assays in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, proteasomes in wild-type cells undergo rapid proteaphagy upon nitrogen starvation, as evidenced by the accumulation of free GFP from both Pre10-GFP and Rpn5-GFP reporters, which could be seen when total cell lysates were immunoblotted with anti-GFP antibodies. Greater than 90% of both fusions disappeared within 1 day of the onset of starvation, concomitant with the strong accumulation of free GFP.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34532.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Proteasomes are rapidly degraded upon nitrogen but not carbon starvation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>, <bold>B</bold> and <bold>C</bold>) Measurement of proteaphagy upon nitrogen and/or carbon starvation by monitoring the release of free GFP from the CP and RP proteasome subunit reporters Pre10-GFP and Rpn5-GFP, respectively.

Here, free GFP was undetectable within the first 2 days, with only small amounts appearing subsequently (~8–12% after 6 days; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). This relative absence of proteaphagy occurred despite that fact that the carbon starvation regime employed here effectively suppressed culture growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>) and stimulated bulk autophagy, as judged by the increased activity of the Pho8Δ60 reporter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Noda and Klionsky, 2008</xref>) and by the release of free GFP from GFP-Atg8, which both measure autophagic flux (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B and C</xref>). This modest accumulation of free GFP seen from the Pre10-GFP and Rpn5-GFP reporters was autophagy-dependent, as it was absent in mutants eliminating the core autophagy component Atg7, or the Atg13 regulatory subunit of the Atg1 kinase complex that activates autophagy in response to nutrient deprivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Thus, proteaphagy still occurs in yeast upon carbon starvation, but at a substantially slower rate.</p><p>Surprisingly, when nitrogen and carbon starvation were combined, we found that rapid proteaphagy during nitrogen starvation was suppressed by the simultaneous lack of carbon. Although 8 hr of nitrogen starvation induced rapid clearance of proteasomes, as measured by loss of the Pre10-GFP and Rpn5-GFP reporters together with the appearance of free GFP, little to no clearance was evident in cells starved for both nitrogen and carbon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). This contrasted with other forms of selective autophagy, with the turnover of GFP-tagged substrates related to the cytoplasm-to-vacuole targeting (CVT) pathway (Ape1; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Shintani et al., 2002</xref>), pexophagy (Pex14; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Reggiori et al., 2005</xref>), ribophagy (Rpl25; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kraft et al., 2008</xref>) and, to a lesser extent, mitophagy (Om45; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kanki and Klionsky, 2008</xref>) being induced by all three starvation regimes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). For each substrate, rapid loss of the fusion concomitant with release of free GFP was readily evident upon nitrogen, carbon, or simultaneous nitrogen and carbon starvation. As an aside, we saw slightly slower mitophagy upon carbon starvation versus nitrogen starvation, in agreement with prior observations showing that the rate of mitophagy is dampened in cells exposed to non-fermentable carbon sources, presumably to maintain respiration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kanki and Klionsky, 2008</xref>). Taken together, it appears that carbon starvation selectively suppresses proteaphagy, despite up-regulating both bulk autophagy and other forms of selective autophagy.</p><p>Confocal fluorescence microscopy of cells expressing <italic>PRE10-GFP</italic> or <italic>RPN5-GFP</italic> confirmed that the rapid transport of proteasomes to the vacuole upon nitrogen starvation was indeed suppressed by simultaneous carbon starvation. Upon switching exponentially growing cells from nitrogen-rich to nitrogen-starvation medium, the GFP signals moved from a mainly nuclear localization to a diffuse vacuolar pattern within 24 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E and F</xref>). Strikingly, this relocation was not evident in cells starved for both nitrogen and carbon. Instead, the Pre10-GFP and Rpn5-GFP signals migrated toward the nuclear periphery and into brightly fluorescent, large (~0.5 μm) puncta within the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E and F</xref>). The appearance of these foci was extremely rapid, being detectable in 50% of the cells within 1 hr of carbon starvation and in 95% of the cells after 4 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A and B</xref>). The time course for entry of Pre10-GFP and Rpn5-GFP into these cytoplasmic puncta (i.e. within 1 hr) was faster than the up-regulation of bulk autophagy (at 2 to 4 hr), suggesting that formation of these foci is an early response to carbon deprivation separate from autophagy. In support, the foci were visible in a number of mutants missing factors required for autophagy initiation, including Atg1, Atg11, Atg13 and Atg17 that help scaffold the pre-autophagosomal structure (PAS), indicating that they arise independent of autophagy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>). The appearance of these foci was also rapidly reversible; upon switching starved <italic>PRE10-GFP</italic> or <italic>RPN5-GFP</italic> cells to fresh carbon-containing medium, the GFP signals returned to diffuse cytoplasmic and nuclear patterns within 30 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2D</xref>).</p><p>We previously described the sequestration of proteasomes into cytoplasmic IPODs, which represents an intermediate step in the autophagic clearance of inactive proteasomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Marshall et al., 2016</xref>).

Consequently, we hypothesized that these puncta are PSGs, which could protect proteasomes from proteaphagic degradation by sequestering them away from the autophagic machinery.

In fact, PSGs even appeared in nitrogen-starved cells pre-treated with 2-DG, as they do in cells subjected to simultaneous nitrogen and carbon starvation. In contrast, when assayed for proteaphagy by the GFP-release assay of both reporters, we found that 2-DG had the inverse effect; like carbon starvation, 2-DG dampened proteaphagy induced by nitrogen starvation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>).

One possibility was Ecm29, which co-purifies with the 26S particle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Leggett et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Marshall et al., 2016</xref>) and appears to have roles in proteasome assembly and quality control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lehmann et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Park et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">De La Mota-Peynado et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Wang et al., 2017</xref>). However, when the <italic>Δecm29</italic> mutation was introduced into <italic>PRE10-GFP</italic> or <italic>RPN5-GFP</italic> cells, we found by GFP-release assays that, as in wild type, the autophagic clearance of the CP and RP was slow during carbon starvation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>), implying RP-containing PSGs still accumulate without Ecm29. We additionally investigated the roles of Blm10 and Ecm29 in nitrogen starvation- and inhibitor-induced proteaphagy; however, neither <italic>Δblm10</italic> nor <italic>Δecm29</italic> cells showed any defect in these pathways, as judged by rapid accumulation of free GFP from the Pre10-GFP and Rpn5-GFP reporters after removal of nitrogen from the growth medium or addition of MG132, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1E</xref>). The lack of an effect for Ecm29 in inhibitor-induced proteaphagy was noteworthy, given its proposed role in identifying dysfunctional proteasomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lehmann et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Another intriguing candidate was Spg5, which was previously shown by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hanna et al.

However, unlike the relationship of the CP and Blm10, the deposition of the RP into PSGs upon carbon starvation was not completely dependent on Spg5, as a sizable percentage of <italic>Δspg5</italic> cells contained PSGs labelled with Rpn5-GFP after prolonged starvation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Saunier et al., 2013</xref>), suggesting that absence of Spg5 delays, rather than blocks, deposition of the RP into PSGs.

Similarly, when proteasomes were purified via the RP in these two backgrounds, less CP and its corresponding Pre4 subunit were co-purified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and B</xref>). While other scenarios are possible, the most parsimonious is that CP and RP dissociate upon carbon starvation but can be co-purified if both are deposited into PSGs. If one sub-particle is blocked from entry into PSGs, its enrichment during purifications of the other sub-particle is diminished.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34532.021</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>The CP and RP dissociate from each other upon carbon starvation and are separately delivered into PSGs.</title><p>(<bold>A and B</bold>) Yeast proteasomes selectively lose the RP or CP sub-complexes when purified from <italic>Δblm10</italic> and <italic>Δspg5</italic> cells via the CP or RP, respectively, upon growth on –C medium. <italic>PRE1-TEV-ProA</italic> or <italic>RPN11-TEV-ProA</italic> cells with or without the <italic>Δblm10</italic> or <italic>Δspg5</italic> mutations were switched from nutrient-rich (+N +C) medium to –C medium for the indicated times before affinity purification of proteasomes based on their ProA tags in the presence of ATP.

In particular, the sequestration of proteasomes into PSGs could help cells resume growth as carbon availability improves by providing a rapidly re-mobilizable cache of proteasomes. To test this hypothesis, we examined the growth resumption of yeast cultures in nutrient-rich medium following exposure to carbon and/or nitrogen starvation using mutant backgrounds (<italic>Δblm10</italic>, <italic>Δnat3</italic>, <italic>Δspg5</italic> and/or <italic>Δupb3</italic>) or culture conditions (2-DG) that impact PSG accumulation and/or proteaphagy (see above).</p><p>Initially, wild-type yeast cells were subjected to 24 hr of carbon, nitrogen, or simultaneous carbon and nitrogen starvation, before being returned to nutrient-rich medium, at which point their ability to resume growth was monitored by measurement of culture density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1A</xref>). While cells not subjected to starvation grew rapidly without lag, reaching an OD<sub>600</sub> of more than 8.0 after 6 hr of growth, cells subjected to nitrogen starvation suffered a 3 to 4 hr lag before resuming growth, reaching an OD<sub>600</sub> of only ~2.0 after 6 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A and B</xref>). By contrast, carbon starvation only modestly delayed growth resumption by itself, while remarkably accelerating re-growth of cells also missing nitrogen, indicating that the growth defect caused by nitrogen starvation can be partially overcome by a lack of carbon, in much the same way as carbon starvation protects proteasomes from autophagy even when cells are starved for nitrogen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A and B</xref>). As a further connection of this growth phenotype to proteasome levels, we exposed nitrogen- and/or carbon-starved cells to the amino acid analogs canavanine and <italic>p</italic>-fluorophenylalanine; survival under these conditions would be aided by the capacity of proteasomes to clear abnormal proteins incorporating these analogs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Finley et al., 2012</xref>). Whereas culture growth in the presence of the analogs was dramatically impaired in cells pre-exposed to nitrogen starvation (~10% of non-treated cells after 6 hr), which would have depleted proteasomes by autophagy, culture growth was better for analog-treated cells starved for either carbon alone or nitrogen and carbon together, and was comparable to non-starved cells (~30% of untreated cells), all three of which would have avoided autophagic clearance of their proteasomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C and D</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34532.025</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Protecting yeast proteasomes in PSGs upon starvation increases cell fitness.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Delayed resumption of yeast cell growth following nitrogen starvation is reversed by simultaneous carbon starvation.

The activity and abundance of the proteasome in particular are tightly controlled by a variety of mechanisms, including the autophagic clearance of inactive or excess particles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Marshall et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Marshall et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Marshall and Vierstra, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Waite et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cohen-Kaplan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Nemec et al., 2017</xref>). In this study, we further investigated starvation-induced proteaphagy in yeast and <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and surprisingly found that, while proteasomes are rapidly eliminated during nitrogen starvation, they remain stable in response to carbon starvation, even though bulk autophagy is up-regulated. Instead, mature proteasomes exit the nucleus and accumulate in cytoplasmic PSGs, the formation of which has previously been reported to protect yeast cells against stress and confer fitness during aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">van Deventer et al., 2015</xref>). Although the appearance of PSGs in quiescent yeast cells has long been known (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Laporte et al., 2008</xref>), their function(s) have remained obscure.</p><p>Here, we demonstrated an inverse relationship between PSG accumulation and proteaphagy, where promoting PSG assembly protects proteasomes from autophagy, while blocking delivery into PSGs encourages their degradation. During the PSG assembly process, the CP and RP appear to separately coalesce, such that they accumulate in PSGs even in the absence of the other sub-particle. An array of cell fitness studies in turn demonstrated that a failure to store proteasomes in PSGs directs them to proteaphagy, which substantially delays the resumption of growth when carbon-starved yeast cells are re-fed. The response can even been seen in cells starved for nitrogen and treated with 2-DG, which supresses ATP levels, indicating that PSGs are not solely assembled in the absence of carbon but are more generally tied to the energy status of yeast cells (this study; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gu et al., 2017</xref>). Taken together, we propose that entry into PSGs shields proteasomes from proteaphagic breakdown, and instead creates a reservoir of stored proteasomes that can be rapidly re-mobilized upon the resumption of cell growth and/or when proteolytic demand rises. While we cannot exclude the remote possibility that PSGs also have alternative functions, and/or that the ability of the various factors studied here to protect proteasomes from autophagy arises from processes unrelated to PSGs, the sum of our results strongly converges to this conclusion. Presumably, the ability to rapidly restore proteasome capacity avoids the need to re-build the proteasome pool <italic>de novo</italic>, which would be essential for the proper regulation of cell division and other growth-promoting processes. The inverse relationship between PSGs and proteaphagy, and the requirement of Blm10/PA200 for CP aggregation, were also demonstrated in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, indicating that PSGs represent a conserved mechanism for proteasome protection.</p><p>We confirmed the involvement of several factors previously reported to influence PSG formation, including the NatB N-terminal acetylation complex, the C-terminus of the proteasomal DUB Rpn11, the proteasome capping factor Blm10/PA200, intracellular pH, and energy levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Peters et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Saunier et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Weberruss et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">van Deventer et al., 2015</xref>).

Regardless of its activities, we found that Blm10 also becomes a target of autophagy upon nitrogen starvation, presumably because of its association with the CP.</p><p>In addition, we identified an unanticipated role for Spg5 in delivery of the yeast RP into PSGs. In contrast to the absolute requirement of Blm10 for CP delivery, Spg5 was not essential for the RP, but its absence substantially delayed PSG entry. Spg5 was previous shown to bind free RPs and to be important for cell viability during stationary phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hanna et al., 2012</xref>), likely by safeguarding proteasomes. How Spg5 promotes delivery of RPs into PSGs is unknown. At least with respect to carbon-starved cells, we did not find Spg5 bound to proteasomes by mass spectrometry of purified preparations, nor did we detect consistent co-localization of Spg5 with PSGs by confocal fluorescence microscopy, implying that, unlike Blm10, Spg5 does not follow proteasomes (or at least the RP) into these granules. Given the possibility that orthologs of Spg5 exist beyond yeast (like Blm10), we search for relatives in other eukaryotes by amino acid sequence similarity; while weak sequence homologs were found in other fungi, they were absent in plants and metazoans, suggesting either that Spg5 is a fungi-specific factor, or that the Spg5 sequence has evolved considerably.</p><p>Ubp3 was previously shown to be important for proteaphagy upon nitrogen starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Waite et al., 2016</xref>). We confirmed this observation and also showed that Upb3 is critical upon carbon starvation once the transport of proteasomes (or just the CP) into PSGs is blocked. Collectively, these data add proteaphagy to the reported roles for Ubp3 during ribophagy in response to nitrogen starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kraft et al., 2008</xref>) and in negatively regulating mitophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Müller et al., 2015</xref>). Ubp3 activity is also required for the efficient formation of stress granules and processing bodies in response to heat stress, sodium azide treatment, or entry into stationary phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Nostramo et al., 2016</xref>), but not for PSG assembly (this study), implying that this DUB is differentially required for the formation of various cytoplasmic puncta.</p><p>While complementation studies confirmed that the catalytic activity of Ubp3 and its interaction with its co-factor Bre5 are important for proteaphagy, the identity of its target(s) remains unknown. Based on the observations that: (i) proteasomes are ubiquitylated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Besche et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kim et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Marshall et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Marshall et al., 2016</xref>); (ii) Ubp3 interacts directly with proteasomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fehlker et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mao and Smerdon, 2010</xref>); and (iii) free ubiquitin has been detected in PSGs and promotes their appearance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gu et al., 2017</xref>), it is possible that direct deubiquitylation of one or more proteasome subunit(s) is essential for PSG condensation. However, immunoblotting of proteasomes purified before and during nitrogen and carbon starvation did not detect changes in overall ubiquitylation of the particle (data not shown), as has been seen upon proteasome inactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Marshall et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Marshall et al., 2016</xref>). Alternatively, it is possible that deubiquitylation of a hypothetical autophagy receptor permits binding to proteasomes and/or Atg8 upon starvation. Clearly, the involvement of proteasome ubiquitylation in IPOD-mediated proteaphagy of inactive proteasomes, and of Ubp3 in supressing starvation-induced proteaphagy, places ubiquitin as a critical effector of proteasome dynamics, as well as being essential for proteasome substrate recruitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Collins and Goldberg, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dikic, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gu et al., 2017</xref>). Further quantitative analysis of the ubiquitylation landscape of cells subjected to starvation in the presence and absence of Ubp3 will likely be required to differentiate the above possibilities.</p><p>How PSGs assemble and are able to shield proteasomes from proteaphagy is unclear. Organisms in natural environments frequently encounter nutrient excess, nutrient deprivation, and rapid shifts between these two extremes, with growth under carbon stress in particular known to trigger the rapid re-organization of the cytoplasm and other compartments to promote cell survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lee et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Saarikangas and Barral, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kaganovich, 2017</xref>). Included is the appearance of large, highly dynamic, membrane-less inclusions that can selectively partition individual proteins, biochemical pathways or cytotoxic protein aggregates away from the cellular milieu (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Narayanaswamy et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">O'Connell et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Petrovska et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Shah et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Suresh et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Franzmann et al., 2018</xref>). Besides PSGs, examples include hundreds of yeast proteins that condense into so-called stress granules during heat stress, mRNA and associated RNA-binding proteins that assemble into ribonucleoprotein granules under osmotic stress, and IPODs that concentrate amyloidogenic protein aggregates. As with PSGs, some of these inclusions are thought to serve protective roles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Saarikangas and Barral, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kaganovich, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Mateju et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Franzmann et al., 2018</xref>). Furthermore, these inclusions, like PSGs, coalesce rapidly and are often reversible, with possible driving forces being changes in cytoplasmic fluidity, intrinsic physico-chemical properties and folding of the protein(s), changes in the surrounding environment such as the influences of pH seen for PSGs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Peters et al., 2013</xref>; this report), and extrinsic factors such as chaperones and/or post-translational modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kaganovich, 2017</xref>).</p><p>Condensation is thought to involve phase separation phenomena often caused by reduced protein solubility. In a manner highly reminiscent of PSGs, phase separation was recently reported for the yeast translation termination factor Sup35 upon nutrient starvation in response to changes in intracellular ATP levels and pH, with this accretion helping resumption of cell growth upon exit from starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Franzmann et al., 2018</xref>). Why carbon starvation, but not nitrogen starvation, induces these re-arrangements remains unexplored; for PSGs, this might be caused by alterations in intracellular pH and ATP levels seen upon carbon starvation but not nitrogen starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Narayanaswamy et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Munder et al., 2016</xref>). Similarly, how these condensates are able to evade the autophagic machinery, which is certainly capable of handling large protein aggregates and insoluble deposits, remains unclear, although their unique biophysical properties might be important (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Holehouse and Pappu, 2018</xref>). PSGs form independently of the PAS that initiates autophagy, additionally implying a spatial separation between PSGs and sites of autophagy initiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>).</p><p>It is also unclear how proteasomes exit the nucleus prior to PSG formation. A recent study found that nuclear proteasomes likely dissociate into their CP and RP sub-complexes prior to export in response to nitrogen starvation, and identified a role for the exportin Crm1 in this relocation, which was blocked in the temperature-sensitive <italic>xpo1-1</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Nemec et al., 2017</xref>). Proteasomes then seemed to transiently associate with cytosolic IPODs, before forming mature PSGs as separate puncta (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Peters et al., 2016</xref>). We previously showed that inactive proteasomes are triaged into IPODs in an Hsp42-dependent manner prior to Cue5-mediated proteaphagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Marshall et al., 2015</xref>), but our finding that PSGs can form even in the absence of Hsp42 implies that the pathway that forms PSGs is different.</p><p>In conclusion, we identify here an evolutionarily conserved function of PSGs in shielding proteasomes from autophagic degradation during nutrient deprivation and/or entry into quiescence that promotes cell survival when growth conditions improve. An intriguing possibility is that similarly protective aggregation takes place for a variety of other intracellular protein complexes during nutritional and environmental stress. Given the ease with which PSG (and proteasome-containing IPOD) assembly can be manipulated through growth conditions, inhibitors, and mutations, proteasome dynamics could provide an excellent paradigm to define the processes underpinning biomolecular condensate formation during stress.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Strain <break/>(<italic>Saccharomyces</italic> <break/><italic>cerevisiae</italic>)</td><td>Wild-type strains <break/>(BY4741; BY4742; <break/>SEY6210; SUB62; <break/>W303-1B)</td><td>Other</td><td>See additional <break/>information</td><td>Provided by Daniel Finley (Harvard <break/>Medical School), Audrey P.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Jonathan Cooper (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Raymond J Deshaies (Reviewer #1), is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This paper proposes a role for proteasome storage granules (PSGs) in protecting proteasomes from autophagy. PSGs form when yeast cells are starved of carbon source. They are rapidly dissolved upon re-feeding. Interestingly, PSGs do not form upon nitrogen starvation, and instead the proteasomes are taken up into the vacuole by autophagy (which the authors refer to as proteaphagy) and degraded. A key observation in the paper is that in cells doubly starved for carbon and nitrogen, proteasomes enter in to PSGs and are not subject to proteaphagy. Furthermore, mutations (e.g. <italic>∆blm10</italic>) that prevent PSG formation upon carbon starvation result in proteophagy. By contrast, treatments that promote PSG formation (e.g. 2-deoxyglucose) block proteophagy upon nitrogen starvation. The authors go on to show that there is a strong correlation between PSG formation and speed of growth recovery upon re-feeding starved cells. This suggests that an important function of PSGs is to allow cells to preserve their proteasomes in times of carbon starvation stress, such that they can quickly recover when more resources are available.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>A key finding of this work is that formation of PSGs correlates with more rapid recovery from starvation. Most of the data on this point are correlative, and it is difficult to rule out that the treatments used do not exert their effect through perturbing or promoting some process other than PSG formation. With this in mind, there are two experiments that would strengthen this key section of the paper that the reviewers believe should be done:</p><p>1) Repeat the <italic>∆ubp3</italic> rescue experiment with a mutant other than <italic>∆blm10</italic> (e.g. <italic>∆nat3</italic>; a <italic>∆nat3 ∆ubp3</italic>strain should recover from carbon starvation faster than <italic>∆nat3</italic>), to establish that this effect is not limited to one particular mutant/treatment.</p><p>2) Examine the effect of <italic>∆ubp3</italic> on recovery from starvation in <italic>∆spg5</italic>. This is a key experiment because proteaphagy in carbon-starved <italic>∆spg5</italic> is not blocked by introducing <italic>∆ubp3</italic>. Thus, a <italic>∆spg5 ∆ubp3 strain</italic> should not show more rapid resumption of growth compared to <italic>∆spg5</italic>, in the assay shown in Figure 8K. This would be particularly striking because <italic>∆ubp3</italic> does have a beneficial effect when this assay is performed with <italic>∆blm10</italic>, and thus would greatly strengthen the correlation between low proteaphagy and rapid resumption of growth.</p><p>In addition, given that this paper shows for the first time the behavior of PSGs in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, the authors should evaluate whether these structures are reversible as they are in yeast.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>The authors have examined the ability of cells of different genotype or treated with different agents to recover upon re-feeding following nitrogen, carbon, or nitrogen and carbon starvation. These experiments paint a consistent picture: if a cell can form PSGs upon starvation to protect its proteasomes from proteophagy, it recovers more rapidly upon refeeding. My one comment here is that I would like to see the <italic>∆ubp3</italic> rescue in more than one example. Currently, the authors show that <italic>∆ubp3</italic> will rescue the recovery defect of a <italic>∆blm10</italic> mutant. Is that same true for <italic>∆nat3</italic>, for example?</p><p>The other major concern I have is that it is hard to exclude that PSGs form for some other reason other than to protect the proteasome from proteophagy. The authors could address this by being a bit more circumspect in their Discussion. The recovery experiments described in the prior paragraph provide further support for this contention, but given that all of the mutants analyzed are likely to impact multiple physiological processes, it is difficult to exclude that the major protective effect of Blm10 or Nat3 is through some process other than PSG formation.</p><p>Another issue that is not addressed is why formation of PSGs would protect from autophagy? There is a paragraph in the Discussion devoted to this topic but it focuses almost entirely on how/why PSGs form and says little about how formation of these structures would prevent autophagy. Autophagy can clearly process large structures including mitochondria and IPODs. Why would formation of PSGs be protective? Perhaps the authors can include a few lines on this in the Discussion.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>In the present study, the authors show that the formation of proteasome storage granules (PSGs), which are formed under carbon-starvation conditions, antagonizes proteaphagy. The CP and RP are separated when the ATP level is reduced, but both accumulate at the same PSGs. They further show that autophagic degradation of proteasomes, which is inhibited by the PSG formation, delays the resumption of cell growth after carbon starvation-replenishment, suggesting a reservoir function of PSGs. Finally, the authors show this phenomenon also in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>.</p><p>Overall, this study is well performed and presented. The methods used in this study are appropriate. Remaining questions would be how PSGs are able to escape from autophagic degradation and how de-ubiquitination is important for proteaphagy. However, these could be future studies as the authors have made significant progress in revealing a role of PSG formation in protection from autophagic degradation and cell regrowth after starvation.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>Marshall and Vierstra report that PSGs and proteaphagy function antagonistically in regulating proteasome abundance during carbon and nitrogen starvation in both yeast and plant cells. PSGs help protect proteasomes from autophagic degradation upon carbon starvation, and promote cell fitness upon recovery from carbon starvation. In carbon-starved cells, the sequestration of the proteasome core particle (CP) into PSGs is dependent on Blm10, while the deposition of the regulatory particle (RP) into PSGs is facilitated by Spg5. In the absence of Blm10, which redirects CPs to the vacuole, active Ubp3 is required for CP proteaphagy under carbon starvation. Assembly of PSG-like structures and protection of proteasomes from proteaphagy under fixed carbon starvation can be reproduced in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. Whether these PSG-like structures in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> can be rapidly remobilized upon recovery from carbon starvation is unknown.</p><p>Overall, this manuscript provides important biological insight into at least one function of PSG formation. The idea that PSGs act to protect functional proteasomes from autophagy under carbon starvation, or energy-depleted, conditions (and possibly the same for other cellular 'puncta') is attractive and well supported by the data. The paper is also well written and well organized. I think the paper would be suitable for publication in <italic>eLife</italic> after the modest criticisms, suggestions, and corrections below are addressed:</p><p>o The apparent mass of the cleaved GFP in the western blots from yeast extracts (Ex. Figures 1A-1C) was larger than what would be expected. In contrast, the free GFP MW from plant protein extracts was close to the expected size (Figures 9A, 10A). Please explain this difference.</p><p>o Can the cytoplasmic foci (Figure 1D) be rapidly remobilized to the nucleus after switching to fresh YPGA that has 2% glycerol? Similarly, can the 2-DG-induced cytoplasmic foci (Figure 3E) remobilize upon switching to fresh +N +C medium?</p><p>o What percentage of cells have separate cytoplasmic foci of Pre10-GFP and Rnq1-mCherry in Figure 1H?</p><p>o As shown in Figure 5F, some mCherry-Spg5 puncta colocalize with Rpn5-GFP in carbon-starved cells, which seems inconsistent with the description in the last paragraph of the subsection “Spg5 helps deliver the RP to PSGs and protects the RP from proteaphagy”. Similarly, some mCherry-Spg5 puncta colocalized with Pre10-GFP (Figure 4—figure supplement 1C); again this is inconsistent with the description in the text. Please address this apparent discrepancy, and more importantly, provide the percentage of PSGs marked by Rpn5 or Pre10 that co-localize or not with Spg5.</p><p>o In Figure 7C, what is the GFP cleavage profile for Pre10-GFP and Rpn5-GFP in the <italic>∆ubp3</italic> mutant?</p><p>o For the starvation treatments on 5-day-old <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> seedlings, is there data indicating the nutrients from seeds are exhausted at this time point? Also, ConA was only added to the medium for starvation treatments. Could ConA cause proteasome relocalization to form cytoplasmic foci in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> even when grow in nutrient rich medium?</p><p>o In Figure 9, can these PSG-like structures in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> be remobilized into nuclei upon carbon restoration? It would be nice, but not essential, in establishing the parallels with yeast PSGs, to show whether these PSG-like structures in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> roots behave similarly compared to the PSGs in yeast.</p><p>o There is no description of the methods used for plant protein extraction as far as I can tell.</p><p>o I did not see any details or citation for the <italic>atg7-2</italic> mutant line used in Figure 10D.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34532.038</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>A key finding of this work is that formation of PSGs correlates with more rapid recovery from starvation.

As such, we agree with the reviewers that performing the additional <italic>Δubp3</italic> rescue experiments would be important. To address this point we undertook two approaches. The first involved assessing the effect of combining the <italic>Δnat3</italic> and <italic>Δubp3</italic> mutations on i) the localisation of Pre10-GFP and Rpn5-GFP as determined by confocal microscopy, and ii) the release of free GFP as determined by immunoblot. These data (now included in a new Figure 7—figure supplement 1A, B, C and D) clearly demonstrate that, while Pre10-GFP is delivered to the vacuole upon carbon starvation in <italic>Δnat3</italic> cells (which do not form PSGs), this delivery is blocked in <italic>Δnat3 Δubp3</italic> double mutant cells. Likewise, while autophagic release of free GFP from the Pre10-GFP reporter is readily detectable by immunoblot in <italic>Δnat3</italic> cells following carbon starvation, this release is greatly reduced in the <italic>Δnat3 Δubp3</italic> double mutant. These results now confirm that Ubp3 is required for delivery of the CP to the vacuole in two separate mutant strains; <italic>Δblm10</italic> (Figure 7A and C) and <italic>Δnat3</italic> (this new data). Interestingly, delivery of Rpn5-GFP to the vacuole, and release of free GFP from this reporter, was not blocked in the <italic>Δnat3 Δubp3</italic> mutant, confirming the finding of both ourselves and Waite et al. (2016) that Ubp3 activity is required only for delivery of the CP to the vacuole upon starvation.</p><p>The second approach involved performing the yeast growth assays to monitor cell fitness following starvation with the <italic>Δnat3</italic> single mutant and the <italic>Δnat3 Δubp3</italic> double mutant, as suggested by the reviewers. These data (included in a new Figure 8K, L and M (replacing the original panels)) again correlate well with the data obtained for the <italic>Δblm10</italic> and <italic>Δblm10 Δubp3</italic> mutants. While the <italic>Δnat3</italic> and <italic>Δnat3 Δubp3</italic> cells grow slightly more slowly than wild type in the absence of starvation, growth recovery of the <italic>Δnat3</italic> strain following carbon starvation is substantially reduced compared to the control (taking approximately 3 to 4 hours, compared to less than 1 hour for wild type). However, when the <italic>Δnat3</italic> and <italic>Δubp3</italic> mutations were combined, the cells were better able to resume growth following restoration of the carbon source than were <italic>Δnat3</italic> cells alone (Figure 8K, L and M). These results add additional support to our conclusion that the extent of proteasome degradation upon carbon starvation impacts the ability of cells to recover from the starvation treatment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Examine the effect of <italic>∆ubp3</italic> on recovery from starvation in <italic>∆spg5</italic>. This is a key experiment because proteaphagy in carbon-starved <italic>∆spg5</italic> is not blocked by introducing <italic>∆ubp3</italic>. Thus, a <italic>∆spg5∆ubp3</italic> strain should not show more rapid resumption of growth compared to <italic>∆spg5</italic>, in the assay shown in Figure 8K. This would be particularly striking because <italic>∆ubp3</italic> does have a beneficial effect when this assay is performed with <italic>∆blm10</italic>, and thus would greatly strengthen the correlation between low proteaphagy and rapid resumption of growth.</p></disp-quote><p>We again agree with the editors and reviewers that this experiment would provide strong additional support for our model. As such, we performed the experiment, and the data is now included in a new Figure 8N, O and P (replacing the original panels K, L and M). As anticipated by the reviewers, while the <italic>Δspg5</italic> mutant cells showed a modest reduction in growth recovery following starvation (the effect is less severe than for the <italic>Δblm10</italic> and <italic>Δnat3</italic> mutants, as deleting Spg5 merely delays, rather than completely blocking, the delivery of the RP into PSGs; it may also reflect the fact that maintaining a pool of the CP is more important to growth resumption than is preserving the RP), combing the <italic>Δspg5</italic> and <italic>Δubp3</italic> mutations did not lead to faster growth recovery, in contrast to the effects seen when <italic>Δubp3</italic> was combined with <italic>Δblm10</italic> or <italic>Δnat3</italic>. Both this data and the new data from point 1 now considerably strengthen the observed correlation between low levels of proteaphagy and rapid resumption of cell growth following renewed availability of nutrients.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In addition, given that this paper shows for the first time the behavior of PSGs in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, the authors should evaluate whether these structures are reversible as they are in yeast.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this suggestion. We subjected 5 day-old <italic>PAG1:PAG1-GFP pag1-1</italic> seedlings grown in the light in sucrose-containing medium to 24 hours of fixed-carbon starvation by switching them to sucrose-free medium and growing them in the dark to prevent photosynthesis. We then returned the seedlings to a sucrose-containing medium and re-exposed them to the light, and monitored the fate of the cytoplasmic PSG-like structures over time. These results are now presented in a new Figure 9F. As can clearly be seen, the strong nuclear and diffuse cytoplasmic fluorescence signal observed in root cells grown in nutrient-rich medium was greatly reduced, and was instead found in bright cytoplasmic puncta when the seedlings were subjected to fixed carbon starvation. However, when the carbon source was replenished, these puncta began to disperse, and the cytoplasmic and nuclear signal returned. This was visible even 1 hour following the cessation of starvation, and after 4 hours the cytoplasmic puncta had essentially disappeared. The rapid reversibility of these punctate structures in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> lends further support to our proposal that these are PSGs, and that they perform an equivalent function in plants as they do in yeast.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>The authors have examined the ability of cells of different genotype or treated with different agents to recover upon refeeding following nitrogen, carbon, or nitrogen plus carbon starvation.

My one comment here is that I would like to see the <italic>∆ubp3</italic> rescue in more than one example.

We agree with the reviewer that, on their own, each mutant or treatment condition we have studied (the <italic>Δblm10</italic>, <italic>Δnat3, Δspg5, Δubp3, rpn11-m1</italic> and <italic>rpn11-m5</italic> mutants, plus growth at high or low pH and treatment with 2-DG) likely impacts multiple cellular processes, and thus we cannot exclude that their major effects on proteaphagy, and the positive effect some of them impart on cell growth recovery after starvation, are mediated through other processes. However, we do feel that the overall weight of the evidence, with multiple mutants and treatment conditions all showing results consistent with our hypothesis, favours our conclusion that PSG formation protects proteasomes from autophagic degradation and helps improve cell fitness following recovery from starvation. We have taken the reviewer’s advice and modified our discussion to take into account the very valid point that was raised and added the sentence below to the Discussion:</p><p>“While we cannot exclude the remote possibility that PSGs also have alternative functions, and/or that the ability of the various factors studied here to protect proteasomes from autophagy arises from processes unrelated to PSGs, the sum of our results strongly converges to this conclusion.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Another issue that is not addressed is why formation of PSGs would protect from autophagy? There is a paragraph in the Discussion devoted to this topic but it focuses almost entirely on how/why PSGs form and says little about how formation of these structures would prevent autophagy. Autophagy can clearly process large structures including mitochondria and IPODs. Why would formation of PSGs be protective? Perhaps the authors can include a few lines on this in the Discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>We again agree with the reviewer that this is an interesting point worthy of inclusion in our Discussion, and we have thus modified it accordingly (see Discussion, ninth paragraph). We are currently lacking experimental data addressing how exactly PSGs (and potentially other biomolecular condensates) are able to evade the autophagy machinery, and so the newly added text is necessarily rather speculative. However, data in our new Figure 1—figure supplement 2C obtained in response to point 1 raised by reviewer 2 indicates that PSGs can form independently to the PAS, and there is thus at least a degree of spatial separation between PSGs and the autophagy machinery (this has been mentioned in the aforementioned paragraph). Whether there is some particular biophysical or structural property of PSGs (and maybe other condensates) that allows them to evade autophagy is an interesting question that to our knowledge has not yet been addressed in the literature.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>[…] Overall, this study is well performed and presented. The methods used in this study are appropriate. Remaining questions would be how PSGs are able to escape from autophagic degradation and how de-ubiquitination is important for proteaphagy. However, these could be future studies as the authors have made a significant progress in revealing a role of PSG formation in protection from autophagic degradation and cell regrowth after starvation.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their positive comments about or work. We agree with reviewer #2 that how PSGs escape capture by the autophagy machinery, and precisely how de-ubiquitylation fits into the picture, are important question that we intend to address in the future.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>[…] I think the paper would be suitable for publication in eLife after the modest criticisms, suggestions, and corrections below are addressed:</p><p>o The apparent mass of the cleaved GFP in the western blots from yeast extracts (Ex. Figures 1A-1C) was larger than what would be expected. In contrast, the free GFP MW from plant protein extracts was close to the expected size (Figures 9A, 10A). Please explain this difference.</p></disp-quote><p>As the reviewer correctly points out, there is a discrepancy in the size of the free GFP observed between yeast and plant cell extracts on our immunoblots. We have noticed this before, and indeed it has been a consistent feature of the experiments we have performed with yeast that the free GFP band runs at around the 30-31 kDa mark (see e.g. Marshall et al., 2016), rather than around 27-28 kDa in the plant cell extracts. Unfortunately, we currently have no satisfactory explanation for this phenomenon. One possibility is that plant and yeast vacuolar hydrolases may have different cleavage specificities, meaning that the GFP gets processed at a different position. Alternatively, there may be some differences in buffer composition between our yeast and plant cell extraction methods that cause this difference. A brief review of the autophagy literature does reveal considerable discrepancy between the size of the free GFP band between (and even within) different studies, ranging from smaller than 20 kDa (e.g. in Lu et al., 2014) up to 30-31 kDa (e.g. in Müller et al., 2015), but the reasons for this are not yet clear.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>o Can the cytoplasmic foci (Figure 1D) be rapidly remobilized to the nucleus after switching to fresh YPGA that has 2% glycerol? Similarly, can the 2-DG-induced cytoplasmic foci (Figure 3E) remobilize upon switching to fresh +N +C medium?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion, and have performed the suggested experiments, which are now included in new Figure 1—figure supplements 2D and 2E. In either case, the cytoplasmic foci observed upon carbon starvation or 2-DG treatment were rapidly re-mobilised upon switching to fresh carbon-containing medium, or medium lacking 2-DG, respectively. This occurred within 30 minutes following cessation of starvation (the earliest time point examined), and within 1 hour of the removal of 2-DG (the slightly slower resorption rate following 2-DG treatment is likely due to incomplete removal of the chemical following wash-out). This timing is consistent with the previous study by Laporte et al. (2008), who showed that PSGs are rapidly re-mobilised within 15 minutes following exit from quiescence.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>o What percentage of cells have separate cytoplasmic foci of Pre10-GFP and Rnq1-mCherry in Figure 1H?</p></disp-quote><p>To address this question we grew and imaged more cells expressing <italic>PRE10-GFP</italic> and <italic>RNQ1-mCherry</italic>, and quantified the number of cells containing distinct GFP and mCherry puncta following carbon starvation. Over 90% of cells (from over 200 quantified) had these distinct puncta, and this is now mentioned in the fifth paragraph of the subsection “Proteasomes are rapidly degraded by autophagy in response to nitrogen but not carbon starvation”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>o As shown in Figure 5F, some mCherry-Spg5 puncta colocalize with Rpn5-GFP in carbon-starved cells, which seems inconsistent with the description in the last paragraph of the subsection “Spg5 helps deliver the RP to PSGs and protects the RP from proteaphagy”. Similarly, some mCherry-Spg5 puncta colocalized with Pre10-GFP (Figure 4—figure supplement 1C); again this is inconsistent with the description in text. Please address this apparent discrepancy, and more importantly, provide the percentage of PSGs marked by Rpn5 or Pre10 that co-localize or not with Spg5.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for noticing that our description of the co-localization data was not as precise as it should have been. They are indeed correct that there are rare instances in which mCherry-Spg5 does indeed appear to co-localize in cytoplasmic puncta with either Pre10-GFP or Rpn5-GFP. As such, we have modified the Discussion in the last paragraph of the subsection “Spg5 helps deliver the RP to PSGs and protects the RP from proteaphagy”, to make this clear. In addition, we grew and imaged more cells expressing either <italic>PRE10-GFP</italic> or <italic>RPN5-GFP</italic> together with <italic>mCherry-SPG5</italic>, and quantified the number of cells containing overlapping GFP and mCherry puncta following carbon starvation. We found that 12% of cells (from over 200 quantified) had puncta containing both Rpn5-GFP and mCherry-Spg5, while the remaining 88% showed puncta containing Rpn5-GFP only. Similarly, just 6% of cells (from over 200 quantified) had puncta containing both Pre10-GFP and mCherry-Spg5, while the remaining 94% showed puncta containing Pre10-GFP only. This quantification has been included in the aforementioned paragraph.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>o In Figure 7C, what is the GFP cleavage profile for Pre10-GFP and Rpn5-GFP in <italic>∆ubp3</italic> mutant?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out this omission from our original experimental design. To address this, we have replaced the immunoblots in Figure 7C with new blots that include the GFP cleavage profile of Pre10-GFP or Rpn5-GFP in <italic>Δubp3</italic> cells alone, together with the other genotypes included in the original Figure. In both cases, the absence of Ubp3 alone did not cause additional release of free GFP compared to wild-type cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>o For the starvation treatments on 5-d-old <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> seedlings, is there data indicating the nutrients from seeds are exhausted at this time point?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for raising this interesting point. There is indeed literature describing the mobilisation of seed storage reserves upon seed germination in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. The major nitrogen sources are the seed storage proteins, which in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> are 12S globulins and 2S albumins. These are known to be fully degraded within 4 days of seed germination (see, for example, Figure 6 of Hunter et al., 2007 and Figure S3A of Gao et al., 2015). Likewise, the major carbon reserve in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> seeds is considered to be triacylglycerol (TAG), and the TAG marker fatty acid eicosenoic acid (20:1) was shown to be more than 95% degraded by day 5 following germination (see Figure 2A of Penfield et al., 2005). As such, we feel that the day 5 time-point selected by us for the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> starvation experiments is appropriate. This information, along with the relevant citations, has now been included in the Results subsection “PSG assembly and the protection of proteasomes from proteaphagy are conserved in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also, ConA was only added to the medium for starvation treatments. Could ConA cause proteasome relocalization to form cytoplasmic foci in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> even when grow in nutrient rich medium?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for noticing this issue; they are indeed correct that our original experimental design did not preclude the fact that the cytoplasmic puncta observed upon fixed carbon starvation could be caused by the ConA treatment. To address this, we now include data in a new Figure 10—figure supplement 1 confirming that the PSG like structures still form upon fixed carbon starvation even in the absence of ConA treatment. This experiment has the additional advantage of confirming that these PSG-like puncta are likely resident in the cytosol, rather than being stabilised by the ConA treatment inside the vacuole.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>o In Figure 9, can these PSG-like structures in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> be remobilized into nuclei upon carbon restoration? It would be nice, but not essential, in establishing the parallels with yeast PSGs, to show whether these PSG-like structures in Arabidopsis roots behave similarly compared to the PSGs in yeast.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for raising this point, and agree with them that inclusion of this data strengthens our conclusion that the punctate structures containing PAG1-GFP and RPN5a-GFP that are observed in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> roots upon fixed carbon starvation are indeed similar to PSGs. Please see point 3 in the essential revisions for details of how we addressed this point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>o There is no description of the methods used for plant protein extraction as far as I can tell.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for noticing this omission. A description of the method used for plant protein extraction has now been included in the Materials and Methods subsection “Immunological techniques”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>o I did not see any details or citation for the <italic>atg7-2</italic> mutant line used in Figure 10D.</p></disp-quote><p>We once again thank the reviewer for noticing this omission. The relevant accession number for this line (GABI_655_B06), and the reference in which it was first described (Chung et al., 2010), are now included in the Materials and Methods subsection “<italic>Arabidopsis</italic> materials and growth conditions”.</p></body></sub-article></article>
