Its reduced levels in diet-induced obesity (DIO) contribute to hyperleptinemia and leptin resistance, effects that are regulated by the endocannabinoid (eCB)/CB<sub>1</sub>R system. Here we show that pharmacological activation/blockade and genetic overexpression/deletion of hepatic CB<sub>1</sub>R modulates sOb-R levels and hepatic leptin resistance. Interestingly, peripheral CB<sub>1</sub>R blockade failed to reverse DIO-induced reduction of sOb-R levels, increased fat mass and dyslipidemia, and hepatic steatosis in mice lacking C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP), whereas direct activation of CB<sub>1</sub>R in wild-type hepatocytes reduced sOb-R levels in a CHOP-dependent manner. Moreover, CHOP stimulation increased sOb-R expression and release via a direct regulation of its promoter, while CHOP deletion reduced leptin sensitivity. Our findings highlight a novel molecular aspect by which the hepatic eCB/CB<sub>1</sub>R system is involved in the development of hepatic leptin resistance and in the regulation of sOb-R levels via CHOP.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>When the human body has stored enough energy from food, it releases a hormone called leptin that travels to the brain and stops feelings of hunger. This hormone moves through the bloodstream and can affect other organs, such as the liver, which also help control our body’s energy levels. Most people with obesity have very high levels of leptin in their blood, but are resistant to its effects and will therefore continue to feel hungry despite having stored enough energy.</p><p>One of the proteins that controls the levels of leptin is a receptor called sOb-R, which is released by the liver and binds to leptin as it travels in the blood. Individuals with high levels of this receptor often have less free leptin in their bloodstream and a lower body weight. Another protein that helps the body to regulate its energy levels is the cannabinoid-1 receptor, or CB1R for short. In people with obesity, this receptor is overactive and has been shown to contribute to leptin resistance, which is when the brain becomes less receptive to leptin. Previous work in mice showed that blocking CB1R reduced the levels of leptin and allowed mice to react to this hormone normally again, but it remained unclear whether CB1R affects how other organs, such as the liver, respond to leptin.</p><p>To answer this question, Drori et al. blocked the CB1R receptor in the liver of mice eating a high-fat diet, either by using a drug or by deleting the gene that codes for this protein. This caused mice to have higher levels of sOb-R circulating in their bloodstream. Further experiments showed that this change in sOb-R was caused by the levels of a protein called CHOP increasing in the liver when CB1R was blocked. Drori et al. found that inhibiting CB1R caused these obese mice to lose weight and have healthier, less fatty livers as a result of their livers no longer being resistant to the effects of leptin.</p><p>Scientists, doctors and pharmaceutical companies are trying to develop new strategies to combat obesity. The results from these experiments suggest that blocking CB1R in the liver could allow this organ to react to leptin appropriately again. Drugs blocking CB1R, including the one used in this study, will be tested in clinical trials and could provide a new approach for treating obesity.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>endocannabinoids</kwd><kwd>leptin resistance</kwd><kwd>ER stress</kwd><kwd>obesity</kwd><kwd>cb1 receptor</kwd><kwd>CHOP</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003977</institution-id><institution>Israel Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>617/14</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tam</surname><given-names>Joseph</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003977</institution-id><institution>Israel Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>158/18</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tam</surname><given-names>Joseph</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007293</institution-id><institution>Obesity Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Early Career Research Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tam</surname><given-names>Joseph</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>ERC-2015-StG grant</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>676841</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tam</surname><given-names>Joseph</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Hungarian National Research, Development, and Innovation Office</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NKFI-6/FK_124038</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Szanda</surname><given-names>Gergő</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The hepatic endocannabinoid/CB<sub>1</sub>R system controls the soluble leptin receptor’s expression and/or subsequent release by Trib3-induced regulation of C/EBP homologous protein levels in hepatocytes to affect leptin signaling in the liver.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Leptin, predominantly produced by and secreted from white adipocytes, conveys information regarding the status of energy storage and availability to the brain to maintain energy homeostasis. It binds the leptin receptor in hypothalamic neurons to reduce food intake and increase energy expenditure in coordination with other adipokines and gastric peptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allison and Myers, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Pan and Myers, 2018</xref>). Molecularly, leptin stimulates the secretion of α-melanocortin stimulating hormone (α-MSH) from proopiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons at the arcuate nucleus (ARC) and inhibits the secretion of the orexigenic peptides neuropeptide-Y (NPY) and Agouti-related protein (AgRP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Flak and Myers, 2016</xref>). Genetic leptin deficiency or lack of functional leptin receptor results in morbid obese and insulin resistance phenotypes in animals (<italic>Lep<sup>ob/ob</sup></italic> or <italic>Lepr<sup>db/db</sup></italic> mice, respectively) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Tartaglia et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Zhang et al., 1994</xref>). In humans, congenital leptin deficiencies are rare, leading to hyperphagia and early-onset obesity, which can be reversed with a leptin replacement therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mantzoros, 1999</xref>). However, most cases of obesity are characterized by hyperleptinemia, indicating that obesity is a leptin-resistant state, where leptin signaling is impaired.</p><p>Whereas many of the actions of leptin are attributed to its effects in the brain, it also has a broad range of physiological effects in the periphery such as angiogenesis, bone formation, lipid and carbohydrate metabolism, nutrient absorption, and insulin homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Sáinz et al., 2015</xref>). In fact, the lack of a response to leptin due to the development of resistance to the hormone may directly affect the central and peripheral actions of leptin, leading to a dysregulated energy balance. For instance, the liver, a central organ in the regulation of whole-body energy homeostasis, constitutes an important target for leptin as it regulates hepatic gluconeogenesis and insulin sensitivity as well as lipid metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Frühbeck and Nutr, 2002</xref>). Therefore, defects in leptin action, which occur in a state of hepatic leptin resistance, impair hepatic function and lead to hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, and dyslipidemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Frühbeck and Nutr, 2002</xref>).</p><p>Various mechanisms have been linked to the development of diet-induced obesity (DIO)-related central and peripheral leptin resistance, including limited CNS access of leptin due to saturated transport machinery, uncoupling of leptin from its receptor (due to rare genetic mutations or intracellular modulators), leptin-induced downregulation of its hypothalamic receptor, and several circulating factors such as the soluble isoform of leptin receptor (sOb-R) (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Engin, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Martin et al., 2008</xref>). Both in humans and mice, the leptin receptor gene (<italic>LEPR</italic> and <italic>Lepr</italic>, respectively) encodes four membrane-anchored isoforms, which differ in the length of their cytoplasmic tail. The long isoform, Ob-Rb, is considered to convey the most robust cellular response to leptin, while the shorter isoforms (Ob-Ra, Ob-Rc, and Ob-Rd) carry a weaker signal. In addition, sOb-R, which lacks the trans-membrane and intracellular domains, also exists. In humans, sOb-R is exclusively generated via proteolytic shedding of membrane-anchored isoforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Maamra et al., 2001</xref>), whereas in mice, it is produced by both transcription of a designated isoform (Ob-Re) and ectodomain shedding of Ob-Rb and Ob-Ra (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ge et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Li et al., 1998</xref>). sOb-R, mainly produced by hepatocytes, is the main leptin-binding protein in human plasma, regulating leptin’s bioavailability and bioactivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lammert et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Yang et al., 2004</xref>). In fact, studies have shown that the circulating levels of sOb-R are inversely correlated with body weight and free leptin levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Ogier et al., 2002</xref>). In addition, sOb-R levels are increased following weight loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Laimer et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Reinehr et al., 2005</xref>), and its overexpression in mice increases leptin sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Huang et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lou et al., 2010</xref>), supporting the key role of sOb-R in the development as well as the reversal of leptin resistance.</p><p>The endocannabinoid (eCB) system, a major regulator of energy homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cristino et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fride et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Pagotto et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Ruiz de Azua and Lutz, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Silvestri and Di Marzo, 2013</xref>), evokes various cellular/metabolic pathways via the activation of two G-protein-coupled receptors, cannabinoid type-1 (CB<sub>1</sub>R) and type-2 (CB<sub>2</sub>R) receptors, by the main eCBs, <italic>N</italic>-arachidonoylethanolamine (AEA) and 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG). The eCB/CB<sub>1</sub>R system is highly overactive during obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Engeli, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Engeli et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Matias et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Monteleone et al., 2005</xref>), and both central and peripheral stimulations of this system have been suggested to contribute to the development of the metabolic syndrome, including leptin resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Engeli et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Matias et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Pagotto et al., 2005</xref>). Studies have shown that leptin's ability to regulate food intake and peripheral lipid metabolism depends upon hypothalamic CB<sub>1</sub>Rs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Buettner et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cardinal et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Di Marzo et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jo et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Malcher-Lopes et al., 2006</xref>). Recent evidence demonstrates that peripheral CB<sub>1</sub>R signaling has the ability to modulate leptin activity too. By using peripherally restricted CB<sub>1</sub>R blockers, we have recently demonstrated that DIO-related hyperleptinemia is completely reversed by increasing leptin's renal clearance and decreasing its secretion from adipocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Tam et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Tam et al., 2010</xref>). Additionally, we have shown that the reversal of hypothalamic leptin resistance in obese mice treated with the peripherally restricted CB<sub>1</sub>R blocker, JD5037, is mediated via re-sensitizing the animals to endogenous leptin and re-activating POMC neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Tam et al., 2017</xref>). Several lines of evidence suggest that hypothalamic neurons, including POMC, undergo endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress during DIO, which may contribute to the development of leptin resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Ozcan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Ramírez and Claret, 2015</xref>). We have previously reported that pharmacological inhibition of peripheral CB<sub>1</sub>Rs (by AM6545) reverses the high-fat diet (HFD)-induced hepatic elevation in the ER stress marker phospho-eIF2α (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Tam et al., 2010</xref>). Since ER stress strongly affects protein translation and secretion (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Ron and Walter, 2007</xref>), we hypothesized that the eCB/CB<sub>1</sub>R system plays a direct role in the regulation of sOb-R levels and hepatic leptin signaling involves the ER stress signaling pathway.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Hepatic CB<sub>1</sub>R regulates sOb-R levels and leptin signaling</title><p>To evaluate the direct contribution of CB<sub>1</sub>R to the regulation of sOb-R levels, we first utilized a pharmacological inhibition paradigm of CB<sub>1</sub>R in DIO mice by using the peripherally restricted CB<sub>1</sub>R inverse agonist JD5037. Similar to previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mazor et al., 2018</xref>), a significant reduction in serum levels of sOb-R was documented in obese mice, an effect that was ameliorated by JD5037 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Since sOb-R is mainly produced by the liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lammert et al., 2001</xref>), we also analyzed the content of sOb-R in liver homogenates from these animals and found a similar trend as in serum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Measurements of the <italic>Lepr-s</italic> (<italic>Ob-Re)</italic> isoform revealed that JD5037 treatment also affected its transcription and protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–E</xref>). Moreover, the protein expression of two additional isoforms of LEPR (Ob-Rb and Ob-Ra) in liver homogenates was also decreased in DIO mice and normalized following JD5037 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–E</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Hepatic CB<sub>1</sub>R regulates soluble isoform of leptin receptor (sOb-R) levels and leptin signaling in DIO.</title><p>Serum (<bold>A</bold>, n = 7–21) and liver (<bold>B</bold>, n = 6–9) levels of sOb-R are reduced following a 14 weeks consumption of high-fat diet (HFD) in wild-type (WT), but not LCB1 cKO mice.

We were therefore not surprised to find that the liver specific deletion of CB<sub>1</sub>R was sufficient to maintain normal circulating levels of sOb-R in obese LCB1 cKO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Similarly, the hepatic gene and protein expression of sOb-R and the other LEPR isoforms were not affected by the HFD feeding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C and G,H</xref>), suggesting that hepatic CB<sub>1</sub>R most likely regulates sOb-R levels.</p><p>To test the functional relevance of our findings to hepatic leptin signaling, we measured the phosphorylation levels of STAT3, the gold-standard measure of leptin signaling (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allison and Myers, 2014</xref>), in mouse livers following exogenous leptin administration in vivo.

In silico analysis of the <italic>Lepr</italic> promoter region revealed a putative binding site, corresponding to five of six nucleotides that compose a core sequence for CHOP binding (GRCm38:CM000997.2. Chromosome 4: 101,717,929–101,717,934) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Ubeda et al., 1996</xref>). As seen in the CHOP precipitates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I</xref>), there was a twofold increase in the recovery of the qPCR product amplified with a primer set flanking the putative CHOP binding site, in cells that were treated with TM. A similar enrichment was seen in <italic>Ppp1r15a</italic> (GADD34), a well-known target of CHOP. This increase was limited to WT hepatocytes, validating the specificity of CHOP IP. Taken together, our data suggests that CHOP is able to occupy the <italic>Lepr</italic> promoter and directly regulate sOb-R levels in response to HFD consumption and/or CB<sub>1</sub>R activation.</p><p>The molecular signaling pathway(s) by which eCBs/CB<sub>1</sub>R regulates CHOP levels calls for further investigation. Nevertheless, one putative mechanism may involve Trib3, a multifunctional protein upregulated during ER stress by the PERK-ATF4-CHOP pathway, which mediates cell death. Trib3 represses its own expression by inhibiting the transcription of both ATF4 and CHOP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jousse et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mathur et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ohoka et al., 2005</xref>). In addition, many studies describe Trib3 as a key factor in mediating the anti-tumor effect of cannabinoids (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Velasco et al., 2016</xref>). Our in vivo data indicate that HFD induces the mRNA and protein expression levels of hepatic Trib3, and that treatment with JD5037 restores these levels. This effect is limited to WT mice, whereas in CHOP KO mice, Trib3 levels did not change in response to HFD nor JD5037 treatment. Similarly, a direct activation of CB<sub>1</sub>R using NE upregulated Trib3 expression in WT, but not in CHOP KO hepatocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A–E</xref>), suggesting that Trib3 is indeed induced via CB<sub>1</sub>R signaling, and negatively regulates CHOP levels. Further support for this hypothesis comes from our data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>, where we show that ATF4 protein levels are reduced in WT mice following the consumption of HFD, and are normalized by JD5037, whereas they remain unchanged in lean and obese LCB1 cKO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2B–D</xref>). Moreover, the ATF4 levels were reduced in hTgCB1 cKO mice fed with a HFD, as compared to lean STD-fed mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2E–G</xref>). Overall, the CB<sub>1</sub>R-related changes in ATF4 expression were found to be well correlated with CHOP as well as with the sOb-R levels, placing ATF4 downstream of CB<sub>1</sub>R and upstream of CHOP in this cascade.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Since only free leptin crosses the blood–brain barrier (BBB) and induces leptin signaling, the sOb-R, which sequesters free leptin in the serum and is considered as the main binding protein for leptin in the circulation, practically regulates leptin’s bioavailability and activity and can potentially affect leptin sensitivity/resistance. This is also true for peripheral tissues, where sOb-R/leptin complexes cannot bind to and activate membrane anchored leptin receptors. Many human and animal studies have demonstrated that sOb-R levels are inversely correlated with plasma levels of leptin, BMI, and adiposity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chan et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lahlou et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Laimer et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Ogier et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Reinehr et al., 2005</xref>), suggesting that low levels of the soluble isoform contribute to obesity-related hyperleptinemia and subsequently, leptin resistance. In contrast to pathological conditions with a positive energy balance (i.e. obesity), human clinical situations associated with energy deficiency (i.e. starvation and/or anorexia nervosa) are characterized by upregulated circulating levels of sOb-R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Monteleone et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Reinehr et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Stein et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Zepf et al., 2012</xref>). Moreover, individuals carrying a mutated allele of <italic>LEPR</italic>, which leads to enhanced shedding of the leptin binding domain, have normoleptinemia and they are not obese (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lahlou et al., 2002</xref>). For these reasons, the sOb-R most likely plays a key role in the formation of central and peripheral leptin resistance conditions. Yet, only limited knowledge exists about the molecular mechanisms that regulate sOb-R production and secretion.</p><p>Using multiple cultured cell types, Gan and colleagues have shown that TNFα may induce cell surface expression of Ob-Rb as well as sOb-R levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gan et al., 2012</xref>). In addition, an in vitro study has demonstrated that increasing the concentration of recombinant sOb-R diminishes STAT3 phosphorylation in response to leptin stimulation, but pre-incubation of leptin with recombinant sOb-R forms ligand-receptor complexes do not affect leptin-mediated STAT3 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Yang et al., 2004</xref>). In vivo, it has been described that leptin stimulation as well as food deprivation specifically induce the expression of sOb-R in mouse liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cohen et al., 2005</xref>). It has been also demonstrated that in contrast to mice, the human sOb-R, exclusively generated through proteolytic cleavage of the extracellular domain of membrane-anchored isoforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Maamra et al., 2001</xref>), is shed into the circulation by two well-known proteolytic enzymes, ADAM10 and ADAM 17, belong to the 'ADAM's family' (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Schaab and Kratzsch, 2015</xref>). As we could not detect significant up/down regulation in the expression levels of these proteins in our experimental paradigms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), and the fact that we detected all changes in both mRNA and protein levels, we reasoned that the observed alterations in the circulating levels of sOb-R result from altered hepatic expression and secretion of the <italic>Lepr</italic> gene rather than decreased shedding. In fact, the regulation of ADAM10 and ADAM17 is complex and involves transcription, dynamic trafficking, cellular localization, and activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Edwards et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Reiss and Bhakdi, 2017</xref>). Whereas the current study is focused on the transcriptional regulation of sOb-R by CB<sub>1</sub>R, other Ob-R isoforms, also expressed in humans, display (at the gene and protein levels) a trend similar to Ob-Re following either CB<sub>1</sub>R activation or blockade. These isoforms (Ob-Ra, Ob-Rb) serve as substrates for ectodomain shedding; therefore, their transcriptional regulation may indirectly influence the sOb-R levels and be relevant to human physiology. In addition, numerous stimuli, such as activation of protein kinase C, an increase in intracellular calcium, lipotoxicity, and apoptosis, may contribute to the proteolytic cleavage of the extracellular leptin receptor domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Maamra et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Schaab et al., 2012</xref>). However, to the best of our knowledge, a molecular mechanism responsible for the decreased expression/shedding of sOb-R in obesity was never reported. Here we describe, for the first time, the involvement of the eCB/CB<sub>1</sub>R system in regulating sOb-R levels and consequently leptin's activity.</p><p>The importance of the eCB/CB<sub>1</sub>R system in regulating normal energy homeostasis as well as mediating obesity-related comorbidities is well acknowledged (review in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Simon and Cota, 2017</xref>). In fact, its pivotal interaction with leptin has been first described in 2001, demonstrating that leptin reduces the content of hypothalamic eCBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Di Marzo et al., 2001</xref>) and attenuates eCB-mediated ‘retrograde' neuronal CB<sub>1</sub>R signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jo et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Malcher-Lopes et al., 2006</xref>). On the other hand, activating CB<sub>1</sub>R by eCBs may, in turn, regulate leptin levels and signaling, as suggested previously in women with anorexia nervosa, whose AEA levels are elevated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Monteleone et al., 2005</xref>), whereas their leptin levels are reduced. In fact, we have previously shown that CB<sub>1</sub>R activation in adipocytes and pre-junctional sympathetic fibers innervating the adipose tissue stimulates leptin biosynthesis and release, and its activation in the proximal tubules of the kidney inhibits leptin degradation and renal clearance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Tam et al., 2012</xref>), thus possibly contributing to leptin resistance. In agreement with these findings, peripheral CB<sub>1</sub>R blockade has been shown to ameliorate obesity-related hyperleptinemia, and subsequently restores leptin sensitivity in obese mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Tam et al., 2012</xref>). By using both pharmacological and genetic approaches that target hepatic CB<sub>1</sub>R, our findings here suggest another novel mechanism by which the eCB system may regulate hepatic leptin resistance. Specifically, peripheral blockade and hepatic deletion/overexpression of CB<sub>1</sub>R modulate the expression levels of the sOb-R isoform in hepatocytes and its subsequent release into the circulation, reversing the CB<sub>1</sub>R-mediated decrease in sOb-R levels and hepatic leptin resistance during obesity. One should point out that although liver-specific CB<sub>1</sub>R KO mice retained higher levels of circulating sOb-R when fed a HFD, they were equally susceptible to DIO as their WT controls. Similarly, hepatic-specific CB<sub>1</sub>R transgenic mice in the CB<sub>1</sub>R KO background remained resistant to DIO while displayed significantly lower circulating sOb-R levels, as compared to their littermates. These data suggest that while liver CB<sub>1</sub>R expression is a major contributor to circulating sOb-R levels, their roles in regulating systemic/central energy balance will need to be further validated. Nevertheless, the contribution of hepatic CB<sub>1</sub>R to the regulation of hepatic leptin resistance was clearly demonstrated here by showing that DIO leads to a loss of leptin sensitivity in WT animals, but not in liver-specific CB<sub>1</sub>R null obese mice. In line with these findings, overexpression of CB<sub>1</sub>R in hepatocytes of lean mice inhibited leptin-induced STAT3 phosphorylation. These results, linking CB<sub>1</sub>R with hepatic leptin signaling, may significantly advance our understanding of CB<sub>1</sub>R’s role in modulating hepatic gluconeogenesis and insulin sensitivity as well as lipid metabolism. Indeed, genetic deletion of CB<sub>1</sub>R in hepatocytes partially protects mice from developing DIO-related hepatic steatosis, hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, and insulin resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Osei-Hyiaman et al., 2008</xref>), whereas its overexpression in hepatocytes contributes to insulin resistance via inhibition of insulin signaling and clearance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Liu et al., 2012</xref>). In this sense, given that leptin regulates lipid, glucose, and insulin homeostasis in the liver, and that these metabolic functions are impaired in rodent models of increased eCB/CB<sub>1</sub>R ‘tone’, a role of CB<sub>1</sub>R-induced hepatic leptin resistance in regulating these processes can be postulated.</p><p>In accordance with our findings, Palomba and colleagues reported that CB<sub>1</sub>R activation interferes with leptin's activity in hypothalamic ARC neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Palomba et al., 2015</xref>). On the other hand, opposite findings were reported by Bosier and colleagues, demonstrating that pharmacological or genetic deletion of CB<sub>1</sub>R in astrocytes downregulates Ob-Rb expression and leptin-mediated functional responses, whereas JZL195 (a dual MAGL and FAAH inhibitor) upregulates these features (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bosier et al., 2013</xref>). These differences can be explained by the distinct roles hepatocytes, astrocytes, and neurons play in peripheral and central metabolic regulations, and by cell-specific roles for CB<sub>1</sub>R in this regulation. As our findings demonstrate a similar effect of hepatic CB<sub>1</sub>R activation/overexpression or blockade/deletion on the different isoforms of LEPR, it seems equally possible that hepatic CB<sub>1</sub>R may affect DIO-related hepatic leptin resistance by not only modulating sOb-R levels, which controls leptin’s activity, but also by modulating the expression of Ob-Rb in hepatocytes. Further investigations would allow us to differentiate between these two pathways.</p><p>Obesity is often characterized by an ER stress and consequently an adaptive unfolded protein response (UPR), operated by three parallel sensors: activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6), inositol requiring enzyme 1α (IRE1α), and protein kinase R-like ER kinase (PERK) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Walter and Ron, 2011</xref>). The activation of the latter induces the phosphorylation of eIF2α, which, in turn, inhibits transcription and protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Ron, 2002</xref>). In case of an extreme ER stress conditions, CHOP is activated by the PERK signaling pathway and executes ER stress-mediated apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Zinszner et al., 1998</xref>). In fact, ER stress has been shown to contribute to the development of hypothalamic leptin resistance, by impairing the transport of leptin across the BBB and suppressing STAT3 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">El-Haschimi et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hosoi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Ozcan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>). In addition, under physiological conditions, excess nutrients increases the demand for protein synthesis by the liver, leading to ER stress and UPR activation, which resolves the stress within hours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Oyadomari et al., 2008</xref>). Nevertheless, chronic ER stress in the liver was demonstrated in both obese mice and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Ozcan et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Puri et al., 2008</xref>). Here we demonstrate that obese mice had elevated levels of phosphorylated eIF2α, indicating increased ER stress, an effect that was reversed by peripheral CB<sub>1</sub>R blockade and was absent in LCB1 cKO. These findings are in agreement with our previous reports, where we reported that a neutral CB<sub>1</sub>R antagonist (AM6545) has the ability to reduce the HFD-induced upregulation in hepatic eIF2α (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Tam et al., 2010</xref>), and that hepatic activation of CB<sub>1</sub>R induces ER stress and contributes to insulin resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Liu et al., 2012</xref>). Unexpectedly, we found that the hepatic gene and protein levels of CHOP and its upstream regulator ATF4 were significantly decreased in obese mice, and were upregulated by peripheral CB<sub>1</sub>R blockade. This observation, although counterintuitive, is conceptually in agreement with several previous reports that describe a modulated UPR signaling with altered sensitivity or output that might implicate conditions of persistence/repeated stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chambers et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gomez and Rutkowski, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Preissler et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Yang et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Apart from its role in ER stress-mediated apoptosis, CHOP has been implicated in regulating other processes such as inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Endo et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Nakayama et al., 2010</xref>), insulin resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Maris et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Song et al., 2008</xref>), and adiposity. Specifically in the liver, Chikka and colleagues suggest that CHOP is a suppressor of key regulators of lipid metabolism like <italic>Cebpa, Ppara,</italic> and <italic>Srebf1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chikka et al., 2013</xref>), and demonstrate that CHOP-deficient mice tend to develop hepatic steatosis in response to bortezomib-induced ER stress. This is in agreement with an earlier report describing higher body weight and adiposity in female CHOP KO mice compared to WT controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ariyama et al., 2007</xref>). In contrast, we show that male CHOP KO mice and their WT littermate controls gain comparable amount of weight and have similar body composition following exposure to an HFD for 14 weeks. Nevertheless, we did see a trend toward increased liver triglycerides.</p><p>An interesting observation was that the eCB ‘tone’ of lean and obese CHOP KO mice was comparable. To the best of our knowledge, a direct regulation of eCB synthesis or degradation by CHOP has never been described. Thus, our data imply a possible link between the two. In fact, it is possible that the higher basal eCB levels seen in CHOP KO mice in comparison with their littermate controls are the consequence of leptin’s reduced ability to inhibit AEA and 2-AG production. This may be due to the reduced level of sOb-R found in the liver of CHOP KO animals. This hypothesis, although not tested here and which needs further experimental corroboration, is in accordance with the findings of others who demonstrated such a mechanism in the hypothalamus and in adipocytes treated with leptin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Di Marzo et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Matias et al., 2006</xref>). In addition, JD5037 failed to reverse many of the metabolic abnormalities, such as HDL and LDL content as well as liver triglycerides in DIO CHOP KO mice. It also had much smaller effect on total body fat mass then in WT DIO mice, suggesting an obligatory role of CHOP in mediating the metabolic improvements induced by CB<sub>1</sub>R blockade. Whereas basal circulating levels of sOb-R were comparable between WT and CHOP KO mice, its levels were markedly lower in the liver of CHOP KO mice as well as cultured hepatocytes. Moreover, sOb-R remained low in these mice even on HFD, supporting a role for CHOP in regulating the synthesis of sOb-R in the liver. The failure of JD5037 to elevate sOb-R levels in obese CHOP KO mice places CHOP downstream of CB<sub>1</sub>R in this molecular cascade.</p><p>As mentioned earlier, the molecular signaling pathway(s) by which eCBs or CB<sub>1</sub>R regulates CHOP levels is outside the scope of this work. However, two possible mechanisms might be relevant. The first putative mechanism may involve Trib3, which is known to be induced in a broad range of cells and in response to multiple forms of cellular stress such as ER stress, excess of free fatty acids, oxidative stress, hypoxia, hyperglycemia, and toxins (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ord and Ord, 2017</xref>). Interestingly, it has been shown that Δ<sup>9</sup>-THC as well as synthetic cannabinoid agonists upregulate Trib3 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Blázquez et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carracedo et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Salazar et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Vara et al., 2011</xref>) to engage apoptosis in variable cancer models. Moreover, Cinar et al. demonstrated that hepatic CB<sub>1</sub>R induces ER stress in hepatocytes by increasing de novo synthesis of ceramides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cinar et al., 2014</xref>), which are also involved in Trib3 upregulation following ER stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carracedo et al., 2006</xref>). In line with our observation that Trib3 levels are negatively correlated with ATF4, CHOP, and sOb-R and are elevated following direct or indirect activation of CB<sub>1</sub>R, we suggest that Trib3 is a molecular linker between CB<sub>1</sub>R and the ATF4/CHOP complex. In fact, Trib3 directly interacts with and inhibits ATF4 and CHOP, forming a negative feedback on the regulation of their activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ohoka et al., 2005</xref>). This Trib3-induced negative modulation of ATF4 and CHOP has been suggested to contribute to the fine-tuning of ATF4- and CHOP-dependent transcription in stressed cells, such as hepatocytes exposed to fatty acid flux. With the extensive body of evidence demonstrating a wide range of molecules that are known to regulate Trib3 expression, our current findings highlight CB<sub>1</sub>R as a novel possible modulator that regulates Trib3 transcription, thus suggesting that CB<sub>1</sub>R activation may disrupt the ER stress signaling pathway involving eIF2α, ATF4, and CHOP. However, the molecular events that link CB<sub>1</sub>R and Trib3 require further assessment, and direct regulation of ATF4 by CB<sub>1</sub>R cannot be excluded. Second possible mechanism has to do with CHOP being a cAMP responsive protein, so its expression is induced via a cAMP response element (CRE) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Conkright et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Pomerance et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Ramji and Foka, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Wilson and Roesler, 2002</xref>). CB<sub>1</sub>R, a G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR), which upon activation recruits Gi protein, can inhibit the activity of adenylyl cyclase and reduce the levels of cAMP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Turu and Hunyady, 2010</xref>). It is therefore plausible that a decline in cAMP following CB<sub>1</sub>R activation inhibits CHOP transcription. This hypothesis is more appealing if one considers the pivotal role of cAMP in regulating liver metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Wahlang et al., 2019</xref>), and takes into account the fact that reduced levels of cAMP were documented in HFD-fed mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Zingg et al., 2017</xref>). Yet, further studies will need to explore the specific molecular pathways linking together hepatic eCB/CB<sub>1</sub>R system and CHOP.</p><p>In conclusion, we report a new role for the hepatic eCB/CB<sub>1</sub>R in the development of hepatic leptin resistance, by reducing the expression and/or subsequent release of sOb-R (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). We show that peripherally restricted CB<sub>1</sub>R antagonism has the ability to restore sOb-R levels, contributing to the reversal of obesity-induced hyperleptinemia. We also suggest that upon CB<sub>1</sub>R blockade in hepatocytes, ATF4 as well as CHOP levels are upregulated via reduced Trib3 expression. CHOP, in turn, directly binds the LEPR promoter and promotes the expression of sOb-R.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>An illustration that describes the suggested molecular mechanism involving CB<sub>1</sub>R and C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) in the regulation of soluble isoform of leptin receptor (sOb-R) levels.</title><p>(Left) When overexpressed in the liver, activated by endocannabinoids during diet-induced obesity (DIO) or synthetic cannabinoids, such as noladin ether (NE, green squares), CB<sub>1</sub>R attenuates cAMP (pink circles) production by inhibiting adenylate cyclase (AC).

Animal studies are reported in compliance with the ARRIVE guidelines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">NC3Rs Reporting Guidelines Working Group et al., 2010</xref>), and are based on the rule of the replacement, refinement, or reduction. All the animals used in this study were housed under specific pathogen‐free (SPF) conditions, up to five per cage, in standard plastic cages with natural soft sawdust as bedding. The animals were maintained under controlled temperature of 22–24°C, humidity at 55 ± 5%, and alternating 12 hr light/dark cycles (lights were on between 7:00 and 19:00 hr), and provided with food and water ad libitum. C57Bl/6 (Envigo, Israel), LCB1 cKO, and hTgCB1 cKO (kindly provided by Dr. George Kunos, NIH) or B6.129S(Cg)-Ddit3<sup>tm2.1Dron</sup>/J (CHOP KO, The Jackson Laboratory #005530), and their WT littermate controls were used for in vivo experiments. All mice were male and 8–10 weeks old at the beginning of each experiment. To generate DIO (body weight &gt;42 g), mice were fed with a standard diet (STD; 14% Kcal fat, 24% Kcal protein, 62% Kcal carbohydrates; NIH-31 rodent diet) or a HFD (60% Kcal fat, 20% Kcal protein, and 20% Kcal carbohydrates; Research Diet, D12492) for 14 weeks. Then, obese mice were randomly divided into the experimental groups. Treatment with JD5037 (3 mg/kg, ip) or vehicle (1% Tween80, 4% DMSO, 95% Saline) was conducted for 7 days, and 12 hr following the last dose, the mice were euthanized by a cervical dislocation under anesthesia, and blood and livers were harvested for further analyses. For leptin sensitivity test, mice were fasted for 24 hr before an ip administration of recombinant mouse leptin (3 mg/kg). One hour following leptin administration, mice were euthanized and livers were harvested and processed for phosphorylated STAT3 detection using western blot.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Cell culture</title><p>WT or CHOP KO immortalized hepatocytes (described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Uzi et al., 2013</xref>), confirmed to be mycoplasma-negative, were maintained in DMEM (01-100-1A; Biological Industries, Israel) supplemented with 5% FCS, 100 mM glutamine, 100 mM Na-Pyruvate, and Pen/Strep.

At the end of incubation, cells were washed in 1× PBS, fixed with 1% formaldehyde for 10 min, then quenched with 125 mM glycine and harvested from plates. Following centrifugation, cells were resuspended in a lysis buffer and sonicated for 12 cycles of 30 s pulse followed by 30 s rest in 70% amplitude. Sheared DNA was diluted in a ChIP dilution buffer and pre-cleared with magnetic ProteinG-sepharose beads for 4 hr at 4°C. Ten percent of the lysate was removed and saved as ‘Input’. The rest of the lysate was divided and each part was incubated overnight at 4°C with 2.5 µg of either anti-H3 (ab1791, Abcam), anti-CHOP (2895S, Cell Signaling), or IgG isotype control. Antibody-chromatin complexes were precipitated with magnetic protein G-Sepharose beads, washed with low salt, high salt, lithium chloride, and Tris-EDTA buffers.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and David James as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: George Kunos (Reviewer #1); Vincenzo Di Marzo (Reviewer #2); Thomas Scherer (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, we are asking editors to accept without delay manuscripts, like yours, that they judge can stand as <italic>eLife</italic> papers without additional data, even if they feel that they would make the manuscript stronger. Thus the revisions requested below only address clarity and presentation.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Leptin resistance is a major pathogenic factor in obesity and both central and peripheral mechanisms have been implicated in its development. Circulating leptin bound to a short form of soluble leptin receptor (sOb-R encoded by Ob-Re) cannot bind to the functional leptin receptor, resulting in reduced levels of free leptin that can cross the blood-brain-barrier. Circulating levels of sOb-R are inversely related to plasma leptin levels, suggesting that they play a key role in the control of leptin sensitivity. Activation of the endocannabinoid/CB<sub>1</sub> receptor system is known to mediate obesity-related leptin resistance in rodents, and Tam and co-workers present elegant evidence for a novel mechanism by which endocannabinoids acting via hepatocyte CB<sub>1</sub>R down-regulate the hepatic expression and circulating levels of sOb-R, thus contributing to leptin resistance.</p><p><italic>Reviewer 1:</italic></p><p>1) Pharmacological (CB<sub>1</sub> agonist/antagonist) as well as genetic tools (liver-specific CB<sub>1</sub> ko and ki) are used to convincingly demonstrate that CB<sub>1</sub>R activation downregulates Ob-Re mRNA and sOb-R protein in the liver and in the circulation. Surprisingly, CB<sub>1</sub>R signal via reducing the expression of the pro-apoptotic transcription factor CHOP, an integral component of the PERK/eIF2α/ATF4/CHOP ER-stress pathway, as supported through the use of CHOP-/- mice. While the evidence is convincing, it is counterintuitive. ER-stress induced by a high fat diet was reported to upregulate rather than reduce CHOP expression in the liver (e.g. Bae et al., Molecules 25:2667, 2020) and the authors' own finding of increased eIF2α phosphorylation, which is upstream from CHOP, should result in increased rather than decreased CHOP expression. Could CB<sub>1</sub> receptor activation disrupt this pathway at a point between eIF2α and CHOP? Could a Trib3-mediated decrease in ATF4 phosphorylation represent such a 'break'? This could be tested by monitoring ATF4 phosphorylation in the authors' paradigm. At a minimum, this paradox needs to be discussed.</p><p>2) In the subsection “CHOP contributes to the metabolic response to peripheral CB<sub>1</sub>R blockade”, the loss of ability of the CB<sub>1</sub> antagonist to reverse the CB<sub>1</sub>-induced dyslipidemic effects (Figures 3H, I, J) in CHOP-/- mice is attributed to an increase in 'endocannabinoid tone', or more specifically a ~2-3-fold increase in the tissue levels of the endocannabinoids anandamide and 2-AG. In the absence of dose-response data, there is no reason to believe that a modest increase in the local concentration of endogenous agonists would result in the loss of effect of a highly potent competitive antagonist. It is more likely that the genetic deletion of an obligatory downstream mediator (CHOP) of the CB<sub>1</sub> response is responsible for the loss of the effect of the antagonist. In this case the unchanged response to HFD may be mediated by a non-CB<sub>1</sub> mechanism.</p><p>3) A limitation of the impact of these findings is that they may not be extended to human physiology, as in humans circulating sOb-R is generated exclusively by ectodomain shedding catalyzed by the proteolytic enzymes ADAM10 and ADAM17, whose expression remained unchanged (Discussion). However, only mRNA was measured, which does not exclude possible changes in enzyme protein levels or enzyme activity. This limitation needs to be mentioned/discussed.</p><p>4) The authors demonstrate that obesity leads to loss of leptin sensitivity in the wild-type, but not in LCB1ko liver, as indicated by the loss of leptin-induced STAT3 phosphorylation in the former but not the latter. These important findings should be more prominently highlighted in the Discussion, which should also briefly touch on what's known about the effects of leptin in the liver (e.g. regulation of hepatic insulin sensitivity).</p><p><italic>Reviewer 2:</italic></p><p>1) There are points in the Introduction and Discussion that need however to be ameliorated, through minor but nevertheless important corrections, as detailed below:</p><p>a) In general, the reader may wonder why the authors decided to investigate the role of CHOP in the effects of CB<sub>1</sub>R on sObR levels. This should be very briefly mentioned in the Introduction.</p><p>b) In the Introduction, the authors mention that the eCB system is overactive in obesity without quoting one of the first paper showing that this is true not only in the hypothalamus but also in peripheral cells, including the major source of leptin, i.e. the adipocytes (Matias et al., 2006). This should be mentioned; additionally, Monteleone et al., 2005, showed probably for the first time the elevation of circulating anandamide levels in overweight/obese women with binge eating disorder, again to be mentioned here;</p><p>c) In the Discussion, when referring to leptin signaling in anorexia nervosa, the authors should again mention the Monteleone et al., 2005 study, showing how anandamide levels are also elevated in women with this disorder, possibly due to their low leptin levels;</p><p>d) the above mentioned study by Matias et al., 2006, showed how both acute and chronic leptin significantly downregulates both anandamide and 2-AG levels in adipocytes (Figure 1 of that paper). This finding could be related to, or even explain, the authors' finding of higher eCB levels in CHOP-KO mice, which, by producing much less sObR, would counteract this inhibition of eCB levels also in adipocytes, by disinhibiting it. Since the authors did not provide a molecular mechanism for this effect, they may wish to discuss this possibility, especially if they have data showing that also in hepatocytes, like in adipocytes and hypothalamus, leptin decreases endocannabinoid levels via sObR (but also if they don't have such data).</p><p><italic>Reviewer 3:</italic></p><p>1) From a methodological viewpoint the study is well executed, however what I am missing a bit is the discussion of the physiologic significance and relevance of the findings for the field. This is relevant, because the exact role of the soluble leptin receptor for leptin action is not fully resolved in the current literature. Since the liver-specific CB<sub>1</sub>R transgenic mice on CB<sub>1</sub>R-null background are resistant to diet induced obesity, despite lower soluble leptin receptor expression raises the question whether the observed phenomenon is relevant for overall leptin action, which is predominantly mediated via the CNS. In the CB<sub>1</sub>R transgenic mice central leptin action seems (based on the resistance to DIO) preserved or at least not majorly impaired, despite lower secretion of soluble leptin receptor, questioning the overall physiologic relevance of the observed reduction in soluble leptin receptor for whole body leptin action. Do the authors have additional data on leptin signaling (in liver and brain) in the transgenic mice?</p><p>2) The claim that the regulation of soluble leptin receptor secretion via liver CB<sub>1</sub>R directly relates to liver leptin resistance is in my opinion not fully supported. The authors only present STAT3 phospho western blot data in CB<sub>1</sub> KO and WT mice, but not the CB<sub>1</sub>R transgenic/CHOP KO mice. Direct effects of the endocannabinoid system on STAT3 signaling can thus not be excluded. I suggest deleting the claim from the title/Abstract. The authors should rather expand on this theory in the Discussion.</p><p>3) Circulating leptin levels (Figure 4F) in CHOP KO vs. WT JD5037 treated mice on HFD seem to correlate with fat mass (Figure 3F) rather than soluble leptin receptor levels. Are there any correlation data that would support the claim that soluble leptin receptor levels directly affects circulating leptin levels?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.60771.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer 1:</p><p>1) Pharmacological (CB<sub>1</sub> agonist/antagonist) as well as genetic tools (liver-specific CB<sub>1</sub> ko and ki) are used to convincingly demonstrate that CB<sub>1</sub>R activation downregulates Ob-Re mRNA and sOb-R protein in the liver and in the circulation.

At a minimum, this paradox needs to be discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to thank the reviewer for finding our data convincing and important.</p><p>As stated by the reviewer, high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity is known to upregulate ER-stress in the liver. We have previously demonstrated it (Tam et al., 2010) and are currently reporting it here by showing the increased hepatic phosphorylation of eIF2α (Figure 3—figure supplement 1). Indeed, the reduced transcriptional expression levels of CHOP are counterintuitive. Yet, as suggested by the reviewer, this could be explained via a CB<sub>1</sub>R-dependent regulation of either ATF4 or Trib3. The latter is upregulated in response to diverse forms of cellular stress (such as ERstress, excess free fatty acid, oxidative stress, hypoxia, hyperglycemia, and toxins; reviewed in Örd and Örd, 2017), and also by cannabinoids. Trib3 is able to directly bind and inhibit ATF4 and CHOP. In fact, our data support such a molecular mechanism, since both HFD and CB<sub>1</sub>R activation upregulate the mRNA and protein expression of Trib3 in the liver/hepatocytes and peripheral CB<sub>1</sub>R blockade in HFD-induced obese mice normalizes its expression (Figure 6—figure supplement 1).</p><p>Following the comment raised by the reviewer, we expanded our evidence for such a regulation and assessed the hepatic mRNA and protein expression levels of ATF4 in three animal settings: WT mice (STD- and HFD-fed animals treated with/without the peripherally restricted CB<sub>1</sub>R blocker, JD5037), liver-specific CB<sub>1</sub> null mice (LCB1 KO, STD vs. HFD), and animals with overexpression of CB<sub>1</sub>R only in hepatocytes (htgCB1<sup>-/-</sup> mice, fed STD, or HFD). As can be seen in the new Figure 6—figure supplement 2, the hepatic ATF4 expression is downregulated in DIO mice, an effect that was completely normalized by peripheral CB<sub>1</sub>R blockade. Also, whereas nullification of CB<sub>1</sub>R in hepatocytes prevented the HFD-induced downregulation of ATF4, overexpression of the former in hepatocytes significantly contributes to the reduced expression of the latter. In addition, preliminary studies conducted in our lab revealed that direct CB<sub>1</sub>R activation by AEA in primary mouse hepatocytes results in a time-dependent reduction in ATF4 and CHOP mRNA levels (please see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>).</p><fig id="sa2fig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-60771-resp-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Taken together, these findings support the idea that although ER stress is induced in the liver by HFD, the activation/blockade (or genetic deletion) of CB<sub>1</sub>R disrupts the conventional unfolded protein response (UPR) by affecting ATF4 expression, either directly, or indirectly via Trib3. These new findings are now described in the subsection “CHOP plays a key role in the regulation of sOb-R by the eCB/CB<sub>1</sub>R system”, and are further discussed in the Discussion. We have also amended the illustration that describes the molecular mechanism by which CB<sub>1</sub>R regulates sOb-R levels (please see the revised Figure 7).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) In the subsection “CHOP contributes to the metabolic response to peripheral CB<sub>1</sub>R blockade”, the loss of ability of the CB<sub>1</sub> antagonist to reverse the CB<sub>1</sub>-induced dyslipidemic effects (Figures 3H, I, J) in CHOP-/- mice is attributed to an increase in 'endocannabinoid tone', or more specifically a ~2-3-fold increase in the tissue levels of the endocannabinoids anandamide and 2-AG.

It is more likely that the genetic deletion of an obligatory downstream mediator (CHOP) of the CB<sub>1</sub> response is responsible for the loss of the effect of the antagonist. In this case the unchanged response to HFD may be mediated by a non-CB<sub>1</sub> mechanism.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is right. The elevated endocannabinoid 'tone' in the CHOP KO mice were not directly linked to the reduced effect of JD5037 in ameliorating dyslipidemia and hepatic steatosis. If our statement was misleading, we apologize for it. Based on our findings, CHOP plays an obligatory role in the CB<sub>1</sub>R-sOb-R cascade, and therefore, we agree with this reviewer that in CHOP KO animals the inability of JD5037 to ameliorate dyslipidemia is most likely related to the absence of CHOP. We amended the text accordingly (please see subsection “CHOP contributes to the metabolic response to peripheral CB<sub>1</sub>R blockade” and the Discussion).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) A limitation of the impact of these findings is that they may not be extended to human physiology, as in humans circulating sOb-R is generated exclusively by ectodomain shedding catalyzed by the proteolytic enzymes ADAM10 and ADAM17, whose expression remained unchanged (Discussion). However, only mRNA was measured, which does not exclude possible changes in enzyme protein levels or enzyme activity. This limitation needs to be mentioned/discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>The regulation of ADAM10 and ADAM17 is complex and involves transcription, dynamic trafficking, cellular localization, and activity. Indeed, the current study focused on the transcriptional regulation of sOb-R by the CB<sub>1</sub>R/CHOP signaling pathway. However, other Ob-R isoforms, also expressed in humans, display (at the gene and protein levels) a trend similar to ObRe following either CB<sub>1</sub>R activation or blockade. These isoforms (Ob-Ra, Ob-Rb) are substrates for ectodomain shedding and therefore their transcriptional regulation may indirectly influence sObR levels and be relevant to human physiology. Nonetheless, the novel CB<sub>1</sub>R-induced regulation of CHOP levels and activity is not limited to animals and may also be relevant to humans. We have discussed these issues in the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The authors demonstrate that obesity leads to loss of leptin sensitivity in the wild-type, but not in LCB1ko liver, as indicated by the loss of leptin-induced STAT3 phosphorylation in the former but not the latter.

As recommended by the reviewer, we have expanded the Introduction and Discussion accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer 2:</p><p>1) There are points in the Introduction and Discussion that need however to be ameliorated, through minor but nevertheless important corrections, as detailed below:</p><p>a) In general, the reader may wonder why the authors decided to investigate the role of CHOP in the effects of CB<sub>1</sub>R on sObR levels.

These observations are in line with the reviewer's suggestion, and as mentioned in the text, deciphering the molecular mechanism by which CHOP regulates eCB production is out of the scope of this paper and will require the utilization of Ob-R-deficient models and/or the use of leptin antagonists to draw such a conclusion. Nevertheless, we amended the Discussion and included a possible explanation to these documented findings.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer 3:</p><p>1) From a methodological viewpoint the study is well executed, however what I am missing a bit is the discussion of the physiologic significance and relevance of the findings for the field.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for finding our work to be well executed. We added a significance statement as well as discussed the relevance of our findings to human physiology in the Discussion (please also see our response to a similar comment raised by the first reviewer). In addition, the importance of our findings to the regulation of hepatic (peripheral) leptin resistance/sensitivity via CB<sub>1</sub>R was expanded on in the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>This is relevant, because the exact role of the soluble leptin receptor for leptin action is not fully resolved in the current literature. Since the liver-specific CB<sub>1</sub>R transgenic mice on CB<sub>1</sub>R-null background are resistant to diet induced obesity, despite lower soluble leptin receptor expression raises the question whether the observed phenomenon is relevant for overall leptin action, which is predominantly mediated via the CNS. In the CB<sub>1</sub>R transgenic mice central leptin action seems (based on the resistance to DIO) preserved or at least not majorly impaired, despite lower secretion of soluble leptin receptor, questioning the overall physiologic relevance of the observed reduction in soluble leptin receptor for whole body leptin action. Do the authors have additional data on leptin signaling (in liver and brain) in the transgenic mice?</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, a soluble leptin receptor is only one of the molecular mechanisms that may contribute to leptin sensitivity/resistance. Here, we reported its role in regulating hepatic leptin resistance. The hTgCB1<sup>-/-</sup> animals, despite producing less sOb-R, do not become obese because they lack CB<sub>1</sub>Rs everywhere except the liver. Central CB<sub>1</sub>Rs are required for the development of diet-induced obesity (DIO, as reported by Pang et al., Obesity, 2012), and are downstream of the effect that sOb-R has on leptin during the development of DIO, as expected. That is why hTgCB1<sup>-/-</sup> animals, although having reduced sOb-R levels, are resistant to DIO. This is also true for mice globally lacking CB<sub>1</sub>Rs, which are resistant to DIO and its metabolic consequences, despite a similar caloric intake during the diet period (Ravinet Trillou et al., 2004; Osei-Hyiaman et al., 2005), which also points to energy metabolism being directly regulated by central endocannabinoids.</p><p>Nevertheless, this does not, by any means, imply that sOb-R is without relevance for DIO and energy metabolism in WT animals. On the contrary, the observations of Lou et al., 2010 strongly support the importance of sOb-R when CB<sub>1</sub>Rs are present. Here, we basically used hTgCB1<sup>-/-</sup> animals to document the relevance of <italic>hepatic</italic> CB<sub>1</sub>R for the production of sOb-R, and show that indeed its overexpression in hepatocytes downregulates the expression of sOb-R, and that it contributes to hepatic leptin resistance. Following the reviewer's comment, we expanded our study and measured leptin signaling in the liver of hTgCB1<sup>-/-</sup> animals, and found an inability of leptin to induce hepatic STAT3 phosphorylation in these mice. These additional results (please see the revised Figure 1R, S, the subsection “Hepatic CB<sub>1</sub>R regulates sOb-R levels and leptin signalling” and the Discussion) further imply a key role for CB<sub>1</sub>R in modulating hepatic leptin signaling via regulating sOb-R levels.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The claim that the regulation of soluble leptin receptor secretion via liver CB<sub>1</sub>R directly relates to liver leptin resistance is in my opinion not fully supported. The authors only present STAT3 phospho western blot data in CB<sub>1</sub> KO and WT mice, but not the CB<sub>1</sub>R transgenic/CHOP KO mice. Direct effects of the endocannabinoid system on STAT3 signaling can thus not be excluded. I suggest deleting the claim from the title/Abstract. The authors should rather expand on this theory in the Discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this comment. As mentioned above, we have now provided evidence for the lack of hepatic leptin sensitivity in mice overexpressing CB<sub>1</sub>R in hepatocytes (see the revised Figure 1). We have also tested the ability of exogenous leptin to induce STAT3 phosphorylation in the liver of CHOP KO mice, and found reduced hepatic leptin sensitivity in the absence of CHOP (see the revised Figure 4G, H, and the subsection “CHOP plays a key role in the regulation of sOb-R by the eCB/CB<sub>1</sub>R system”), that is also in accordance with the reduced levels of sOb-R in these mice. We also discussed the relevance of hepatic leptin sensitivity and its regulation by CB<sub>1</sub>R (see the Discussion), and therefore decided to leave this claim in the title and Abstract. We hope that the reviewer, in light of the newly added data, also considers our claim now well-founded.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Circulating leptin levels (Figure 4F) in CHOP KO vs. WT JD5037 treated mice on HFD seem to correlate with fat mass (Figure 3F) rather than soluble leptin receptor levels. Are there any correlation data that would support the claim that soluble leptin receptor levels directly affects circulating leptin levels?</p></disp-quote><p>Many human and animal studies have demonstrated that sOb-R levels are inversely correlated with the plasma levels of leptin, BMI, and adiposity (Chan et al., 2002; Lahlou et al., 2000; Laimer et al., 2002; Ogier et al., 2002; Reinehr et al., 2005). The <italic>positive</italic> correlation between serum leptin concentrations and fat mass has been well demonstrated (Lonnqvist et al., 1995; Considine et al., 1996; Maffei et al., 1995).
