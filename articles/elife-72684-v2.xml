mediated differently. We examined connections between social reward and social selectivity, aggression, and oxytocin receptor signaling pathways in rodents that naturally form enduring, selective relationships with mates and peers (monogamous prairie voles) or peers (group-living meadow voles). Female prairie and meadow voles worked harder to access familiar versus unfamiliar individuals, regardless of sex, and huddled extensively with familiar subjects. Male prairie voles displayed strongly selective huddling preferences for familiar animals, but only worked harder to repeatedly access females versus males, with no difference in effort by familiarity. This reveals a striking sex difference in pathways underlying social monogamy and demonstrates a fundamental disconnect between motivation and social selectivity in males—a distinction not detected by the partner preference test. Meadow voles exhibited social preferences but low social motivation, consistent with tolerance rather than reward supporting social groups in this species. Natural variation in oxytocin receptor binding predicted individual variation in prosocial and aggressive behaviors. These results provide a basis for understanding species, sex, and individual differences in the mechanisms underlying the role of social reward in social preference.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>What factors drive the formation of social relationships can vary greatly in animals. While some individuals may be motivated to find social partners, others may just tolerate being around others. A desire to avoid strangers may also lead an individual to seek out acquaintances or friends. Sometimes a mix of these factors shape social behavior.</p><p>Studying motivation for social relationships in the laboratory is tricky. Traditional laboratory animals like mice and rats do not bond with specific peers or mates. But small burrowing rodents called voles are a more relationship-oriented alternative to mice and rats. Prairie voles form selective and enduring preferences for both their mates and familiar same-sex peers. Meadow voles on the other hand, live alone much of the year but move in with other animals over the winter.</p><p>Beery et al. show that social motivation in voles varies by relationship type, species and sex. In the experiments, voles were first trained to press a lever to get a food reward. Then, the food reward was swapped with access to familiar or unfamiliar voles. Female prairie voles strived to be with animals they knew rather than to be with strangers, while male prairie voles tried hard to access any female. In contrast, meadow voles did not overly exert themselves to access other animals.</p><p>Beery et al. then measured oxytocin receptor levels in the brains of prairie voles. Prairie voles that had more receptors for oxytocin in part of their brain known as the nucleus accumbens worked harder to access their familiar partner. But individuals with more oxytocin receptors in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis were more likely to attack an unfamiliar animal.</p><p>The meadow voles’ behavior suggests that they are more motivated by tolerance of familiar animals, while the female prairie voles may find it rewarding to be with animals they have bonded with. These differences may help explain why these two species of vole have evolved different social behaviors. The experiments also suggest that oxytocin – which is linked with maternal behavior – plays an important role in social motivation. Learning more about the biological mechanisms that underlie vole social behaviors may help scientists identify fundamental aspects of social behavior that may apply to other species including humans.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>prairie vole</kwd><kwd>meadow vole</kwd><kwd><italic>Microtus</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>Microtus ochrogaster</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>Microtus pennsylvanicus</italic></kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R15MH113085</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Beery</surname><given-names>Annaliese K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Prairie and meadow voles show striking sex and species differences in social motivation to access conspecifics of different types (familiar versus unfamiliar and same-sex versus opposite-sex).</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The brain regions and neurochemicals involved in social behaviors show remarkable conservation across species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">O’Connell and Hofmann, 2011</xref>). At the same time, social behavior is not a unified construct, with different species exhibiting distinct social structures and behavioral repertoires. The formation of selective social relationships is a particular hallmark of both human and prairie vole societies. Such relationships are difficult to study in traditional lab rodents because mice, rats, and other rodents typically do not form preferences for known peers or mates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Triana-Del Rio et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Schweinfurth et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Beery et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Cymerblit-Sabba et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Insel et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Beery and Shambaugh, 2021</xref>). In species that form specific relationships, selectivity may be based on reward and prosocial motivation toward specific individuals, or on avoidance (fear, aggression) of unfamiliar individuals. The role of social motivation and tolerance may also differ by familiarity, sex, and type of relationship (e.g. same-sex peer versus opposite-sex mate). Voles provide an opportunity to probe the role of selectivity and social reward across relationship types and social organization.</p><p>The reinforcing properties of social interaction have been demonstrated in a variety of rodent species and contexts, often through conditioned place preference for a socially associated environmental cue (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Panksepp and Lahvis, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Dölen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Goodwin et al., 2019</xref>). Operant conditioning for access to a social stimulus has been used to more directly measure motivation for specific types of social interaction, particularly access to pups, social play, and sexual opportunities (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Trezza et al., 2011</xref>). Social motivation has also been assessed with access to novel same-sex peers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Martin and Iceberg, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Achterberg et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Borland et al., 2017</xref>). Often social interactions are affiliative, but in some contexts animals will work for access to aggressive interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Azrin et al., 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Falkner et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Golden et al., 2017</xref>). To date, only one study has examined the role of familiarity in social motivation, in novelty-preferring female rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hackenberg et al., 2021</xref>), and none have done so with mate relationships.</p><p>Prairie voles, <italic>Microtus ochrogaster</italic>, and meadow voles, <italic>Microtus pennsylvanicus</italic>, both form selective social relationships but exhibit different social organization and mating systems. Prairie voles are socially monogamous, forming long-term selective relationships between males and females that have been studied for decades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Carter et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Walum and Young, 2018</xref>). Prairie voles also form selective relationships with familiar same-sex cage-mate ‘peers’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">DeVries et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Beery et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lee et al., 2019</xref>). Meadow voles are promiscuous breeders that transition to living in social groups and sharing nests during winter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Getz, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Madison and Mcshea, 1987</xref>). Under conditions of short daylength in the laboratory, female (but not male) meadow voles exhibit greater social huddling and less aggression than their long daylength counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Beery et al., 2008b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lee et al., 2019</xref>). These vole species thus allow comparison of the properties of peer relationships across species (prairie vole peers versus meadow vole peers) and relationship type within species (prairie vole mates versus prairie vole peers).</p><p>Prairie voles exhibit socially conditioned place preferences (sCPP) for familiar opposite-sex mates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Ulloa et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Goodwin et al., 2019</xref>), and in some circumstances for same-sex peers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lee and Beery, 2021</xref>). In contrast, meadow voles do not form sCPP and may even condition away from social cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Goodwin et al., 2019</xref>). Neurochemical pathways underlying social reward also vary between species and relationship type; dopamine is necessary for the formation of opposite-sex pair bonds in prairie voles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Aragona and Wang, 2009</xref>), but is not necessary for the formation of same-sex peer preferences in meadow or prairie voles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Beery and Zucker, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lee and Beery, 2021</xref>). These initial findings suggest that social selectivity may result from differential social motivation and tolerance in these species.</p><p>Voles demonstrate striking preferences for familiar versus novel peers and mates, assessed using the partner preference test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Williams et al., 1992b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Beery, 2021</xref>). This test quantifies preference, but as no effort is required to access a conspecific, it cannot distinguish between prosocial motivation and avoidance of unfamiliar conspecifics. To examine the role of motivation in relationships, we assessed effort expended by voles of different sexes (male, female), relationship types (same-sex, opposite-sex), and species (prairie vole, meadow vole) to reach social targets in an operant conditioning paradigm. Because the seasonal transition from solitary to social is most pronounced in female meadow voles in the field and laboratory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Madison and Mcshea, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Beery et al., 2009</xref>), only females of this species were used. Subjects underwent &gt;60 active training and testing days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Responses (lever presses) in lightly food-restricted voles were shaped and reinforced using a food reward, followed by 8 days of pressing for a food reward on a progressive ratio 1 (PR-1) schedule. Social testing consisted of 8 consecutive test days in which each reward consisted of 1 min of access to the familiar (same- or opposite-sex) partner, and 8 test days for which rewards consisted of access to different sex-matched strangers (order balanced within groups). We assessed effort expended to access familiar and novel social stimuli in four groups of prairie voles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>): females lever pressing for a female conspecific (F➤F), females pressing for a male conspecific (F➤M), males pressing for a male conspecific (M➤M), and males pressing for a female conspecific (M➤F). Meadow vole females (F➤F) were also trained and tested for 8 days of familiar and 8 days of novel vole exposure, counterbalanced. A subset of voles was used to explore the reward value of an empty chamber, extinguishing timelines, and relationships between oxytocin receptor (OTR) density and behavior.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Overview of apparatuses, timeline, and testing groups.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Lever pressing in voles was shaped and trained using food reinforcement.

We conducted receptor autoradiography to assess variation in neural OTR density in female prairie voles. (OTR was not analyzed in male brains; following early results, later males were used to pilot a two-choice social operant paradigm.)</p><p>Together these studies allowed us to examine how the reward value of social contact differs between male and female prairie voles, between opposite-sex and same-sex pairings, and between meadow and prairie vole FF pairings. We found both similarities in and striking differences between social motivation across species, sexes, and pairing types. Detailed examination of social behaviors during social access further underscored the distinction between social motivation and familiarity preference, especially in males. In addition to these group differences in social motivation, individual differences in OTR density were related to aggressive and prosocial behaviors.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Sex-specific patterns of social effort in prairie voles</title><p>In order to assess motivation for different kinds of social stimuli across groups, lever pressing responses were quantified on a progressive ratio schedule (PR-1). Males and females showed qualitatively different response patterns in the social chambers, as well as significant interaction between sex and variables of interest in a model screening for sex differences (sex*stimulus type (p = 0.01), sex*stimulus familiarity (p = 0.09)), so responses were further analyzed separately by sex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Beery, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Beltz et al., 2019</xref>). For each sex, two-way repeated measures ANOVA (RM-ANOVA) was performed with familiarity of the tethered stimulus (partner/stranger) as the within-subjects/repeated measure, and sex of the tethered stimulus (opposite-sex/same-sex) as a between-subjects measure. Female prairie voles pressed more for familiar partners than unfamiliar strangers, with no effect of opposite-sex versus same-sex pairings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, effect of stimulus familiarity: F<sub>(1, 14)</sub> = 15.17, p = 0.0016, η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup>p20.52; no effect of stimulus sex: F<sub>(1, 14)</sub> = 0.44, p = 0.51, η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup>p20.03; subject matching: F<sub>(14, 14)</sub> = 4.2, p = 0.0057, η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup>p20.81, no significant interaction).

In females, lever pressing effort was based on familiarity of the social target (partner versus stranger), but did not differ between same-sex (FF) and opposite-sex (FM) housed pairs. Because testing occurred with only the partner or stranger present at any given time, failure to spend time in the stranger chamber indicates lack of interest in the stranger, as opposed to relative preference for a better option. Females also exhibited extensive partner huddling and time spent in the chamber of a partner but not a stranger. These preferences persisted when scaled by rewards (i.e. time the subject was available), indicating strong selectivity in social preferences. Social motivation thus paralleled social selectivity in females.</p><p>Male prairie voles exhibited similarly strong selectivity in huddling and chamber preferences, consistent with decades of work showing partner preferences in both male and female prairie voles. In contrast, males showed no propensity to work harder to access a familiar vole than an unfamiliar social target, but instead worked significantly harder to access an opposite-sex social target than a same-sex social target. This reveals a dissociation between social motivation and markers of social bond formation such as huddling in males. This sex difference in motivated behavior is consistent with the hypothesis that outwardly similar partner preferences in males and females result from latent differences in underlying signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">De Vries, 2004</xref>). Oxytocin, dopamine, and opioid signaling all affect partner preferences in males and females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Williams et al., 1992a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Gingrich et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aragona et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Burkett et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Resendez et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Johnson et al., 2016</xref>), but prairie voles also exhibit sex differences in these signaling pathways (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Winslow et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Martin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Ulloa et al., 2018</xref>). These latent differences in mechanisms underlying social bonding may support similar partner preference behavior while promoting sex differences in social motivation.</p><p>Factors that may particularly motivate males to access unfamiliar females include opportunities for mating and aggression. Male prairie voles exhibit multiple mating strategies in field settings, including both a socially monogamous ‘resident’ partner strategy, and a ‘wanderer’ strategy; however, even residents engage in extra-pair copulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Madrid et al., 2020</xref>). Interest in non-partners can also result from motivation for aggressive behavior; for example, the opportunity for aggression is rewarding in dominant male mice (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Golden et al., 2019</xref>). That does not seem to be the case in male prairie voles, however. Aggression toward partners was rare, and response rate was not correlated with aggression toward a stranger in male prairie voles tested with females or males. Aggressive bouts in male prairie voles tested with strangers initially appeared correlated with lever pressing effort, but this effect disappeared when scaled by access time, unlike effects reported for huddling/access time. When social interest is high (e.g. males for unfamiliar females), it is still possible that males would press more for their partners if placed in direct opposition to a stranger, and this is an avenue for future investigation.</p><p>The lack of consistent mapping between effort in the operant task and partner preferences in male huddling highlights a disconnect between social reward and the selectivity of huddling preferences. This disconnect is further underscored by the presence of robust partner preferences in female meadow voles despite no evidence of social reward in the operant task or in sCPP tests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Goodwin et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, partner preference does not imply social reward, nor does social reward imply selective preference. These behavioral findings are consistent with the lack of effects of dopamine antagonists on same-sex peer partner preferences in female meadow voles as well as prairie voles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Beery and Zucker, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lee and Beery, 2021</xref>). While dopamine signaling is not necessary for peer partner preference expression, it can enhance preferences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lee and Beery, 2021</xref>) and may play a more fundamental role in pair bonding with mates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Aragona and Wang, 2009</xref>). Because partner preference does not indicate behavioral reward, the partner preference test and other tests of social approach in the absence of work likely reflect different combinations of partner tolerance, partner reward, and stranger aversion.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>OTR signaling differs by relationship type and by individual social behaviors</title><p>Strong relationships were present between OTR density, housing differences, and behavior, highlighting connections across levels of organization.

Females of both species pressed more for partners than for strangers, but responses were lower in meadow voles, indicative of the lack of social reward. This is consistent with prior findings from sCPP tests, in which meadow voles did not condition toward a bedding associated with social contact, and in one setting conditioned away from it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Goodwin et al., 2019</xref>). These findings are also in line with results from the sole prior study of operant responses in voles. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Matthews et al., 2013</xref>, tested prairie voles and meadow voles housed in long daylengths to determine whether they would learn to lever press for stranger voles.

Nonetheless, even under pro-social short daylength conditions used in the present study, social pressing was low in meadow voles. Comparison of short daylength-housed female meadow vole responses for the partner chamber, stranger chamber, and an empty chamber in different trial blocks revealed equivalent levels of pressing for a partner or an empty chamber and less for the stranger. This suggests that decreased pressing for the stranger represents avoidance, but that pressing for the partner may indicate tolerance more than reward. Female (short daylength-housed) meadow voles also exhibited lower aggression than female prairie voles, consistent with social tolerance, and with prior descriptions of their behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lee et al., 2019</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Comparability across vole species and sexes</title><p>Lever pressing was demonstrated to be an effective metric to compare effort exerted to reach different social stimuli in voles; voles of each species and sex tested pressed at comparable rates for food reward, indicating a lack of major differences in task learning, and thus that social lever pressing can be assessed and compared across groups. Subject response rates were not consistently high or low across reward conditions, indicating that responses are reward-specific. Extinction was effective, with all subjects decreasing lever pressing behavior by more than half their baseline response count. Differences in lever pressing effort between groups could therefore be attributed to reward-specific differences in social motivation.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Implications for the evolution of social relationships</title><p>Persistent relationships within specific pairs or groups of conspecifics are present throughout the animal kingdom, including species of invertebrates, fishes, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bales et al., 2021</xref>). While the nature and extent of these relationships vary considerably, they share in common the specificity of social preferences that leads to repeated association. They may differ, however, in the mechanisms that influence familiar approach and unfamiliar avoidance. In particular, familiar individuals—whether mates or peers—may or may not be socially rewarding, and unfamiliar individuals may or may not be aversive.</p><p>Even within closely related vole species, we see evidence that only some relationships involve selective social reward, for example, mate relationships in female prairie voles, while others—such as peer relationships in winter phenotype meadow voles—involve selectivity without appreciable reward. Selectivity in the absence of reward may rely instead on changing social anxiety and aggression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Beery, 2019</xref>). For example, when exposed to the short, winter photoperiods associated with the transition from solitary to group living in the wild, meadow voles undergo changes in CRF (corticotropin-releasing factor) receptor densities, glucocorticoid secretion, behavioral indicators of anxiety, and aggression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ossenkopp et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Beery et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anacker et al., 2016</xref>). More research is needed to establish causal links between these changes and the transition to group living. More broadly, it remains to be determined to what extent social monogamy and pair bonding with mates shares mechanisms across species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Goodson, 2013</xref>), and to what extent different types of relationships (e.g. with peers or mates) share foundations, or differ in their regulation. Ultimately, these studies should help us understand how selective relationships of different types evolve.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>While other studies have assessed social reward in rodents, few have considered the role of stimulus familiarity, likely because laboratory rodents do not exhibit familiarity preferences under normal conditions (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Beery and Shambaugh, 2021</xref>). In social choice tests, mice and young rats often prefer social novelty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Moy et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Smith et al., 2015</xref>), and relative preference for a social stimulus versus a food stimulus is greater when novel rats are presented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Reppucci et al., 2020</xref>). Indeed, in operant trials in which rats had simultaneous access to familiar and unfamiliar same-sex conspecifics, rats expended more effort to access unfamiliar conspecifics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hackenberg et al., 2021</xref>). In the present study, female prairie voles exhibited similar partner preferences but higher social motivation and aggression compared to female meadow voles. Social motivation and selectivity were not linked in male prairie voles, and there was a striking sex difference in the reward value of mates and peers in prairie voles. OTR binding revealed connections between social environment, receptor density, and prosocial behavior, illustrating the importance of this system across levels of biological organization. Better understanding of the interface between social motivation and social selectivity will thus be key to improving our understanding of the nature of social relationships.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Chemical compound, drug</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">(Thr⁴,Gly⁷)-Oxytocin</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Bachem</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">4013837</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"> </td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Chemical compound, drug</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><sup>125</sup>I-OVTA; <sup>125</sup>I-ornithine vasotocin analog; vasotocin, d(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>5</sub> [Tyr(Me)<sub>2</sub>,Thr<sup>4</sup>,Orn<sup>8</sup>,(<sup>125</sup>I)Tyr<sup>9</sup>-NH<sub>2</sub>]</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Perkin Elmer</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">NEX254050UC</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"> </td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Chemical compound, drug</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Testosterone</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Sigma-Aldrich</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">T1500</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Software, algorithm</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">MED-PC IV</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Med Associates</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">SOF-735</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animal subjects</title><p>Prairie voles and meadow voles from in-house colonies were bred in a long photoperiod (14 hr light:10 hr dark; lights off at 17:00 EST; described further in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lee et al., 2019</xref>).

Animals that met training criteria progressed to the experimental testing sequence, beginning with 8 days of pressing for a food reward on a PR-1 schedule (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Subjects in opposite-sex pairs were placed with either a tubally ligated, hormonally intact female mate, or a castrated and testosterone implanted male mate 5–10 days prior to the start of social habituation and testing. Subjects in same-sex pairs remained with their cage-mate. Social testing consisted of 8 days of PR-1 with rewards yielding access to the familiar (same- or opposite-sex) partner, and 8 days with access to a sex-matched stranger (order balanced within groups). Voles were trained and tested over seven cohorts; group membership was distributed across cohorts, and voles were assigned to groups within sex without knowledge of their response rates in the training phase. A subset of voles (those in cohorts 4–7) continued in empty chamber control and/or extinguishing tests as described below. Voles were sacrificed at the conclusion of testing, and brains were stored at –80°C.</p><p>We tested four groups of prairie voles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>): females lever pressing for a female conspecific (F➤F), females pressing for a male conspecific (F➤M), males pressing for a male conspecific (M➤M), and males pressing for a female conspecific (M➤F). Each group consisted of eight focal voles, tested for 8 days with their partner and for 8 days with a series of novel ‘strangers’, sex-matched to the partner. The order of testing (partner then stranger or stranger then partner) was counterbalanced within groups. Some voles did not complete both partner and stranger testing, in which case additional voles were added up to 8/group. Meadow vole females (F➤F-<italic>Mp</italic>, n = 7) were also trained and tested for 8 days of familiar and 8 days of novel vole exposure, with order counterbalanced within the group.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Operant conditioning and testing with food reward</title><p>Subjects were weighed for 3 consecutive days to establish baseline body weights, then food-restricted to a target weight of 90% baseline to enhance motivation for the food reward. Weights were recorded daily after training or testing, prior to being returned to their home-cages. Any vole that dropped to or below 85% of the baseline weight was returned to ad libitum food to avoid long-term health consequences. Perforated cage dividers were used during food restriction to ensure each vole had access to its specific ration (0.3–1 food pellets and ~4 g [half] of a baby carrot). Food restriction ended when subjects transitioned to social testing.</p><p>Operant conditioning was conducted in mouse-sized modular test chambers (30.5 cm × 24.1 cm × 21.0 cm) outfitted with a response lever, clicker, modular pellet dispenser for mouse, and pellet receptacle (Med Associates Inc, St Albans, VT, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Data were acquired using the MED-PC-IV program running training protocols coded by experimenters. Sessions lasted 30 min and took place between 0900 and 1700. Vole behavior was shaped using manual reinforcement by an experimenter until a subject met the training criterion of 3 days in a row of ≥5 responses without manual reinforcement on an FR-1 schedule. One 20 mg food pellet (Dustless Precision Pellet Rodent Grain Based Diet; Bio-Serv, Flemington, NJ) was dispensed as each reward. Animals that did not learn to consistently lever press within ~20 days were used as partners or strangers for future social testing. Subjects that met the training criterion transitioned to a PR-1 schedule with each successive reward requiring an additional response. The progressive ratio has been shown to be a better indicator of motivation than FR programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hodos and Kalman, 1963</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Weatherly et al., 2003</xref>). PR-1 testing was conducted for 8 days, at the conclusion of which all focal animals were returned to ad lib food, and cage dividers were removed.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Testing with social rewards</title><p>Social reward testing was conducted in mouse-sized modular test chambers, custom-equipped with a motorized door (Med Associates Inc, St Albans, VT) for access to a second ‘social’ chamber (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). This chamber was constructed of clear plastic (15 cm × 20.5 cm × 13 cm) and contained an eye-bolt for tethering a stimulus vole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). A clear plastic tunnel (2.54 cm diameter, 5.5 cm long) connected the operant chamber to the social chamber, and the entire apparatus was fixed to a mounting board. Lever presses were rewarded by door opening and chamber access; the door remained raised for 1 min, after which the experimenter returned the focal vole to the operant chamber. Sessions lasted 30 min and were video-recorded for quantification of additional behaviors.</p><p>Subjects transitioned to social testing following a habituation session and two FR-1 sessions. Habituation to the social apparatus took place with the door open and the lever covered: voles explored the apparatus for 15 min with an empty social chamber, and 15 min with the partner tethered in the social chamber. Two days of FR-1 pressing for a tethered vole followed habituation to ensure that subjects associated lever pressing with access to the social chamber and a stimulus vole.</p><p>Social testing took part in two phases: pressing for a partner vole on a PR-1 schedule and pressing for a stranger on a PR-1 schedule. Each phase lasted 8 days. The order of testing was counterbalanced within groups and subjects completed both phases. Social stimulus animals were tethered to the end of the social chamber. During the 8 days of stranger testing, the focal vole was tested against a novel vole each session to prevent familiarity between conspecifics.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Non-social conditions</title><p>Empty chamber testing took place after social testing to avoid altering lever pressing for the social stimuli. The empty chamber control was run to assess the value of apparatus exploration: 30 voles (10 female prairie voles, 14 male prairie voles, 6 female meadow voles) pressed the lever for 8 successive days on a PR-1 schedule to access the adjacent chamber when no stimulus vole was present. Sessions lasted 30 min and video was recorded and scored for behavior after testing. For the extinction phase, 31 voles (13 female prairie voles, 11 male prairie voles, 7 female meadow voles) were tested in the social chamber with an unrewarded lever for 10 successive days (30 min sessions).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Behavioral scoring</title><p>Counts of responses (lever presses) and rewards (food pellets or door raises) were automatically recorded during each test. In all social trials (16/vole) and all empty chamber control trials (8/vole), behavior in the ‘social’ chamber was also filmed with a portable digital video camera. Videos were scored using a custom perl script (OperantSocialTimer; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/BeeryLab/Operant/">https://github.com/BeeryLab/Operant/</ext-link>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Beery, 2017</xref>) to determine time in the social chamber, time in side-by-side contact with the tethered vole (huddling), and bouts of aggression. These values could also be reported relative to other intervals (e.g. time huddling/access time when the door was up, or time huddling/time in the social chamber). Non-social/empty chamber trials (8 days/vole) were also videotaped and analyzed for time in the social chamber/available time with the door raised.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Castration and tubal ligation</title><p>At least 1 week prior to pairing, the future ‘partner’ of each opposite-sex prairie vole pair was surgically altered to prevent pregnancies during testing. Female partners of male focal voles underwent tubal ligation. Dorsal incisions were made over each ovary. Two knots were placed below each ovary at the top of the uterine horn. The wound was closed using a sterile suture. Male partners of female focal voles were castrated and implanted with testosterone capsules. Testes were accessed by midline incision, and the blood supply was cut-off through a tie at the testicular artery. Testes were removed and the muscle wall and skin were closed using sterile suture. A testosterone capsule was implanted subcutaneously between the scapulae. Capsules contained 4 mm of crystalline testosterone (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO) in silastic tubing (ID 1.98 mm, OD 3.18 mm; Dow Corning, Midland, MO) as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Costantini et al., 2007</xref>. Capsules were sealed with silicone, dried, and soaked in saline for 24 hr prior to insertion. A subset of strangers was also castrated or ligated, with no effect on focal behavior. Surgical procedures were performed under isoflurane anesthesia. Voles received 0.05 mg/kg buprenorphine and 1.0 mg/kg metacam subcutaneously prior to surgery, and again the following day. Post-operative wound checks continued for up to 10 days post-surgery.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Receptor autoradiography</title><p>OTR binding density was assessed in the brains of 11 female prairie voles at the conclusion of the study (males were used for an additional pilot study). Frozen brains were sectioned coronally at 20 μm, thaw-mounted on Super-frost Plus slides (Fisher, Inc), and stored at –80°C until processing (as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Beery et al., 2008a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Beery and Zucker, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Mooney et al., 2015</xref>). Briefly, slides were thawed until dry, then fixed for 2 min in fresh, chilled 0.1% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M PBS. Sections were rinsed 2 × 10 min in 50 mM Tris (pH 7.4), and incubated for 60 min at room temperature in a solution (50 mM Tris, 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.1% BSA, 0.05% bacitracin, 50 pM radioligand) containing the radioactively labeled <sup>125</sup>I-ornithine vasotocin analog vasotocin, d(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>5</sub> [Tyr(Me)<sub>2</sub>,Thr<sup>4</sup>,Orn<sup>8</sup>,(<sup>125</sup>I)Tyr<sup>9</sup>-NH<sub>2</sub>] (<sup>125</sup>I-OVTA, PerkinElmer, Inc). An adjacent series of slides, processed for non-specific binding, was incubated with an additional 50 nM non-radioactive ligand [Thr<sup>4</sup>Gly<sup>7</sup>]-oxytocin (Bachem). All slides were rinsed 3 × 5 min in chilled Tris–MgCl<sub>2</sub> (50 mM Tris, 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, pH 7.4), dipped in cold distilled water, and air-dried. Sections were apposed to Kodak BioMax MR film (Kodak, Rochester, NY) for 3 days and subsequently developed. Radioligand binding density in each brain region was quantified in samples of uniform area from three adjacent sections for each brain region and averaged for each brain. Non-specific binding was subtracted from total binding to yield specific binding values.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>Social data were analyzed for all subjects completing both partner and stranger phases of testing (n = 8 prairie vole M➤M pairs, 8 prairie vole M➤F pairs, 8 prairie vole F➤F pairs, 8 prairie voles F➤M pairs, and 7 meadow vole F➤F pairs). Four additional female prairie voles completed testing with a partner or stranger only: data from these subjects was included in analysis of food responses and food versus social response rates. Group differences in single variables (e.g. food responses) were assessed by one-way ANOVA. Two-way RM-ANOVA was used to assess the effects of social factors, with stimulus familiarity [partner, stranger] as a within-subjects repeated measure, stimulus type [same-sex, opposite-sex] as a between-subjects (non-repeated) measure, a test for interaction effects [stimulus familiarity*stimulus type], and for subject matching. Paired t-tests were used within groups for comparison of behavior toward the partner versus stranger. Response count (i.e. lever presses) and breakpoint (i.e. number of rewards achieved) are highly correlated; detailed results are therefore shown for only one measure (response count). Response rate (responses/active session time) was used when comparing food responses to social responses, as the lever was continuously active during food-rewarded testing (active session time = 30 min), but was not capable of raising the door when it was already up (active session time = 30 min with the door up). Autoradiography data were collected in multiple brain regions, and comparisons were performed by two-way ANOVA (group*brain region). Statistical analyses were performed in JMP 15.0 (SAS, Inc) and Prism 9 (GraphPad Software Inc). Effect sizes were calculated in Excel. Cohen’s d for paired t-tests used the mean of partner-stranger differences/standard deviation of partner-stranger differences. Eta squared (η<sup>2</sup>) and partial eta squared (η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup>) were reported for one-way and two-way ANOVAs, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lakens, 2013</xref>). Pearson’s product-moment correlation coefficient was reported for correlations. All tests were two-tailed, and results were deemed significant at p &lt; 0.05. Number of animals: social operant studies in rats have been successful with six subjects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tan and Hackenberg, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hiura et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hackenberg et al., 2021</xref>). We used 30% more subjects as a buffer (eight females or males in each condition), as operant behavior in voles was not well characterized.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Project administration, Supervision, Validation, Visualization, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Investigation, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>This study was carried out in accordance with the recommendations of the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health.

The authors show that females will work harder to access familiar individuals (either pair-bonded males or same-sex females) while males will work to access females regardless of whether they are pair-bonded or unfamiliar. These results cast a new light on decades of work based partner-preference tests that assess pair bonds without considering motivation.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Social selectivity and social motivation in voles&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Michael Taffe as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Karen Bales (Reviewer #3).</p><p>Overall, the reviewers were enthusiastic about the application of operant methods to study attachments in the different species of voles.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The lack of data using a progressive ratio schedule was viewed as a weakness for evaluating sex differences in motivation. If these data can be collected the reviewers agreed that this would significantly strengthen the claims in the manuscript. If these data can not be collected quickly the authors should address this limitation in the discussion.</p><p>2) The absence of male oxytocin receptor autoradiography data was also viewed as a weakness. If these data are available (null or otherwise) they should be included. The genotyping data were viewed as being tangential to the main theme of the paper and reviewers agreed these data should be removed.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>My main suggestion is for the authors to highlight how their results change how we view the results of partner preference tests in the abstract and discussion. I think it would be helpful for the authors to go into a little more depth about the difference between actively seeking out a partner (or female) versus more passively huddling (in the case of animals with an opposite sex partner) when the partner is available.

We also cite references supporting the preferability of progressive ratio schedules in our description of the methods. A fixed ratio schedule was used in some parts of training (initial introduction to food rewards and habituation to the social testing paradigm), but a progressive ratio was used for all experimental phases.</p><p>We have identified two ways to make this information more accessible throughout the manuscript.</p><p>1. The testing protocol was described in greatest detail in the methods section which appears <italic>after</italic> the Results section. We have thus added text highlighting the progressive ratio protocol in the Results section, which now begins with: “In order to assess motivation for different kinds of social stimuli across groups, lever pressing responses were quantified on a progressive ratio schedule (PR-1).” We have also added this information to the caption of figure 2 and the y-axis of figures 2 and 5.</p><p>2. Progressive ratio results can be reported as breakpoints (which only represent PR designs) or lever pressing responses (which can be used for PR or FR studies), but as these metrics are highly correlated, only one is typically analyzed. We reported lever pressing responses as it captures additional information from incomplete reward series (detailed circa line 720), so to aid in interpreting/translating the data in terms of breakpoints, we have added the mapping of lever presses to breakpoints for a PR-1 schedule to the y-axis of Figure 2A. This is also now articulated in the text: “The mapping from response count to the corresponding PR-1 breakpoint (i.e. the maximum number of responses exhibited to achieve a reward) is shown in figure 2A and applies to all response count figures.” As well as in the figure 2 legend: “PR-1 breakpoint thresholds are listed in italics next to the corresponding number of responses on the interior y-axis of panel A and apply to all lever pressing data (e.g. a vole that presses 55 times should receive 10 rewards, the last of which takes 10 responses to gain).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The absence of male oxytocin receptor autoradiography data was also viewed as a weakness. If these data are available (null or otherwise) they should be included. The genotyping data were viewed as being tangential to the main theme of the paper and reviewers agreed these data should be removed.</p></disp-quote><p>Male oxytocin receptor data is not available. When we discovered males were not working harder to access familiar females, we diverted later study males to pilot a social choice variant of the operant setup (and thus stopped collecting their brains at the conclusion of the study). That pilot led us to conduct a new study using a two-choice operant apparatus (now in review), and the tissues from that second study could enable a similar analysis in both male and female brains. I will strongly consider running that assay once I have autoradiography set up in my new lab.</p><p>We have clarified that male data were not omitted null data, but rather not assayed: “We conducted receptor autoradiography to assess variation in neural oxytocin receptor density in female prairie voles. (OTR was not analyzed in male brains; following early results, later males were used to pilot a two-choice social operant paradigm).”</p><p>We have removed all genotyping data as requested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>My main suggestion is for the authors to highlight how their results change how we view the results of partner preference tests in the abstract and discussion. I think it would be helpful for the authors to go into a little more depth about the difference between actively seeking out a partner (or female) versus more passively huddling (in the case of animals with an opposite sex partner) when the partner is available. Do the authors expect dopaminergic mechanisms to play a stronger role in lever pressing than huddling (similar to liking/wanting hypotheses)?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this suggestion – we have added material to both the abstract and discussion.</p><p>Abstract: we were at the word limit, so we cut a few words and added a minimal statement:</p><p>“This reveals a striking sex difference in pathways underlying social monogamy, and demonstrates a fundamental disconnect between motivation and social selectivity in males—a distinction not detected by the partner preference test.”</p><p>Discussion (new paragraph):</p><p>“The lack of consistent mapping between effort in the operant task and partner preferences in male huddling highlights a disconnect between social reward and the selectivity of huddling preferences. This disconnect is further underscored by the presence of robust partner preferences in female meadow voles despite no evidence of social reward in the operant task or in socially conditioned place preference tests (Goodwin et al., 2019). Social reward thus does not imply selective preference, nor does partner preference imply social reward. These behavioral findings are consistent with the lack of effects of dopamine antagonists on same-sex peer partner preferences in female meadow voles as well as prairie voles (Beery and Zucker, 2010; Lee and Beery, 2021). While dopamine signaling is not necessary for peer partner preference expression, it can enhance preferences (Lee and Beery, 2021), and may play a more fundamental role in pair bonding with mates (Aragona and Wang, 2009). Because partner preference does not indicate behavioral reward, the partner preference test and other tests of social approach in the absence of work likely reflect different combinations of partner tolerance, partner reward, and stranger aversion.”</p><p>We have also added a related section to the discussion “Implications for the evolution of social relationships” (see response to reviewer #3).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Including the missing male groups would improve the paper.</p></disp-quote><p>I have added better explanations for their omission in these two instances. In the case of meadow voles, the seasonal transition to sociality only occurs in females (or predominantly in females) in both the field and laboratory, thus the following text has been added:</p><p>Introduction: “Because the seasonal transition from solitary to social is most pronounced in female meadow voles in the field and laboratory (Madison and McShea, 1987; Beery et al., 2009), only females of this species were used.”</p><p>Results: “Lever pressing responses in prairie voles were compared to those of a related non-monogamous vole species (the meadow vole) that exhibits group living during winter months. Female meadow voles are territorial and aggressive in summer or long day lengths in the lab, but socially tolerant in winter or short days. Because male meadow voles do not undergo this transition (Madison and McShea, 1987; Beery et al., 2009), we focused on comparison of social motivation in female meadow voles relative to female prairie voles.”</p><p>Regarding neural OTR data: <bold>“</bold>We conducted receptor autoradiography to assess variation in neural oxytocin receptor density in female prairie voles. OTR was not analyzed in male brains as several male subjects were used to pilot a follow-up study using a two-choice social operant paradigm (<italic>in review</italic>).”</p><p>In prior studies in voles in our lab and others, sex differences in OTR density have not been found (e.g. Insel et al., 1992, Ahern et al., 2021), with signaling differences hypothesized to be largely mediated through sex differences in peptide distribution. Nonetheless it would have been informative to correlate individual binding data with behavior in the males, and we will consider this for a second study we conducted that yielded more male brains.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I am not sure the value of the genotype comparisons given the limited behavioral data that can be assessed. It might strengthen the paper to remove it (and perhaps the data could serve as the basis for a different paper).</p></disp-quote><p>We have removed the genotype comparisons as suggested. They are stronger with a larger sample set, so we have added them to our second study data set for which we also collected genotype data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It would be great to run progressive ratio on a subset of subjects where differences were found. For example, run progressive ratio for female prairie voles with a partner that is familiar vs. novel (e.g., female partners only) and male prairie voles for a partner that is male vs. female (e.g., familiar only). I think this could be done with relatively few animals but would allow for conclusions about motivation.</p></disp-quote><p>A progressive ratio was used for all testing. This has been clarified in several locations in the manuscript and hopefully addresses this concern.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The claim &quot;sex-specific&quot; should be limited to when an analysis comparing sexes was actually conducted (e.g., the first title of the Results section is inaccurate).</p></disp-quote><p>We have now added quantitative comparison of the sexes to supplement the qualitative description of the difference in response pattern. Specifically, we screened for sex differences using a generalized linear model with stimulus type (same/opposite sex), stimulus familiarity (partner/stranger), sex of the presser (female/male), sex of the presser*stimulus type, and sex of the presser*stimulus familiarity. This yielded interactions of sex with stimulus type (<italic>p</italic>=.0112) and familiarity (<italic>p</italic>=0.09), providing quantitative evidence for sex differences not in the amount but in the <italic>stimulus specificity</italic> of pressing, supporting the decision to analyze the results separately by sex. We have added this result to the manuscript. We believe “Sex-specific patterns of social effort in prairie voles” is therefore accurate. If needed, this section could be re-titled “Social effort in males and females was influenced by different aspects of the social stimulus.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The corresponding correlation in males for Figure 3G should be shown.</p></disp-quote><p>Both male and female data now appear in Figure 3G. We also took this opportunity to change the graph from total bouts of aggression to aggression/access time, as was already displayed for all other social comparisons (e.g. huddling/access time, social chamber/access time). We originally presented both versions in the text, emphasized the scaled findings in the text, but displayed the unscaled findings in the figure. We continue to present both unscaled and scaled findings in the text, but now display the scaled findings we believe are more meaningful.</p><p>In addition, we added further detail regarding which voles underwent control and extinguishing testing (all voles in cohorts 4, 5, 6, and 7, which represented &gt;2/3 of the voles in the study and were distributed across groups).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>In general, I found the paper to be quite well-written and I enjoyed reading it. I have the following recommendations:</p><p>Because some sample sizes were relatively small, the chance of Type II error is higher. Reporting effect sizes would be helpful.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added effect sizes throughout the manuscript. For pairwise comparisons we have added Cohen’s d; for 1-way and 2-way ANOVAs we now present eta squared and partial eta squared, and for correlations we already listed the Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient alongside statistical significance. We selected the sample sizes for this study in consultation with operant expert Dr. Tim Hackenberg, who assured us that the repeated testing involved in social operant studies allowed him to use samples sizes as small as 4-6 per group (we used 8). Although only 8 subjects were tested per group, each subject’s data represented the mean of 8 days of sampling in each of the three conditions, enhancing the reliability of data for each subject and reducing the chance of type II error.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Caption for Figure 5a: should specify that this statement refers to a food reward.</p></disp-quote><p>Fixed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 296: In Ahern and Young 2009, I do not believe that there were actually any differences in OTR binding due to early experience.

The other two references show similar findings, and I’ve added more study-specific detail so this now reads:</p><p>“Variation in OTR density by relationship type has not been previously assessed, although oxytocin receptor density or mRNA levels differ in response to early-life housing manipulations in prairie voles, such as presence of a father and single versus group housing (Prounis et al., 2015) as well as chronic social isolation in adulthood (Pournajafi-Nazarloo et al., 2013).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Check reference list and text for correspondence: Pournajafi-Nazarloo 2013 missing from ref list; Prounis also missing; there may be more, those are just the two I noticed</p></disp-quote><p>These references have also been added to the bibliography, and one other that was also previously missing.

In lieu of finding better language that could apply to both males and females, surgical manipulations of males and females are now specified separately:</p><p>“Subjects in opposite-sex pairs were placed with either a tubally ligated, hormonally intact female mate, or a castrated and testosterone implanted male mate”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Finally, I felt like the discussion could be broader in its consideration of the implications of these findings for the evolution of social bonding.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added a section at the end of the Discussion section:</p><p>Implications for the evolution of social relationships</p><p>Persistent relationships within specific pairs or groups of conspecifics are present throughout the animal kingdom, including select invertebrates, fishes, reptiles and amphibians, birds, and mammals (Bales et al., 2021). While the nature and extent of these relationships vary considerably, they share in common the specificity of social preferences that leads to repeated association. They may differ, however, in the mechanisms that influence familiar approach and unfamiliar avoidance. In particular, familiar individuals—whether mates or peers—may or may not be socially rewarding, and unfamiliar individuals may or may not be aversive.</p><p>Even within closely related vole species, we see evidence that only some relationships involve selective social reward, for example mate relationships in female prairie voles, while others—such as peer relationships in winter phenotype meadow voles—involve selectivity without appreciable reward. Selectivity in the absence of reward may rely instead on changing social anxiety and aggression (Beery, 2019). For example, when exposed to the short, winter photoperiods associated with the transition from solitary to group living in the wild, meadow voles undergo changes in CRF receptor densities, glucocorticoid secretion, behavioral indicators of anxiety, and aggression (Ossenkopp et al., 2005; Beery et al., 2014; Anacker et al., 2016). More research is needed to establish causal links between these changes and the transition to group living. More broadly, it remains to be determined to what extent social monogamy and pair bonding with mates shares mechanisms across species (Goodson, 2013), and to what extent different types of relationships (e.g. with peers or mates) share foundations, or differ in their regulation. Ultimately these studies should help us understand how selective relationships of different types evolve.</p></body></sub-article></article>
