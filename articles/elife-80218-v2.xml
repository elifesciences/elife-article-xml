Since eROS is an unavoidable consequence of aerobic metabolism, understanding how <italic>Mtb</italic> manages eROS levels is essential yet needs to be characterized. By combining the Mrx1-roGFP2 redox biosensor with transposon mutagenesis, we identified 368 genes (redoxosome) responsible for maintaining homeostatic levels of eROS in <italic>Mtb</italic>. Integrating redoxosome with a global network of transcriptional regulators revealed a hypothetical protein (Rv0158) as a critical node managing eROS in <italic>Mtb</italic>. Disruption of <italic>rv0158</italic> (<italic>rv0158</italic> KO) impaired growth, redox balance, respiration, and metabolism of <italic>Mtb</italic> on glucose but not on fatty acids. Importantly, <italic>rv0158</italic> KO exhibited enhanced growth on propionate, and the Rv0158 protein directly binds to methylmalonyl-CoA, a key intermediate in propionate catabolism. Metabolite profiling, ChIP-Seq, and gene-expression analyses indicate that Rv0158 manages metabolic neutralization of propionate toxicity by regulating the methylcitrate cycle. Disruption of <italic>rv0158</italic> enhanced the sensitivity of <italic>Mtb</italic> to oxidative stress, nitric oxide, and anti-TB drugs. Lastly, <italic>rv0158</italic> KO showed poor survival in macrophages and persistence defect in mice. Our results suggest that Rv0158 is a metabolic integrator for carbon metabolism and redox balance in <italic>Mtb</italic>.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</kwd><kwd>redoxosome</kwd><kwd>endogenous ROS</kwd><kwd>lipid metabolism</kwd><kwd>methylcitrate cycle</kwd><kwd>carbon source</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd><kwd><italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100009053</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust - DBT India Alliance</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>IA/S/16/2/502700</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Singh</surname><given-names>Amit</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007780</institution-id><institution>Indian Institute of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Graduate Student Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shee</surname><given-names>Somnath</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001502</institution-id><institution>Department of Atomic Energy, Government of India</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>project number 12-R&amp;D-TFR-5.04-0800</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Seshasayee</surname><given-names>Aswin N</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001407</institution-id><institution>Department of Biotechnology, Ministry of Science and Technology, India</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BT/PR29098/Med/29/1324/2018</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Singh</surname><given-names>Amit</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001407</institution-id><institution>Department of Biotechnology, Ministry of Science and Technology, India</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BT/HRD/NBA/39/07/2018-19</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Singh</surname><given-names>Amit</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100007296</institution-id><institution>Infosys Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Singh</surname><given-names>Amit</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001409</institution-id><institution>Department of Science &amp;

Two major concerns: the emergence of drug-resistant strains and few anti-TB drugs in the pipeline, necessitate the discovery of novel drug targets. <italic>Mtb</italic> requires oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) for growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Wayne and Hayes, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Boshoff and Barry, 2005</xref>). Low O<sub>2</sub> levels, as encountered in hypoxic granulomas, trigger a transition from actively growing to a non-replicating persistent state in <italic>Mtb</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Boshoff and Barry, 2005</xref>). While this metabolic adaptation is an important contributor toward tolerance against host-induced stressors and anti-TB drugs, it obstructs the completion of the <italic>Mtb</italic> life cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ernst, 2012</xref>). Therefore, for successful progression and subsequent disease transmission, <italic>Mtb</italic> requires O<sub>2</sub>. The immediate consequence of an aerobic lifestyle is the generation of endogenous reactive oxygen species (eROS) as metabolic by-products when O<sub>2</sub> adventitiously interacts with and extracts an electron from quinones, flavins, and transition metal centres distributed throughout the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Imlay, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Imlay, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Imlay, 2003</xref>). eROS can cause oxidative damage to DNA, proteins, and lipids, driving the bacteria to deploy detoxification and repair machinery to keep eROS-induced deleterious effects below a threshold level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Imlay, 2009</xref>). While multiple reports investigate this cellular requirement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ayer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Brynildsen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Radzinski et al., 2018</xref>), an understanding of global pathways that keep <italic>Mtb</italic>- eROS levels in check, is absent.</p><p>The primary niche of <italic>Mtb</italic> is inside phagocytic cells, where the bacteria are exposed to superoxide (O<sub>2</sub>.<sup>-</sup>), nitric oxide (NO), their reaction product peroxynitrite (ONOO.), and hypochlorite stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ehrt and Schnappinger, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Philips and Ernst, 2012</xref>). In response to host-induced redox stress, <italic>Mtb</italic> deploys antioxidant enzymes catalase-peroxidase (KatG), superoxide dismutase (Fe-SodA), thioredoxin reductase (TrxB2), alkyl hydroperoxide reductase (AhpC), and redox buffers- thioredoxin (trxC), and ergothioneine (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). In addition to this, <italic>Mtb</italic> maintains a reduced cytosol by producing mycothiol (MSH; a low-molecular-weight sugar thiol) in millimolar amounts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Kumar et al., 2011</xref>). Interestingly, the cytoplasmic MSH-mediated redox buffering is intricately linked to the radical detoxification system by a membrane-associated oxidoreductase complex (MRC; SodA, DoxX, and SseA) in <italic>Mtb</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Nambi et al., 2015</xref>). Disruption of any MRC-component impedes mycothiol recycling, increases oxidative damages, and enhances susceptibility to thiol stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Nambi et al., 2015</xref>). Furthermore, <italic>Mtb</italic> expresses virulence factors that modulate host immune signalling and ROS- generating machinery to reduce the concentrations of ROS encountered by the bacteria inside the host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Chai et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Köster et al., 2017</xref>). Additionally, the thick cell envelope consisting of cyclopropanated mycolic acids, phthiocerol dimycocerosates (PDIM), lipoarabinomannan, and phenolic glycolipid I (oxygen radical scavengers) confers an excellent anatomical barrier to and detoxification of exogenous oxidants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Hatfull and Jacobs, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Tyagi et al., 2015</xref>). Also, sulfur metabolism pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hatzios and Bertozzi, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Kunota et al., 2021</xref>), RHOCS (a redox homeostatic system; PknG, ribosomal protein L13, and RenU) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Wolff et al., 2015</xref>), DNA repair, and redox sensors (two-component systems such as DosR/S/T, WhiB family of transcriptional factors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Hatfull and Jacobs, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Kumar et al., 2011</xref>, and SigH-AosR/RshA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Khan et al., 2021</xref>) allow <italic>Mtb</italic> to adapt and survive in response to exogenous redox stressors. While <italic>Mtb</italic> has evolutionarily adapted to counteract the host-generated exogenous redox stress, the pathogen is markedly sensitive to cell-permeable molecules that artificially elevate ROS and RNI inside the bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Singh et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Tyagi et al., 2015</xref>). For example, <italic>Mtb</italic> retains viability under high millimolar (mM) concentrations of exogenous ROS and RNI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Voskuil et al., 2011</xref>).

The consumption of propionate requires overlapping reactions encompassing the TCA cycle, methyl citrate cycle (MCC), and glyoxylate cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Eoh and Rhee, 2014</xref>). Therefore, we focussed on the steady-state metabolite levels of the intermediates associated with these pathways.

These findings underscore the importance of identifying genetic factors responsible for keeping eROS levels low in <italic>Mtb</italic>. We integrated high-throughput technologies: Tn mutagenesis, FACS, and Illumina-Sequencing platform with a redox-biosensor (Mrx1-roGFP2) and identified genetic factors required for maintaining basal redox balance in <italic>Mtb</italic>.

Mutation in genes responsible for oxidative stress response, turnover of thiol buffers, cell-envelope homeostasis, and bioenergetics, which are expected to impart higher eROS accumulation, were part of the redoxosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Interestingly, we also identified factors not directly involved in redox balance including genes associated with RNA processing, transporters and secretion, and amino acid metabolism. (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). Future experiments are needed to understand how these pathways contribute to redox balance in <italic>Mtb</italic>.</p><p>We discovered and characterized a conserved hypothetical gene, <italic>rv0158,</italic> as a critical node with the highest betweenness centrality in the hierarchical redox-homeostasis network. Interestingly, <italic>rv0158</italic> is one of the key transcriptional regulators that genetically interact with <italic>ctpC</italic> (<italic>sodA</italic> hypomorph) in a network to impart oxidative stress resistance during infection in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Nambi et al., 2015</xref>). Additionally, the <italic>rv0158</italic> gene was also shown to be upregulated in THP1 macrophages, 0.5% SDS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Fontán et al., 2008</xref>), and in C57BL/6 mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Dubnau et al., 2005</xref>). These studies and our data clearly demanded an in-depth understanding of the <italic>rv0158</italic> function. Our data indicate that <italic>rv0158</italic> deletion resulted in higher eROS accumulation, rendering the strain more susceptible to exogenous redox stressors and reduced intrinsic resistance to anti-TB drugs. Previous studies with Tn-mutant libraries have shown that <italic>rv0158</italic> confers optimal bacterial fitness in mice model of infection, and the phenotype varies with different mouse genotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bellerose et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Smith et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib126">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>). While this requires further experimentation, our findings largely agree with the requirement of <italic>rv0158</italic> for the persistence of <italic>Mtb</italic> in mice.</p><p><italic>Mtb</italic> isolated from the lungs chiefly catabolizes fatty acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bloch and Segal, 1956</xref>). β-oxidation of fatty acids generates NADH and acetyl-CoA or propionyl-CoA to generate ATP. On the other hand, these lipid intermediates also act as building blocks for cell wall lipids synthesis. Remarkably, despite its importance, the overload of propionyl-CoA and its metabolites adversely affect the survival of <italic>Mtb</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Eoh and Rhee, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Lee et al., 2018</xref>). Therefore, there is a trade-off between the beneficial effects of fatty acid catabolism (its skeleton is a valuable carbon source) and toxicity. To deal with the overload of toxic metabolites, <italic>Mtb</italic> must have a sophisticated way to compartmentalize or calibrate the flux of fatty acid metabolites toward either catabolism or anabolism. The absence of such a control can have two consequences: (1) increased catabolism which then leads to the accumulation of chemically reactive and biologically intoxicating metabolites, such as propionate, glyoxylate, or fumarate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Dong et al., 2021</xref>), and (2) decreased lipid anabolism that can perturb membrane structure, function, and virulence. Using multiple techniques, our data suggest that <italic>rv0158</italic> regulates <italic>Mtb</italic>’s growth and redox balance on fatty acids such as propionate. Based on our data, we propose that Rv0158 maintains redox balance by regulating the utilization of fatty acids in catabolic (MCC, TCA, and glyoxylate) and anabolic (PDIM, mycolic acids) pathways of <italic>Mtb</italic>.</p><p>While <italic>rv0158</italic> KO grew slow in response to glucose, the growth of the mutant was either comparable on fatty acids (palmitate, acetate, and cholesterol) or better (propionate) than WT <italic>Mtb</italic>. Since propionate stunts the growth of WT <italic>Mtb</italic> but not of <italic>rv0158</italic> KO, we begin understanding the role of rv0158 in propionate metabolism. It is known that propionate (or one of its catabolic intermediates, 2-methylcitrate or methylmalonyl-CoA) is lethal to <italic>Mtb</italic> if allowed to accumulate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Eoh and Rhee, 2014</xref>). Similarly, the accumulation of glyoxylate and disruption of intrabacterial pH homeostasis, redox balance, and membrane potential in the glyoxylate shunt and MCC pathway mutants, resulted in lethality on odd and even chain fatty acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Eoh and Rhee, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Puckett et al., 2017</xref>). The relatively lesser accumulation of glyoxylate and TCA cycle intermediates in <italic>rv0158</italic> KO, and increased expression of MCC genes (<italic><underline>prpC</underline></italic>, <italic>prpD</italic>, and <italic>icl</italic>) suggest that the mutant is better equipped to prevent accumulation of toxic intermediates when metabolizing propionate. Another consequence of growth on propionate is the undesirable accumulation of NAD(P)H pool, resulting in intrabacterial reductive stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Singh et al., 2009</xref>). A reductive shift in the <italic>E<sub>MSH</sub></italic> of <italic>Mtb</italic> on propionate suggests that <italic>Mtb</italic> utilizes mycothiol as a sink to dissipate NAD(P)H-reductive stress. Reductive stress is also mitigated by NADPH-dependent incorporation of propionyl moieties into cell wall polyketide lipids (SL-1, PAT/DAT, and PDIM) and triacylglycerol (TAG) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Jain et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Singh et al., 2009</xref>). Propionate cultured <italic>rv0158</italic> KO displayed higher expression of PDIM biosynthesis genes-cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>), a more significant reductive shift in <italic>E<sub>MSH</sub></italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>), and efficient respiration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C and F</xref>). All these observations are consistent with the greater adaptability of the mutant on propionate.</p><p>While metabolism through MCC and glyoxylate shunt pathway are active on carbohydrates and induced on fatty acid substrates in <italic>Mtb</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Muñoz-Elías et al., 2006</xref>), the relatively higher expression of <italic>prpR, prpC</italic>, <italic>prpD</italic>, <italic>icl1</italic>, and PDIM genes in <italic>rv0158</italic> KO compared to WT <italic>Mtb</italic> on glucose could have resulted in directing a greater flux of glucose carbon away from energy generating TCA cycle/oxidative phosphorylation to MCC/glyoxylate cycle and energy-requiring polyketide lipid anabolism. The expression of the MCC pathway is activated by a transcription factor PrpR in <italic>Mtb</italic>, whose activity depends on an oxidation-resistant 4Fe-4S cluster (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Tang et al., 2019</xref>). Furthermore, PrpD retained activity under high ROS conditions in other bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Grimek and Escalante-Semerena, 2004</xref>). Therefore, it is likely that MCC enzymes remained functionally active in <italic>rv0158</italic> KO on glucose despite higher eROS. These metabolic changes are possible reasons behind altered redox balance, respiration slow down, and impaired growth of <italic>rv0158</italic> KO on glucose. The mutant also showed slow growth in media containing a combination of nutrients (glucose, glycerol, and tween-80), impaired resistance to redox stress, antibiotics, and persistence defect in mice. The <italic>in vivo</italic> phenotype of <italic>rv0158</italic> KO is consistent with the fact that <italic>Mtb</italic> persistence relies upon efficient metabolization of glucose, co-catabolism of multiple nutrients, and resistance to oxidative/nitrosative stress in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anand et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">de Carvalho et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Marrero et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Noy et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>We found that Rv0158 protein strongly binds to methylmalonyl-CoA, an essential intermediate of propionyl-CoA metabolism, coupled with the synthesis of methyl branched lipids (SL-1, PAT/DAT, and PDIM) in <italic>Mtb</italic>. Moreover, our ChIP-seq data revealed that Rv0158 specifically binds to the genomic regions encompassing the <italic>prp</italic> operon, <italic>prpR</italic>, and <italic>icl1</italic> when <italic>Mtb</italic> metabolizes propionate. These findings, along with our gene expression and metabolomics data, indicate that Rv0158 binding to methylmalonyl-CoA might calibrate the flux of propionate into MCC and methyl-branched lipids biosynthesis. Interestingly, probable propionyl-coenzyme A carboxylase genes (<italic>accA2 and accD2</italic>) required for the biotin-dependent conversion of propionyl-CoA to methylmalonyl-CoA are highly induced in <italic>rv0158</italic> KO (six- to sevenfold; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>) and Rv0158 directly binds to gene encoding biotin synthase (<italic>bioF2</italic>). These findings suggest a possible regulatory loop between biotin synthesis, AccA2/D2-dependent methylmalonyl-CoA formation, and propionate metabolism, where Rv0158 may act as an important link between these pathways. The vitamin B12 (Vit-B12) dependent methylmalonyl-CoA pathway is another means by which propionate toxicity can be alleviated in <italic>Mtb</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Savvi et al., 2008</xref>). While we did not experiment with Vit-B12, the direct and robust binding of methylmalonyl-CoA with Rv0158 protein indicates that Rv0158 could regulate the flux of propionate into methylmalonyl-CoA pathway in <italic>Mtb</italic> during periods of Vit-B12 availability <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>The transcription of the <italic>prp</italic> operon is carefully controlled by PrpR. Under propionate-rich conditions, PrpR binds to propionyl-CoA and induces the expression of itself, <italic>prp</italic> operon, and <italic>icl1</italic> to catabolize propionate by MCC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Tang et al., 2019</xref>). However, PrpR remains in an inactive conformation during growth on carbohydrates resulting in the basal expression of the <italic>prp</italic> operon and <italic>icl1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Tang et al., 2019</xref>). The expression of <italic>prpR</italic>, <italic>prp</italic> operon, and <italic>icl1</italic> was uniformly derepressed in <italic>rv0158</italic> KO on glucose and showed hyperinduction on propionate, suggesting that Rv0158 likely functions as a repressor of PrpR. These findings are supported by ChIP-Seq data showing the physical binding of Rv0158 to the <italic>prpR</italic> promoter region under propionate-grown conditions. Since PrpR is an autoinducer and activates the <italic>prp</italic> operon, a repressor of <italic>prpR</italic> that monitors the metabolic flux of propionate by sensing methylmalonyl-CoA might be essential to avoid unnecessary hyperinduction of <italic>prpR</italic> and providing greater control on propionate metabolism in <italic>Mtb</italic>. In addition to propionate catabolism, <italic>Mtb</italic> sequesters propionate via protein propionylation to regulate free propionyl-CoA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Nambi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Singhal et al., 2015</xref>). Therefore, a metabolic intermediate of propionate catabolism such as methylmalonyl-CoA that Rv0158 could sense might be a valuable indicator of propionyl-CoA flux into MCC, methylmalonyl CoA pathway, and methyl branched lipids biosynthesis in <italic>Mtb</italic>. Moreover, propionyl-CoA binding by PrpR and methylmalonyl-CoA binding by Rv0158 could jointly facilitate a more stringent control on the overall consumption of propionate by non-metabolic (propionylation) and metabolic (MCC, polyketide lipids) pathways in <italic>Mtb</italic>.</p><p>Although our data suggest that Rv0158 likely senses methylmalonyl-CoA and regulates the expression of pathways associated with propionate metabolism, several issues remain to be addressed. It remains unknown if methylmalonyl-CoA is perceived as a metabolic signal by Rv0158 in <italic>Mtb</italic>, and how this association affects direct interaction with DNA and gene expression. Also, the lack of Rv0158 may induce a physiological state in <italic>Mtb</italic> that is more tolerant to toxicity caused by fatty acids such as propionate. For example, cAMP homeostasis is associated with modulating redox balance, respiration, fatty acid uptake, and fatty acid toxicity in <italic>mycobacteria</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ko and Oh, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Nambi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Nazarova et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Wong et al., 2023</xref>). Moreover, Myc<italic>obacterium bovis</italic> BCG elevates cAMP levels in response to propionate, and phosphodiesterases such as Rv0805 regulate cAMP homeostasis to modulate growth on propionate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">McDowell et al., 2023</xref>). Other evidences suggest that reduced cAMP levels result in overactive fatty acid catabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Nambi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Nazarova et al., 2019</xref>) as we observed in the case of <italic>rv0158</italic> KO growing on propionate. While overactive fatty acid catabolism is generally detrimental due to the accumulation of toxic intermediates, mycobacteria have evolved sophisticated regulatory mechanisms (e.g., FdmR) to direct the flux of excess fatty acids away from catabolism to lipid anabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Dong et al., 2021</xref>). These alterations on the mycobacterial surface might be important to counteract toxicity caused by fatty acid-dependent disruption of <italic>the Mtb</italic> envelope (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kengmo Tchoupa et al., 2022</xref>). We observed a higher expression of the PDIM biosynthesis cluster, altered mycolic acids content, and changes in membrane permeability of <italic>rv0158</italic> KO, suggesting overall changes in the cell envelope of the mutant.

The authors then examine the pooled library of Tn mutants that were more oxidized for evidence of DNA damage, lipid peroxidation, upregulation of oxidative stress gene expression, and inability to recover from oxidative stress. All of this validated that they had selected a pool of mutants that were on average exhibiting a more oxidized state. The authors then focus the rest of the manuscript on the transcription factor Rv0158, by generating a deletion mutant and complemented version for Rv0158 and confirming that the mutant exhibits a more oxidized condition. This is an interesting and important characterization of Rv0158 in Mtb. Based on their data, the authors propose that Rv0158 is required to calibrate the cytoplasmic redox potential in response to changes in carbon sources. However, there are multiple explanations for the phenotypes observed, and the function for Rv0158 in metabolism and redox homeostasis remains unclear.</p><p>– Lines 329-331- the authors mention that docking analysis highlighted cholesterol as a potential ligand for Rv0158, but is this just because they used the KstR2 structure as a model, which would fit the Rv0158 structure to KstR2 and may not capture important differences in the ligand binding site? What is the potential model for how cholesterol sensing would allow Rv0158 to serve as a signal for redox homeostasis?</p><p>– For the experiments in Figure 8, the authors state that they hypothesized that the role of Rv0158 would be carbon source dependent, but it is not immediately obvious why that is, and what the outcome for particular carbon sources would be expected. Therefore, in Lines 422-423, it is not clear that the data is in agreement with the hypothesis because it was not obvious what the hypothesis was. In particular, because the authors earlier state that Rv0158 may respond to cholesterol, why would one not expect the TF to function in the presence of cholesterol? Better flushing out of the model and mechanism would be helpful.</p><p>– Figure 8 suggests that the deletion mutant is better equipped for growth on lipid carbon sources, possibly affecting metabolism and carbon source use, which impacts redox. The authors state in lines 447-448 that their findings indicate a requirement for rv0158 to calibrate the cytoplasmic redox potential in response to changes in carbon sources. However, it seems equally possible that Rv0158 has some role in carbon metabolism or assimilation of certain carbon sources into central metabolism, and this is having an indirect effect on redox potential. This may be particularly relevant since the initial experiments were performed in media with multiple available carbon sources and there was still a phenotype. The seahorse experiments also suggest issues with carbon source use.</p><p>– Does the carbon source affect the sensitivity to the conditions used in 10A?</p><p>– The growth defect in macrophages could just reflect the same growth defect observed in culture in glucose-containing media. It does not appear to be specific to the macrophages and this should be taken into account when interpreting that data.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Shee and colleagues implemented a clever TnSeq screen to identify mutants with impaired intracellular redox homeostasis. They identified, what they call the redoxosome, which includes functionally diverse genes of which 1/3rd is related to oxidative stress/antioxidant response. Network analysis led to the identification of rv0158, which encodes a putative transcriptional regulator. The authors constructed a deletion mutant and characterized it by RNAseq, seahorse measurements, lipid analyses, and during growth in a macrophage cell line and in mice. The authors conducted many experiments, which revealed that the rv0158 mutant has many phenotypes, but unfortunately the direct regulon of Rv0158 remains unidentified. The mechanistic basis for the attenuation of the rv0158 deletion mutant in the mouse model is therefore unexplained.</p><p>The identified &quot;redoxosome&quot; includes genes that are functionally very diverse, and I am not convinced that the majority is required for redox homeostasis. Moreover, the authors failed to validate individual transposon mutants. The validation experiments done with the enriched mutant pool (Figure 2) are not informative as the data could be driven by just a few of the mutants. They analyzed EMSH response in a handful of transposon mutants obtained from BEI but did not carry out any further functional analysis that would provide confidence that the identified mutants are in fact required for redox homeostasis. The EMSH response is not sufficient to support this claim. It is not clear why these specific mutants were selected.</p><p>The authors focused on the putative transcriptional regulator Rv0158 and used RNAseq to identify its regulon. The approach cannot distinguish genes that are directly regulated by Rv0158 from those that are indirectly regulated. This is supported by the large number of genes identified. Accordingly, the follow-up work does not lead to significant insight into the function of Rv0158. The mutant accumulated fewer mycolic acids than wt was more permeable to EtBr, and contained higher NADPH levels than wt Mtb; the underlying mechanisms and specific dysregulated genes that are responsible for these phenotypes remain undetermined. Similarly, the growth defects are difficult to interpret and the conclusion that rv0158 deletion improved growth with fatty acids as a carbon source is not supported by the data; this is only observed with propionate.</p><p>The conclusion that rv0158 is required to survive in macrophages is incorrect. The mutant survives perfectly well (100% survival); it fails to grow like wt. The slight <italic>in vivo</italic> growth defect and more drastic persistence defect seems inconsistent with the data from the macrophage cell line.</p><p>The MIC measurements using resazurin are a concern, given that resazurin reports on respiration, it is reduced in aerobically growing cells. The altered intracellular redox state of the rv0158 mutant could affect the resazurin reduction and confound the data.</p><p>There are some inaccurate statements that need to be corrected. For example, the authors state &quot;Mtb secretes antioxidant enzymes (catalase-peroxidase (KatG), superoxide dismutase (Fe-SodA), thioredoxin reductase (trxB2), Alkyl hydroperoxide reductase (AhpC) and redox buffers thioredoxin (trxC), and ergothioneine). Not all of these are secreted; in fact, the majority are not.</p><p>They wrote&quot; Mtb displays a low MIC of 3 μM for the endogenous superoxide (O2.-) generator 2, 3-Dihydro-1,4, naphthoquinone and 0.4 μM for the intracellular NO donor PA-824. On what basis do the authors quantify the MICs as &quot;low&quot;?</p><p>The experiments shown in Figure 2 should be conducted with isolated transposon mutants.</p><p>The genes that are directly regulated by Rv0158 need to be identified to gain mechanistic insight into the many phenotypes of the mutant and potentially explain the <italic>in vivo</italic> attenuation.</p><p>The authors should test growth with additional fatty acids, especially those that are relevant to the <italic>in vivo</italic> environment to substantiate the claim that rv0158 is required for growth with fatty acids.</p><p>The conclusion that the key rv0158 function is to maintain the flux of lipid metabolism intermediates needs to be substantiated by carbon flux analyses.</p><p>MIC measurements using growth/OD600 readings should be conducted.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors of the study combined the Mrx-roGFP2 redox biosensor with transposon mutagenesis and FACS to identify the Mtb redoxome. From this library, the authors identify a hypothetical protein, RV0158 that modulates intracellular redox balance and lipid homeostasis. The corresponding Mtb knockout strain is implicated in anti-TB drug susceptibility and survival <italic>in vivo</italic>. I am concerned that the claims by the authors are not supported by the data.</p><p>The strengths of the manuscript are combining roGFP with FACS to identify a set of genes involved in redox balance, implicating a regulatory gene (rv0158) involved in this process, and demonstrating its role in anti-TB drug susceptibility and virulence.</p><p>The weaknesses of the manuscript include using pooled libraries of transposon mutants (the redoxome) in their Q-PCR and oxidative stress exposure experiments. Examining pooled libraries of mutant clones complicates the interpretation of data that is based on the average contribution of all the genes and makes it impossible to make reliable conclusions. Also, the redoxome was identified using a single oxidant, CHP, which is not a physiologically relevant oxidant. Hence, the redoxome is an artificial signature. An important control, an antioxidant to reverse the response, is lacking. The manuscript lacks a mechanism whereby RV0158 regulates redox homeostasis. Although the lipid metabolism, oxidative stress, and redox couple experiments provide circumstantial evidence, a clear sensing/regulatory mechanism is lacking. The authors favor that rv0158 regulates lipid metabolism as a mechanism for redox homeostasis, but unfortunately, no mechanism is provided. Lastly, I have concerns about the bioenergetic data and interpretation. Overall, numerous casually linked experiments were performed, and the manuscript appears unfocused.</p><p>There are numerous grammatical issues throughout the manuscript that warrant attention.</p><p>Lines 33-34; ambiguous sentences, rephrase.</p><p>Lines 56-61; add references where relevant and not at the end of the sentence.</p><p>Line 188; what do the authors mean by nontoxic?

In addition, the authors still seem to bias their interpretations towards their favored model and should revise the manuscript to consider alternatives.</p><p>The authors should address the following comments, which they should largely be able to do by not overstating their results, considering other models, and providing a more thorough and transparent analysis of the metabolite measurements.</p><p>1. The findings that the rv0158 deletion mutant can grow on propionate at a concentration that inhibits growth of the wt and complemented strains and that Rv0158 can bind methylmalonyl-CoA are interesting. However, the authors' interpretations are often based on phenotypic differences whose physiological relevance remains unclear. Their interpretation of the phenotypes seems biased towards the model they propose, but other explanations should be considered and included, at least in the discussion.</p><p>2. There are concerns regarding the metabolomics data. The authors do not seem to have used metabolite standards. Even the source data fail to show which masses they utilized for the measured metabolites. Oxaloacetate is very unstable and can typically not be measured directly. The statement &quot;We found that α-ketoglutarate pools are marginally higher in rv0158 KO compared to WT Mtb under propionate (Figure 9; [Figure 9 in the revised manuscript]), indicating another reason for better mutant growth on propionate&quot; is not justified, because in the complemented mutant α-ketoglutarate pools are even higher than that in the KO.</p><p>3. The authors added CFU data to assess susceptibility to antibiotics, but this is different than MIC measurements using growth as readout to assess drug resistance, which can be different than susceptibility to drug induced killing. This should be considered when describing and interpreting the data.</p><p>4. The authors' explanation for the different binding targets of Rv0158 during growth in glucose and in propionate is not clear. It seems that they suggest that methylmalony -CoA binding is required for Rv1058 to bind and repress the prpR promoter, but direct evidence for this is lacking. Overall, their model of Rv0158 activity is very complex and is sometimes based solely on associations. The authors would benefit by more rigorously evaluating their data and being more careful with their interpretations.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.80218.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) A more thorough analysis and dissection of Rv0158 is necessary to provide insight into its role in mycobacterial metabolism and redox homeostasis.</p></disp-quote><p>To better understand Rv0158 function in mycobacterial metabolism and redox balance, we performed several key experiments described below.</p><p>One of the significant findings of our manuscript is the slow growth of <italic>rv0158</italic> KO on glucose and mixed nutrients (glucose, glycerol, and tween-80), whereas growth was better on fatty acids such as propionate (Figure 7 and Figure 7—figure supplement 1 in the revised manuscript). Therefore, to understand the better adaptability of <italic>rv0158 KO</italic> on propionate as a carbon (C) source, we performed liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) metabolomics following exposure of WT <italic>Mtb</italic> and <italic>rv0158 KO</italic> to 0.3% glucose or 0.3% propionate (Figure 9 in the revised manuscript). We assessed the pool sizes of the intermediates associated with the methylcitrate cycle (MCC), TCA, and glyoxylate cycles. Our data suggest that Rv0158 deficiency accelerates propionyl-CoA utilization and reduces the pool of toxic metabolites such as glyoxylate (Figure 9 in the revised manuscript), thereby positively influencing the growth and redox potential of <italic>rv0158 KO</italic> utilizing propionate as a sole carbon source (Figure 7 in the revised manuscript).</p><p>We then extended our study to understand the potential model of propionate sensing by Rv0158. We employed microscale thermophoresis (MST) to identify ligands for Rv0158 and found that it binds with malonyl-CoA, decanoyl -CoA, C12/C16/C18-CoA, and methylmalonyl-CoA. The highest affinity was for methylmalonyl-CoA (affinity constant [Kd] of 0.9 ± 0.3 µM) (Table 1 in the revised manuscript). Methylmalonyl-CoA is a crucial intermediary metabolite regulating propionate flux into MCC, methylmalonyl pathway, and methyl branched lipids in <italic>Mtb</italic>. Therefore, we proposed that the physical association of methylmalonyl-CoA with Rv0158 likely facilitates the regulation of genes associated with propionate metabolism in <italic>Mtb</italic>. We performed ChIP-sequencing (ChIP-seq) of Rv0158 on glucose or propionate as a sole carbon source to examine this (Figure 11 and Supplementary file 5 in the revised manuscript). On glucose, Rv0158 binds to several genes involved in methyl-branched lipid biosynthesis (<italic>pks2</italic>, <italic>fadD23</italic>, <italic>rv2958c</italic>, <italic>rv2959c</italic>, <italic>rv2961</italic>), lipid transporter (<italic>rv0987-rv0988</italic>, <italic>mmpL1-mmpS1</italic>, <italic>mmpL4</italic>-<italic>mmpS4</italic>), biotin synthesis (<italic>bioF2</italic>), and surface-associated proteins (<italic>esp</italic> operon, <italic>lpqG</italic>, esxQ, <italic>rv1501</italic>-r<italic>v1507A</italic>). Under propionate condition, Rv0158 binds to the genomic region encompassing 32 genes, 24 genes overlap with glucose. The promoter regions of the remaining eight genes that Rv0158 exclusively bind in propionate- grown <italic>Mtb</italic> were part of the glyoxylate cycle and MCC (<italic>icl1</italic>, <italic>fadB2</italic>, <italic>prpR</italic>, <italic>and prp</italic> operon) (Figure 11 and Supplementary file 5 in the revised manuscript).</p><p>Lastly, to support ChIP-seq data, we performed qRT-PCR of MCC genes (<italic>icl1</italic>, <italic>prpR</italic>, <italic>prpC</italic>, <italic>prpD</italic>) in WT <italic>Mtb</italic>, <italic>rv0158</italic> KO, and <italic>rv0158 Comp</italic> growing on glucose or propionate by qRT-PCR. We observed increased expression of MCC genes in <italic>rv0158</italic> KO compared to WT <italic>Mtb</italic> on glucose (Figure 10A, 10B, and Figure 10—figure supplement 2 in the revised manuscript). Propionate exposure increased MCC gene expression in <italic>rv0158</italic> KO compared to WT <italic>Mtb.</italic> In addition to the MCC pathway, <italic>Mtb</italic> mitigates propionate toxicity via the biosynthesis of PDIM (phthiocerol dimycocerosates). We measured the expression of the PDIM biosynthesis cluster in <italic>rv0158</italic> KO. Expression of PDIM genes was broadly unchanged in <italic>rv0158</italic> KO on glucose compared to WT <italic>Mtb</italic> (Figure 10D and Figure 10—figure supplement 2 in the revised manuscript)<italic>.</italic> However, similar to MCC genes, the PDIM cluster was induced ≈10-fold in <italic>rv0158</italic> KO compared to WT <italic>Mtb</italic> on propionate (Figure 10E and Figure 10—figure supplement 2 in the revised manuscript). In sum, our ChIP-seq, RT-qPCR, and MST data indicate that Rv0158 prevents the hyperexpression of MCC genes and adjusts the partitioning of propionate between the catabolism and methyl branched lipids anabolism in <italic>Mtb.</italic></p><p>We thank the Reviewers for these excellent recommendations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors should be more conservative with their data interpretations and open to alternative models of Rv0158 function.</p></disp-quote><p>We have extensively revised the manuscript and provided alternative models of the Rv0158 function in <italic>Mtb</italic>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>In this manuscript, the authors combined TnSeq approaches with a reporter for mycothiol redox potential to identify genes in Mtb that are required to maintain the reducing environment of the cell. The authors then examine the pooled library of Tn mutants that were more oxidized for evidence of DNA damage, lipid peroxidation, upregulation of oxidative stress gene expression, and inability to recover from oxidative stress. All of this validated that they had selected a pool of mutants that were on average exhibiting a more oxidized state. The authors then focus the rest of the manuscript on the transcription factor Rv0158, by generating a deletion mutant and complemented version for Rv0158 and confirming that the mutant exhibits a more oxidized condition. This is an interesting and important characterization of Rv0158 in Mtb. Based on their data, the authors propose that Rv0158 is required to calibrate the cytoplasmic redox potential in response to changes in carbon sources. However, there are multiple explanations for the phenotypes observed, and the function for Rv0158 in metabolism and redox homeostasis remains unclear.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for responding positively to our manuscript. We have addressed all of the Reviewer’s concerns in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Lines 329-331- the authors mention that docking analysis highlighted cholesterol as a potential ligand for Rv0158, but is this just because they used the KstR2 structure as a model, which would fit the Rv0158 structure to KstR2 and may not capture important differences in the ligand binding site? What is the potential model for how cholesterol sensing would allow Rv0158 to serve as a signal for redox homeostasis?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the Reviewer that <italic>in silico</italic> investigation may not provide a potential model for how Rv0158 senses fatty acids such as cholesterol and propionate for redox homeostasis. Therefore, we employed microscale thermophoresis (MST) to identify ligands for Rv0158. We tested various metabolites generated during the catabolism of long-chain fatty acids, propionate, and cholesterol (Lines: 457- 464 in the revised manuscript). We found that Rv0158 does not bind with CoA, acetyl-CoA, and propionyl-CoA. However, Rv0158 showed binding with malonyl-CoA, decanoyl -CoA, C12/C16/C18-CoA, with the highest affinity for methylmalonyl-CoA (affinity constant [Kd] of 0.9 ± 0.3 µM) (Table 2 and Table 2- Source Data 1 in the revised manuscript). Since methylmalonyl-CoA is a crucial intermediary metabolite regulating propionate flux into MCC, methylmalonyl pathway, and methyl branched lipids (Savvi et al., 2008), we proposed that its physical association with Rv0158 likely facilitates regulation of genes associated with propionate metabolism in <italic>Mtb</italic>. We supported this model by performing ChIP- Seq and expression analysis during the growth of <italic>Mtb</italic> on glucose or propionate as a sole carbon source.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– For the experiments in Figure 8, the authors state that they hypothesized that the role of Rv0158 would be carbon source dependent, but it is not immediately obvious why that is, and what the outcome for particular carbon sources would be expected. Therefore, in Lines 422-423, it is not clear that the data is in agreement with the hypothesis because it was not obvious what the hypothesis was. In particular, because the authors earlier state that Rv0158 may respond to cholesterol, why would one not expect the TF to function in the presence of cholesterol? Better flushing out of the model and mechanism would be helpful.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for this comment. We have simplified this section (Lines: 355- 370 in the revised manuscript). Our RNA-Seq data on media containing mixed carbon sources (glucose, glycerol, and tween 80) indicated that genes associated with fatty acid catabolism were induced in <italic>rv0158</italic> KO. Furthermore, genes related to the methylcitrate cycle (MCC; <italic>prpC, prpD,</italic> and <italic>icl1</italic>), which alleviate propionate toxicity (Eoh and Rhee, 2014a), were significantly upregulated in <italic>rv0158</italic> KO. On this basis, we first examined the role of <italic>rv0158</italic> in utilizing fatty acids as nutrients by <italic>Mtb</italic>. Furthermore, fatty acids being a more reduced C substrate than glucose (Borah et al., 2021; Singh et al., 2009), we tested if differences in the growth of <italic>rv0158</italic> KO on fatty acids vs glucose are also associated with changes in the redox potential of <italic>Mtb</italic>. Our ligand binding assay, metabolomics, ChIP-seq, and expression analysis shed new light on the mechanism of how Rv0158 could function in the presence of propionate to adjust the growth and redox potential of <italic>Mtb</italic>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Figure 8 suggests that the deletion mutant is better equipped for growth on lipid carbon sources, possibly affecting metabolism and carbon source use, which impacts redox. The authors state in lines 447-448 that their findings indicate a requirement for rv0158 to calibrate the cytoplasmic redox potential in response to changes in carbon sources. However, it seems equally possible that Rv0158 has some role in carbon metabolism or assimilation of certain carbon sources into central metabolism, and this is having an indirect effect on redox potential. This may be particularly relevant since the initial experiments were performed in media with multiple available carbon sources and there was still a phenotype. The seahorse experiments also suggest issues with carbon source use.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the Reviewer. Our metabolomics, ChIP-seq, and expression data confirm that Rv0158 deficiency accelerates propionyl-CoA utilization and reduces the pool of toxic metabolites such as glyoxylate, thereby positively influencing the growth and bioenergetics of <italic>rv0158 KO</italic> utilizing propionate as a sole carbon source. We thank the Reviewer for this insightful comment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Does the carbon source affect the sensitivity to the conditions used in 10A?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for this comment. We have addressed the Reviewer’s concern by measuring the survival of <italic>rv0158</italic> KO under hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) stress when grown in the presence of acetate/propionate /cholesterol as a sole carbon source (Figure 12—figure supplement 1 in the revised manuscript). We found that the sensitivity of <italic>rv0158</italic> KO towards H2O2 stress was alleviated when we substituted glucose with fatty acids (0.03% acetate or 0.3% propionate or 0.02% cholesterol) as C source (Lines: 503- 508 in the revised manuscript). This aligns with the restoration of MSH redox state (Figure 7F in the revised manuscript) and OXPHOS (relative to WT <italic>Mtb</italic>) in the knockout strain when growing with fatty acids as a C source (Figure 8 in the revised manuscript).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The growth defect in macrophages could just reflect the same growth defect observed in culture in glucose-containing media. It does not appear to be specific to the macrophages and this should be taken into account when interpreting that data.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for this comment. We showed that the <italic>rv0158</italic> KO exhibits a slow-growth phenotype in glucose-containing media. In the revised manuscript, we addressed the Reviewer’s concern by assessing if the macrophage environment induces slow growth like glucose or killing of the mutant over time (Lines: 532- 536 in the revised manuscript). Immune- activation of macrophages elevates phagosomal oxidative and nitrosative stress to cause redox stress in <italic>Mtb</italic> (Bhaskar et al., 2014). Therefore, we examined the mutant phenotype inside the lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and IFN-γ activated RAW 264.7 macrophages. We observed that <italic>rv0158</italic> KO entered bacteriostasis two days post-infection (p.i.) and showed ≈50% killing at four days p.i. (Figure 12D in the revised manuscript). The killing of the mutant coincides with an overwhelming oxidative shift in the <italic>E<sub>MSH</sub></italic> of <italic>Mtb</italic> inside immune-activated macrophages (Figure 12C in the revised manuscript). At both these time points, the survival of the mutant remains significantly lower than the WT <italic>Mtb</italic>. The data agree with our findings that <italic>rv0158</italic> KO is exceptionally sensitive to oxidative and nitrosative stress <italic>in vitro</italic>. Altogether, while glucose slows the growth of <italic>rv0158</italic> KO <italic>in vitro</italic>, an oxidatively hostile environment of activated macrophages induces killing.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Shee and colleagues implemented a clever TnSeq screen to identify mutants with impaired intracellular redox homeostasis. They identified, what they call the redoxosome, which includes functionally diverse genes of which 1/3rd is related to oxidative stress/antioxidant response. Network analysis led to the identification of rv0158, which encodes a putative transcriptional regulator. The authors constructed a deletion mutant and characterized it by RNAseq, seahorse measurements, lipid analyses, and during growth in a macrophage cell line and in mice. The authors conducted many experiments, which revealed that the rv0158 mutant has many phenotypes, but unfortunately the direct regulon of Rv0158 remains unidentified. The mechanistic basis for the attenuation of the rv0158 deletion mutant in the mouse model is therefore unexplained.</p><p>The identified &quot;redoxosome&quot; includes genes that are functionally very diverse, and I am not convinced that the majority is required for redox homeostasis. Moreover, the authors failed to validate individual transposon mutants. The validation experiments done with the enriched mutant pool (Figure 2) are not informative as the data could be driven by just a few of the mutants. They analyzed EMSH response in a handful of transposon mutants obtained from BEI but did not carry out any further functional analysis that would provide confidence that the identified mutants are in fact required for redox homeostasis. The EMSH response is not sufficient to support this claim. It is not clear why these specific mutants were selected.</p><p>The authors focused on the putative transcriptional regulator Rv0158 and used RNAseq to identify its regulon. The approach cannot distinguish genes that are directly regulated by Rv0158 from those that are indirectly regulated. This is supported by the large number of genes identified. Accordingly, the follow-up work does not lead to significant insight into the function of Rv0158. The mutant accumulated fewer mycolic acids than wt was more permeable to EtBr, and contained higher NADPH levels than wt Mtb; the underlying mechanisms and specific dysregulated genes that are responsible for these phenotypes remain undetermined. Similarly, the growth defects are difficult to interpret and the conclusion that rv0158 deletion improved growth with fatty acids as a carbon source is not supported by the data; this is only observed with propionate.</p><p>The conclusion that rv0158 is required to survive in macrophages is incorrect. The mutant survives perfectly well (100% survival); it fails to grow like wt. The slight <italic>in vivo</italic> growth defect and more drastic persistence defect seems inconsistent with the data from the macrophage cell line.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for insightful comments. We have addressed most of the Reviewer’s comments in the revised manuscript. Since our FACS-based strategy did not use exogenous ROS donors (e.g., H2O2 or cumene hydroperoxide) to induce oxidative stress, we expected to unbiasedly sort out mutants that directly or indirectly affect redox by influencing metabolism and respiration. Therefore, our findings are on the anticipated lines. We randomly selected 10 Tn mutants, available at the BEI resource, to validate the screen. To further bolster our validation, we analyzed the Tn mutants (ROS measurement and DNA damage) to confirm that the strains are indeed oxidatively stressed. We have included these findings in the revised manuscript (Lines: 164- 177, 263- 267 in the revised manuscript).</p><p>We selected an uncharacterized transcription factor (Rv0158) for further analysis. In the revised manuscript, we performed a detailed characterization of Rv0158. We identified the ligands for Rv1058 by MST. Using ChIP-seq, we identified binding sites for Rv0158 when <italic>Mtb</italic> is grown in glucose vs propionate-medium. Furthermore, we performed a metabolomics study to examine the underlying mechanism of growth improvement on propionate. Finally, we examined the survival of the mutant inside immune-activated macrophages and confirmed poor survival. The mutant showed a slow growth phenotype on glucose and mixed carbon source (glucose, glycerol, and tween-80). However, the growth of the mutant was better than WT <italic>Mtb</italic> on propionate. Overall, data suggest that Rv0158 deficiency accelerates propionyl-CoA utilization and reduces the pool of toxic metabolites such as glyoxylate, positively influencing the growth and bioenergetics of <italic>rv0158 KO</italic> utilizing propionate as a sole carbon source. We also repeated macrophages data to include more time points and showed that <italic>rv0158 KO</italic> entered into bacteriostasis at two days post-infection (p.i.) and showed ≈50% killing at four days p.i. The killing of the mutant coincides with an overwhelming oxidative shift in the <italic>E<sub>MSH</sub></italic> of <italic>Mtb</italic> inside immune-activated macrophages. At both these time points, the survival of the mutant remains significantly lower than the WT <italic>Mtb</italic>.</p><p>The likely reason for attenuation inside animals requires more experimentation. However, the plausible cause could be the exceptional sensitivity of the mutant to oxidative/nitrosative stress and fitness defect on diverse carbon sources or glucose as a sole carbon source. These data are consistent with the fact that <italic>Mtb</italic> persistence in mice relies upon resistance to oxidative/nitrosative stress, efficient metabolization of glucose, and co-catabolism of fatty acids and glucose (Adams et al., 1997; Marrero et al., 2013; Noy et al., 2016).

We have included CFU data to corroborate the resazurin- reduction experiment in the revised manuscript (Figure 12B in the revised manuscript).

We agree with the Reviewer that additional experiments are needed to show that these Tn mutants are oxidatively stressed.

Therefore, we propose that Rv0158 facilitates the regulation of genes associated with propionate metabolism in <italic>Mtb</italic>. To examine this, we performed ChIP-sequencing (ChIP-seq) using an anhydrotetracycline (ATc)-inducible flag-tagged Rv0158 (pexCF-<italic>rv0158</italic>) (Minch et al., 2015) (Lines: 468- 474 in the revised manuscript).</p><p>When glucose was used as a sole C-source, Rv0158 binds to the promoter regions of 70 <italic>Mtb</italic> genes (Supplementary file 5 in the revised manuscript; Fold change over input control &gt; 1.5; <italic>q value</italic> &lt; 0.0001). Further classification of these genes indicates that Rv0158 binds to several genes involved in methyl-branched lipid biosynthesis (<italic>pks2</italic>, <italic>fadD23</italic>, <italic>rv2958c</italic>, <italic>rv2959c</italic>, <italic>rv2961</italic>), lipid transporter (<italic>rv0987-rv0988</italic>, <italic>mmpL1 mmpS1</italic>, <italic>mmpL4</italic>-<italic>mmpS4</italic>), biotin synthesis (<italic>bioF2</italic>), and surface-associated proteins (<italic>esp</italic> operon, <italic>lpqG</italic>, <italic>esxQ</italic>, <italic>rv1501</italic>-r<italic>v1507A</italic>) (Supplementary file 5 in the revised manuscript) (Lines: 474- 482 in the revised manuscript). Under propionate condition, Rv0158 binds to promoter regions encompassing 32 genes (Fold change over input control &gt; 1.5; <italic>q value</italic> &lt; 0.0001). Out of 32 genes, 24 genes overlap with glucose. The promoter regions of the remaining eight genes Rv0158 exclusively bound in propionate- grown <italic>Mtb</italic> were part of MCC and the glyoxylate cycle (<italic>icl1</italic>, <italic>fadB2</italic>, <italic>prpR</italic>, <italic>and prp</italic> operon) (Figure 11 and Supplementary file 5 in the revised manuscript) (Lines: 483- 488 in the revised manuscript).</p><p>We performed RT-qPCR and found that the expression of MCC genes was specifically induced in WT <italic>Mtb</italic> grown in propionate (Figure 10, and Figure 10—figure supplement 2 in the revised manuscript). In contrast to WT <italic>Mtb</italic>, MCC genes were uniformly induced in <italic>rv0158</italic> KO independent of C source (Figure 10, and Figure 10—figure supplement 2 in the revised manuscript). However, propionate resulted in a far greater induction of MCC genes in <italic>rv0158</italic> KO than glucose (Figure 10 and Figure 10—figure supplement 2 in the revised manuscript). In addition to the MCC pathway, <italic>Mtb</italic> mitigates propionate toxicity via the biosynthesis of PDIM (phthiocerol dimycocerosates) (Lee et al., 2013) (Figure 10C in the revised manuscript). We measured the expression of the PDIM biosynthesis cluster in <italic>rv0158</italic> KO. Expression of PDIM genes was broadly unchanged in <italic>rv0158</italic> KO on glucose compared to WT <italic>Mtb</italic> (Figure 10 and Figure 10—figure supplement 2 in the revised manuscript). However, similar to MCC genes, the PDIM cluster was induced ≈10-fold in <italic>rv0158</italic> KO compared to WT <italic>Mtb</italic> on propionate (Figure 10, and Figure 10—figure supplement 2 in the revised manuscript). Since Rv0158 did not bind to any PDIM genes, data indicate that their hyperexpression in <italic>rv0158 KO</italic>, specifically on propionate, was an indirect effect (Lines: 428- 445 in the revised manuscript).</p><p>Since Rv0158 binds many genes related to methyl-branched fatty acid metabolism/transport despite growth on glucose, we think that methylmalonyl-CoA is available for binding to Rv0158 and repressing undesirable over-expression of propionate metabolic pathways. Agreeing to this, <italic>Mtb</italic> cultured on glucose maintains carbon flux into MCC and glyoxylate cycle, indicating the availability of propionyl-CoA and methylmalonyl-CoA (Eoh and Rhee, 2014c). Under propionate-rich conditions, increased requirements to mitigate toxicity can be achieved by Rv0158-mediated binding high levels of methylmalonyl-CoA and calibrating carbon flux into MCC by direct binding to <italic>prpR</italic>, <italic>prp</italic> operon, and <italic>icl1,</italic> and indirectly to production of methyl branched lipids. Lack of this control under conditions of mixed carbon sources (sugar and fatty acids) <italic>in vivo</italic> could have contributed to the persistence defect of <italic>rv0158</italic> KO in mice. The exceptional sensitivity of the mutant to oxidative and nitrosative stress is an additional factor responsible for the phenotype of the mutant <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors should test growth with additional fatty acids, especially those that are relevant to the <italic>in vivo</italic> environment to substantiate the claim that rv0158 is required for growth with fatty acids.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for this recommendation. As suggested by the Reviewer, we measured the growth of WT <italic>Mtb</italic>, <italic>rv0158</italic> KO, and <italic>rv0158</italic> Comp in 7H9 medium supplemented with either 0.3% glucose or host-relevant fatty acids (0.3% sodium acetate, 0.3% sodium propionate, 0.02% cholesterol, 200 μM palmitate) as a sole carbon (C) source (Lines: 356- 361 in the revised manuscript). Both absorbance (OD 600 nm) and CFU estimation showed a slow growth phenotype with an extended lag phase on glucose (Figure 7A and Figure 7—figure supplement 1 in the revised manuscript). The defective growth phenotype of <italic>rv0158</italic> KO was absent if glucose was replaced by acetate/cholesterol/palmitate (Figure 7B- D in the revised manuscript). Interestingly, we observed a gradual increase in the growth of <italic>rv0158</italic> KO on 0.3% sodium propionate, a concentration bacteriostatic to both WT <italic>Mtb</italic> and <italic>rv0158</italic> Comp (Figure 7B- D in the revised manuscript).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The conclusion that the key rv0158 function is to maintain the flux of lipid metabolism intermediates needs to be substantiated by carbon flux analyses.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the Reviewer. Therefore, to elucidate metabolic changes associated with the better adaptability of <italic>rv0158 KO</italic> on fatty acids, we performed liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) metabolomics following exposure of WT <italic>Mtb</italic> and <italic>rv0158 KO</italic> to 0.3% glucose or 0.3% propionate (Lines: 400- 427 in the revised manuscript). We observed a ~100-fold accumulation of 2-methylcitrate (2-MC) in WT <italic>Mtb</italic> and <italic>rv0158</italic> KO under propionate but not glucose (Figure 9 in the revised manuscript), confirming the activation of propionate breakdown by MCC. Furthermore, downstream metabolites of propionate catabolism such as pyruvate, succinate, fumarate, malate, oxaloacetate, and glyoxylate were significantly accumulated (2-6-fold) in propionate-grown WT <italic>Mtb</italic> as compared to glucose (Figure 9 in the revised manuscript). In contrast, these metabolites were either not accumulated (<italic>e.g.,</italic> succinate, malate, and oxaloacetate) or marginally accumulated (<italic>e.g.,</italic> fumarate and glyoxylate) in propionate-grown <italic>rv0158</italic> KO (Figure 9 in the revised manuscript), presumably due to efficient catabolism of propionate via MCC in the mutant relative to WT <italic>Mtb</italic>. We also found evidence of lesser accumulation of pyruvate and lactate in <italic>rv0158</italic> KO (Figure 9 in the revised manuscript). Since the pyruvate and lactate levels depend on glyoxylate shunt, MCC, and gluconeogenesis (Serafini et al., 2019), these findings agree with the better metabolic ability of <italic>rv0158 KO</italic> to consume propionate. Conservation of α-ketoglutarate and glutamate pools via glutamine synthase (GltB/D’s) is an additional metabolic strategy to neutralize propionate toxicity in <italic>Mtb</italic> (Lee et al., 2018). We found that α-ketoglutarate pools are marginally higher in <italic>rv0158</italic> KO compared to WT <italic>Mtb</italic> under propionate (Figure 9 in the revised manuscript), indicating another reason for better mutant growth on propionate. Data suggest that <italic>rv0158</italic> KO mitigates propionate toxicity through efficient MCC and TCA cycle metabolization.</p><p>We also accept that only a pulse-label of a metabolite and the estimation of label incorporation in the metabolic products can fully indicate flux, since the steady-state amounts cannot separate production from consumption. However, when observed over entire pathways, or complete sets of metabolites, they do conclusively indicate the overall metabolic state in the cell and, in many cases, correlate with overall flux. However, to be correct in our description, we only indicated pool sizes of these metabolites in the text. We hope the Reviewer would agree that these findings, together with the data showing improved growth and bioenergetics of <italic>rv0158</italic> KO on propionate compared to glucose, support the role of Rv0158 in integrating carbon metabolism with redox balance in <italic>Mtb</italic>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>MIC measurements using growth/OD600 readings should be conducted.</p></disp-quote><p>We have supplemented our MIC data with CFU analysis.

They have addressed many prior concerns to yield an impressive story, but there are some concerns with the newly added data that need to be addressed. In addition, the authors still seem to bias their interpretations towards their favored model and should revise the manuscript to consider alternatives.</p><p>The authors should address the following comments, which they should largely be able to do by not overstating their results, considering other models, and providing a more thorough and transparent analysis of the metabolite measurements.</p><p>1. The findings that the rv0158 deletion mutant can grow on propionate at a concentration that inhibits growth of the wt and complemented strains and that Rv0158 can bind methylmalonyl-CoA are interesting. However, the authors' interpretations are often based on phenotypic differences whose physiological relevance remains unclear. Their interpretation of the phenotypes seems biased towards the model they propose, but other explanations should be considered and included, at least in the discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the comment. Our data suggest that Rv0158 likely senses methylmalonyl-CoA and regulates the expression of pathways associated with propionate metabolism. However, several issues remain to be addressed. We need to investigate if methylmalonyl-CoA is perceived as a metabolic signal by Rv0158 in <italic>Mtb</italic> and how this association affects direct interaction with DNA and gene expression. Also, the lack of Rv0158 may induce a physiological state in <italic>Mtb that is</italic> more tolerant to toxicity caused by fatty acids such as propionate. For example, cAMP homeostasis is associated with modulating redox balance, respiration, fatty acid uptake, and fatty acid toxicity in <italic>mycobacteria</italic> (Ko and Oh, 2020; Nambi et al., 2013; Nazarova et al., 2019; Wong et al., 2023)<italic>.</italic> Moreover, <italic>Mycobacterium bovis</italic> BCG elevates cAMP levels in response to propionate, and phosphodiesterases such as Rv0805 regulate cAMP homeostasis to modulate growth on propionate (McDowell et al., 2023). Other evidence suggests that reduced cAMP levels result in overactive fatty acid catabolism (Nambi et al., 2013; Nazarova et al., 2019) as we observed in the case of <italic>rv0158 KO</italic> growing on propionate. While overactive fatty acid catabolism is generally detrimental due to the accumulation of toxic intermediates, mycobacteria have evolved sophisticated regulatory mechanisms (e.g., FdmR) to direct the flux of excess fatty acids away from catabolism to lipid anabolism (Dong et al., 2021). These alterations on the mycobacterial surface might be important to counteract toxicity caused by fatty acid-dependent disruption of <italic>the Mtb</italic> envelope (Kengmo Tchoupa et al., 2022). We observed a higher expression of the PDIM biosynthesis cluster, altered mycolic acids content, and changes in membrane permeability of <italic>rv0158</italic> KO, suggesting overall changes in the cell envelope of the mutant. Therefore, the physiological effects of <italic>rv0158</italic> disruption in <italic>Mtb</italic> could result from multiple effectors such as redox, respiration, and cAMP. Also, propionate metabolism is regulated by multiple transcription factors (<italic>e.g.,</italic> GlnR, PrpR, RamB, PhoP, WhiB3) in <italic>Mtb</italic> (Lee et al., 2013; Micklinghoff et al., 2009; Qi et al., 2021; Singh et al., 2009; Tang et al., 2019). Therefore, future experiments are needed to understand the breadth of Rv0158-mediated gene regulation in collaboration with additional regulators and metabolites (<italic>e.g.,</italic> acyl-CoA, malonyl-CoA, and cAMP) in coordinating fatty acid metabolism. In the revised manuscript, we have included the above explanations in the Discussion section of the revised manuscript (Lines: 737- 767 in the revised manuscript). We thank the editors for these insightful comments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. There are concerns regarding the metabolomics data. The authors do not seem to have used metabolite standards. Even the source data fail to show which masses they utilized for the measured metabolites. Oxaloacetate is very unstable and can typically not be measured directly.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for not adequately describing the metabolomics data. For measurement of the TCA cycle and glyoxylate cycle intermediates, metabolites were derivatized with O-benzylhydroxylamine (OBHA) after extraction and drying down, as mentioned in earlier method papers (Tan et al., 2014; Walvekar et al., 2018). In particular, oxaloacetate is unstable in aqueous solutions, hence was stabilized by OBHA derivatization to prevent degradation (Figure 9- Source Data 1, Figure 9—figure supplement 1- 2 in the revised manuscript) (also see Walvekar et al., 2018 for extensive methodology details). We have used metabolites standards to identify and quantify the TCA and methylcitrate cycle metabolites (please see the source data- Figure 9- Source Data 1). The metabolites were separated using Synergi 4µm Fusion-RP 80 Å LC column (150 x 4.6 612 mm, Phenomenex) on Shimadzu Nexera UHPLC system. Solvents used for the separation of TCA intermediates are the following: 0.1% formic acid in water (solvent A) and 0.1% formic acid in methanol (solvent B). The metabolites were detected using ABSciex QTRAP 5500 mass spectrometer. The detailed parameters used are described in Walvekar et al., 2018. The data was acquired using Analyst 1.6.2 software (Sciex) and analyzed using MultiQuant version 3.0.1 (Sciex). We have incorporated this information in the results (Lines: 412- 419 in the revised manuscript) and methods sections (Lines: 1344- 1355 in the revised manuscript) of the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The statement &quot;We found that α-ketoglutarate pools are marginally higher in rv0158 KO compared to WT Mtb under propionate (Figure 9; [Figure 9 in the revised manuscript]), indicating another reason for better mutant growth on propionate&quot; is not justified, because in the complemented mutant α-ketoglutarate pools are even higher than that in the KO.</p></disp-quote><p>This was an inadvertent error from our side. We removed the statement from the submitted revised manuscript (1-05-2022-RA-<italic>eLife</italic>-80218R1) but did not delete it from the corresponding response letter. This result is not a part of the revised manuscript. We apologize for the confusion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The authors added CFU data to assess susceptibility to antibiotics, but this is different than MIC measurements using growth as readout to assess drug resistance, which can be different than susceptibility to drug induced killing. This should be considered when describing and interpreting the data.</p></disp-quote><p>The reason for doing the CFU experiment was to rule out the issue with the MIC assays done using resazurin dye (raised by Reviewer #2). However, in light of the above comment, we have modified the Results section to clearly differentiate between resistance and drug induced killing (Lines- 528- 539 in the revised manuscript).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The authors' explanation for the different binding targets of Rv0158 during growth in glucose and in propionate is not clear. It seems that they suggest that methylmalony -CoA binding is required for Rv1058 to bind and repress the prpR promoter, but direct evidence for this is lacking. Overall, their model of Rv0158 activity is very complex and is sometimes based solely on associations. The authors would benefit by more rigorously evaluating their data and being more careful with their interpretations.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the model of Rv0158 mediated gene regulation is very complex and needs independent investigation. To the extent possible, we have rigorously analysed and interpreted the data. We reanalyzed the ChIP-seq data and made further revision in our interpretations. Based on all the sequences enriched in the ChIP analysis under glucose and propionate conditions, the conserved binding motif for Rv0158 was found to be YGGCGGBGMCGGCGG (where Y represents pyrimidines (C/T), B represents G/T/C, and M represents A/C, enrichment e value = 2.6*10<sup>-109</sup>) (Figure 11D in the revised manuscript). While the binding motif is unique, it is closely located to the binding motifs of other transcription factors involved in regulating methylcitrate cycle (<italic>e.g.,</italic> PrpR, GlnR, PhoP, and RamB) (Supplementary file 6 in the revised manuscript), suggesting overlapping or competing mechanisms to regulate propionate metabolism in <italic>Mtb</italic>. We also made it clear that the direct or indirect nature of Rv0158-mdiated regulation needs future experimentation (Lines- 508- 515 in the revised manuscript).</p><p>Additionally, in the Discussion section we made it evident that there several alternate models to explain the findings associated with Rv0158 including the need to understand the breadth of Rv0158-mediated gene regulation in collaboration with additional regulators (GlnR, PrpR, RamB, PhoP, WhiB3) and metabolites (<italic>e.g.,</italic> acyl-CoA, malonyl-CoA, and cAMP) in coordinating fatty acid metabolism (Lines- 743- 767 in the revised manuscript).</p><p>References</p><p>Dong W, Nie X, Zhu H, Liu Q, Shi K, You L, Zhang Y, Fan H, Yan B, Niu C, Lyu LD, Zhao GP, Yang C. 2021.
