The mechanisms underpinning this cross-modal plasticity are poorly understood. We probe such mechanisms by performing a forward genetic screen for mutants with enhanced O<sub>2</sub> perception in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>. Multiple mutants exhibiting increased O<sub>2</sub> responsiveness concomitantly show defects in other sensory responses. One mutant, <italic>qui-1</italic>, defective in a conserved NACHT/WD40 protein, abolishes pheromone-evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses in the ADL pheromone-sensing neurons. At the same time, ADL responsiveness to pre-synaptic input from O<sub>2</sub>-sensing neurons is heightened in <italic>qui-1</italic>, and other sensory defective mutants, resulting in enhanced neurosecretion although not increased Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses. Expressing <italic>qui-1</italic> selectively in ADL rescues both the <italic>qui-1</italic> ADL neurosecretory phenotype and enhanced escape from 21% O<sub>2</sub>. Profiling ADL neurons in <italic>qui-1</italic> mutants highlights extensive changes in gene expression, notably of many neuropeptide receptors. We show that elevated ADL expression of the conserved neuropeptide receptor NPR-22 is necessary for enhanced ADL neurosecretion in <italic>qui-1</italic> mutants, and is sufficient to confer increased ADL neurosecretion in control animals. Sensory loss can thus confer cross-modal plasticity by changing the peptidergic connectome.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>neural circuits</kwd><kwd>neuropeptide receptors</kwd><kwd>cross-modal plasticity</kwd><kwd>behavioural mutants</kwd><kwd>genetic screen</kwd><kwd>neural profiling by RNAseq</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>209504/Z/17/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>de Bono</surname><given-names>Mario</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010663</institution-id><institution>H2020 European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>269058 ACMO</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>de Bono</surname><given-names>Mario</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Graduate Student Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Valperga</surname><given-names>Giulio</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Stimulus-receptivity loss increases coupling of a sensory neuron to a second sensory circuit by upregulating neuropeptide receptors, enhancing output of the second circuit, and providing a mechanism for cross-modal plasticity.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Animals that lose a sensory modality often show increased sensitivity to other sensory inputs. This change can involve repurposing neurons or brain areas that normally mediate responses to the lost modality such that they process other sensory inputs. For example, in blind people the absence of visual stimulation leads to rewiring of inputs into primary visual cortex (V1), so that V1 becomes responsive to tactile stimuli, a characteristic absent in sighted individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Büchel et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dietrich et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sadato et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wanet-Defalque et al., 1988</xref>). The molecular mechanisms enabling such repurposing of neural circuits are incompletely understood, but at some level are thought to reflect opportunities for rewiring.</p><p>Animals can execute innate behaviours without a need for prior learning. However, experience and context can modulate innate behaviours, with circuits coordinating innate responses integrating information from modulating sensory pathways. Connections that link circuits mediating responses to distinct sensory cues provide opportunities to re-route sensory information if one sensory pathway is damaged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fine and Park, 2018</xref>). <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> provides a favourable model to study cross-modal interactions in neural circuits, and how these connections may be altered by neural plasticity, in particular because of the careful reconstruction of its complete wiring diagram of chemical and electrical synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cook et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jarrell et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">White et al., 1986</xref>). These studies have emphasized the anatomical stereotypy of the <italic>C. elegans</italic> nervous system, which contrasts with extensive experience-dependent plasticity at the behavioural level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fenk and de Bono, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pocock and Hobert, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Saeki et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhang et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>A salient environmental cue for <italic>C. elegans</italic> is oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gray et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Persson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zimmer et al., 2009</xref>). Instantaneous as well as prior O<sub>2</sub> experience can reconfigure the value of sensory cues for this animal. For example, animals acclimated to 21% O<sub>2</sub> are attracted to pheromones that repel animals acclimated to 7% O<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fenk and de Bono, 2017</xref>). The wiring diagram, coupled with Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging, provides tantalizing hints about the basis of cross-modal plasticity associated with changes in O<sub>2</sub> levels. One of the main O<sub>2</sub>-sensing neurons, URX, forms a spoke in a large hub-and-spoke circuit centred on the RMG interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Macosko et al., 2009</xref>). Several sensory neurons, including pheromone receptors called ASK and ADL that, respectively, mediate attraction and repulsion from pheromones, form additional spokes in the circuit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Macosko et al., 2009</xref>). The URX O<sub>2</sub> sensors show persistent higher activity at 21% O<sub>2</sub> compared to 7% O<sub>2</sub>, and tonically transmit this activity to the RMG hub interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Busch et al., 2012</xref>). These O<sub>2</sub>-evoked changes in URX and RMG somehow alter the pheromone response properties of ASK and ADL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fenk and de Bono, 2017</xref>). Reciprocally, altering sensory transduction in the ASK or ADL neurons influences how <italic>C. elegans</italic> responds to O<sub>2</sub> stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">de Bono et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Laurent et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Macosko et al., 2009</xref>). However, the molecular underpinnings of how cross-modal changes are coordinated across the hub-and-spoke circuit as different elements of the circuit become more or less active are unclear.</p><p>Here, we employ forward genetics to identify mechanisms that alter information processing across the RMG hub-and-spoke circuit. We suppress <italic>C. elegans</italic> arousal in response to 21% O<sub>2</sub> by using genetic backgrounds that reduce signalling from RMG. We then seek mutants that restore O<sub>2</sub> responsiveness; such mutants are likely to reprogram sensory information processing across the hub-and-spoke circuit to circumvent RMG inhibition. We identify several sensory defective mutants that increase ADL’s ability to relay information from pre-synaptic neurons, including from URX O<sub>2</sub> sensors and RMG interneurons. Specifically, these mutants show increased O<sub>2</sub>-evoked secretion of neuropeptides from ADL. Using RNA sequencing (RNAseq), we profile ADL neurons in wild-type control and one enhancer mutant, <italic>qui-1</italic>. We discover extensive remodelling of ADL’s peptidergic properties and find that increased expression of the neuropeptide receptor NPR-22 is necessary and sufficient to increase neurosecretion from ADL. Our data suggest that defects in sensory perception by the ADL pheromone sensors can increase ADL’s responsiveness to input from the O<sub>2</sub> circuit by reconfiguring its sensitivity to neuropeptides. Changes in the peptidergic connectome may be an unappreciated mechanism by which loss of one sensory modality alters responsiveness to another.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A genetic screen for enhancers of <italic>C. elegans</italic> aggregation behaviour</title><p>Natural isolates of <italic>C. elegans</italic> avoid and escape 21% O<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">de Bono and Bargmann, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cheung et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gray et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Persson et al., 2009</xref>). On a bacterial lawn these animals move rapidly and continuously while seeking lower O<sub>2</sub> concentrations such as areas of thick bacterial growth. A hub-and-spoke network that integrates multiple sensory cues coordinates this escape behaviour (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fenk and de Bono, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Laurent et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Macosko et al., 2009</xref>). The standard <italic>C. elegans</italic> lab strain N2 (Bristol), referred to here as wild-type (WT), is not aroused by 21% O<sub>2</sub> and does not accumulate on thick bacteria. This is due to a gain-of-function mutation in the neuropeptide receptor NPR-1, <italic>npr-1</italic> 215V (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">de Bono and Bargmann, 1998</xref>) which arose during domestication of the original Bristol wild strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">McGrath et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Weber et al., 2010</xref>). NPR-1 215V inhibits O<sub>2</sub>-escape behaviour by acting in the RMG interneurons to reduce the output of the hub-and-spoke circuit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Macosko et al., 2009</xref>). We exploited this inhibition to set up genetic screens seeking mutants that restored O<sub>2</sub>-escape behaviour to <italic>npr-1 215</italic>V animals. Such mutants are likely to circumvent RMG’s inhibition by re-routing sensory information and increasing the output of the hub-and-spoke circuit, thereby shedding light on cross-modulation of sensory circuits.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>A genetic screen for mutants with enhanced O<sub>2</sub>-escape behaviour.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The hub-and-spoke circuit associated with the URX O<sub>2</sub> sensors and O<sub>2</sub>-escape behaviour, updated according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cook et al., 2019</xref>.

We therefore mutagenized both N2 animals, and <italic>flp-21</italic> deletion mutants, and selected for individuals that accumulated preferentially on a patch of thick bacteria (OP50) placed in the middle of a thin lawn (see Methods) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> – Step 1). We isolated 22 mutants from the N2 parental strain and 17 mutants from the <italic>flp-21</italic> parental strain that preferentially accumulated on the thick food patch. From these mutants, we further selected six strains that displayed enhanced O<sub>2</sub>-evoked changes in locomotory activity compared to N2 controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> – Step 2). N2 and <italic>flp-21</italic> animals show only a modest change in locomotory activity when O<sub>2</sub> levels change from 7% to 21%, due to reduced RMG activity. By contrast, animals with a functional O<sub>2</sub> circuit become aroused at 21% O<sub>2</sub> and quiescent at 7% O<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Busch et al., 2012</xref>). To capture these differences in locomotory activity in one metric we plotted the ratio between animal speed at 21% and 7% O<sub>2</sub>.</p><p>To identify the genetic defects causing increased O<sub>2</sub>-escape behaviour in these mutants we used a Deep Sequence Mapping strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zuryn et al., 2010</xref>).

These strains showed indistinguishable responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>), further suggesting that disrupting <italic>qui-1</italic> confers strong O<sub>2</sub>-escape behaviour. To confirm this, we showed that a wild-type <italic>qui-1</italic> transgene completely rescued the <italic>qui-1</italic>(<italic>db104</italic>) O<sub>2</sub>-escape phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).</p><p>In the hub-and-spoke circuit, the URX O<sub>2</sub> sensors are tonically activated by 21% O<sub>2</sub> and in turn tonically activate the RMG hub interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Busch et al., 2012</xref>).

Two additional O<sub>2</sub> sensors, AQR and PQR, while not a part of the hub-and-spoke circuit, also signal increasing O<sub>2</sub> concentrations to the animal.

WD40 domains mediate protein–protein or protein–DNA interactions. NACHT domains are present in proteins involved in programmed cell death and transcription of the major histocompatibility complex, and include an NTPase domain, which is proposed to regulate signalling from these proteins. Most of the Walker A motif (Motif 1P loop) in the NTPase domain, which binds nucleotides, is conserved in QUI-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>), suggesting the NACHT domain is functional.</p><p>Previous work suggests <italic>qui-1</italic> is expressed in a small subset of sensory and interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hilliard et al., 2004</xref>).

We impaired sensory input into ADL by cell specifically disrupting the function of its cilia. Sensory cilia are necessary for ADL’s chemosensory activity, and proper cilia formation is supported by OSM-6, an intraflagellar transport protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Collet et al., 1998</xref>). <italic>osm-6</italic> mutants display truncated cilia, fail to take up the lipophilic dye DiO, and show severe chemosensory defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hedgecock et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Perkins et al., 1986</xref>). To cell specifically disrupt OSM-6 in ADL, we introduced a sequence encoding an Auxin inducible degron (AID) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nishimura et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>) in frame and just upstream of the stop codon of <italic>osm-6</italic> using CRISPR/Cas9. <italic>osm-6::AID</italic> knock-in animals did not show any defect compared to wild-type in their ability to take up DiO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A, B</xref>), suggesting that OSM-6::AID is functional. ADL-restricted expression of the F-box protein TIR1, which selectively targets proteins containing the AID tag for degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nishimura et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>), was sufficient to reduce ADL dye filling in <italic>osm-6::AID</italic> animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2C</xref> III and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2D</xref>).

This is consistent with recent reports that TIR1 can target proteins for degradation in the absence of Auxin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hills-Muckey et al., 2021</xref>). Taken together these data confirm cell-specific knockdown of OSM-6 and that increased knockdown progressively impairs ADL cilia integrity.</p><p>Cell-specific disruption of OSM-6::AID resulted in dye filling defects in ADL. To assess if this disruption was sufficient to heighten responsiveness to pre-synaptic O<sub>2</sub> input, we assayed ADL neurosecretion in <italic>osm-6::AID</italic> animals. <italic>osm-6::AID</italic> animals expressing TIR1 in ADL displayed elevated neurosecretion levels compared to <italic>osm-6::AID</italic> controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2E</xref>), whereas growing these animals in the presence of Auxin suppressed this increase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>).

Both <italic>qui-1;npr-22</italic> and <italic>qui-1;tkr-1</italic> animals show O<sub>2</sub>-escape responses similar to those of <italic>qui-1</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A, B</xref>), and overexpressing <italic>npr-22</italic> in ADL neurons did not confer increased O<sub>2</sub>-escape behaviour compared to wild-type animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2C</xref>). This suggests that while increased expression of <italic>npr-22</italic> and <italic>tkr-1</italic> underpin increased ADL neurosecretion in <italic>qui-1</italic> mutants, they are not sufficient to explain the increased O<sub>2</sub>-escape behaviour in these animals. To further address if neurosecretion from ADL is required for the O<sub>2</sub>-escape behaviour of <italic>qui-1</italic> mutants, we expressed tetanus toxin (TeTX) in <italic>qui-1</italic> mutants. TeTX is predicted to cleave SNB-1, the main synaptobrevin expressed in ADL neurons. The O<sub>2</sub>-escape behaviour of <italic>qui-1</italic> animals expressing TeTX in ADL was similar to that of <italic>qui-1</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2D</xref>), suggesting that ADL neurosecretion is not essential for the increased O<sub>2</sub>-escape response of <italic>qui-1</italic> mutants. Whether this reflects redundancy between <italic>qui-1</italic>-expressing neurons, and/or a role for altered ADL communication via gap junctions, is still unclear. We conclude that disrupting sensory responsiveness in ADL, by the <italic>qui-1</italic> mutation, increases the coupling of this neuron to the hub-and-spoke circuit by reconfiguring the expression of neuropeptide receptors that facilitate DCVs release.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Cross-modal plasticity is thought to involve recruitment of impaired neurons to process additional sensory modalities. The molecular details of such rearrangement are not yet clear. Here, we use forward genetics as an entry point to seek mechanisms that increase <italic>C. elegans’</italic> responsiveness to an oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) sensory cue. Several of the mutants we identify simultaneously increase responsiveness to O<sub>2</sub> while disrupting other sensory responses – a hallmark of cross-modal plasticity. We analyse one of these mutants, <italic>qui-1</italic>, which is defective in the ortholog of mammalian NWD1, in depth. We show that loss of QUI-1 prevents the ADL sensory neurons from responding to pheromone, but increases ADL neurosecretion in response to input from upstream O<sub>2</sub>-sensing neurons. Loss of <italic>qui-1</italic> thus recruits ADL sensory neurons more strongly into the O<sub>2</sub>-sensing circuit. We observe a similar change in additional sensory defective animals as well as in animals with ADL-specific impairment of the intraflagellar transport protein OSM-6. Loss of <italic>qui-1</italic> is associated with extensive changes in gene expression in ADL neurons, notably induced expression of neuropeptide receptors, including NPR-22 and TKR-1. Elevated expression of NPR-22 and TKR-1 increase the coupling of ADL neurosecretion to O<sub>2</sub> input in <italic>qui-1</italic> mutants. We propose that impairing sensory perception can sensitize sensory neurons to other sensory modalities by reconfiguring peptidergic circuits.</p><p>ADL-specific expression of <italic>qui-1</italic> rescues both the increased O<sub>2</sub>-escape phenotype of <italic>qui-1</italic> mutants and enhanced neurosecretion from ADL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3A</xref>), indicating that <italic>qui-1</italic> acts cell autonomously to regulate neurosecretion. Impairing the primary O<sub>2</sub>-sensing mechanism, by disrupting the molecular oxygen sensor GCY-35, restores ADL neurosecretion in <italic>qui-1</italic> mutants to levels observed in controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), confirming that increased ADL neurosecretion in <italic>qui-1</italic> is driven primarily by activity originating outside ADL. Together with data showing that <italic>qui-1</italic> mutants exhibit normal O<sub>2</sub>-evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses in the primary O<sub>2</sub>-sensing neurons URX, AQR, PQR, and in the hub interneurons RMG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C–F</xref>), this suggests that in <italic>qui-1</italic> mutants ADL neurons are more sensitive to incoming pre-synaptic activity.</p><p>Selectively expressing <italic>gcy-35</italic> cDNA in the URX O<sub>2</sub> sensors partially rescues the ADL neurosecretion phenotype of <italic>qui-1;gcy-35</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), confirming that URX helps drive increased ADL neurosecretion in <italic>qui-1</italic> mutants. Disrupting the inhibitory neuropeptide receptor <italic>npr-1</italic> further increases ADL neurosecretion in <italic>qui-1</italic> mutants, and this phenotype is partially rescued by expressing <italic>npr-1</italic> cDNA specifically in RMG interneurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). This further supports a model in which activity from the hub-and-spoke circuit propagates from URX–RMG to ADL to stimulate neurosecretion. Consistent with this, in <italic>qui-1</italic> mutants, but not in controls, ADL neurons show O<sub>2</sub>-evoked neurosecretion: prolonged exposure to low (7%) or high (21%) O<sub>2</sub> concentrations modulates ADL neurosecretion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). These data confirm that disrupting <italic>qui-1</italic> recruits ADL more strongly into the hub-and-spoke circuit. It still remains unclear how this increased coupling leads to enhanced O<sub>2</sub>-escape behaviour. Blocking ADL’s output by expressing TeTX has no effect on the O<sub>2</sub>-escape behaviour of <italic>qui-1</italic> mutants. This negative result could reflect either redundancy between ADL and other <italic>qui-1</italic>-expressing neurons, or a still unidentified molecular mechanism, perhaps via gap junctions, by which ADL promotes the O<sub>2</sub> responses of this mutant.</p><p>Previous work in <italic>C. elegans</italic> has described cross-modal plasticity in a touch receptor/olfactory circuit paradigm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rabinowitch et al., 2016</xref>). In this paradigm, worms with touch receptor defects show enhanced odorant responses compared to wild-type controls because activated touch receptors release an inhibitory neuropeptide, FLP-20, that downregulates communication between the AWC olfactory neurons and their post-synaptic target, the AIY interneurons. Loss of touch receptor function thus enhances odorant responses by disinhibiting AWC–AIY communication. In this mechanism, the defective touch receptors do not contribute to the enhanced odorant sensing. FLP-20 appears to act as a general arousal signal, relaying information about mechanical stimulation to multiple circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chew et al., 2018</xref>). By contrast, in the paradigm we describe, the defective sensory neuron, ADL, becomes more strongly incorporated in the circuit mediating the enhanced modality, O<sub>2</sub> response.</p><p>Several questions remain outstanding. How does disrupting <italic>qui-1</italic>, and ADL sensory function, lead to extensive changes in ADL gene expression? Comparing gene expression in ADL between <italic>qui-1</italic> and wild-type controls reveals altered expression of several transcription factors, including members of the nuclear hormone receptor family (<italic>nhr</italic>), the <italic>egl-46</italic> zinc-finger protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wu et al., 2001</xref>) and the storkhead box protein <italic>ham-1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Feng et al., 2013</xref>). Some of these transcription factors show substantial (e.g. &gt;30-fold) induction, and are orthologs of immediate early genes in mammals. These transcription factors may contribute to the transcriptional changes in ADL.</p><p>Previous work has shown that mutations in BBS-7, a conserved protein involved in trafficking of molecular cargos along the primary cilium of neurons, and linked to Bardet–Biedl syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Liu and Lechtreck, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tan et al., 2007</xref>), lead to increased neurosecretion from ADL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lee et al., 2011</xref>). Mutations in <italic>bbs-7</italic> cause defects in cilia formation and in sensory perception. Our data suggest that increased neurosecretion from ADL in <italic>bbs</italic> mutants may reflect increased coupling to the O<sub>2</sub> circuit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Interestingly, <italic>bbs-7</italic> mutants show a range of other physiological phenotypes including small body size and delays in development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lee et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mok et al., 2011</xref>). Both of these phenotypes can be suppressed by mutating <italic>gcy-35</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mok et al., 2011</xref>), consistent with them resulting from enhanced responses to O<sub>2</sub>.</p><p>We identify several sensory defective mutants that display both enhanced neurosecretion from ADL and increased O<sub>2</sub>-evoked locomotory responses. This correlation suggests cell-specific sensory defects in ADL could increase O<sub>2</sub> responsiveness. We test this prediction by knocking down OSM-6, an intraflagellar transport protein essential for correct cilium assembly, exclusively in ADL, resulting in a cell-specific reduction in dye filling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2D</xref>), a proxy for aberrant cilia formation and sensory defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Collet et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hilliard et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Inglis et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Perkins et al., 1986</xref>). Cell-specific sensory defects in ADL result in heightened responsiveness to O<sub>2</sub> inputs which support an increased ADL neurosecretion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). It is important to note that a further reduction in OSM-6 levels and ADL’s dye filling capacity, achieved by cultivating animals overexpressing TIR1 on Auxin, suppressed ADL’s O<sub>2</sub>-evoked neurosecretion. The TIR1 system used in this study makes it difficult to assess OSM-6::AID levels in the absence or presence of Auxin, however we speculate that while mildly disrupting ADL’s cilium function increases ADL responsiveness to O<sub>2</sub> inputs, a greater impairment does not result in the same alteration. These data illustrate a repurposing of ADL sensory neurons in response to cell-specific sensory defects. This is further supported by the fact that both <italic>fig-1</italic> and <italic>wrt-6</italic> display increased ADL neurosecretion and an enhanced O<sub>2</sub> response, despite both genes being expressed in glial cells, suggesting their effect on ADL is indirect. Glia are required for proper cilia development and correct sensory perception, and both glia-ablated animals and <italic>fig-1</italic> mutants show defective responses to cues sensed by ADL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bacaj et al., 2008</xref>). <italic>wrt-6</italic> mutants also exhibit a dye filling defect (data not shown), suggesting impairment in ADL’s ability to sense external cues. These data taken together suggest that the enhanced responsiveness to O<sub>2</sub> input we observe in sensory defective mutants, characterized by increased O<sub>2</sub>-evoked neurosecretion from ADL, is consistent with cell-specific defects in ADL sensory perception. Enhanced ADL neuroendocrine output may modulate aspects of the animal’s physiology and behaviour we have not probed here.</p><p>Conceptually, our findings resonate with studies in vertebrates which find that loss of a sensory modality can lead to recruitment of input-deprived sensory cortex to process information from spared senses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lee and Whitt, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Petrus et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rauschecker, 1995</xref>). In the nervous system of <italic>C. elegans</italic>, the defective ADL sensory neurons becomes sensitized to pre-synaptic input associated with a different modality, O<sub>2</sub> sensing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). This recruitment is supported by a transcriptional program in the sensory defective ADL that induces the expression of neuropeptide receptors including NPR-22 and TKR-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). We speculate that reconfigured peptidergic circuits may be a common feature of cross-modal recruitment.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Model depicting the effect of disrupting sensory perception on ADL sensory neurons.</title><p>Schematic depiction of model explaining ADL O<sub>2</sub>-evoked neurosecretion in sensory defective mutants.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Piali Sengupta as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Ilona C Grunwald Kadow (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>(1) The reviewers are not convinced that the results should be interpreted as evidence for cross modal plasticity (see public review of reviewer #3). The main concern is that the qui-1 mutant background does not distinguish between a specific effect on ADL's sensory properties and a more general switch that concomitantly upregulates neurosecretion and thereby elevated behavioural responses to oxygen. If the authors insist in their interpretation, an orthogonal approach should be taken. A cell specific knockdown of ocr-2 in ADL, either via RNAi or a transgenic Cre-lox strategy, would be a more specific way to disrupt the sensory properties of ADL. Such a manipulation should lead to the same effect, i.e. up-regulation of neurosecretion and elevated behavioural responses to 21% oxygen.</p><p>(2) The authors did not exclude the possibility that other oxygen sensory neurons, e.g. AQR, PQR or BAG show altered responses in qui-1 mutants and could thereby explain the enhanced behavioral responses. In addition to URX and RMG, they should record AQR, PQR and BAG activity in wild-type and qui-1 mutants.</p><p>(3) The authors suggest a rather detailed model while providing only partial evidence for it. The authors convincingly show that neurosecretion from ADL is up-regulated in qui-1 mutants, but this could be a sheer correlation with the behavioral phenotype.</p><p>They should perform ADL cell ablations and in addition interfere with ADL neurosecretion, e.g. by expressing tetanus toxin, both in in qui-1 mutant background. The model predicts that these manipulations will suppress the enhanced behavioral responses to high oxygen.</p><p>In this vein, the behavioral responses to 21% O2 of the strains qui1;npr-22, qui;npr-22 + ADLp:npr22 rescue, ADLp:npr-22 OE, and qui-1 tkr-1 should be analyzed to further support the model.</p><p>(4) There is a large variability in the behavioral assay. For example, in Figure 1D qui-1 mutants show an elevated 21% O2 evoked response, however in Figure 1-S1B the mutants' major phenotype seems to be reduced speed at 7% O2. This would have a strong implication in how to interpret the data and requires further discussion. Related to this, quantifying locomotion speed responses as fold change with respect to the 7% condition cannot distinguish between effects on baseline speed at 7% and effects on 21% evoked response magnitude. Additional quantifications of absolute speed should be provided.</p><p>(5) The authors start their introduction by explaining how the loss of vision, for instance, can lead to the repurposing of neurons and even the rewiring of neural circuits. The presented data, however, describes a cell-autonomous mechanism that increases neuropeptide receptor expression and thereby increases peptide release. The exact relationship between (1) increased O2 sensitivity, (2) increased receptor expression and (3) increased peptide release is not fully explained by the data. This is also evidenced by their model in Figure 6. I suggest that the authors still integrate all of their findings in their model but indicate what remains not fully elucidated.</p><p>For instance, we suggest including URX etc. into your model, because this is the gained sensory modality that makes the whole paper more interesting.</p><p>(6) The issue of possible background mutations influencing the ADL transcriptomic analysis should be addressed. Were the mutants sufficiently outcrossed? This point could be addressed by providing additional transcriptome data from the strains generated in response to (1), different alleles or fully outcrossed lines.</p><p>(7) It should be stated whether the qui-1 mutant was derived from an N2 or flp-21 background, or in other words, what is the wild type.</p><p>The label wild type (WT) is applied at least to 4 different genomic strains (Control strain N2, DAF-28::mCherry, IDA-1::GFP and srh-220p:mKate). This can be confusing for the audience and it is not specified in the methods section. A table of the strains used in the study would be much appreciated. Should be also mentioned that N2 is not a 'wild' strain.</p><p>Related: The label wild type (WT) is applied at least to 4 other different genomic strains (Control strain N2, DAF-28::mCherry, IDA-1::GFP and srh-220p:mKate).

We have sought to test our model with a functional experiment that selectively disrupts sensory input into the ADL neurons. To achieve this, we decided to knock down a protein required for intraflagellar transport, OSM-6, rather than the OCR-2 TRP channel subunit. OCR-2 mediates not only pheromone responses in ADL, but also O<sub>2</sub>-escape behaviour (de Bono et al., 2002). This may reflect a broader role for OCR-2 in ADL than sensory transduction. Disrupting OSM-6 truncates sensory cilia and severely compromises many chemosensory responses, but only weakly reduces aggregation and O<sub>2</sub> responses.</p><p>To target OSM-6 degradation specifically to the ADL neurons we knocked in DNA encoding an Auxin Inducible Degron (AID) into the <italic>osm-6</italic> locus, and expressed TIR1 in ADL to achieve cell-specificity. TIR1 is required for AID. We have added the new data to Figure 4F–G and Figure 4—figure supplement 2. We show that expressing TIR1 in ADL disrupts OSM-6::AID function both in the presence and absence of Auxin. This agrees with recent work that tested the efficiency and specificity of the AID system (Hills-Muckey et al., 2021). A partial OSM-6::AID reduction in ADL recapitulates many of the phenotypes of <italic>qui-1</italic> mutants, including increased neurosecretion from ADL, heightened ADL responses to O<sub>2</sub> inputs and a small but significant enhancement of the O<sub>2</sub>-escape response. We think these new data support our interpretation that a change in ADL’s sensory properties leads to heightened response of ADL neurons to O<sub>2</sub> inputs, a phenotype observed in <italic>qui-1</italic> and multiple other sensory defective mutants and a hallmark of cross-modal plasticity. However, the effects of knocking down <italic>osm-6</italic> on ADL function also appear to be complex, as the stronger <italic>osm-6</italic> knockdown achieved by adding auxin to the <italic>osm-6::AID</italic> knockin animals expressing TIR1 in ADL, unexpectedly gives weaker phenotypes than when auxin is absent.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The authors did not exclude the possibility that other oxygen sensory neurons, e.g. AQR, PQR or BAG show altered responses in qui-1 mutants and could thereby explain the enhanced behavioral responses. In addition to URX and RMG, they should record AQR, PQR and BAG activity in wild-type and qui-1 mutants.</p></disp-quote><p>Our reviewers are right that we did not probe the contribution of other O<sub>2</sub> sensors such as AQR, PQR and BAG. We focused on URX and RMG since they are connected with ASH and ADL neurons in a hub-and-spoke circuit. We have now imaged O<sub>2</sub>-evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses in AQR and PQR in <italic>qui-1</italic> mutants using the Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor YC3.60, and incorporated the data in Figure 1—figure supplement 1D and 1E. In both neurons, the responses of <italic>qui-1</italic> and wild-type animals are comparable. This suggests the enhanced O<sub>2</sub>-escape behaviour of <italic>qui-1</italic> mutants is not explained by increased activity of URX, AQR, PQR or RMG O<sub>2</sub>-sensing neurons.</p><p>We regret we have not been able to image BAG’s O<sub>2</sub>-evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses. These responses are smaller than in other O<sub>2</sub> sensors and require a different microscope set-up capable of higher magnification, and we have encountered technical difficulties in setting up this system.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) The authors suggest a rather detailed model while providing only partial evidence for it.

We have now updated the Discussion to clarify that this mechanism remains unclear, especially in the light of further experiments suggested by our reviewers.</p><p>Our work identified multiple mutants that concomitantly exhibit O<sub>2</sub>-evoked DCV release from ADL neurons and enhanced O<sub>2</sub>-escape behaviour (<italic>qui-1, bbs-7</italic>, <italic>wrt-6</italic> and <italic>fig-1</italic> mutants). Follow up experiments with <italic>osm-6::AID</italic> knockin animals that selectively perturb ADL cilia function by expressing TIR1 in this neuron recapitulate these phenotypes (See Point 1). As suggested by our reviewers, we probed the molecular mechanism linking ADL output to O<sub>2</sub>-escape behaviour. We disrupted ADL neurosecretion in <italic>qui-1</italic> mutants by selectively expressing tetanus toxin (TeTx) in this neuron, and assayed O<sub>2</sub>-evoked escape behaviour (Figure 5—figure supplement 2D). The TeTx expressing <italic>qui-1</italic> animals retained elevated O<sub>2</sub>-escape; this suggests that elevated neurosecretion does not, on its own, explain their altered behaviour. We previously showed that ablating ADL and ASH neurons disrupts aggregation in <italic>npr-1</italic> animals (de Bono et al., 2002), confirming that these neurons are important for this behaviour. We had also shown that expressing TeTx in ASH and ADL neurons in <italic>npr-1</italic> mutants has only a small effect on O<sub>2</sub>-escape response, although it reduced by about half the reversal response evoked by 3 mM Cu<sup>2+</sup> (Laurent et al., 2015).</p><p>We also did not observe any change in O<sub>2</sub>-escape behaviour in <italic>qui-1;npr-22</italic> or <italic>qui-1;tkr-1</italic> double mutants compared to <italic>qui-1</italic> controls, or in transgenic animals over-expressing NPR-22 compared to wild-type (Figure 5—figure supplement 2A-C). Together, these data suggest removing <italic>npr-22</italic>, <italic>tkr-1</italic> or blocking ADL’s synaptic output, is not sufficient to account for the O<sub>2</sub>-responses of <italic>qui-1</italic> mutants. Most likely, communication through gap junctions is also important for the O<sub>2</sub>-escape response of <italic>qui-1</italic> mutants. Further experiments are clearly required to test this model.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) There is a large variability in the behavioral assay. For example, in Figure 1D qui-1 mutants show an elevated 21% O2 evoked response, however in Figure 1-S1B the mutants' major phenotype seems to be reduced speed at 7% O2. This would have a strong implication in how to interpret the data and requires further discussion. Related to this, quantifying locomotion speed responses as fold change with respect to the 7% condition cannot distinguish between effects on baseline speed at 7% and effects on 21% evoked response magnitude. Additional quantifications of absolute speed should be provided.</p></disp-quote><p>Our reviewers are right in pointing out that there is some variability in animals’ speed during O<sub>2</sub>-escape assays. This is something we have observed before. The biggest source of variability appears to be the thickness of the bacterial lawn on which animals are either grown or assayed. For this reason, all our assays are day-matched – different genotypes are grown together and assayed on the same day, on plates seeded at the same time. All our Figures also include data obtained on at least three different days.</p><p>The reviewers also correctly point out that <italic>qui-1</italic> mutants and N2 animals differ in their responses to both 21% and 7% O<sub>2</sub>: not only are <italic>qui-1</italic> animals more strongly aroused by 21% O<sub>2</sub> but they also move more slowly than WT at 7% O<sub>2</sub>. Other aggregation mutants, including <italic>npr-1</italic>, show these same phenotypic differences from N2. Disrupting the O<sub>2</sub> responses of <italic>npr-1</italic> animals, for example by deleting genes encoding the molecular O<sub>2</sub> sensors GCY-35 and GCY-36, confers N2-like behavior: <italic>npr-1;gcy-35</italic> and <italic>npr-1</italic>;<italic>gcy-36</italic> animals move slower than <italic>npr-1</italic> at 21% O<sub>2</sub> but faster at 7% O<sub>2</sub>. We think the intermediate speed of N2 animals (and <italic>gcy-35;npr-1</italic> mutants etc) at 7% O<sub>2</sub> reflects circuit plasticity; the persistent low activity of the O<sub>2</sub>-sensing circuit in these animals renders the locomotory circuit more sensitive to input from other circuits. By contrast, in <italic>npr-1</italic> and <italic>qui-1</italic> mutants kept at 21% O<sub>2</sub> the locomotory circuit is adapted to persistent high input form the O<sub>2</sub> sensing neurons; when this input is removed, by shifting animals to 7% O<sub>2</sub>, the locomotory circuit is less sensitive to input from other circuits – leading to animals moving slowly. Consistent with this interpretation, <italic>npr-1</italic> animals kept for long periods at 7% O<sub>2</sub> gradually begin to move faster at this O<sub>2</sub> concentration. Moreover, when such animals are stimulated by 21% O<sub>2</sub>, they reach significantly higher speeds than animals habituated to 21% O<sub>2</sub>.</p><p>This is why we think the ratio of <italic>C. elegans</italic>’ speed at 21% O<sub>2</sub> and 7% O<sub>2</sub> is a good proxy for the functionality of the O<sub>2</sub> circuit in regulating the locomotory circuit.</p><p>We acknowledge that the circuits controlling locomotory activity are complex, and regulated by sensory modalities other than O<sub>2</sub>. However, we think the observations described above justify using the change in the animals’ speed as we switch them from low to high O<sub>2</sub> as a proxy for changes in the activity of the O<sub>2</sub> circuit. We have outlined this reasoning in the Method Section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) The authors start their introduction by explaining how the loss of vision, for instance, can lead to the repurposing of neurons and even the rewiring of neural circuits.

We agree that our model suggests that cell-autonomous changes in ADL alters ADL responsiveness to input from other neurons, notably URX. We have updated our model in Figure 6 to indicate O<sub>2</sub>-sensory neurons (including URX). We have also added question marks to our model to highlight unknown molecular mechanisms that need to be investigated in future work. Namely, the molecular mechanisms that reconfigures the expression profile of ADL, and the signal from O<sub>2</sub>-sensing neurons that supports ADL’s O<sub>2</sub>-evoked neurosecretion after sensory impairment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) The issue of possible background mutations influencing the ADL transcriptomic analysis should be addressed. Were the mutants sufficiently outcrossed? This point could be addressed by providing additional transcriptome data from the strains generated in response to (1), different alleles or fully outcrossed lines.</p></disp-quote><p>We worried about unspecific effects of background mutations both on the ADL transcriptome and on other <italic>qui-1</italic> related phenotypes. We regret we did not explicitly address this point in our initial submission. To remove background mutations, mutants isolated in our screen, including <italic>qui-1</italic>, were backcrossed with the N2 laboratory strain a minimum of four times. These <italic>qui-1</italic> animals were further crossed into a 5 times outcrossed line that expresses the fluorescent protein mKate specifically in ADL, to generate the strains from which we sorted ADL neurons by FACS. Mutant and transgenic strains were outcrossed using the N2 laboratory strain. We explain this in the Methods section of the revised manuscript.</p><p>The extensive outcrossing make us confident that the large majority of differentially regulated genes between wild-type and <italic>qui-1</italic> samples in ADL are due to the absence of <italic>qui-1</italic>. Supporting this, both mutations in neuropeptide receptors identified by our profiling, <italic>npr-22</italic> and <italic>tkr-1</italic>, suppress ADL’s elevated neurosecretion. Nevertheless, we have added a note to explicitly bring up the concern raised by our reviewers, that some transcriptional differences could be the result of background mutations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) It should be stated whether the qui-1 mutant was derived from an N2 or flp-21 background, or in other words, what is the wild type.</p><p>The label wild type (WT) is applied at least to 4 different genomic strains (Control strain N2, DAF-28::mCherry, IDA-1::GFP and srh-220p:mKate).

We have now inserted a line in the Results section of the revised manuscript to say this.</p><p>We agree that our use of “WT” is misleading. We used this term in an attempt to keep figures accessible since <italic>C. elegans</italic> genetic nomenclature can be confusing to non-specialist readers. To address this issue and ensure we do not mislead our readers, we opted for the term “Control” in Text and Figures while referring to strains we used to image Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses, ADL neurosecretion, IDA-1 localisation and analyses of ADL profiling, while also reporting the genotype of each control line in the respective Figure legends. We have also compiled a Strain List (Supplementary File 6) listing the genotype of all strains used in the paper and detailing the figure in which they have been used, to help readers track different control strains.</p><p>We also highlight in the revised version of the Results section that the N2 laboratory strain has accumulated mutations since the original wild strain was domesticated more than 60 years ago.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(8) It would be helpful if the authors could comment about why they think that ADL O2 responses disappear in qui-1 mutants, and how O2 information received through NPR-22 directly induces enhanced neuropeptide release without involving any detectable calcium signals.</p></disp-quote><p>We can only speculate why O<sub>2</sub>-evoked responses in ADL disappear in <italic>qui-1</italic> mutants. One possibility is that ADL becomes less excitable due to the reconfigured gene expression associated with loss of <italic>qui-1</italic> in ADL. This model would predict that selectively knocking down <italic>qui-1</italic> in ADL would confer the same Ca<sup>2+</sup> response phenotype. Blocking ADL neurosecretion with TeTx in <italic>qui-1</italic> mutants would test if the increased ADL neurosecretion we describe feeds back to reduce the O<sub>2</sub>-evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> response in ADL. An alternative hypothesis is that the effect of disrupting <italic>qui-1</italic> is non-cell-autonomous, altering excitatory or inhibitory input to ADL from other <italic>qui-1</italic> expressing neurons. We have not tested if neurosecretion from other <italic>qui-1</italic>-expressing neurons is altered in <italic>qui-1</italic> mutants.</p><p>Strikingly, while disrupting <italic>qui-1</italic> leads to loss of a measurable O<sub>2</sub>-evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> response in ADL, these neurons display elevated O<sub>2</sub>-evoked neurosecretion in <italic>qui-1</italic> mutants. This implies that some O<sub>2</sub>-evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses are retained in ADL’s axons in <italic>qui-1</italic> mutants. It also suggests that other second messengers upregulate neurosecretion. Elevating cAMP, for example, can promote dense-core vesicle release more efficiently than increasing Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels (Steuer Costa et al., 2017). Altered G-protein coupled receptor signalling could lead to elevated cAMP levels and increased neurosecretion in <italic>qui-1</italic> mutants. It is worth noting that in N2 controls, ADL does not display O<sub>2</sub>-evoked neurosecretion despite showing measurable Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(9) In a previous research article of the lab, they showed strong responses in ADL to 21% oxygen in npr-1 background, and that ADL is unresponsive in N2 background. Contrarily, there seems to be a significant response in Figure 2E. This should be at least mentioned and discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>Our reviewers are correct to note the difference. This likely reflects use of improved Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensors. Fenk <italic>et al.</italic> imaged ADL’s O<sub>2</sub>-evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> response in the N2 laboratory strain and <italic>npr-1</italic> mutants using GCaMP3; in this paper we use GCaMP6s an improved version of GCaMP3 (Tian et al., 2009). The 10-fold increase in signal intensity given by GCaMP6s compared to GCaMP3 likely explains why our imaging experiments detect Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses not observed by Fenk <italic>et al.</italic> We have added a note to say this.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(10) we am not a fan of the work 'reprogram'. We implicates an epigenetic mechanism, and we don't think you've shown that. We suggest finding another expression.</p></disp-quote><p>We borrowed the term “reprogramming” to denote a change in ADL’s proprieties, but did not wish to imply that epigenetic mechanisms were involved. Given that what we report changes in gene expression, we can see that such a misunderstanding could easily arise. To avoid confusion, we have removed the word “reprogramming” from the revised manuscript, and simply refer to changes in gene expression.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(11) Two of the presented mutants are loss-of-functions of genes expressed in glia cells. I actually found this aspect very interesting given that these mutants phenocopy qui-1 in several aspects. We would like to hear more in the discussion about how the authors interpret these data.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that it is interesting that mutants for two genes expressed in glial cells, <italic>wrt-6</italic> and <italic>fig-1</italic>, phenocopy <italic>qui-1</italic>. We have revised the Discussion to expand on this observation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(12) Figure 1: the panels don't correspond to the text (e.g., Figure 1A, B and D)</p></disp-quote><p>We apologise for this oversight. We have corrected the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(13) The term hyperpolarization could be misleading in the context of calcium imaging (e.g. Figure 2 and associated text).</p></disp-quote><p>We have corrected the text. We now state that while in wild-type animals O<sub>2</sub> stimulation increases ADL’s Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels, in <italic>qui-1</italic> mutants the same stimulus seems to reduce Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(14) Would a single copy fig-1 gDNA rescue fig-1?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, our prediction would be that a single copy insertion of the wild-type <italic>fig-1</italic> gene would rescue phenotypes associated with this mutant. In the absence of this rescue experiment, our analysis of multiple <italic>fig-1</italic> alleles gives us confidence that impairing <italic>fig-1</italic> increases O<sub>2</sub>-escape behaviour.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(15) &quot;These data suggest that ADL neurons release more DCVs in bbs, wrt-6, and fig-1 mutants than wild type animals in response to input from the O2 circuit.&quot; The response to the O2 circuit was directly shown only for bbs-7 (in addition to qui-1).</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing out this misleading statement. We have reworded this statement to say that <italic>bbs-7</italic> and <italic>qui-1</italic> mutants increased ADL neurosecretion reflects increased responsiveness to O<sub>2</sub> input. We also suggest that enhanced neurosecretion from ADL in other sensory defective mutants characterised in this study may similarly reflect increased responsiveness to O<sub>2</sub>-input. We believe data from our OSM-6::AID knockdown experiments support this interpretation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(16) Figure 5A: we assume each column is an independent repetition?</p><p>Also, perhaps we got this wrong, but the scales in Figure 5 and S5 show a negative log2 fold change when the expression level had actually increased from WT to qui-1?</p></disp-quote><p>That is correct. We apologise for the oversight.
