response against infection. Some virulence effectors subvert the host autophagic machinery to escape the surveillance of autophagy. The mechanism by which pathogens interact with host autophagy remains mostly unclear. However, traditional strategies often have difficulty identifying host proteins that interact with effectors due to the weak, dynamic, and transient nature of these interactions. Here, we found that Enteropathogenic <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (EPEC) regulates autophagosome formation in host cells dependent on effector NleE. The 26S Proteasome Regulatory Subunit 10 (PSMD10) was identified as a direct interaction partner of NleE in living cells by employing genetically incorporated crosslinkers. Pairwise chemical crosslinking revealed that NleE interacts with the N-terminus of PSMD10. We demonstrated that PSMD10 homodimerization is necessary for its interaction with ATG7 and promotion of autophagy, but not necessary for PSMD10 interaction with ATG12. Therefore, NleE-mediated PSMD10 in monomeric state attenuates host autophagosome formation. Our study reveals the mechanism through which EPEC attenuates host autophagy activity.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>autophagy</kwd><kwd>unnatural amino acid</kwd><kwd>covalent crosslinking</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100013290</institution-id><institution>National Key Research and Development Program of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2018YFC1002802</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ren</surname><given-names>Haiyan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100013290</institution-id><institution>National Key Research and Development Program of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2018YFA0109200</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ren</surname><given-names>Haiyan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31872727</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ren</surname><given-names>Haiyan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>1.3.5 project for disciplines of excellence, West China Hospital, Sichuan University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ZYYC20020</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ren</surname><given-names>Haiyan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Transient interactions between NleE and PMSD10 suppress PSMD10 interaction with ATG7 to attenuate host autophagosome formation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Autophagy, a process referring to engulfment of a portion of the cytosol in a double-membrane autophagosome to lysosomes for degradation, plays a vital role in the host response to pathogens. Antibacterial autophagy, known as xenophagy, delivers intracellular bacteria to lysosomes for degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Xu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Choi et al., 2013</xref>). Autophagy not only plays a role in pathogen sensing and restriction, but also implicates in many other immune processes, such as proper immune cell differentiation, regulation of pattern recognition receptors, cytokine production, inflammasome activation, antigen presentation, and lymphocyte homeostasis, which contribute to host response to pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Pareja and Colombo, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Germic et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gomes and Dikic, 2014</xref>). However, various bacterial pathogens have evolved strategies to combat the autophagy pathway in order to enhance their survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agarwal et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">He et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gannagé et al., 2009</xref>). These strategies include escape from autophagy recognition, suppression of autophagy initiation, inhibition of autophagosome formation, blockade of autophagosome–lysosome fusion, hijacking of autophagy for replication, etc. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Wu and Li, 2019</xref>). Considering the variety of mechanisms utilized by different pathogens, understanding the mechanism by which each microbe manipulates autophagy is key to developing effective strategies for clinical treatment.</p><p>Whether and how pathogens affect autophagy in host cells remains largely elusive. Enteropathogenic <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (EPEC) species are gram-negative extracellular pathogens that mainly infect the human intestine, causing life-threatening diarrhea in immunocompromised individuals. We found that EPEC partially suppresses autophagosome formation in host cells in a NleE dependent manner. NleE was the first identified member of a class of S-adenosyl-<sc>l</sc>-methionine (SAM)-dependent methyltransferases in EPEC. To investigate how NleE interferes with autophagy, we sought to identify NleE interaction partners in host cells. Traditional strategies, such as immunoprecipitation and affinity purification, often have difficulty identifying host proteins that interact with effectors due to the weak, dynamic and transient nature of these interactions in living cells. Covalent capture enables the identification of weak and transient interactions with enhanced specificity, reliability, and accuracy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Yu and Huang, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Preston and Wilson, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Sinz, 2018</xref>). In particular, genetically encoded crosslinking technology has emerged as an attractive strategy for the investigation of native protein–protein interactions in living cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Coin, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Coin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Yang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Zhang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Tang et al., 2018</xref>). However, this technology has been applied mostly to map peptide–protein and protein–protein interactions. The low yield of photocrosslinking and the high background signals of crosslinked samples in mass spectrometry (MS) analysis significantly hinder this technique for identification of new interaction partners, especially in mammalian cells, which usually contain small amounts of proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Coin, 2018</xref>). We optimized the process and successfully identified PSMD10 as an interaction partner of NleE in mammalian cells using genetically incorporated unnatural amino acids (Uaas).</p><p>The interaction mechanism between NleE and PSMD10 was revealed by pairwise chemical crosslinking. Traditionally, disulfide bond formation between specific Cys residues has been used to detect intermolecular proximity in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dong et al., 2012</xref>). However, the sensitivity of disulfide bonds to reducing environments limits its application. Pairwise chemical crosslinking arises from the reactions that occur between genetically incorporated proximity-enabled Uaas and specific amino acids (such as Cys and Lys) when the two groups are proximal to each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Coin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Xiang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Xiang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ren, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Wang, 2017</xref>). The high specificity and stability of crosslinking make it ideal for detecting the intermolecular proximities of proteins in living cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Yang et al., 2017</xref>). In addition, proximity-enabled crosslinking likely depicts dynamic interaction conformations under physiological conditions.</p><p>Our study reveals a new mechanism by which pathogens attenuate the host defense response. NleE regulates autophagosome formation in a PSMD10 dependent manner in host cells. Further studies reveal that homodimerization of PSMD10 is critical for its interaction with ATG7 and ATG10, but not for its interaction with ATG12. Specifically, NleE interacts with the N-terminus of PSMD10 and suppresses PSMD10 homodimerization.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>NleE attenuates autophagosome formation in host cells</title><p>Gram-negative bacterial cell wall-derived lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is a potent proinflammatory pathogen-associated molecule.

The interaction between bacterial pathogens and host autophagy is a mutual process, and many bacteria have developed diverse mechanisms to combat host autophagy. The mechanism of how pathogens affect autophagy in host cells remains largely elusive. In this study, we found that the EPEC effector NleE attenuates autophagosome formation by interacting with host PSMD10. PSMD10 homodimers interact with ATG7 and promote autophagy. The NleE-mediated PSMD10 in a monomeric state attenuates autophagy.</p><p>Generally, interactions between host proteins and effectors are weak, dynamic, and transient in living cells. We applied genetically encoded photocrosslinking Uaas to covalently capture the transient interaction partners of NleE in situ. Furthermore, covalent complexes are tolerant to stringent processing, which makes purification under denaturing conditions possible. The dynamic interaction of NleE with the N-terminus of PSMD10 in living cells was revealed by pairwise chemical crosslinking. Genetical encoding technology is advantageous for capturing dynamic protein–protein interactions in different conformations. Our research represents that genetic encoding technology is a powerful approach to identify unknown interactions and reveal interaction models in mammalian cells. It will convince people to use genetically incorporated photoreactive Uaas, together with pairwise chemical crosslinking in future studies.</p><p>Previously, NleE was identified as an SAM-dependent methyltransferase in EPEC. It methylated specific zinc-coordinating cysteines in TAB2/3 and ZRANB3 to disrupt their ubiquitin-chain binding ability. Here, we demonstrated that NleE attenuates autophagy in host cells at the autophagosome formation step in a PSMD10 dependent manner. PSMD10 interacts with ATG7, ATG12, Rpt3, and HSF1. Stabilization of PSMD10 homodimer is required for its interaction with ATG7, but not with ATG12, Rpt3, and HSF1. Homodimerization of ATG7 plays an important role in LC3 modification. The AD of ATG7 that mediates ATG7 homodimerization is also responsible for binding of ATG7 with PSMD10. These observations may explain why NleE-mediated PSMD10 in the monomeric state specifically inhibits the interaction of PSMD10 with ATG7, but not the interaction of PSMD10 with other interaction partners. Our study showed the mechanism by which NleE specifically functions to inhibit autophagy. While inhibition of autophagy may affect host responses toward EPEC. NleE-mediated inhibition of autophagy impairs cytokine IL-6 production in macrophages, which was reported to contribute to host defense through stimulation of acute phase responses, hematopoiesis, and immune reactions.</p><p>The mechanism by which the interaction of PSMD10 homodimer with ATG7 enhances autophagy remains to be further investigated. Homodimerization of ATG7 is thought to play an important role in LC3 modification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Noda et al., 2011</xref>). NleE, <italic>PSMD10 KO</italic> and monomeric C4S mutation did not affect the dimerization of ATG7, excluding the possibility that the PSMD10 homodimer facilitates ATG7 dimerization.

Ten micrograms of protein samples were injected by an autosampler and separated on an ACQUITY UPLC Protein BEH C4 Column (300 Å, 1.7 µm, 2.1 mm × 50 mm) by a reverse-phase gradient of 0–80% acetonitrile for 15 min. Mass calibration was performed right before the analysis. MS spectra were acquired from 400 m/z to 5000 m/z. Protein spectra were averaged, and the charge states were deconvoluted using Protein Deconvolution software. Carbamidomethylation and methylation on cysteine were set as variable modifications.</p><p>For the living cell methylation assay, the immunoprecipitated proteins were sent to Shanghai Bioprofile Technology for MS analysis. The samples were digested with trypsin for 16–18 hr at 37°C. The digested peptides were loaded onto an EASY-NLC 1200 UHPLC system. The eluted peptides were sprayed into the Q Exactive Plus LC-MS system. The mass spectrometer was operated in data-dependent mode with one MS scan followed by 20 HCD (high-energy collisional dissociation) MS/MS scans for each cycle. MS spectra were acquired from 300 m/z to 1800 m/z with a resolution of 70,000 at m/z = 200. The AGC value was set at 1e6, with a maximum fill time of 50 ms. For MS/MS scans, the top 20 most intense precursors were selected. The AGC value for MS/MS was set to a target value of 1e5, with maximum fill time of 50 ms. Database searches were performed by MaxQuant 1.6.0.16 against the UniProt <italic>Homo sapiens</italic> Protein Database with a false discovery rate (FDR) &lt; 1%. Searches were carried out with a precursor peptide mass tolerance of 20 ppm. Two missed trypsin cleavages were allowed in these searches. Carbamidomethylation and methylation on cysteine residues were set as variable modifications.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>IL-6 secretion assay</title><p>THP-1 cells were treated with 200 ng/ml Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) for 48 hr. Macrophages were treated with 1 µM Wortmannin for 2 hr to inhibit autophagy. Bacteria were grown overnight in LB medium with shaking at 37°C at 220 rpm and then subcultured (1:30) into fresh RPMI 1640 medium for 2–3 hr. Bacterial culture was added to cells at an MOI = 100 and incubated for 4 hr. Cell culture supernatant was collected andIL-6 secretion was measured by ELISA. Cells were harvested in 1× SDS loading buffer for subsequent immunoblotting.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>All experiments were performed in at least three triplicates.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Ivan Dikic as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Dominique Soldati-Favre as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The mechanisms by which bacterial effectors interact with host factors to modulate autophagy are largely unknown. This paper reveals that the Enteropathogenic <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (EPEC) effector NleE regulates autophagosome formation in host cells by suppressing homodimerization of PSMD10, which is required for its interaction with ATG7 and promotion of autophagy. The claims are well supported by a series of solid biochemical experiments both in vitro and in live cells. The findings will be of interest to researchers in the field of autophagy and in general for scientists interested in host-pathogens interactions.</p><p>Essential Revisions:</p><p>1. Does NleE affect basel levels of autophagy or specifically only during stimulation? The authors should assess if inhibition of autophagy have any effects on host responses toward EPEC, such as cytokine production and cell death. This should also be discussed in the introduction and the discussion part.</p><p>2. The lack of evidence showing the involvement of PSMD10 in NleE mediated autophagy suppression in the context of EPEC infection. Assays of homodimerization of PSMD10 and interaction between PSMD10 and ATG7 should be repeated under the conditions of EPEC infection, preferably with both WT and NleE mutants.</p><p>3. Does C4S mutation affect PSMD28 expression pattern? Does the NleE K219 mutation affect its binding to PSMD10?</p><p>Please also read remaining comments as there are several examples where to improve figures, quantification and also presentation quality of data.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The authors identified the interacting partner of NleE inside the host cell, which is PSMD10. More detailed molecular characterization was then carried out. It was found that NleE suppresses homodimerization of PSMD10 and its binding to ATG7.</p><p>One of the major strengths of the study is the use of genetically incorporated crosslinkers for the identification of interacting partners. Traditional immunoprecipitation and manuscript experiments have difficulties identifying weak and transient interaction or low abundance proteins, such as bacterial virulence factors inside the host cells. Covalent capture using genetically incorporated crosslinkers helped to improve the specificity, reliability and sensitivity and indeed with that the authors were able to reveal PSMD as an interacting partner of NleE. This method could potentially be applied to study other bacterial virulence factors.</p><p>One interesting implication of the current study is the possibility of NleE's involvement in neurodegenerative disease. It is known that inflammation and gut dysbiosis are correlated with the occurrence of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease. Bacteria are able to influence the brain by inducing neuroinflammation or by delivering virulence factor into into the central nervous system via outer membrane vesicles (OMVs). Whether NleE from <italic>E. coli</italic> can suppress the autophagy process outside the gastrointestinal system is an interesting question and merits further investigation.</p><p>My major criticism is the lack of evidence showing the involvement of PSMD10 in NleE mediated autophagy suppression in the context of EPEC infection. Experiments concerning regulation of autophagy by NleE and PSMD10 were solely done on overexpression experiments without the actual bacteria. This makes the conclusion less convincing. Also, the authors did not demonstrate and/or explain why autophagy is important for the host defense against <italic>E. coli</italic>, especially because <italic>E. coli</italic> is extracellular. This decreases the impact of the work.</p><p>There are also essential questions that are crucial for the completeness of the study but the authors failed to address. First, does NleE affect basel levels of autophagy or specifically only during stimulation? For example, in Figure 1B it seems that NleE expression alone without other stimulation is able to suppress LC3-II but the quantification is missing, making it impossible to be interpretated. Also, is the methyltransferase activity of NleE required for the suppression of autophagy? Based on the data, PSMD10 is not methylated by NleE. However, the mutants of NleE which are unable to methylate also lost their activities to bind PSMD10. One possibility is that NleE methylates another factor which is required for the binding. Lastly, how is the proteosome system affected NleE? Proteosome and autophagy are two closely connected systems. Since PSMD10 is an important component of the proteosome system, it is surprising that NleE does not have any effects on the proteosome.</p><p>I believe the study is novel and bring a significant advancement to the field.

The mechanism is mediated by the interaction of the methyltransferase NleE of the bacteria with PSMD10 of the host. After demonstrating that NleE blocks autophagosome formation in several cell lines, authors apply genetically incorporated photo- and chemical crosslinkers to identify the target of NleE in the mammalian cell and the topology of the associated complex. They can clearly show that NleE interacts with the N-terminus PSM10 and hamper its physiologic homodimerization, which in turn prevents PSMD10 from interacting with autophagy-related proteins such as ATG7. Thus, the effect of NleE in blocking autophagy is independent from its enzymatic activity, but rely on a previously unknown feature.</p><p>The amount of new information about the molecular functioning of the investigated proteins reported here is impressive. The described experiments are well designed and look very solid. Especially the biochemically experiments with genetically encoded crosslinkers are a beautiful application of this method to answer biological question. Many studies about protein-protein interactions rely of IPs and in many cases only in vitro experiments. This work presents direct evidences of interactions from crosslinking events happening in the live cells, which represents a much higher quality.</p><p>Overall the work is well organized, the manuscript is clearly structured and the flow of the general story can be followed quite well. However, I recommend to improve some sections to make important details more easily understandable for the reader. There are also some language issues.

Meanwhile, bacteria have evolved various strategies to evade autophagy surveillance. Bacterial virulence effectors can inhibit autophagy via different mechanisms, including blocking the autophagy induction signal, impairing autophagy recognition, attenuating the function of autophagy proteins, or blocking the maturation of bacterium-containing autophagic vacuoles. However, the mechanism by which bacterial effectors interact with host factors to modulate autophagy remains largely unknown. In this paper, the authors first demonstrated that the Enteropathogenic Escherichia. coli (EPEC) effector NleE regulates autophagosome formation in host cells. They then employed genetically incorporated crosslinkers and identified the 26S Proteasome Regulatory Subunit 10 (PSMD10) as a direct interaction partner of NleE in living cells. They further showed that NleE impairs autophagosome formation by suppressing homodimerization of PSMD10, which is required for its interaction with ATG7 and promotion of autophagy. This study reveals a novel mechanism by which a bacterial virulent effector inhibits host autophagy.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.69047.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential Revisions:</p><p>1.
