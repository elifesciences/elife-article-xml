proteins after pathogen clearance is likewise key to preventing autoimmunity. Interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF1) plays an essential role as a transcription factor in driving the expression of immune response genes during infection. The striking difference in functional output with other IRFs is that IRF1 also drives the expression of various cell cycle inhibiting factors, making it an important tumor suppressor. Thus, it is critical to regulate the abundance of IRF1 to achieve a ‘Goldilocks’ zone in which there is sufficient IRF1 to prevent tumorigenesis, yet not too much which could drive excessive immune activation. Using genetic screening, we identified the E3 ligase receptor speckle type BTB/POZ protein (SPOP) to mediate IRF1 proteasomal turnover in human and mouse cells. We identified S/T-rich degrons in IRF1 required for its SPOP MATH domain-dependent turnover. In the absence of SPOP, elevated IRF1 protein levels functionally increased IRF1-dependent cellular responses, underpinning the biological significance of SPOP in curtailing IRF1 protein abundance.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>interferon regulatory factor 1</kwd><kwd>proteasome</kwd><kwd>ubiquitin</kwd><kwd>protein

counter pathogens during infection, yet precisely timed degradation of these response proteins after pathogen clearance is likewise key to preventing autoimmunity and hyperinflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Crow and Stetson, 2022</xref>).</p><p>Recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns and subsequent secretion of cytokines known as interferons (IFNs) are particularly critical for conferring an anti-pathogen response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Takeuchi and Akira, 2010</xref>). Type I interferons (IFNα/β) can be secreted by most cells upon infection, whereas type II IFNs (IFNγ) are secreted by specific cell types such as natural killer cells and T helper 1 cells. Binding of these cytokines to their receptors initiates cell signaling driving transcription of hundreds of response genes, which collectively mediate the anti-pathogen response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Schoggins, 2019</xref>).</p><p>Interferon regulatory factors (IRFs) play essential roles as transcription factors in the IFN system. Some IRFs, such as IRF3, are constitutively expressed. Their activity is predominantly regulated through phosphorylation, and they are essential for induction of type I IFNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tamura et al., 2008</xref>). In contrast, some other IRFs, including IRF1, are transcriptionally induced during infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Feng et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>IRF1 is a key family member for the induction of the innate immune response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Forero et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kimura et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Langlais et al., 2016</xref>). The importance to precisely control IRF1 levels and its functional output is underpinned by the fact that aberrant IRF1 expression is linked to inflammatory syndromes, such as Behcet’s disease, arthritis, and systemic lupus erythematosus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Donn et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Govind et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lee et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Uddin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>). The striking difference in functional output with other IRFs is that IRF1 also drives the expression of various cell cycle inhibiting factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Armstrong et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tanaka et al., 1996</xref>), making it an important tumor suppressor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nozawa et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Xie et al., 2003</xref>). Thus, it is critical to regulate the abundance of IRF1 to achieve ‘Goldilocks’ levels at which there is sufficient IRF1 to prevent tumorigenesis, yet not too much which could cause excessive immune activation.</p><p>In addition to its transcriptional regulation, the other main means of IRF1 regulation is at a protein level through rapid degradation by the proteasome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nakagawa and Yokosawa, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Pion et al., 2009</xref>), which seems to in turn be critical to limit transcriptional output and reduce the IRF1 protein pool once IRF1 transcription is shut off during immune resolution. In line with this notion, proteasome inhibitors have been shown to block IRF1 degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Attard et al., 2005</xref>). Several factors have thus far been reported to mediate poly-ubiquitination of IRF1, and direct its proteasomal degradation.</p><p>The importance of these individual regulators for IRF1 turnover is to a degree determined by their cellular context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Liu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Remoli et al., 2020</xref>). This draws an interesting parallel to other transcription factors which can be ubiquitinated by various different E3 ligase complexes, depending on cellular context. cMYC is a prime example of such a cell context-regulated transcription factor. A Cullin E3 ligase complex using the FBXW7 substrate receptor module (SCF<sup>FBXW7</sup>) has been reported as a key factor in cMYC degradative ubiquitination in many cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Welcker et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Yada et al., 2004</xref>). In contrast, various other E3s, including TRIM32, CHIP, and several other Cullin F-box complexes, have been shown to be important for cMYC degradation, yet in more cell-specific contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sun et al., 2021</xref>). Identification and characterization of such E3 ligases is critical for ultimately understanding how their action controls transcriptional output in various cell types, within the context of whole organisms.</p><p>As for other transcription factors, turnover mechanisms can be different for distinct cellular IRF1 protein pools, dependent on their localization and functional engagement in transcription. As such, understanding which functional IRF1 domains determine its turnover is important. IRF1 has an N-terminal DNA binding domain, followed by a nuclear localization signal (NLS), IRF1 transactivation IRF-association domain (IAD2), and a C-terminal intrinsically disordered enhancer region (IDR). This C-terminal IDR is an important determinant of IRF1 turnover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nakagawa and Yokosawa, 2000</xref>). On the one hand, the IDR is stabilized by the chaperones HSP70 and HSP90 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Landré et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nakagawa and Yokosawa, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Narayan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Narayan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Narayan et al., 2011a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Narayan et al., 2011b</xref>), whereas it is targeted for degradative ubiquitination by the protein quality control E3 ligase CHIP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Narayan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Narayan et al., 2011b</xref>). This has suggested that cells may, at least in part, turn over IRF1 co- or post-translationally using their general protein quality control pathways.</p><p>In addition, the N-terminal DNA binding domain has been reported to determine IRF1 stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Landré et al., 2013</xref>). Consistent with a model in which IRF1 is ubiquitinated by the E3 ligase MDM2 in an unbound state, DNA binding competes with E3 ligase interaction, thereby stabilizing IRF1 in a functionally engaged state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Landré et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Lastly, the IAD2 domain has been implicated in driving IRF1 ubiquitination and degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Garvin et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Pion et al., 2009</xref>). In part, this has been attributed to generation of a GSK3β-dependent phospho-degron on DNA-bound IRF1, and subsequent recognition by the SCF<sup>FBXW7</sup> E3 ligase complex, which drives its degradation.</p><p>In this study, we set out to identify novel factors that control IRF1 abundance in an unbiased manner. Genome-wide genetic screens were performed to identify novel IRF1-specific E3 ligases. This identified the Cullin ubiquitin E3 ligase receptor SPOP to functionally mediate IRF1 degradation. Follow-up analyses identified four degrons in, or near the IRF1 IAD2 enhancer domain responsible for SPOP binding, and subsequent IRF1 ubiquitination and degradation. Consequently, loss of <italic>SPOP</italic> increased transcriptional output of IRF1-stimulated genes.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Establishment of an IRF1 protein abundance reporter cell line for genetic screening</title><p>The IRF1 protein is ubiquitinated and turned over by the proteasome.

Likewise, stimulation of RKO cells with IFNγ strongly induced endogenous IRF1 protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; 11.2-fold). Subsequent treatment with the translation inhibitor cycloheximide (CHX) rapidly chased out the induced IRF1 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In the absence of de novo protein synthesis, IRF1 levels returned to pre-stimulation protein levels within 4 hr, indicating that it is highly unstable. Simultaneous inhibition of lysosomal degradation by Bafilomycin A (Baf) did not affect endogenous IRF1 stability and half-life (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–B</xref>), indicating that IRF1 is predominantly turned over by the proteasome. In line with this finding, endogenous IRF1 protein levels measured by intracellular staining were also induced by IFNγ and depleted upon translation inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; left panel), whereas inhibition of proteasomal degradation by MG132 increased IRF1 levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; right panel). Together, these results indicate that IRF1 is induced by IFNγ and degraded by the proteasome in RKO cells, as has been described for other cell types, making it a suitable model for identification of IRF1 stability regulators.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Establishment of an interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF1) protein abundance reporter cell line for genetic screening.</title><p>RKO cells were stimulated with IFNγ for 4 hr, and subsequently incubated with the translation inhibitor cycloheximide (CHX) in the absence or presence of proteasome inhibitor MG132, after which endogenous IRF1 levels were analyzed by (<bold>A</bold>) western blot or (<bold>B</bold>) intracellular staining and flow cytometry.

Therefore, a strategy was devised to uncouple IRF1 protein abundance from its endogenous transcriptional program, thereby aiming to maximize the identification of regulators of protein degradation. To this end, a monoclonal cell line harboring Dox-inducible Cas9 was established, and a dual-color reporter construct under the control of a constitutively active promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), consisting of an mCherry-IRF1 cassette separated from BFP by a P2A ribosomal skip site. Although both proteins are translated from a single transcript in equimolar quantities, the unstable mCherry-IRF1 was predicted to accumulate at lower steady-state levels than the stable BFP internal control.</p><p>We reasoned that it would be important to screen in parallel with an unrelated protein that is degraded in a proteasome-dependent manner, in order to distinguish between general players in the ubiquitin proteasome system and factors specifically regulating IRF1 abundance. cMYC is constantly turned over by the proteasome with a 20–30 min half-life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gregory and Hann, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ramsay et al., 1986</xref>). Therefore, a comparable cell line expressing mCherry-cMYC was established and characterized alongside the mCherry-IRF1 cell line.</p><p>To investigate whether the mCherry-tagged IRF1 reporter had comparable degradation characteristics as its endogenous counterpart, cells were subjected to a CHX chase to determine protein stability. In line with endogenous IRF1, mCherry-IRF1 levels rapidly diminished within 4 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). IRF1 degradation was prevented by simultaneous inhibition of the proteasome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), whereas inhibition of lysosomal degradation by Baf did neither stabilize endogenous IRF1 nor mCherry-IRF1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Similarly, mCherry-cMYC and endogenous cMYC were rapidly lost upon CHX treatment, which was prevented by simultaneous proteasome inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C–D</xref>). This indicated that mCherry-IRF1, mCherry-cMYC, and their endogenous equivalents are all predominantly degraded by the proteasome.</p><p>Next, we set out to determine whether our fluorescent reporters were compatible with fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)-based genetic screening. In particular, we assessed by flow cytometry whether inhibition of protein synthesis or proteasomal degradation would specifically affect the mCherry-tagged unstable proteins, without affecting their stable BFP internal controls. Consistent with our findings by western blot readout, flow cytometry analysis also showed that both mCherry-IRF1 and mCherry-cMYC were degraded in the absence of de novo protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>; top panels), and stabilized by proteasome inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>; bottom panels), without affecting levels of the stable BFP internal control.</p><p>To determine IRF1 and cMYC half-lives, we quantified mCherry-IRF1 and IFNγ-induced endogenous IRF1 levels over time following inhibition of protein synthesis. Single exponential decay curve fitting indicated the half-life of endogenous IRF1 to be 72 min, whereas the half-life of mCherry-IRF1 was twice as long at 144 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). We reasoned that the increased mCherry-IRF1 half-life would likely still allow identification of factors mediating degrading of endogenous IRF1, but could not rule out that some aspects of endogenous IRF1 degradation were differentially represented by mCherry-IRF1. Importantly, IFNγ treatment did not alter constitutively expressed mCherry-IRF1 levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>), indicating that its degradation machinery is likely already active under non-stimulated conditions. Similar measurements for mCherry-cMYC indicated a 24 min half-life for mCherry-cMYC and 19 min for endogenous cMYC in the same cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C–D</xref>), consistent with previously published work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Welcker et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Yada et al., 2004</xref>). These combined data indicate that the N-terminal mCherry fusions of IRF1 and cMYC phenocopied the proteasomal degradation and instability of their endogenous counterparts.</p><p>Lastly, we assessed whether our selected monoclonal mCherry-IRF1 and mCherry-cMYC reporter cell lines had retained the ability to drive genome editing. To this end, cells were transduced with a lentiviral vector constitutively expressing an sgRNA targeting the cell-essential factor ribonucleotide reductase catalytic M1 (<italic>RRM1</italic>), while co-expressing iRFP. Subsequently, the ratio between these transduced cells and non-transduced cells in the same cell pool were measured over time by flow cytometry as a proxy for cell fitness.</p><p>As anticipated, the presence of Dox in the culture medium to induce Cas9 resulted in a near-complete loss of iRFP<sup>+</sup> sg<italic>RRM1</italic> cells from the cell pool in 6 days in both cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1G–H</xref>), whereas parallel sg<italic>AAVS1</italic> control samples remained at a constant ratio. In contrast, in the absence of Dox, sg<italic>RRM1</italic> cells were not depleted over the 2-week course of the experiment. This indicated that the mCherry-IRF1 and mCherry-cMYC cell lines had minimal editing in the absence of Dox, yet efficient genome editing upon Dox-induced Cas9 expression.</p><p>Taken together, our data demonstrate that mCherry-IRF1 and mCherry-cMYC phenocopy the unstable nature of their endogenous counterparts and are likewise predominantly degraded by the proteasome. We concluded that the established reporter cell lines were suitable for subsequent genetic screening to identify IRF1 and cMYC stability regulators and that the established cell lines could be used for parallel screens to determine specificity of identified factors.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Identification of the Cullin substrate receptor SPOP as a regulator of IRF1 abundance</title><p>The characterized mCherry-IRF1 and mCherry-cMYC reporter cell lines were subsequently used for genome-wide genetic screening for regulators of their protein abundance.

To stabilize the actively targeted IRF1 protein pool, cells were treated with proteasome inhibitor. Under these conditions, the diffuse nucleoplasmic IRF1 signal increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>), suggesting that this represents the unstable cellular IRF1 pool. Moreover, in the presence of proteasome inhibitor, the SPOP puncta increased in size and signal intensity, consistent with previous reports that these are sites of SPOP-dependent degradation of a subset of its targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Marzahn et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Usher et al., 2021</xref>). However, none of the IRF1 signal was detected in the SPOP puncta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Together, these data suggest that IRF1 is likely targeted for degradation in the nucleoplasm, and that this could potentially be mediated by the diffuse nucleoplasmic SPOP pool.</p><p>To further extend these analyses, subcellular fractionation of <italic>AAVS1</italic>- and <italic>SPOP</italic>-targeted cells was performed. Consistent with our microscopy results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>), IFNγ treatment rapidly induced IRF1 in the nuclear fraction, which even further increased upon <italic>SPOP</italic> depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B–C</xref>). These data reinforce the conclusion that SPOP targets IRF1 in the nucleus, where it is subsequently degraded.</p><p>Previous studies had identified an S/T-rich SPOP binding consensus of [Φ]-[Π]-[S]-[S/T]-[S/T], in which Φ and Π are non-polar and polar residues, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Zhuang et al., 2009</xref>). We reasoned that the presence of any sequences matching this SPOP degron in IRF1 could mediate SPOP binding to IRF1, thereby targeting it for ubiquitination and degradation.</p><p>A multiple sequence alignment of IRF1 across species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>) identified four sequences in IRF1 matching the SPOP degron consensus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), consistent with predictions (ScanProsite – Expasy, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hou et al., 2022</xref>). One of the putative SPOP degrons was identified in the region between the DNA-binding domain and the IAD2 domain, whereas the remaining three were predicted to be inside the IAD2 domain, which is important for transactivation and dimerization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>To test whether these predicted degron sites in IRF1 are important for SPOP-dependent degradation, an IRF1 mutant was generated in which the core S/T residues in each putative SPOP binding domain (SBD) were mutated to A residues (IRF1-SBD<sub>mut</sub>). Subsequently, wild-type IRF1 or IRF1-SBD<sub>mut</sub> were expressed in the presence of increasing amounts of a wild-type SPOP expression plasmid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). SPOP expression decreased wtIRF1 protein levels in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>), without affecting the stable EGFP internal control. In contrast, protein levels of the IRF1 degron mutant remained unaffected by exogenous SPOP expression, suggesting that one or more of the four predicted degrons are required for SPOP-dependent IRF1 degradation.</p><p>Next, we set out to investigate whether IRF1 and SPOP interact in cells and whether this interaction is mediated through the predicted IRF1 S/T degrons. To directly assess complex formation between SPOP and IRF1, SPOP was immunoprecipitated from cells expressing wtIRF1 or IRF1-SBD<sub>mut</sub>. Subsequent western blot analysis for IRF1 identified wtIRF1, but not IRF1-SBD<sub>mut</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). The reciprocal approach in which wtIRF1 or IRF1-SBD<sub>mut</sub> were immunoprecipitated, exclusively identified SPOP upon purification of wtIRF1, but not its degron mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>).</p><p>SPOP interaction with S/T degrons has been previously mapped to its MATH domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Zhuang et al., 2009</xref>). In line with this observation, wtIRF1 interacted with wtSPOP, yet failed to co-immunoprecipitate MATH-domain mutated SPOP (SPOP-MATH<sub>mut</sub>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). Consistently, the reciprocal pull-down of wtSPOP identified wtIRF1, whereas the SPOP mutant showed strongly reduced interaction with IRF1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>).</p><p>In line with one or more of the four identified degrons being important for SPOP-dependent IRF1 turnover, IRF1 ubiquitination was significantly increased upon co-expression of wtSPOP, but not with MATH-domain mutated SPOP (SPOP-MATH<sub>mut</sub>). Upon mutation of the SPOP binding sequences, IRF1 ubiquitination was significantly decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I–J</xref>). From this, we concluded that some or all of the SPOP degrons are required for IRF1 poly-ubiquitination, although the remaining ubiquitination in the IRF1 mutant indicates that additional E3 ligases may ubiquitinate IRF1 as well. It remains to be determined whether these SPOP-independent poly-ubiquitin chains have a topology associated with proteasomal degradation.</p><p>Subsequently, we set out to identify the lysine residues required for IRF1 turnover. To this end we expressed SPOP together with full-length IRF1, in which all lysines in only the indicated protein domains were mutated to arginines to prevent ubiquitination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D–E</xref>). Mutation of all lysines in the N-terminal half of the DNA-binding domain (DBD1), its C-terminal half (DBD2), the NLS region, or its C-terminal domain (C-term.) did not alter its sensitivity to treatment with proteasome inhibitor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D–E</xref>). In contrast, an IRF1 mutant in which all lysines were mutated in the entire IRF1 protein (allKtoR) was no longer stabilized by proteasome inhibition, suggesting that SPOP targets lysines in multiple IRF1 domains.</p><p>Lastly, we tested whether wtSPOP or SPOP-MATH<sub>mut</sub> could rescue IRF1 degradation in <italic>SPOP</italic> KO cells. To this end, expression plasmids for wtSPOP or its MATH domain mutant counterpart were delivered to <italic>SPOP</italic> KO cells, and endogenous IRF1 levels measured by flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1F</xref>).

In contrast, the elevated IRF1 protein levels in <italic>SPOP</italic> KO cells were decreased by exogenous wtSPOP expression to levels measured in wild-type cells, whereas they were not affected by the empty vector control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1H</xref>; middle panel and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1I</xref>).

To this end, wtIRF1 or IRF1-SBD<sub>mut</sub> were co-expressed with an IFN-stimulated response element (ISRE) luciferase reporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). wtIRF1 expression increased reporter activation by 408-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Consistent with our findings that the IRF1-SBD<sub>mut</sub> is expressed at increased steady-state levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>), expression of the same amount of plasmid encoding this mutant resulted in an 85% increase in ISRE-reporter activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). In line with SPOP degron-dependent degradation, wtIRF1-driven ISRE activation was reduced 11-fold by SPOP co-expression, whereas its degron-mutated IRF1-SBD<sub>mut</sub> counterpart was unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>).</p><p>To exclude any confounding effects, we reduced the amount of IRF1-SBD<sub>mut</sub> expression construct by half to match the steady-state protein levels of wtIRF1. Likewise, under these conditions wtSPOP expression specifically reduced wtIRF1-driven reporter expression, but not its IRF1-SBD<sub>mut</sub> counterpart (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Moreover, IRF1-driven reporter activation was only reduced by wtSPOP, but not SPOP-MATH<sub>mut</sub>, which cannot interact with IRF1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). From these data, we concluded that one or more degrons in the IRF1 substrate as well as the substrate binding domain in SPOP are required for reducing IRF1 levels, thereby controlling its transcriptional output.</p><p>Unlike other IRFs, IRF1 also drives the expression of various cell cycle inhibiting factors (e.g. p21) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Armstrong et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tanaka et al., 1996</xref>), making it an important tumor suppressor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nozawa et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Xie et al., 2003</xref>). Therefore, we next determined whether <italic>SPOP</italic> loss would affect cell fitness in a competition assay. To avoid any confounding and desensitization effects of continuous IFNγ treatment to upregulate IRF1, we targeted SPOP in our mCherry-IRF1 screening cell line, and analyzed their relative cell fitness in a mixed culture with untransduced cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). Over the course of 20 days, targeting <italic>SPOP</italic> in cells not exogenously expressing mCherry-IRF1 (wt) reduced fitness by 15%, whereas this was further reduced by nearly twofold in mCherry-IRF1-expressing cells, relative to their respective sg<italic>AAVS1</italic> controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). From these data we concluded that <italic>SPOP</italic> loss disproportionally reduces cell fitness in the presence of IRF1, consistent with increased IRF1 protein concentrations in the absence of SPOP.</p><p>Lastly, we addressed the biological relevance of <italic>SPOP</italic> loss on the cellular antiviral state. Pre-treatment of both sg<italic>AAVS1</italic> and sg<italic>SPOP</italic> cells with IFNγ reduced vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) progeny virus production by approximately fivefold in a multi-cycle infection experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>). However, progeny virus titers were not significantly different from sg<italic>AAVS1</italic> control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p><p>Since IRF1 drives only the transcription of a subset of ISGs in IFNγ-stimulated cells, we reasoned that most of the antiviral state in cells could be conferred by the STAT1 homo-dimeric transcription factor complex, in an IRF1-independent manner. Therefore, we next performed VSV infections in cells exogenously expressing mCherry-IRF1, in which most of the antiviral state is IRF1-dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Schoggins et al., 2011</xref>). To further limit IRF1-independent ISG induction during infection, sgRNAs targeting <italic>IRF3</italic> and <italic>STAT1</italic> were expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ramsauer et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Schoggins et al., 2011</xref>), in combination with either sg<italic>AAVS1</italic> or sg<italic>SPOP</italic>. sg<italic>AAVS1</italic>-expressing mCherry-IRF1 cells produced approximately 10-fold less progeny virus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>), compared to its counterparts not expressing IRF1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>), indicating that mCherry-IRF1 expression conferred an antiviral effect. Consistent with increased IRF1 protein levels, loss of <italic>SPOP</italic> further reduced VSV progeny titers by approximately 10-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). These results indicate that SPOP plays an important role in limiting intracellular IRF1 protein concentrations, and that its loss increases IRF1-dependent cell fitness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>) and antiviral immunity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The importance of IRF1 in myeloid cells for driving CXCL9 and CXCL10 expression and thereby being broadly critical for their innate immune response has been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Forero et al., 2019</xref>). Moreover, IRF1 is a critical tumor suppressor, which is underpinned by the observation that IRF1 is mutated or lost in many cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nozawa et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Xie et al., 2003</xref>). Some ubiquitin E3 ligases controlling IRF1 protein turnover have been described, such as FBXW7, MDM2, and STUB1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Garvin et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Landré et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Narayan et al., 2011b</xref>). Their differential importance for regulating IRF1 turnover in different cell types and tissues draws an interesting functional parallel with cMYC, which is also targeted for degradation by cell-type-specific E3 ligases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sun et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Here, we show that the Cullin E3 ligase receptor SPOP is important for IRF1 protein turnover. In contrast to previous findings in COS7 and MRC5 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Garvin et al., 2019</xref>), in our RKO cell-based experiments, FBXW7 did not contribute to IRF1 degradation, as its ablation did not alter IRF1 protein concentrations. Nevertheless, FBXW7 cellular functionality and efficient targeting was demonstrated, since it was key to cMYC degradation, consistent with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Welcker et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Yada et al., 2004</xref>). These findings expand our knowledge on the pathways that can be employed by different cells to balance IRF1 levels. Moreover, it underpins the notion that, as for cMYC, the factors mediating IRF1 turnover can be cell-context-specific. This notion of cell-type-specific regulation of protein degradation is further underpinned by the fact that we show in this manuscript that SPOP is dispensable for cMYC degradation in our cell models, whereas it has been reported to mediate cMYC turnover in prostate and breast cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Geng et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Luo et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>SPOP has been found to be differentially expressed in many cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cuneo and Mittag, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Guo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Li et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Patel et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Song et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zhao et al., 2016</xref>). Moreover, mutations accumulate in SPOP target recognition domains in endometrial and prostate cancers, altering their sensitivity to BET inhibitor therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Dai et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Janouskova et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>). Interestingly, these mutations enhanced BRD protein degradation in endometrial cancers, whereas it did the opposite in prostate cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Dai et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Janouskova et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, SPOP substrate targeting, its importance as a tumor-promoting or -repressing factor, and therapy sensitivity may be cancer- or cell-type specific. This exemplifies the cell context-dependent similarities between IRF1 and SPOP.</p><p>Several SPOP substrates important in a cancer context have been previously identified, such as BRD proteins, DRAK1 and LATS1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pang et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wang et al., 2020</xref>). Our data presented here adds IRF1 to this growing list of SPOP substrates. Since IRF1 levels are low in many cells in the absence of cytokine stimulation, it may have previously been missed as a SPOP interactor and substrate in unbiased proteomics efforts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Dai et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Janouskova et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, while the contributions of SPOP to cancer establishment or progression are likely through deregulation of a manifold of its substrates, our work suggests that IRF1 may be one of them. In line with our finding that SPOP could be critical for lowering the tumor-suppressive levels of IRF1, SPOP is overexpressed in most clear-cell renal cell carcinomas (ccRCC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Patel et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zhao et al., 2016</xref>). The observation that IFNγ signaling and IRF1 expression are important biomarkers in ccRCC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kong et al., 2022</xref>), addressing the importance of the SPOP-IRF1 axis in this cancer type may be of particular interest in future studies.</p><p>The complexity of IRF1 turnover regulation in different cell types is further illustrated by the fact that SPOP may influence IRF1 stability in myeloid cells in an opposite manner as we identified here in stromal cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tawaratsumida et al., 2022</xref>). Recent work identified SPOP in myeloid cells as a key bridging molecule, indirectly repressing IRF1 phosphorylation, and its subsequent degradation. In line with this model, loss of <italic>SPOP</italic> in plasmacytoid dendritic cells and a mouse macrophage cell line decreased IRF1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tawaratsumida et al., 2022</xref>). This opposite SPOP phenotype and function from what we describe here could be explained by the fact that many non-immune cells do not express TLRs and their associated adapter proteins, which were shown to be required for SPOP complex formation and repression of IRF1 phosphorylation and degradation. It should be noted that the RKO cells used in this study have been reported to express TLRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Xu et al., 2020</xref>). This suggests that additional cellular factors, such as recruited adaptors or differential dependence on specific Src kinases for signaling, may determine SPOP-dependent regulation in myeloid cells.</p><p>Importantly, IRF1 degradation in myeloid cells is seemingly dependent on active TLR-dependent immune signaling, whereas in the stromal, non-myeloid cell models used in this study, IRF1 degradation was independent of immune signaling. Several other studies have indicated that SPOP may inhibit TLR signaling through several different proposed means (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jin et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Li et al., 2020</xref>), suggesting that SPOP may balance biological output from the TLR-IRF1 axis through opposing effects. Together, these possible contrary effects of SPOP on IRF1 abundance in different cell types should thus be considered when addressing the impact of SPOP in the context of future whole-organism studies.</p><p>During the revision of this manuscript, Gao et al. also reported SPOP as an important IRF1 degrader in endometrial cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gao et al., 2023</xref>). They found that cancer-associated SPOP mutations result in diminished IRF1 degradation, and consequentially increased expression of the IRF1-driven immune-suppressive PD-L1. Most of the cell-mechanistic data of how SPOP targets IRF1 for ubiquitination and degradation are in agreement between both studies. However, a notable difference between both studies is that in our experiments, we showed that in RKO and HeLa cells, SPOP is localized in the nucleoplasm and nuclear speckles, whereas IRF1 is exclusively diffusely distributed in the nucleoplasm. Since proteasome inhibition increased only the diffuse nucleoplasmic IRF1 pool, we concluded that in our cell models SPOP most likely targets IRF1 in the nucleoplasm, and not in nuclear speckles. In contrast, Gao et al. found that IRF1 strongly associates with SPOP in nuclear speckles in KLE endometrial cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gao et al., 2023</xref>). It remains unclear where this difference stems from. It could be that SPOP-IRF1 subcellular interaction sites differ in different cell types, or that technical differences – such as SPOP/IRF1 expression levels – influence subcellular interaction sites.</p><p>Previous work has indicated that SPOP recognizes nuclear targets with intrinsically disordered regions through multivalent interactions with S/T-rich degrons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Usher et al., 2021</xref>). In addition, its related paralog SPOP-like (SPOPL) has been proposed to regulate the oligomeric state of the SPOP E3 ligase complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Errington et al., 2012</xref>). While our genetic screens indicate that SPOPL does likely not play an important role in IRF1 targeting, our data from this study are fully consistent with the reported substrate profile: IRF1 has IDRs and localizes almost exclusively to the nucleoplasm. Moreover, IRF1 is likely targeted by SPOP through recognition of one or more S/T-rich degrons, although we have not determined the contribution of the four individual S/T-rich degrons to IRF1 degradation.</p><p>The S/T residues in these SBD are theoretical sites of phosphorylation, which as such could influence SPOP-IRF1 interaction. Indeed, previous work has indicated that SPOP preferentially binds some substrate S/T-rich degrons in their non-phosphorylated form, whereas in other substrates, phosphorylation of these sites seems a prerequisite for interaction and degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jiang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ostertag et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Zhuang et al., 2009</xref>). Whether any of the identified IRF1 degrons are phosphorylated, and how this would affect its SPOP-dependent degradation, remains to be determined. IRF1 phosphorylation on S219 and S221 in the fourth degron was identified with low coverage in available IRF1 proteomics data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Garvin et al., 2019</xref>) and independently in a region that includes this site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lin and Hiscott, 1999</xref>), suggesting that this particular identified SBD could be post-translationally modified. The same sites were identified to be phosphorylated in breast cancer cells by the immune-activating kinase IKKε (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Remoli et al., 2020</xref>). Phosphorylation under these conditions increased IRF1 proteasomal degradation. Since IKKε is activated under physiological conditions during infection, this could suggest that in some cellular contexts, ongoing immune signaling could thus provide a regulatory circuit driving transcription of <italic>IRF1</italic>, as well as providing its subsequent signal for degradation of the encoded IRF1 protein by SPOP.</p><p>Three of the identified S/T-rich degrons in IRF1 are located in its IAD2 transactivation domain. This domain is key for heterodimerization with other transcriptional activators or repressors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Antonczyk et al., 2019</xref>). Therefore, an additional regulatory implication of our findings could be that IRF1 heterodimerization through its IAD2 domain could shield three of the S/T-rich degrons from recognition by SPOP. As such, SPOP could thus preferentially target the inactive nucleoplasmic IRF1 pool that is not engaged in transcription.</p><p>Taken together, our study identified and characterized SPOP as a cellular factor targeting IRF1 for proteasomal degradation. It extends the growing set of E3 ligases which collectively mediate proper intracellular IRF1 protein levels in various different cellular contexts. Our findings lay the foundation for future studies to address how transcriptionally inactive and active immune transcription factor pools are properly spatiotemporally targeted in diverse cell types.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Vectors</title><p>The lentiviral human genome-wide sgRNA library consists of six sgRNAs per gene for a whole coding human genome and was described elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Michlits et al., 2020</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>Comments to the Authors:</p><p>We are sorry to say that, after consultation with the reviewers, we have decided that this work in its current form will not be considered for publication by <italic>eLife</italic>. Should the authors wish to address reviewers' comments, we would be willing to consider a substantially revised manuscript. In particular, a revised study should include experiments to (1) provide more robust evidence of SPOP-mediated ubiquitination of IRF1, (2) provide a deeper understanding of the localization of SPOP-mediated regulation of IRF1 (nuclear, cytoplasmic, during translocation), and (3) assess the biological relevance of SPOP/IRF1 axis in other cells (per reviewers' suggestions below).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors sought to address an important question of how IRF1 is turned over, as aberrant IRF1 expression is linked to several immunological disorders. The authors devised a clever fluorescent protein-based IRF1 degradation assay and used this system to perform a well-controlled genome-wide CRISPR screen for genes that regulated IRF1 expression. They identified SPOP as a hit and then carried out a series of experiments (genetic reconstitution, binding assays, localization) to validate SPOP as an E3 ligase that mediates the degradation of IRF1. In functional assays, they linked SPOP1-dependent IRF1 regulation to predicted changes in specific downstream IRF1 target genes, and they demonstrated modest effects of this pathway on cell fitness.</p><p>Strengths</p><p>Powerful CRISPR screens to identify SPOP as a regulator of IRF1 protein abundance;</p><p>Rigorous validation of hit, including binding assays, colocalization, and judicious use of both SPOP and IRF1 mutants as control.</p><p>Weaknesses</p><p>Current evidence for SPOP directly ubiquitinating IRF1 is incomplete and lacks complementing orthogonal assays;</p><p>The significance of the SPOP/IRF1 axis in a biologically relevant model system (infection, cancer, etc) is lacking.</p><p>1. The key/new mechanism here is that SPOP directly ubiquitinates IRF1 and enforces its degradation. There is only one Ub assay directly showing this, thus the strength of the evidence is incomplete. The authors need to provide additional data supporting this mechanism. Orthogonal assays (e.g. Ub assays in cells vs in vitro ubiquitination assays using recombinant protein) showing the same result are critical to pin this mechanism down. The use of SPOP mutants that cannot ubiquitinate IRF1 also needs to be included as controls.</p><p>2. The broader significance of the paper is uncertain in the absence of a more compelling role for the SPOP/IRF1 axis in a biologically relevant setting. The authors claim in the discussion that viral assays would be difficult due to the overlap of IRF1 and ISGF3 target genes. This logic is confusing. There are ample examples in the literature of IRF1 expression conferring antiviral effects to cells, especially in cells that can't signal through IFN (STAT1-deficient). Co-expression of SPOP with IRF1 should reduce IRF1 levels and create a more permissive antiviral state. Alternatively, a more robust cancer-related model could help assign a clearer biological role for SPOP/IRF1.</p><p>3. The authors should include a new discussion on how their work relates to a recent similar study (PMID: 36481790).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Vunjak and colleagues report the results of a genome-wide CRISPR screen designed to identify genes controlling the post-translational fate of IRF1. IRF1 was the first interferon regulatory factor to be identified, and its activity as a transcription factor has been associated with both successful immune control of intracellular viral and bacterial infections, as well as regulation of cell cycle progression and tumor suppression. Unlike IRFs such as IRF3, which are expressed constitutively and activated via phosphorylation, IRF1 activity is determined primarily by its protein abundance which is regulated transcriptionally, translationally (at the level of protein synthesis), and by the rate of protein degradation. A better understanding of these processes would be important for scientists with interests in innate immune host responses to pathogens as well as the role of IRF1 in protection against cancer.</p><p>Vunjak et al. focused on host factors controlling IRF1 protein degradation in RKO cells, a poorly differentiated human colonic carcinoma cell line, after confirming that the abundance of IRF1 protein in these cells was stabilized by inhibition of the proteasome when cells were treated with cycloheximide to block new protein synthesis. The authors constructed a cell line with stable expression of an mCherry-IRF1 reporter protein and conditional expression of Cas9, which they then transduced with lentiviruses expressing a genome-wide guide RNA (sgRNA) library. They used flow cytometry to select cells with enhanced mCherry-ORF1 expression, and high throughput sequencing of the selected cells to identify SPOP as a leading candidate for regulation of IRF1 protein abundance, putatively controlling its degradation. The authors went on to show in a series of validation experiments that targeted depletion of SPOP (a 374aa adapter protein that is a component of a cullin-RING E3 ubiquitin ligase complex involved in ubiquitination of a number of other cellular proteins) enhances endogenous IRF1 protein abundance, as anticipated from the screen. They show SPOP forms a complex with IRF1 through interactions with one or more predicted SPOP-interaction domains ('degrons') in IRF1, and provide data suggestive of SPOP-regulated IRF1 ubiquitination.</p><p>These experiments were generally well-controlled and carried out in a thoughtful manner, and collectively they provide solid evidence that SPOP regulates IRF1 abundance in RKO cells, most likely by mediating its ubiquitination and subsequent proteasome-dependent degradation. These results differ significantly from those of Tawaratsumida et al. (PMID 35857476), who reported earlier this year that the deletion of SPOP decreased, rather than increased, the abundance of IRF1 (and other IRFs) by increasing the activity of the Src kinase family member LYN and subsequent LYN-directed IRF degradation. However, they are consistent with a recent report by Gao et al. (PMID: 36481790), who also demonstrated that SPOP interacts with IRF1 and regulates IRF1 abundance via ubiquitination and proteasome-mediated degradation in endometrial carcinoma cells, thereby suppressing IRF1-mediated expression of the programmed cell death 1 ligand, PD-L1.</p><p>While providing valuable insight, there are several important limitations to the Vunjak study. As in all such CRISPR screens, genes that are essential for cell proliferation/survival and also involved in IRF1 regulation might be missed due to the global effects of gene knockout. More specific to the authors' screen, however, the half-life of the mCherry-IRF1 reporter protein was approximately twice that of endogenous IRF1 in cycloheximide-treated RKO cells, suggesting that the reporter protein might not be subject to an additional, SPOP-independent degradation pathway acting only on the endogenous protein. Another major limitation of the study is that the fate of IRF1 was investigated only in a single cancer cell line. IRF1 is recognized to have important tumor suppressor activity, and the control of its expression could differ from the norm in cells that have undergone a neoplastic transformation. Thus, while both the Gao report shows SPOP regulates IRF1 abundance directly in other cancer cell types, it would be important to know whether it similarly controls IRF1 abundance in non-neoplastic stromal cells, or in immune cells in the presence or absence of IRF1 activation by pathogen invasion.</p><p>Another uncertainty is the cellular compartment in which IRF1 degradation is regulated – is it regulated in the cytoplasm, or in the nucleus where most SPOP is expressed, or could it be regulated at the level of nuclear translocation? The latter possibility is particularly intriguing, as Vunjak's CRISPR screen identified multiple components of the nuclear pore complex in addition to SPOP. Also unknown is the impact of IRF1 phosphorylation on its degradation, either at the level of SPOP binding to IRF1, ubiquitination, or nuclear translocation of IRF1. While the authors note these questions, the manuscript leaves them unanswered, to be resolved hopefully in future studies.</p><p>RKO is a cancer cell line – is IRF1 degradation in these cells representative of IRF1 degradation pathways in normal cells? For example, FBXW7 appears to be not important for IRF1 regulation in these cells but has been reported to be so in other cell types.</p><p>Line 135-236 – The authors should consider that IRF1 abundance is regulated not only transcriptionally, but also translationally, as IRF1 synthesis is subject to inhibition by PKR independently of transcription (Feng et al., PMID 28967880).</p><p>Line 172-175 – The fact that the t<sub>1/2</sub> of the mCherry-IRF1 product is twice as long as that of endogenous IRF1 suggests the possibility that the endogenous degradation pathway may be only partly represented/active in the reporter cell line.</p><p>Line 231 – (a) The authors state that SPOP was &quot;The strongest candidate enriched at both three and six days after Cas9 induction&quot; – however, SPOP is not shown in Figure S2E (the day 3 panel), and it is not the most significantly enriched in Figure 2D. (b) Were each of the 6 sgRNAs targeting SPOP enriched at day 3 and day 7?</p><p>Line 241-244 – &quot;FBXW7, MDM2, [and] STUB1/CHIP … are unlikely to play a significant role in IRF1 degradation&quot; – or, could these proteins be required for cell survival? The authors should note the limitations of this CRISPR screen.</p><p>Figure 3A – BFP labeling appears to be increased in the sgSPOP transduced cells. Was the change in MFI from sgAAVS1 significant?</p><p>Figure S3E (and other bar graphs) – showing symbols for the individual values reflected in the means shown by the bars would be informative and enhance the presentation of the authors' data.</p><p>Line 260-62 – Is the increase in IRF1 protein primarily cytoplasmic, or nuclear?</p><p>Lines 298-99, 318 – The data do not show that &quot;the four predicted degrons collectively are required for SPOP-dependent IRF1 degradation&quot; since all four degrons were mutated. It could be that only one of the degrons is functional in the wild-type protein and that the loss of degradation requires mutation of only that specific degron. The authors recognize this limitation in the Discussion on lines 472-473, but ought to change the text in Results to more accurately reflect the data. The Abstract should also be modified to reflect this more accurate interpretation of the data.</p><p>Figure 4E-H – Were the wt and mutated IRF1 expression products tagged with Myc? It is otherwise not clear why blotting was with antibody to Myc-IRF1 (minor detail).</p><p>Figure 4J, I – How reproducible were these IRF1 ubiquitylation experiments? There are no error bars in Figure 4I suggesting that the experiment may have been done only once.</p><p>The authors should cite the recent publication by Gao et al. (PMID: 36481790) in the Discussion, and compare the results of Gao et al., with those reported here.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>In this study, Vunjak and colleagues show that the Speckle Type BTB/POZ Protein (SPOP) is responsible for the ubiquitination and turnover of Interferon Regulatory Factor 1 (IRF1). Using a CRISPR genetic screening approach, the authors identified several factors, including the E3 ligase substrate adaptor SPOP as regulators of IRF1 protein levels. The screening approach used good controls (such as Myc instead of IRF1) and showed significant results. Further, the authors identified potential SPOP-binding motifs in IRF1 and showed that they (or at least one of them) are important for the recognition and turnover via SPOP; they used flow cytometry, co-immunoprecipitation, western immunoblotting, and dual luciferase assays. Finally, to determine the response of IRF1 transcriptional activity to the presence and absence of SPOP, the authors performed a qPCR analysis of IRF1-driven transcripts, which revealed a significant increase in SPOP knockout cells.</p><p>The manuscript is well written. The authors find another substrate of SPOP. One open question is how significant this E3 ligase is for the turnover of IRF1. The difference in ubiquitination in WT and SPOP-binding motif-devoid IRF1 is modest. The differences in transcriptional activity, however, are large. A set of additional experiments are necessary to understand these counterintuitive effects. The authors identify 4 SPOP-binding motifs in IRF1 and suggest that they work synergistically in the recognition of IRF1 by SPOP and its subsequent degradation. However, without testing the contribution of individual SPOP-binding motifs, it is impossible to say whether they all contribute to SPOP turnover.</p><p>1. The current version of Figure 1E is weak in supporting the idea that IRF1 degradation is independent of autophagy/autolysosomal degradation. Additional controls including time-dependent CHX treatment (like in Figure 1A) and -IFNγ in the presence of Bafilomycin will help to answer this question clearly.</p><p>2. Is IRF1 ubiquitinated by SPOP also in the absence of inflammation or is this an inflammation-specific response?</p><p>3. There are no error bars in some histogram plots (Figure 3E, Figure 3F, Figure 4J, Figure 5C). How many biological and technical replicates did the authors perform?</p><p>4. In Figure 4D, it seems that both IRF1 and SPOP localize in the nucleus but the resolution of the microscopy image is not sufficient to clearly understand their subcellular distribution. SPOP is often localized to nuclear bodies such as nuclear speckles. Micrographs with better resolution and concentration on the nucleus are required.</p><p>5. The decrease in the ubiquitylation level of IRF1 with mutated SB motifs compared to IRF1 WT is modest (Figure 4I). SPOP seems to be responsible for the turnover of only a small fraction of IRF1. The authors found other E3 ligase hits in their genetic screen, e.g. HUWE1 (a strong candidate hit in Figure S2F). Have they considered testing whether there are other E3 ligases involved in the turnover of IRF1?</p><p>6. In Figure 5A and 5B, to be able to unambivalently identify whether tested transcripts are only driven by the transcriptional activity of IRF1 but not by other IRF family members or other transcription factors when treated with IFNγ, a control condition like sgIRF1 cells are necessary.</p><p>7. Experiments in Figure 5C and Figure 5D show a comparison of +/- WT SPOP expression. In Figure 5C, the ratio is about 10fold, but in Figure 5D around 100 fold. What results in this large deviation?</p><p>8. The authors observe little to no protein turnover effect of SPOP on cMYC. However, it has been previously shown that SPOP recognizes cMYC as a ubiquitination substrate (PMID: 28414305, PMID: 30002443). Could the authors please discuss the potential reasons for this discrepancy?</p><p>9. The authors mentioned a recent study (Tawaratsumida et al., 2022) that shows that deletion of SPOP results in LYN-dependent (Src kinase family member LYN) degradation of IRF1, and inhibition of its transcriptional activity. The discussion (in lines 452-456) suggests that the differences may arise from the expression of TLRs and associated adapters exclusively in immune cells. However, colon/colorectal cancer cells including RKO cells are known to express most TLRs (e.g. PMID: 33244454). It thus seems that TLR expression is not the critical difference that causes the differing response. Could the authors please discuss what other biological reasons could potentially cause this different response?</p><p>10. The statement &quot;…the four predicted degrons collectively are required for SPOP-dependent IRF1 degradation.&quot; (lines 298-299) cannot be made without testing the response of the SPOP degrons individually, as well as in binary and ternary combinations. It is possible that only one of the motifs is responsible for the observed effect.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.89951.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the authors resubmitted a revised version of the paper for consideration.

These data show that SPOP localizes in our cell models diffusely in the nucleoplasm and nuclear speckles, whereas IRF1 is exclusively diffusely nucleoplasmic. Additional data show that IRF1 only accumulated as a diffusely nucleoplasmic pool upon proteasome inhibition. In line with these findings, IRF1 and SPOP subcellular fractionation indicated that SPOP targets IRF1 in the nucleus, and that IRF1 is degraded in the nucleus. The fact that IRF1 was undetectable in the cytosol, indicates that IRF1 is likely rapidly imported into the nucleus upon synthesis, and that this is the predominant location where SPOP-dependent IRF1 degradation takes place.

The authors devised a clever fluorescent protein-based IRF1 degradation assay and used this system to perform a well-controlled genome-wide CRISPR screen for genes that regulated IRF1 expression. They identified SPOP as a hit and then carried out a series of experiments (genetic reconstitution, binding assays, localization) to validate SPOP as an E3 ligase that mediates the degradation of IRF1. In functional assays, they linked SPOP1-dependent IRF1 regulation to predicted changes in specific downstream IRF1 target genes, and they demonstrated modest effects of this pathway on cell fitness.</p><p>Strengths</p><p>Powerful CRISPR screens to identify SPOP as a regulator of IRF1 protein abundance;</p><p>Rigorous validation of hit, including binding assays, colocalization, and judicious use of both SPOP and IRF1 mutants as control.</p><p>Weaknesses</p><p>Current evidence for SPOP directly ubiquitinating IRF1 is incomplete and lacks complementing orthogonal assays;</p><p>The significance of the SPOP/IRF1 axis in a biologically relevant model system (infection, cancer, etc) is lacking.</p><p>1. The key/new mechanism here is that SPOP directly ubiquitinates IRF1 and enforces its degradation. There is only one Ub assay directly showing this, thus the strength of the evidence is incomplete. The authors need to provide additional data supporting this mechanism. Orthogonal assays (e.g. Ub assays in cells vs in vitro ubiquitination assays using recombinant protein) showing the same result are critical to pin this mechanism down. The use of SPOP mutants that cannot ubiquitinate IRF1 also needs to be included as controls.</p></disp-quote><p>New data in Figures 4I+J address IRF1 ubiquitination by SPOP, using IRF1 mutants that lack SPOP-binding domains, and SPOP mutants lacking an intact substrate recognition domain. These new data show robust wtIRF1 ubiquitination by wtSPOP, which was severely reduced if either the E3 or substrate were mutated in their interaction surfaces. These new data provide evidence for robust IRF1 poly-ubiquitination, supported by quantification of replicates and statistical analysis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The broader significance of the paper is uncertain in the absence of a more compelling role for the SPOP/IRF1 axis in a biologically relevant setting. The authors claim in the discussion that viral assays would be difficult due to the overlap of IRF1 and ISGF3 target genes. This logic is confusing. There are ample examples in the literature of IRF1 expression conferring antiviral effects to cells, especially in cells that can't signal through IFN (STAT1-deficient). Co-expression of SPOP with IRF1 should reduce IRF1 levels and create a more permissive antiviral state. Alternatively, a more robust cancer-related model could help assign a clearer biological role for SPOP/IRF1.</p></disp-quote><p>New data in Figure 5F + Figure 5—figure supplement 1C address the relevance of SPOP for exogenous IRF1-driven antiviral responses in <italic>STAT1</italic>-targeted cells. The data show that exogenous IRF1 expression reduced VSV progeny virus production by ~10 fold, and that this was further reduced by approximately another 10-fold in the absence of SPOP. These results underpin the biological significance of SPOP in controlling the IRF1-driven antiviral state.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.

IRF1 was the first interferon regulatory factor to be identified, and its activity as a transcription factor has been associated with both successful immune control of intracellular viral and bacterial infections, as well as regulation of cell cycle progression and tumor suppression. Unlike IRFs such as IRF3, which are expressed constitutively and activated via phosphorylation, IRF1 activity is determined primarily by its protein abundance which is regulated transcriptionally, translationally (at the level of protein synthesis), and by the rate of protein degradation. A better understanding of these processes would be important for scientists with interests in innate immune host responses to pathogens as well as the role of IRF1 in protection against cancer.</p><p>[…]</p><p>RKO is a cancer cell line – is IRF1 degradation in these cells representative of IRF1 degradation pathways in normal cells?

However, by day 6, these cells will be lost. This notion is underpinned by the fact that we readily identify proteasome components, and other highly cell-essential degradation mediators like AKIRIN2 in the screens presented in this manuscript, and the two publications listed above. Moreover, the used screening cell lines containing an sgRNA targeting the highly cell-essential gene <italic>RRM1</italic>, were only lost upon addition of Dox to induce Cas9, but not without it (Figure 1—figure supplement 1G-H), further substantiating the great care taken to enable identification of cell-essential genes in our screens, without the risk of out-selection of cells in which essential genes were targeted prior to the screening procedure.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 3A – BFP labeling appears to be increased in the sgSPOP transduced cells.

Using a CRISPR genetic screening approach, the authors identified several factors, including the E3 ligase substrate adaptor SPOP as regulators of IRF1 protein levels. The screening approach used good controls (such as Myc instead of IRF1) and showed significant results. Further, the authors identified potential SPOP-binding motifs in IRF1 and showed that they (or at least one of them) are important for the recognition and turnover via SPOP; they used flow cytometry, co-immunoprecipitation, western immunoblotting, and dual luciferase assays. Finally, to determine the response of IRF1 transcriptional activity to the presence and absence of SPOP, the authors performed a qPCR analysis of IRF1-driven transcripts, which revealed a significant increase in SPOP knockout cells.</p><p>The manuscript is well written. The authors find another substrate of SPOP. One open question is how significant this E3 ligase is for the turnover of IRF1. The difference in ubiquitination in WT and SPOP-binding motif-devoid IRF1 is modest. The differences in transcriptional activity, however, are large. A set of additional experiments are necessary to understand these counterintuitive effects. The authors identify 4 SPOP-binding motifs in IRF1 and suggest that they work synergistically in the recognition of IRF1 by SPOP and its subsequent degradation. However, without testing the contribution of individual SPOP-binding motifs, it is impossible to say whether they all contribute to SPOP turnover.</p><p>1. The current version of Figure 1E is weak in supporting the idea that IRF1 degradation is independent of autophagy/autolysosomal degradation. Additional controls including time-dependent CHX treatment (like in Figure 1A) and -IFNγ in the presence of Bafilomycin will help to answer this question clearly.</p></disp-quote><p>New data addressing the contribution of autophagy/lysosomal degradation to IRF1 turn-over in a protein stability chase were added as new figures Figure 4—figure supplement 1A-B. IRF1 stability was investigated in the presence of both cycloheximide and Bafilomycin A. From these data, we concluded that IRF1 is predominantly degraded by the proteasome, with little to no contribution by lysosome-dependent mechanisms.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

In Figure 4D, it seems that both IRF1 and SPOP localize in the nucleus but the resolution of the microscopy image is not sufficient to clearly understand their subcellular distribution. SPOP is often localized to nuclear bodies such as nuclear speckles. Micrographs with better resolution and concentration on the nucleus are required.</p></disp-quote><p>New data in Figures 4A and Figure 4—figure supplement 1A address the subcellular localization of IRF1 and SPOP by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy in two cell models. From these new data, we conclude that SPOP localizes in both of our cell models diffusely in the nucleoplasm and nuclear speckles, whereas IRF1 is exclusively diffusely nucleoplasmic. Additional data show that IRF1 only accumulates as a diffusely nucleoplasmic pool upon proteasome inhibition. Together, these results indicate that IRF1 and SPOP likely interact in the nucleoplasm, and that IRF1 is predominantly degraded in the nucleoplasm, with limited involvement of SPOP in nuclear speckles.

The decrease in the ubiquitylation level of IRF1 with mutated SB motifs compared to IRF1 WT is modest (Figure 4I). SPOP seems to be responsible for the turnover of only a small fraction of IRF1. The authors found other E3 ligase hits in their genetic screen, e.g. HUWE1 (a strong candidate hit in Figure S2F). Have they considered testing whether there are other E3 ligases involved in the turnover of IRF1?</p></disp-quote><p>UBE3C and HUWE1 were two other E3 ligases identified in the IRF1 screen. UBE3C was not further pursued, as the fact that it was also a strong hit in the cMYC screen indicated this may be a more general regulator of proteasomal degradation, consistent with published data (Chu et al. JBC 2013, PMID: 24158444). The role of HUWE1 in IRF1 turn-over is being further elucidated outside of this manuscript’s scope, which may be indirect as we recently showed for the inflammation regulator tristetraprolin (Scinicariello <italic>et al.</italic>, <italic>eLife</italic> 2023).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6.

Moreover, the internally controlled nature of the dual luciferase setup, makes us confident that both data sets are reliable. Although we cannot identify a particular cause for the difference with certainty, a higher transfection efficiency and higher signal gain settings on the plate reader for the second experiment (Figure 5D) may have improved the experimental range of the assay, and consequently may have resulted in larger effect differences upon SPOP expression.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. The authors observe little to no protein turnover effect of SPOP on cMYC. However, it has been previously shown that SPOP recognizes cMYC as a ubiquitination substrate (PMID: 28414305, PMID: 30002443).

The authors mentioned a recent study (Tawaratsumida et al., 2022) that shows that deletion of SPOP results in LYN-dependent (Src kinase family member LYN) degradation of IRF1, and inhibition of its transcriptional activity.

However, colon/colorectal cancer cells including RKO cells are known to express most TLRs (e.g. PMID: 33244454). It thus seems that TLR expression is not the critical difference that causes the differing response.
