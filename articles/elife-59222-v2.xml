drives the polarized orientation of the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> mitotic spindle and primes the invariant inheritance of the old spindle pole body (SPB, the yeast centrosome) by the bud. This model has anticipated analogous centrosome asymmetries featured in self-renewing stem cell divisions. We previously implicated Spc72, the cytoplasmic receptor for the gamma-tubulin nucleation complex, as the most upstream determinant linking SPB age, functional asymmetry and fate. Here we used structured illumination microscopy and biochemical analysis to explore the asymmetric landscape of nucleation sites inherently built into the spindle pathway and under the control of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK). We show that CDK enforces Spc72 asymmetric docking by phosphorylating Nud1/centriolin. Furthermore, CDK-imposed order in the construction of the new SPB promotes the correct balance of nucleation sites between the nuclear and cytoplasmic faces of the SPB. Together these contributions by CDK inherently link correct SPB morphogenesis, age and fate.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>spindle</kwd><kwd>polarity</kwd><kwd>asymmetric fate</kwd><kwd>gamma-tubulin</kwd><kwd>cell cycle</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RO1GM121443</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jaspersen</surname><given-names>Sue L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>CSC Cambridge International Scholarship</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Peng</surname><given-names>Qiuran</given-names></name><name><surname>Guo</surname><given-names>Zhiang</given-names></name><name><surname>Segal</surname><given-names>Marisa</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The polarized orientation of the mitotic spindle in budding yeast arises from spindle pole structural and functional asymmetry subject to cell cycle control.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Spindle orientation in self-renewing stem cell divisions exploits structural asymmetries built into the centrosome cycle to create a directional bias that links differential fate with an invariant pattern of age-dependent centrosome inheritance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Pelletier and Yamashita, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Rebollo et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Venkei and Yamashita, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Wang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Yamashita et al., 2007</xref>).

The SPB consists of three major layers — an inner plaque facing the nucleus, a central plaque rooted in the nuclear envelope and an outer plaque facing the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Microtubule (MT) nucleation sites arise by recruitment of the conserved γ-tubulin complex (γTC but also referred to as the γ-tubulin small complex or γ-TuSC) composed of Tub4 (yeast γ-tubulin), Spc98/GCP3 and Spc97/GCP2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Farache et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Geissler et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Knop, 1997a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kollman et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Winey and Bloom, 2012</xref>). The inner plaque organizes intranuclear spindle MTs by docking γTCs onto Spc110/pericentrin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Knop, 1997b</xref>).

Genetic analyses in combination with electron microscopy (EM) and, more recently, structured illumination microscopy (SIM), have contributed toward a model mapping the ordered addition of individual components according to three landmark events — satellite assembly at the distal end of the bridge, generation of a duplication plaque and a final side-by-side stage with the bridge connecting duplicated SPBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams and Kilmartin, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Burns et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cavanaugh and Jaspersen, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Jaspersen and Ghosh, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Jaspersen and Winey, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Rüthnick and Schiebel, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Winey and Bloom, 2012</xref>). By onset of SPB separation and spindle assembly, the old SPB has established first contacts with the bud through existing aMTs while the newly assembled SPB delays aMT organization until a ~ 1 µm-long spindle has formed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Shaw et al., 1997</xref>). This intrinsic functional asymmetry, in interplay with extrinsic cues, primes spindle polarity and orientation along the mother-bud axis in association with the stereotyped inheritance of the old SPB by the bud (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Geymonat and Segal, 2017</xref>). In agreement with live imaging data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Juanes et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Segal et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Shaw et al., 1997</xref>), three-dimensional ultrastructural analyses demonstrate aMT asymmetric organization built into the early stages in the spindle pathway, with aMTs emerging from the old SPB outer plaque and the bridge both at the satellite and side-by-side stages in cells proceeding unperturbed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Byers and Goetsch, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">McIntosh and O'Toole, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">O'Toole et al., 1999</xref>).</p><p>Core cell cycle controls linking aMT organization with landmark events along the spindle pathway might involve phosphorylation targets at the SPB. Phosphorylation sites have been identified in many SPB components but their possible significance to intrinsic SPB functional asymmetry remains unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fong et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Huisman et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Keck et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Lin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Lin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Rock et al., 2013</xref>). In <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, cell cycle progression is controlled by a single cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK), Cdc28/Cdk1, that associates with a series of phase-specific cyclins to control various cell cycle events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Morgan, 2007</xref>). We have previously implicated the S-phase CDK Clb5-Cdc28 in enforcing aMT asymmetry. Indeed, Clb5 inactivation in the sensitized <italic>cdc28-4</italic> background, <italic>cdc28-4 clb5∆,</italic> specifically abrogates the delay in aMT organization at the new SPB relative to spindle assembly with concomitant disruption of spindle polarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Segal et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Segal et al., 1998</xref>). More recently we have correlated aMT temporal asymmetry with the acquisition of Spc72 at the new SPB outer plaque during spindle assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Juanes et al., 2013</xref>). However, that study could not determine how Spc72 temporal asymmetry arises or its direct impact on γTC distribution at distinct nucleation sites. Moreover, the idea that intrinsic SPB asymmetry has such structural basis has been brought into question in a recent study, which suggested instead that aMT asymmetry stems solely from extrinsic factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lengefeld et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Here we undertook detailed analysis of the mode of distribution of Spc72 and components of the γTC throughout the spindle pathway by SIM. Our data show that biased recruitment of Spc72 and the γTC at the old SPB stems from manifest asymmetry throughout G<sub>1</sub> and during the side-by-side stage, which is preserved until spindle assembly begins. Our data also show that CDK targets Nud1 in order to enforce Spc72 biased partition during S phase. Moreover, CDK is required for the γTC inner to outer plaque ratio that underlies the normal distribution of nucleation sites at the two faces of the SPB. Finally, CDK also promotes the assembly of the new SPB in the correct order by which γTC addition to the outer plaque always follows the complete assembly of the inner plaque. Taken together, our study reveals key contributions of CDK toward accurate SPB morphogenesis that secure the correct interplay between intrinsic and extrinsic asymmetries that determine spindle polarity and differential fate.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Asymmetric outer plaque structure and γTC partition during spindle assembly revealed by SIM</title><p>We have previously proposed that the intrinsic link between SPB age, temporally asymmetric aMT organization and SPB fate is underpinned by Spc72 biased localization to the old SPB during spindle assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Juanes et al., 2013</xref>). Yet, how this asymmetry is built and the associated impact on the localization of γTC at three nucleation sites — inner plaque, outer plaque and the bridge — remain unknown. SIM represents an effective approach to answer these questions as demonstrated by a previous study focused on core molecular events in SPB duplication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Burns et al., 2015</xref>). Of particular relevance is the ability of SIM to resolve SPB inner and outer plaques shown by that study, using strains expressing endogenous SPB components fused to fluorescent tags. Accordingly, single SPBs of cells expressing Tub4-mTurquoise2 (mT2) showed two distinct foci that could be assigned to inner and outer plaques by co-label with YFP-Spc110 or YFP-Spc72, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Burns et al., 2015</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Two foci were also observed using Spc97-mT2 or Spc98-mT2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Burns et al., 2015</xref>). In all cases, the focus co-localized with YFP-Spc110 was more intense than the signal co-localized with YFP-Spc72, consistent with the idea that there is more γTC at the inner plaque of the SPB than at the outer plaque.</p><p>To establish the relative ratio of γTC at the inner and outer plaque, we determined the intensity of Tub4-mT2, Spc97-mT2 or Spc98-mT2 foci in individual SIM images (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Based on the accepted nuclear to cytoplasmic MT ratio of ~5–10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Erlemann et al., 2012</xref>), we anticipated a similar ratio for the γTC. Against expectations, quantitative analysis uncovered an overall inner to outer plaque ratio (IP:OP ratio) of ~2–3 for each γTC component. While it is clear from individual measurements there is considerable heterogeneity in γTC that will be further investigated below, this heterogeneity, the lower z-resolution of SIM or other issues with quantitation are unlikely to account for the observed IP:OP ratio. In diploid cells, the number of MTs increases two-fold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Byers and Goetsch, 1974</xref>). Analysis of Tub4-mT2 distribution in haploids and diploids showed a roughly two-fold increase in γTC at both the inner and outer plaques of diploid SPBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>). A previous challenge with single color SIM analysis of γTC involved the orientation of the SPB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lengefeld et al., 2018</xref>). To overcome this limitation, strains contained second reference label (typically Spc72, Nud1 or Spc110; see Materials and methods) so that images in which inner and outer plaques overlapped vertically (top view) could be excluded. Judging from the apparent overlap between single Tub4 foci and the core outer plaque component Nud1, only ~12% of all SPBs in our SIM images showed a top view (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). Collectively, these data point to an unexpected, marked contribution of the outer plaque to bulk γTC content at the SPB and illustrated the utility of SIM for analysis of SPB structure. This finding is consistent with the notion that Tub4 asymmetry observed by wide-field fluorescence microscopy might reflect events at the cytoplasmic face of the SPB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Juanes et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>The γTC localizes to two cytoplasmic SPB substructures: the outer plaque and the (half)-bridge. To better understand possible γTC heterogeneity and γTC distribution to the outer plaque or half-bridge as contributors to intrinsic SPB asymmetry, we analyzed Tub4-mT2 by SIM in asynchronous cell populations in either <italic>KAR1</italic> or <italic>kar1∆15</italic> backgrounds. The <italic>kar1∆15</italic> mutation abrogates Spc72 binding to Kar1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Pereira et al., 1999</xref>), thus precluding γTC localization to the bridge. Strains also contained Spc72-Venus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><p>Cell images were grouped by cell cycle/spindle stage (SPB number and spindle length) and SPB age (old versus new) based on measure of inner plaque intensities and/or position within the cell. To compare Tub4 localization among multiple SPBs in a cell cycle/spindle stage, we used computational methods to align dual color SIM images based on Tub4-mT2 fluorescence at the inner and outer plaque of SPBs within that category and used to generate an averaged image (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–B</xref>, see Materials and methods). This type of analysis is advantageous because it shows the likelihood that a protein is present in a given location based on many cells and allows for positional comparison between different proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Burns et al., 2015</xref>). From these averaged images and their quantitation by linescan analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) or from quantitation of individual SPBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), the structural asymmetry between old versus new SPB was apparent. Unduplicated SPBs from G<sub>1</sub>-phase cells exhibited a Tub4 IP:OP ratio between 2 and 3 that was also manifest in old SPBs throughout the remaining of the cell cycle. By contrast, the ratio was highest in new SPBs early in spindle assembly but decreased later in the spindle pathway.</p><p>Linescan analysis along the spindle axis in maximal SIM image projections of wild type and <italic>kar1∆15</italic> cells was used to elucidate the contribution of the bridge pool of γTC to its asymmetry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–F</xref>), validating our data from averaged images while revealing further significant trends. First, Tub4-mT2 was apparent at the inner plaque of the new SPB early in spindle assembly (&lt;1 µm-long spindles), before Spc72-Venus or Tub4-mT2 accumulated at the new SPB outer plaque (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> a versus b-e). Both components were strongly asymmetric at the cytoplasmic face of the SPB in <italic>KAR1</italic> cells or mainly present at the old pole in <italic>kar1∆15</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). The <italic>KAR1</italic> and <italic>kar1∆15</italic> samples analyzed showed similar spindle length profiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>) confirming that overall spindle dynamics was not affected by the <italic>kar1∆15</italic> mutation. The complete assembly of the SPB inner plaque served as a further reference in support of the late acquisition of Tub4 by the new SPB outer plaque. Second, incorporation of Tub4-mT2 onto the new SPB trailed Spc72-Venus, consistent with the idea that Spc72 is needed for γTC recruitment to the outer plaque (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Taken together, Tub4 exhibited a marked asymmetry at the cytoplasmic face of the SPB at early stages of the spindle pathway underpinned by Spc72 distribution. Further, the bridge-based localization of γTC plays little role in this asymmetry.</p><p>Importantly, Spc72 and Tub4 asymmetry during spindle assembly was also observed in the W303 yeast strain background in both individual images and in averaged images grouped by cell cycle/spindle stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). Quantitative analysis for relative Tub4 partition between inner and outer plaques by stage and SPB identity confirmed that Tub4 asymmetric recruitment is common to both 15D and W303 strain backgrounds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4B–C</xref>). Validation of Spc72 asymmetry by wide-field fluorescence microscopy analysis in multiple strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>) indicates that the effects are unlikely related to yeast genetic background and/or SIM. Rather, these results demonstrate that intrinsic SPB structural and functional asymmetry is a general feature of the budding yeast spindle cycle.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Spc72 and Tub4 asymmetries arise during SPB duplication</title><p>Landmark molecular events in SPB duplication have been elucidated by EM studies and, more recently, dissected by SIM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams and Kilmartin, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Burns et al., 2015</xref>).

In early G<sub>1</sub>, unduplicated SPBs contained two Tub4-Venus foci, the strongest corresponding to the inner plaque (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,a</xref>). A subset of unduplicated SPBs exhibited an elongated cytoplasmic signal extending beyond the presumed outer plaque (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,b</xref>); this most likely corresponded to bridge-localized γTC. In later G<sub>1</sub>, two foci of Spc110 were apparent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,c–d</xref>) along with a second prominent Tub4 focus at the new inner plaque, consistent with the idea that Spc110 incorporation occurs after SPB insertion into the nuclear envelope and that Spc110 recruits γTC to the SPB inner plaque. Duplicated SPBs remained unseparated in S phase (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> for a distribution of distances between unseparated SPB pairs) and had a variable cytoplasmic label of Tub4-mT2 extending from the old SPB to the space between the two inner plaques, as shown in the 1-pixel linescans across inner and outer plaques (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,c–d</xref>). These data suggest that γTC is present on the outer plaque of the old SPB throughout SPB duplication and localizes to varying degrees to the bridge. However, it does not appear to be added to the outer plaque of the new SPB as part of SPB duplication in G<sub>1</sub>.</p><p>To quantify the distribution of γTC at the old SPB, bridge and new SPB, we compared Tub4-Venus to Spc42-mT2 in wild type or <italic>kar1∆15</italic> cells. Spc42 is the first protein incorporated into the new SPB during its formation in G<sub>1</sub> phase, and its levels can be used to evaluate progression through SPB duplication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams and Kilmartin, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Burns et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Rüthnick et al., 2017</xref>). Cells at the satellite or duplication plaque stage were recognized by the presence of duplicated Spc42 signals alongside a single Tub4 inner plaque focus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,a–b</xref>, hollow arrowhead) or at the side-by side stage by the presence of duplicated Spc42 signals with two Tub4 inner plaque foci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,c–e</xref>, hollow arrowheads). During the satellite stage, Tub4 was also observed at the old SPB outer plaque (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,a</xref>, solid arrowhead), or favoring the space between the SPB and satellite with a residual signal often apparent at the old SPB outer plaque (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,b</xref>, big and small solid arrowheads, respectively). After appearance of the new inner plaque (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,c–e</xref>), label continued to distribute between those two cytoplasmic locations (solid arrowheads). Label associated with the new SPB outer plaque was not observed. In <italic>kar1∆15</italic> cells Tub4 retained localization exclusively at the old SPB outer plaque throughout (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,f–g</xref>, solid arrowhead) demonstrating that localization at the center of the SPB pair in <italic>KAR1</italic> cells represented nucleation sites at the bridge. Thus, Tub4 and by extension γTC, localizes to the old SPB and bridge during SPB duplication. The fact that Tub4 is readily detected at the new SPB inner plaque but not at the outer plaque indicates that its asymmetry between cytoplasmic faces of the old versus new SPB is not due to fluorophore maturation. Further, our data clearly demonstrate that SPB insertion is not the trigger for completion of outer plaque assembly.</p><p>As γTC is recruited to the outer plaque and bridge via Spc72, we also examined Spc72 incorporation into the SPB during duplication using Spc42 to mark collectively the satellite stage and duplicated side-by-side SPBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Like γTC, we observed two localization patterns. Some cells showed single Spc72 label at the old SPB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,a</xref>, arrowhead) while the majority of cells showed Spc72 label extending from the old SPB to the bridge, with label favoring one or the other location (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,b–d</xref>, big and small arrowheads, respectively) and a small proportion appearing to carry label at the bridge exclusively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,e</xref>). This dual site distribution was abrogated in <italic>kar1∆15</italic> cells in which label remained at the old SPB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,f</xref>). An identical result was obtained when Spc72-Venus localization was determined in reference to Nud1-mT2 label (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), which also displays two signals from the satellite stage and throughout duplication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Burns et al., 2015</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>).

Importantly, these experiments clearly showed that a significant fraction of both Spc72 and Tub4 are maintained at the old SPB, even in the presence of bridge-localized pools of each protein.</p><p>To confirm that the asymmetric localization of Spc72 and γTC arises during SPB duplication, we examined Spc72-Venus and Spc98-mT2 (another component of the γTC) in <italic>KAR1</italic> and <italic>kar1∆15</italic> cell populations released from a metaphase block imposed by repression of <italic>CDC20</italic>. This allowed us to follow synchronous populations proceeding unperturbed along the subsequent cell cycle to ensure we captured and staged all modes of localization during early landmarks of the spindle pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).

SIM analysis of these synchronized cells confirmed the inherent asymmetry built into the SPB duplication cycle, the overall absence of Spc72 and Spc98 at the new SPB outer plaque, and a modest contribution to Spc72 label at the new SPB attributed to the bridge, as inferred from the nearly absolute asymmetry at onset of SPB separation observed in <italic>kar1∆15</italic> cells. These findings validated our analysis using asynchronous cell populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>).

First, CDK helps retain Spc72 at the old SPB outer plaque thus enforcing asymmetry in unseparated SPBs, at least in part, via phosphorylation of Nud1. Second, CDK further imposes the sequential addition and the ensuing distribution of γTC at the inner and outer plaques, most likely, by phosphorylation of other SPB components (see Discussion). These findings point to critical links between CDK temporal control, correct SPB morphogenesis and functional asymmetry.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>SIM reveals that maturation and acquisition of nucleation capability are compartmentalized and proceed separately at inner and outer plaques of the new SPB</title><p>Historically, SPB assembly is thought to begin with the formation of the satellite, followed by addition of outer plaque components, including Nud1 and, perhaps by extrapolation, Spc72 and the γTC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams and Kilmartin, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Rüthnick and Schiebel, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Winey and Bloom, 2012</xref>). Because mutants that disrupt SPB insertion into the nuclear envelope (i.e., <italic>mps2-1</italic>, <italic>ndc1-1</italic>) form a complete outer plaque that is competent for aMT nucleation, SPB insertion is not required for outer plaque assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Winey et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Winey et al., 1993</xref>). Yet, our current work challenges the idea that completion of the new outer plaque, specifically addition of Spc72 and γTC, temporally precedes SPB insertion and even separation in wild type cells. Rather, these distal components are added later as the new SPB matures part-way along spindle assembly.</p><p>Previous SIM analysis focused on short spindles was unable to estimate the overall proportion of SPBs with γTC at the outer plaque, in part, because a fraction of those SPBs were presumably aligned perpendicularly to the imaging plane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lengefeld et al., 2018</xref>). By contrast, our use of a second label and 3-D realignment allowed us to analyze virtually all SPBs in every cell cycle stage to uncover outer plaque asymmetry. Furthermore, unlike direct stochastic optical resolution microscopy (dSTORM) in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lengefeld et al., 2018</xref>, which presumed a model for MT formation in vivo based on in vitro work, our analysis made no assumptions and only took into account fluorescence intensity — a reliable readout of γTC abundance given the increase observed as a function of cell ploidy or during the cell cycle.

Differences in the composition of γTC and its interactor, Mozart, as well as phosphoregulation of Mto2 (an activating subunit of the Spc72 ortholog, Mto1), are thought to underlie SPB asymmetry in these cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Borek et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gao et al., 2019</xref>).

Therefore, we anticipated a correlative 5–10 IP:OP ratio in γTC levels rather than the ~2 fold difference measured. This apparent discrepancy between γTC levels and MT nucleation suggests that the availability of γTC is not the sole regulator of MT formation in the cell. Further work will help elucidate the roles that the outer and inner plaque receptors, Spc72 and Spc110 respectively, the MT polymerase Stu2 (the budding yeast Dis1/TOG family member) and various post-translational modifications play in differential MT nucleation on each face of the SPB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fong et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gunzelmann et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Huisman et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Keck et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Lin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Lin et al., 2014</xref>). In conclusion, our work illustrates an additional mode of regulation for aMT organization involving the addition of Spc72 and γTC to the new SPB with a temporality emerging, at least in part, from CDK-dependent phosphorylation of Nud1.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>CDK contributions to the SPB cycle and intrinsic asymmetry</title><p>CDKs promote multiple events along the spindle pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Avena et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Byers and Goetsch, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chee and Haase, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Elserafy et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fitch et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Haase et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Huisman et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Jaspersen et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Jones et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Juanes et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Liang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Lin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Rüthnick and Schiebel, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Segal et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Winey and Byers, 1993</xref>) beginning with the requirement for G<sub>1</sub> cyclin (Cln)-Cdc28 in SPB duplication.

A number of SPB targets have been implicated but the precise molecular details are unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Jaspersen et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Jones et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Keck et al., 2011</xref>). CDK activity also ensures that SPB duplication occurs once per cell cycle via Sfi1 — one of the best understood CDK molecular paradigms centered on an SPB component (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Avena et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Elserafy et al., 2014</xref>). Otherwise, most CDK phosphorylation sites in SPB components studied so far have proven dispensable for viability (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Huisman et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Jaspersen et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Lin et al., 2014</xref>, this study), with synergism observed when CDK site mutants for multiple SPB components are combined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Jones et al., 2018</xref>). Now, phospho-proteomic datasets convey an integral view of CDK phosphorylation at the SPB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fong et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Keck et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Lin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Rock et al., 2013</xref>) against a backdrop for potential interplay with several cell cycle, and possibly other, protein kinases. However, it remains an ongoing challenge to link this complex regulatory landscape to function or any spatial restrictions tied into SPB age.</p><p>We previously implicated Clb5-Cdc28 in enforcing intrinsic SPB asymmetry based on the phenotype of <italic>cdc28-4 clb5∆</italic> mutant cells, a genetic setup designed to circumvent cyclin functional redundancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Segal et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Segal et al., 1998</xref>). Here, our data indicate that Clb5-Cdc28 is required for timing Spc72 addition to the new SPB outer plaque. Indeed, <italic>cdc28-4 clb5∆</italic> mutants exhibited a marked advancement of Spc72 recruitment in unseparated SPBs, a defect also apparent in cells overexpressing non-degradable Sic1. Thus, despite any functional overlap between Clns and Clb5, Cln-Cdc28 might be insufficient to sustain SPB intrinsic asymmetry. However, we cannot exclude that both CDK complexes might contribute in wild type context, given that loss of Spc72 asymmetry arises from the strong genetic interaction between <italic>cdc28-4</italic> (a G<sub>1</sub> hypomorph <italic>CDK</italic> allele) and <italic>clb5∆</italic>.</p><p>Substitutions impeding CDK phosphorylation of Nud1 also advanced Spc72 recruitment to the new SPB outer plaque leading to substantial symmetry in short spindles. To understand the molecular link between Nud1 phosphorylation by CDK and Spc72 bias, the impact of CDK on the interaction between Nud1 and Spc72 was investigated. Spc72 pull-down by phosphorylated wild type Nud1 as bait was enhanced ~10 fold over an unphosphorylated control. By contrast, CDK could not stimulate binding when Nud1<sup>7A</sup> was used as bait. This change in affinity might translate into structural asymmetry if CDK activity were to inherently favor the old SPB outer plaque. Supporting this notion, both Cln2 and Clb5 as part of CDK complexes interacted with purified Spc72 in vitro. These data suggest that CDK might preferentially associate with the old SPB, which contains Spc72 in G<sub>1</sub>, to dictate intrinsic asymmetry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). CDK phosphorylation of Nud1 once Clb5-Cdc28 becomes active, retains Spc72 at the old SPB, while Spc72 acquisition at the new SPB is inherently delayed due to reduced affinity toward unphosphorylated Nud1. Then, delayed acquisition of Spc72 by the new SPB sets in motion a positive feedback loop centered on Spc72 and CDK phosphorylation of Nud1, accelerating outer plaque assembly as the spindle forms. Retention of Spc72 by the old SPB has been demonstrated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lengefeld et al., 2018</xref> although the mechanistic basis of how this might be achieved was not discussed. Such a mechanism might effectively establish SPB identity on the basis of Spc72 inherited by the old SPB from the preceding cell cycle. In the absence of CDK phosphorylation of Nud1, however, Spc72 retention by the old SPB would be compromised during duplication and the side-by-side stage when it is partly redeployed to the bridge, and thus become readily shared by both SPBs. We therefore propose a built-in interplay between Spc72-driven recruitment of CDK at the old SPB and the ensuing enhancement of Spc72 binding affinity through Nud1 phosphorylation by CDK as a landmark event in the SPB duplication cycle linking SPB identity and age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>A model for CDK control of intrinsic SPB asymmetry.</title><p>Our data suggest that CDK phosphosites in Nud1 increase affinity toward Spc72. (<bold>A</bold>) Because the old SPB inherits Spc72 and Nud1 from the preceding cell cycle (<bold>a</bold>), CDK recruitment to the old SPB via Spc72 promotes phosphorylation of Nud1 that may reinforce Spc72 retention in wild type cells. De novo Nud1 added to the new SPB (from the satellite state) is presumably not phosphorylated and would have low affinity for Spc72. As a result (<bold>b</bold>), S-phase CDK enforces structural asymmetry during the side-by-side stage. By onset of spindle assembly (<bold>c</bold>), low-affinity binding of Spc72 at the new SPB outer plaque may redirect CDK to phosphorylate Nud1 and trigger the phospho-dependent increase in affinity toward Spc72 that accelerates completion of the new SPB outer plaque. Thus, CDK recruitment via Spc72 translates phospho-dependent affinity between Spc72 and Nud1 into intrinsic structural asymmetry. This built-in delay in new outer plaque maturation manifests in temporal asymmetry in γTC recruitment and aMT organization. (<bold>B</bold>) In the absence of Nud1 phospho-dependent control, Spc72 is no longer restricted to the old SPB during the side-by-side stage with concomitant disruption of intrinsic asymmetry. The more severe phenotype observed upon loss of S-phase CDK implicates further substrates (see text). In <italic>cdc28-4 clb5∆</italic> cells (<bold>d</bold>), Spc72 symmetry is compounded by mis-regulation of the inner plaque allowing for the incorporation of γTC to the new SPB in the reverse order - first at the outer plaque and then at of the inner plaque. By contrast (<bold>e</bold>), loss of Nud1 phosphosites in <italic>nud1<sup>7A</sup></italic> cells, decreases Spc72 asymmetry without otherwise perturbing inner plaque function. Order of γTC addition is retained but acquisition by the outer plaque is advanced as it precedes SPB separation.

In addition to docking Spc72, Nud1 is a scaffold protein in the Mitotic Exit Network (MEN), a signaling pathway required for progression across the M/G<sub>1</sub> phase boundary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gruneberg, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Rock et al., 2013</xref>). Previous studies suggested Nud1 as a putative CDK and Cdc14 target, the latter a phosphatase typically reversing CDK phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bloom et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Park et al., 2008</xref>). Nud1 is also phosphorylated by Mps1, Cdc5 and Cdc15 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Keck et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Maekawa et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Park et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Rock et al., 2013</xref>). Nud1 MEN function has been implicated in correct SPB inheritance by linking the activation of the downstream MEN kinase Dbf2 at metaphase with polarized marking of the old SPB by Kar9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hotz et al., 2012</xref>). Yet, later <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Campbell et al., 2019</xref> demonstrated that Dbf2 activation is confined past anaphase onset and plays no role in Kar9 control, raising the possibility that the defective inheritance reported in a <italic>nud1</italic> mutant related instead to the role of Nud1 demonstrated here.

Thus, CDK may act through further substrates at the SPB, and more broadly via other protein kinases such as Mps1 and Cdc5, both dependent on CDK for their activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Jaspersen et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Mortensen et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Rodriguez-Rodriguez et al., 2016</xref>).

Finally, Clb5-Cdc28 might antagonize Cdc14 by direct phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Li et al., 2014</xref>), while the interplay between CDK thresholds and a constellation of phosphatases acting at the G<sub>1</sub>/S boundary is beginning to emerge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ariño et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Martín et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Surprisingly, inactivation of S-phase CDK not only disrupted Spc72 asymmetry but also decreased the γTC IP:OP ratio at SPBs. Moreover, recruitment of γTC during SPB duplication was markedly misregulated — Tub4 often appeared at the new outer plaque before its incorporation to the new inner plaque, a reversal of the normal sequence of events. By contrast, <italic>nud1<sup>7A</sup></italic> cells displayed excess symmetry without otherwise altering the order of γTC recruitment at the two faces of the new SPB or the Tub4 IP:OP ratio (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). These observations point to CDK acting via additional targets such that acquisition of γTC normally starts at the new SPB inner plaque. The γTC assembles in the cytoplasm and nuclear import is mediated by a nuclear localization sequence in Spc98 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Pereira et al., 1998</xref>). Clb5-Cdc28 phosphorylation of Spc110 at the inner plaque is critical for efficient γTC recruitment in early S phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Huisman et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Lin et al., 2014</xref>). Once γTC is docked at the inner plaque (but not at the outer plaque), Spc98 undergoes Mps1 and CDK-dependent phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Pereira et al., 1998</xref>), which is not essential for γTC recruitment per se but might still promote retention and nucleation activity. Thus, CDK phosphorylation prompts maturation of the new inner plaque ahead of the outer plaque. Tub4 also undergoes CDK and Cdc5-dependent phosphorylation that might be important for microtubule organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Lin et al., 2011</xref>). In <italic>cdc28-4 clb5∆</italic> cells, the combined effect of advanced Spc72 association with the new outer plaque and impaired retention of γTC by the inner plaque through hypophosphorylation of Spc110, Spc98 and Tub4 might cause roughly concurrent binding of γTC to both faces of the SPB with concomitant decrease in the IP:OP ratio. By contrast, the <italic>nud1<sup>7A</sup></italic> mutation decreases Spc72 asymmetry without otherwise affecting inner plaque function and IP:OP ratio.

Replacement of endogenous <italic>KAR1</italic> by the <italic>kar1∆15</italic> allele (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Pereira et al., 1999</xref>) was carried out by one-step disruption using pKS-kar1∆15-URA3 or pKS-kar1∆15-HIS2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Juanes et al., 2013</xref>). Deletion of <italic>NUD1</italic> was carried out by one-step disruption using a targeted <italic>KANMX</italic> cassette produced by polymerase chain reaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Juanes et al., 2013</xref>). Wild type <italic>NUD1</italic> gene or a mutated version in which seven CDK consensus sites were cancelled using nested PCRs (introducing S/T to A substitutions at positions 21, 294, 388, 392, 469, 806 and 843; referred to in the text as <italic>nud1<sup>7A</sup></italic>) fused to CFP or HA<sub>3</sub> were inserted as EcoRI-HindIII fragments into YIplac211 or YIp204, respectively. YIp211-NUD1-CFP or YIp211-NUD1<sup>7A</sup>-CFP were used for transformation of heterozygous <italic>NUD1/nud1::KANMX</italic> diploid cells. Linearization using StuI targeted integration at <italic>URA3</italic>. Following sporulation and tetrad dissection, haploid cells in which the <italic>NUD1</italic> deletion was rescued by the integrative constructs were selected. Haploid cells carrying YIp204-NUD1-HA<sub>3</sub> or YIp204-NUD1<sup>7A</sup>-HA<sub>3</sub> integrated at <italic>TRP1</italic> in the background of the <italic>NUD1</italic> deletion were similarly constructed. A similar strategy was implemented to construct strains expressing wild type or phospho-site mutant versions of Spc72-GFP, HA<sub>3</sub>-Kar1 or Cnm67-HA<sub>3</sub> in the respective deletion backgrounds. Mutations encoded S/T to A substitutions at positions 232, 243, 552 and 566 of Spc72, positions 149, 216, 222 and 294 of Kar1 and positions 17, 72, 89, 103, 120, 121, 146 and 147 of Cnm67.</p><p>Endogenous tagging to produce C-terminal fusions to GFP, YFP, CFP, mCherry, or mTurquoise2 of Tub4, Spc72, Nud1, Spc42, Cnm67 and Spc98 in 15DaubA was carried out using tagging vectors previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Juanes et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Juanes et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Ten Hoopen et al., 2012</xref>). N-terminal tags fused to Kar1 and Spc110 were created by single-step replacement with recombinant cassettes targeted to the endogenous loci. W303-derived strains expressing fusions to fluorescent tags have been described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Burns et al., 2015</xref>.</p><p>Strains transformed with pP<sub>MET3</sub>-CDC20-LEU2 (a gift from Ethel Queralt) were used for synchronization by metaphase arrest and release as follows. Early log cell cultures grown in synthetic medium lacking methionine at 23°C were arrested by addition of 2.5 mM methionine in order to repress <italic>CDC20</italic> and incubation was continued for 3 hr at 23°C. Uniform arrest was verified by microscopy. Cells were then harvested by centrifugation at 2000 rpm for 5 min at room temperature, rinsed twice and released by resuspending into synthetic medium lacking methionine at 23°C. Aliquots were collected every 15 min and processed for SIM. For inducible expression of non-degradable Sic1∆<sup>aa2-50</sup> under the <italic>GAL1</italic> promoter, cells were transformed with pLD1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Noton and Diffley, 2000</xref>) linearized with ApaI. Mid-log cells grown in raffinose-containing synthetic medium at 23°C were induced by addition of 3% galactose and aliquots removed and processed every half hour. Uniform arrest (until cells exhibited single elongated buds) was achieved after 3.5 hr. <italic>P<sub>MET3</sub>-CDC5</italic> cells expressing Nud1-HA<sub>3</sub> or Nud1<sup>7A</sup>-HA<sub>3</sub> at endogenous levels were grown to early log in synthetic medium without methionine at 30°C. Cultures were divided and their volume doubled with identical fresh medium without or supplemented with 2 mM methionine final concentration, respectively. After 3.5 hr at 30°C, uniform arrest due to depletion of Cdc5 was confirmed by microscopy analysis in the cultures supplemented with methionine. Cells were harvested, rinsed with ice-cold water and processed for protein extraction and western blot analysis. Depletion of Cdc5 using this construct causes a uniform arrest with a MEN phenotype (large budded cells with fully elongated spindles).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Wide-field fluorescence microscopy imaging and analysis</title><p>Images of cells coexpressing Spc72-GFP and Spc42-CFP (as reference) were acquired with a Nikon Eclipse E800 with a CFI Plan Apochromat 100x, NA 1.4 objective, a Chroma Technology CFP/YFP filter set and a Coolsnap-HQ CCD camera (Roper Scientific) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Guo and Segal, 2017</xref>) as five-plane Z-stacks of fluorescence images at a distance of 0.8 μm between planes with 2 × 2 binning, paired to a DIC image at the middle focal plane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Juanes et al., 2013</xref>). Stacks were processed into 2-color overlays of maximal intensity 2-D projections and analyzed with MetaMorph software (Molecular Devices). Linescans for fluorescence intensity along the spindle axis were generated with the line tool set to 3-pixel width and normalized intensity plots produced in Microsoft Excel. Integrated intensities were determined in a 7 × 7 pixel region and cell background subtracted for each channel. An asymmetry index was calculated as the absolute difference between the relative values at each SPB (i.e. Spc72/Spc42 intensity ratio) divided by the sum of the same values. The index ranged from 0 (absolute symmetry) to 1 (absolute asymmetry). Statistical analysis was carried out using GraphPad Prism and the open source package R. Boxplots depict 5th, 25th, 50th, 75th and 95th centiles with notches indicating the 95% confidence interval of the median.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>SIM imaging and analysis</title><p>Preparation of cell slides for SIM and image acquisition were according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Burns et al., 2015</xref>. Cells from early-log cultures grown at 22°C in synthetic complete medium supplemented with 0.1 g/L adenine were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (Ted Pella) in 100 mM sucrose for 15 min at room temperature and washed twice in phosphate-buffer saline, pH 7.4. An aliquot of cells was resuspended in Dako mounting media (Agilent Technologies, #S3023), placed on a cleaned number 1.5 coverslip, covered with a cleaned glass slide then allowed to cure overnight at room temperature.</p><p>SIM images were acquired with an Applied Precision OMX BLAZE (GE Healthcare) equipped with an Olympus 60 × 1.42 NA Plan Apo oil objective. Images were collected in sequential mode with two or three PCO Edge sCMOS cameras (Kelheim, Germany) for each acquisition channel. Color alignment from different cameras in the radial plane was performed using the color alignment slide from GE Healthcare. In the axial direction, color alignment was performed using 100 nm TetraSpeck beads (ThermoFisher, F8803). Reconstruction was accomplished with the softWoRx v6.52 software (GE Healthcare) according to manufacturer’s recommendations with a Wiener filter of 0.001. In most cases images are YFP/mT2 with 514 nm excitation for YFP and then 445 nm excitation for mT2. In some cases, we modified the protocol for mT2/YFP/mCherry acquisition with the mCherry acquired first and excited with the 568 nm laser. The dichroic in every case was 445/514/561 with emission filters at 460–485 nm, 530–552 nm and 590–628 nm for mT2, YFP and mCherry, respectively.</p><p>Three-dimensional analysis of SIM images was carried out using custom macros and plugins for the open source program FIJI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>). Plugins and source code are available for download at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://research.stowers.org/imagejplugins">http://research.stowers.org/imagejplugins</ext-link>. First, spots corresponding to unseparated or separated SPB pairs were manually identified based on a reference label (typically Spc42 or Nud1) and sorted for analysis of the query label according to the experiment. If the maximum SPB intensity was in the first or last slice for either query or reference label, the SPB was excluded from further analysis. Next, for unseparated SPB pairs, the two spots in the reference channel representing the SPB were fitted to two 3D-Gaussian functions and realigned along the axis between these functions using [jay_sim_fitting_macro_multicolor_profile.ijm]. The higher intensity spot was assigned as the old SPB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Burns et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Unruh et al., 2018</xref>). This realignment allowed the distribution of signal in the query channel to be analyzed against a single point of reference. For analysis of SPBs containing components of the γTC as the reference channel, the inner and outer plaque signal were selected, with the stronger signal assigned to the inner plaque (see Figure S1). These images were fitted to two 3D Gaussian functions and subject to realignment. In some cases, after realignment, images were averaged and scaled as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Burns et al., 2015</xref>), using [merge_all_stacks_jru_v1.ijm] then [stack_statistics_jru_v2.ijm]. Reconstructed images were scaled 4 × 4 with bilinear interpolation and presented as max projections in z over the relevant slices. After adjusting consistently brightness and contrast, and scaling to 8-bit image depth, cell images were incorporated into final figures using Adobe Illustrator.</p><p>SPB-SPB distances (referred to as SPB inter-distances) within cells were calculated after Gaussian fitting of the reference signal. Arbitrary boundaries along the spindle pathway were set according to the distribution of SPB inter-distances along the cell cycle measured in reference asynchronous cell populations labelled with Spc42-mTurquoise2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>) as follows:&lt;0.35 µm, unseparated SPBs;&lt;1 µm-long spindles; 1–2.5 µm-long spindles;&gt;2.5 µm elongated spindles. Additionally, distance distributions were assessed for conformity in each experiment. In the special case of analyses of γTC components with respect to the outer plaque component Spc72, SPBs were visually inspected and those in which inner and outer plaques overlapped vertically (as indicated by overlapping Spc72 and the sole γTC signals) were excluded from analysis, due to limited resolution in the z axis to assess inner and outer plaque signals. Similar considerations were applied when Tub4 label was quantified instead in reference to the core outer plaque component Nud1 in order to exclude SPBs presented in top view (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref> (using Nud1 as reference to include both old and new SPBs in this analysis), only ~12% of SPBs fell into this category. When indicated, an asymmetry index was derived from SIM data as the absolute difference between the intensity values of label at each SPB divided by the sum of the same values.</p><p>Linescan analysis along the IP-OP axis or the SPB-bridge axis was performed at 1–3- or 5-px width dependent on the experiment. When stated, normalization was carried out internally between maximal and minimal intensities in individual images or with respect to the indicated reference image in a set. Spindles were arbitrarily classified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>) according to the difference in label intensity between the SPBs as follows: ‘one pole’, label visible at one outer plaque only; ‘strongly asymmetric’, at least an 8-fold difference in label intensity between SPBs; ‘asymmetric’, between 8-fold and 1.3-fold difference; ‘symmetric’, less than 1.3-fold difference.</p><p>To directly compare Tub4 intensity in haploid and diploid cells, a haploid Tub4-mT2 Spc110-YFP strain was mixed with a Tub4-mT2/Tub4-mT2 diploid prior to imaging. After spot-fitting and realignment, images were assigned to the haploid or diploid group based on Spc110-YFP signal. Data from individual SPBs and averaged SPBs is shown.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Protein production and purification</title><p>Recombinant MBP fusions to Nud1 or Nud1<sup>7A</sup> were expressed from pMAL-c4X (New England Biolabs). Induction in Rosetta 2 cells (Novagen) was triggered with 0.5 mM IPTG followed by incubation at 16°C overnight. Cells were then harvested by centrifugation 10 min at 5000 rpm at 4°C and washed with ice-cold H<sub>2</sub>O. Frozen cell pellets were stored at −80°C. Bacterial cells were lysed by sonication and MBP fusions were purified onto amylose resin (New England Biolabs) as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Ten Hoopen et al., 2012</xref>). To elute MBP-fusion proteins, the resin-bound fraction was resuspended in 500 µl of elution buffer (20 mM TRIS pH 7.5, 200 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 10 mM mercaptoethanol + 30 mM Maltose) and incubated on a roller for 5–15 min at 4°C. This was repeated and successive eluates tested for protein presence. Fractions were pooled together and subject to dialysis in HKEG buffer (20 mM HEPES, 50 mM KCl, 1 mM EDTA, 5% Glycerol) using Maxi GeBaFlex-tube (Generon) at 4°C, concentrated by evaporation at 4°C and protein concentration evaluated by SDS-PAGE analysis against a BSA standard curve. Protein aliquots were stored frozen at −80°C.</p><p>Protein expression and purification from yeast was based on an auto-selection expression system previously developed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Geymonat et al., 2009</xref>). Cln2<sup>∆Nt</sup> and Clb5<sup>∆db</sup>, both stabilized versions of the cyclins Cln2 and Clb5, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hadwiger et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jacobson et al., 2000</xref>), were produced as GST or Twin-Strep-tag fusion proteins in the context of overexpressed Cdc28/Cks1. Briefly, PCR cassettes encoding the mutant cyclins along with gapped pMG1 or pMG6 expression vectors were used to transform the yeast expression host MGY70 (<italic>MAT a ura3-1 trp1-28 leu2</italic>Δ<italic>0 lys2 his7 mob1::kanR pep4::LEU2 [URA3-MOB1])</italic> or its derivative MGY139 (<italic>MATα ura3 trp1 his3 leu2 lys2∆0 pep4::LYS2 mob1::kanR cdc28::LEU2 [URA3-MOB1-CDC28])</italic> by gap-repair. Auto-selection for the expression construct is achieved by passage of the resulting transformants onto FOA medium to select for loss of the resident <italic>MOB1/CDC28</italic>-carrying plasmid. Proteins were induced in YEP-galactose (1% final) for 8 hr at 30°C. Cells were harvested and proteins purified on glutathione beads according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Geymonat et al., 2009</xref> or on Strep-Tactin XT resin (IBA) following manufacturer's instructions. CDK protein complexes were eluted with 20 mM reduced glutathione or 50 mM biotin, respectively and dialyzed overnight at 4°C in buffer A (Tris pH 7.5 20 mM, NaCl 150 mM, DTT 0.5 mM, glycerol 10%). Co-purification of Cdc28 and Cks1 was confirmed by SDS-PAGE and cyclins quantified by Coomassie blue staining against a BSA standard curve. Constructs encoding GST-Nud1 or GST-Nud1<sup>7A</sup> were also created by gap-repair of the pMG1 backbone in the yeast host MGY70. The resin-bound fraction was stored in 50% v/v glycerol at −20°C. MBP-Spc72 was expressed from the vector pMG3 in strain MGY853. MBP-Spc72 was eluted with 20 mM maltose and dialyzed o/n at 4°C in buffer A. Eluted proteins were quantified and stored at – 80°C.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Western blot analysis, kinase and binding assays</title><p>Expression level of Nud1-HA<sub>3</sub> and Nud1<sup>7A</sup>-HA<sub>3</sub> was determined by western blot analysis of whole cell extracts as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Ten Hoopen et al., 2012</xref>) using monoclonal antibody 12CA5 (Roche) at 1:1000 dilution and monoclonal antibody B-5-1-2 (Sigma) at 1:1000 dilution to detect α-tubulin as loading control.</p><p>4 µg of MBP-Nud1 or MBP-Nud<sup>7A</sup> were incubated 30 min at 30°C in the presence of 40 µM ATP, 2 µCi [γ-<sup>32</sup>P] ATP (3000 mCi/mmol; 10mCi/ml, Perkin-Elmer) and 19 ng of purified Strep-tag-Clb5<sup>∆db</sup>/Cdc28-as in kinase buffer (50 mM Tris pH 7.5, 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> and 1 mM DTT) in a final volume of 20 µl. When indicated, Cdc28-as was inhibited by addition of 5 µM 1NM-PP1. Reactions were stopped by addition of 5 µl of 5x Laemmli buffer followed by incubation at 95°C for 3 min. 10 µl- aliquots of phosphorylation reactions were analyzed on a 4–12% gradient SDS-PAGE gel and blotted to a PVDF membrane followed by autoradiography.</p><p>Equal amounts (~3–5 µg) of GST-Nud1 and GST-Nud1<sup>7A</sup> bound to beads (or Nud1<sup>(250-600)</sup> and Nud1<sup>4A(250-600)</sup>) were incubated for 1 hr at 37°C in a 200 µl reaction containing Strep-tag Clb5<sup>∆db</sup> and/or Cln2<sup>∆Nt</sup>/Cdc28/Cks1 (0.5–1 µg) and 1 mM ATP in kinase buffer (50 mM Tris pH 7.5, 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> and 1 mM DTT). Mock reactions were carried out in a 200 µl reaction containing kinase buffer only. Reactions were stopped by 3 washes of the beads with ice-cold washing buffer (50 mM Tris pH 7.5, 250 mM NaCl, 0.2% NP-40, 1 mM DTT). Beads were then resuspended in 300 µl of binding buffer (50 mM Tris pH7.5, 250 mM NaCl, 0.2% NP-40, 1 mM DTT, 1% BSA) containing 15 µg of purified MBP-Spc72 and incubated at 4°C for 2 hr on a roller. Beads were washed five times with washing buffer and bound proteins were eluted with 20 mM reduced glutathione. Eluted proteins were analyzed on a 6% SDS-PAGE gel followed by a western blot using monoclonal anti-GST (Abcam) or anti-MBP (New England Biolabs) at 1:1000 dilution to detect GST-Nud1 and MBP-Spc72, respectively. Since MBP-Spc72 and GST-Nud1 have approximate molecular mass of 130 kDa, eluted material was loaded in duplicate gels for western blot analysis and probed with α-MBP or α-GST antibodies, respectively.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We are grateful to Mark Winey for sharing data prior to publication and to Mark Longtine, John Kilmartin and Ethel Queralt for their gift of strains and constructs.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Anna Akhmanova as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As the editors have judged that your manuscript is of interest, but as described below that additional experiments are required before it is published, we would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Asymmetric inheritance of the centrosome has been linked to self-renewing stem cell divisions. The yeast spindle pole body (SPB), a centrosome-equivalent structure, is also inherited non-randomly, with the old SPB preferentially segregating to the new daughter cell. Different types of mechanisms that control this asymmetry have been proposed. In this study the authors corroborate that there is an inherent structural asymmetry based on Spc72 localization to the old SPB during the duplication stage and that the new SPB does not acquire Spc72 and nucleation complexes until later during mitotic spindle assembly. They show that the asymmetry is controlled by CDK-dependent phosphorylation of Nud1, which increases affinity for the nucleation complex receptor Spc72 and thus its preferential retainment at the old SPB during duplication. In addition, CDK is shown to control the ordered assembly of the new SPB, including the correct distribution of nucleation complexes to the cytoplasmic and nuclear faces of the SPB.</p><p>The reviewers were impressed with the beautiful SIM analysis supporting the SPB age/maturation hypothesis as mechanism underlying asymmetric inheritance. However, there was some concern regarding the phosphorylation-based mechanism as basis for asymmetry. The following issues should be addressed:</p><p>Main points:</p><p>1) It is clear that CDK plays an important role in SPB asymmetry and that Nud1 is a CDK substrate. However, whether Nud1 phosphorylation by CDK is critical for SPB asymmetry is less convincing. Considering that the impact of non-phosphorylatable <italic>Nud1<sup>7A</sup></italic> is relatively subtle (Figures 4D and 5F) the importance of Nud1 phosphorylation for asymmetry should be discussed without overstating it. The authors should also discuss the study by Lengefeld et al., 2018, and the differing view in this context in more detail.

Therefore, we state in the manuscript that <italic>nud1<sup>7A</sup></italic> did not fully recapitulate the loss of S-phase CDK thus implicating other substrates at the SPB or beyond (including a number of protein kinases known to phosphorylate Nud1 that require CDK for their activity).</p><p>However, what we found most unexpected and surprising was that this ~20% decrease in Spc72 asymmetry seen in unseparated SPBs in the <italic>nud1<sup>7A</sup></italic> mutant translated in substantial symmetry during spindle assembly, with both Spc72 and γTC detected at the new SPB in 100% of cells (Figure 5A-E). The increase in nucleation sites at the new SPB during spindle assembly is consistent with the perturbation to the program for establishment of spindle polarity and the modest but reproducible impact on the pattern of SPB inheritance. This finding highlights the central role that Nud1 plays in the control of spindle polarity by its involvement in astral microtubule (aMT) organisation via Spc72.</p><p>Our data both extends and contrasts to previous work in several ways. First, previous work from the Barral lab showed that a <italic>nud1<sup>ts</sup></italic> allele also randomised SPB inheritance pointing to the importance of Nud1 for this process. Yet their study linked instead Nud1 function to Kar9 (via Dbf2 activity at metaphase), suggesting that Nud1 functioned not through aMTs but through the Mitotic Exit Network (MEN). Later, the Amon lab showed that MEN activation is confined to a post-anaphase interval and does not control Kar9 polarity (Campbell et al., 2019). Thus, it was essential for us to revisit the role of Nud1 control of spindle polarity by its involvement in aMT organisation via Spc72 as part of our study of the intrinsic or built-in asymmetry.</p><p>The idea that spatial cues are integral to the program of spindle polarity in interplay with intrinsic SPB asymmetry is an important concept that has developed over several decades of research. Early studies from the Bloom lab showed that aMT asymmetry underlies spindle polarity —the old SPB that initially carries aMTs is destined to the bud (Shaw et al., 1997). Moreover, upon loss of Bud6 or Kar9 function through knockout, bud-ward fate is no longer linked to the pole first containing aMTs (Yeh et al., 2000) without otherwise preventing aMT asymmetry. It follows that age-dependent aMT asymmetry can only translate into differential SPB fate in the hands of cortical determinants, underscoring the instructive importance of spatial cues (for review see Geymonat and Segal, 2017). In other words, aMTs at the old SPB cannot dictate bud-ward targeting without the aid of spatial cues from the cell cortex. Both <italic>bud6∆</italic> and <italic>kar9∆</italic> mutants randomise the pattern of SPB inheritance, irrespective of intrinsic SPB identity, without negating the importance of the intrinsic pathway.</p><p>The Lengefeld et al. study claims that spatial cues are the sole contributors to instigate aMT asymmetry. While their observations are consistent with a large body of work showing that cortical cues are important for aMT asymmetry (see Juanes et al., 2013,; Cepeda-Garcia et al., 2010; Ten Hoopen et al., 2012; Huisman et al., 2004), their inference overlooks the established principle that cortical cues are necessary but not sufficient to link SPB age, identity and fate.</p><p>While we do not dispute the notion that intrinsic SPB asymmetry cannot translate into asymmetric fate without extrinsic polarity cues, we show the mechanistic basis for SPB and aMT asymmetry in this paper. Using the same genetic background as Lengefeld et al., we observe Spc72 asymmetry (Figure 1—figure supplement 5). Our ability to spatially resolve and visualize the outer plaque during SPB duplication/maturation in unperturbed cycling, wild-type cells distinguishes our work from that of Lengefeld et al. Further, we observe Spc72 asymmetry in four unrelated yeast genetic backgrounds (Figure 1—figure supplement 5). Taken together, our work strongly suggests that both Spc72 and γTC asymmetry is a general premise in the SPB duplication cycle.</p><p>To address the reviewers' comment we have edited the manuscript in order that the role of direct CDK phosphorylation of Nud1 not be overstated, in line with the evidence presented. The Discussion has been edited to better place our findings in the broader context including consideration of Lengefeld et al., 2018. Here we provide a brief overview on the role of cortical cues and their implications to the findings reported to fit within the space of the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Text/Figure improvements</p><p>Figures 1D-F</p><p>a) Figure 1D and the top row of Figure 1E both show that Spc72 is recruited to the new pole over time, and eventually reaches a symmetric distribution at both poles.
