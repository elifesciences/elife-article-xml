groups of functionally related neurons, including cranial motor neurons of the brainstem, are frequently organised as nuclei. The molecular mechanisms governing the emergence of nuclear topography and circuit function are poorly understood. Here we investigate the role of cadherin-mediated adhesion in the development of zebrafish ocular motor (sub)nuclei. We find that developing ocular motor (sub)nuclei differentially express classical cadherins. Perturbing cadherin function in these neurons results in distinct defects in neuronal positioning, including scattering of dorsal cells and defective contralateral migration of ventral subnuclei. In addition, we show that cadherin-mediated interactions between adjacent subnuclei are critical for subnucleus position. We also find that disrupting cadherin adhesivity in dorsal oculomotor neurons impairs the larval optokinetic reflex, suggesting that neuronal clustering is important for co-ordinating circuit function. Our findings reveal that cadherins regulate distinct aspects of cranial motor neuron positioning and establish subnuclear topography and motor function.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>ocular motor system</kwd><kwd>cell adhesion</kwd><kwd>cadherins</kwd><kwd>motor neuron</kwd><kwd>oculomotor</kwd><kwd>brainstem</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/J014567/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Knüfer</surname><given-names>Athene</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000522</institution-id><institution>Company of Biologists</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DEV-170218</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Knüfer</surname><given-names>Athene</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>102895/Z/13/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Clarke</surname><given-names>Jonathan DW</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MR/L020742/2</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Guthrie</surname><given-names>Sarah</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Cadherin-dependent cell adhesion controls the contralateral migration and clustering of ocular motor subpopulations and is required for the development of functional eye movements driven by those neurons.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>During vertebrate embryonic development, neurons within the CNS assemble into stereotyped anatomical structures, such as clusters or layers (laminae). Neurons which share common inputs and axonal outputs, including motor neurons of the brainstem and spinal cord, are often organised as coherent clusters of cells, termed nuclei. Despite their prevalence, little is known about the mechanisms regulating their development (nucleogenesis). The correct arrangement of motor neurons within nuclei is thought to be critical for multiple aspects of circuit formation, including muscle target innervation and acquisition of sensory inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Landmesser, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sürmeli et al., 2011</xref>). Consequently, understanding the molecular programmes that direct motor neuron positioning and assembly of functional neuromuscular circuits represents an important challenge.</p><p>In the brainstem, some cranial motor nuclei, such as the oculomotor nucleus and facial motor nucleus, can be further divided into subnuclei according to their efferent projections. Neurons that contribute axons to the same cranial nerve yet innervate different muscle targets exhibit stereotyped topography within the larger nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Greaney et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">McArthur and Fetcho, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barsh et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Isabella et al., 2020</xref>). To date, the molecular and cellular processes which give rise to subnuclear topography remain unknown. The positioning of some groups of motor neurons has been shown to be regulated by members of the classical cadherin superfamily of cell adhesion molecules, which include type I and type II cadherins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Price et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Demireva et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Astick et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dewitz et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dewitz et al., 2019</xref>). Differential expression of type II cadherins, which participate in homophilic as well as heterophilic interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Patel et al., 2006</xref>), drives the segregation and coalescence of somatomotor and branchiomotor neurons into discrete cranial motor nuclei in the hindbrain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Astick et al., 2014</xref>). Furthermore, cadherins participate in an intricate network of interactions with gap junctions and spontaneous activity, to regulate the emergence of mature topography in brainstem motor nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Montague et al., 2017</xref>). Although the role of cadherins in the segregation of different motor neuron subtypes has been investigated, their requirement for the development of subnuclear architecture or motor function is unclear.</p><p>The zebrafish ocular motor system, which comprises the oculomotor nucleus (nIII) of the midbrain, as well as the trochlear (nIV) and abducens nuclei (nVI) of the hindbrain, provides an unparalleled opportunity to address these questions. The anatomical layout of the system is well-conserved among vertebrates; together the three nuclei innervate six extraocular muscles responsible for coordinating important eye movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Graf and McGurk, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Evinger, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gilland and Baker, 2005</xref>). Four of these muscles are innervated by the four constituent subnuclei of nIII, whereas nIV and nVI each target a single muscle. Oculomotor subnuclei are known to exhibit spatial topography with respect to muscle target, segregated along the dorsoventral axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Greaney et al., 2017</xref>); in higher vertebrates, this organisation also extends to the visceral motor neurons of the Edinger-Westphal nucleus which is located dorsal to nIII (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hasan et al., 2010</xref>). Curiously, neurons belonging to the superior rectus (SR) subnucleus translocate their soma across the midline in an unusual migration to the contralateral side (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Puelles-Lopez et al., 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Naujoks-Manteuffel et al., 1991</xref>), giving rise to contralateral connectivity.</p><p>In this study, we utilise the fine-grained anatomy and precise motor behaviour mediated by the zebrafish ocular motor system to identify the contribution of cadherin-mediated adhesion to the emergence of subnuclear topography and circuit function in vivo. We find that nIII subnuclei differentially express repertoires of type I and type II cadherins. Cranial motor neuron-specific perturbation of cadherin function interferes with normal programmes of neuronal positioning specific to each subnucleus, such as the clustering of dorsal oculomotor neurons and contralateral migration of ventral SR neurons. We also find that neurons belonging to the adjacent IO subnucleus, in which cadherin function is unperturbed, are mispositioned, suggesting that cadherin-mediated interactions between subnuclei contribute to their normal positioning. Finally, we find that cadherin function in dorsal oculomotor neurons is required for the development of efficient eye movements, as perturbing cadherin adhesivity impairs the nasal eye movements of the oculomotor-driven optokinetic reflex (OKR) predictably. Our findings show that cadherins play a fundamental role in the assembly of cranial motor subnuclei and circuitry and may facilitate the integration of motor neurons into functional circuits by controlling their stereotyped positioning.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Developing ocular motor neurons differentially express cadherin combinations</title><p>In addition to their established roles in controlling motor neuron topography (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Price et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Astick et al., 2014</xref>), recent work indicates that type II cadherins act synergistically with the type I cadherin cdh2 (N-Cadherin) to control their precise positioning, although the exact mechanism remains unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dewitz et al., 2019</xref>). In order to determine whether type I and type II cadherins are plausible candidates to play a role in ocular motor neuron development, we assayed the expression of several cadherins in developing ocular motor neurons using RNAscope fluorescent in situ hybridisation. Cadherin transcript detection was performed in transgenic <italic>Isl1:GFP</italic> zebrafish embryos, in which the majority of ocular motor neurons, including trochlear (nIV) and most oculomotor (nIII) neurons are known to express GFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Higashijima et al., 2000</xref>). nIII neurons innervating the inferior oblique (IO) muscle, as well as abducens (nVI) motor neurons, lack GFP expression; we therefore focussed our analyses on nIII and nIV neurons which are GFP-positive.</p><p><italic>Isl1:GFP</italic> fluorescence was preserved following RNAscope processing, allowing expression of individual mRNAs to be examined in ocular motor neurons, which display a fanned arrangement during development, within the intact brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Due to the lack of subpopulation-specific markers, expression in nIII subnuclei was assayed based on their anatomical location, as neurons are generated and distributed along the dorsoventral (DV) axis stereotypically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Greaney et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–C</xref>). Whereas the dorsal portion of nIII contains motor neuron groups innervating the inferior rectus (IR) and medial rectus (MR) muscles, ventral (and medial) nIII predominantly contains superior rectus (SR)-innervating neurons, as well as inferior oblique (IO) neurons just lateral to these (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Greaney et al., 2017</xref>). Our data indicate that IO neurons are also found further dorsal, consistent with reports in other teleost species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Graf and McGurk, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Luiten and de Vlieger, 1978</xref>). Superior oblique (SO)-innervating neurons belonging to nIV are located proximal to and just rostral of nIII in rhombomere 1 (r1) of the hindbrain.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Differential expression of cadherin combinations in ocular motor neurons in <italic>Isl1:GFP</italic> zebrafish at 48 hpf.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Dorsal view of cranial motor neurons (green) and <italic>cdh8</italic> expression (magenta).

To evaluate cadherin expression, we quantified average fluorescence intensities for each probe within nIV (SO-innervating) and three defined anatomical regions of nIII: a ventral medial region (SR-innervating), and a dorsal lateral and a dorsal medial region (both IR/MR-innervating). At 48 hpf, ocular motor neurons expressed combinations of cadherins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–L</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B–D and F–G</xref>), and differential expression was observed between dorsal and ventral nIII subnuclei, as well as between nIII and nIV. Detection was highly specific, as in situ hybridisation with a negative control probe against the bacterial mRNA <italic>dapB</italic> revealed almost no signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A and E</xref>), whereas expression of the transcription factor <italic>foxg1a</italic> within the CNS was restricted to telencephalic regions consistent with its known expression pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Danesin et al., 2009</xref>). Previous work has shown that selectivity of adhesion between cell types can be achieved by discrete profiles of cadherin expression, as well as by varying levels of the same cadherin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Price et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Steinberg and Takeichi, 1994</xref>). We find that cadherin expression within ocular motor (sub)nuclei and surrounding non-motor neuron cell types varies both in intensity and spatial distribution. For example, expression of the type I cadherin <italic>cdh2</italic> (N-Cadherin) and type II cadherin <italic>cdh11</italic> was detected in all ocular motor neurons, displaying a broad and relatively uniform distribution across subnuclei, as well as cells immediately surrounding them, with <italic>cdh2</italic> displaying the highest levels of expression of all surveyed cadherins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D, H and L</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C and G</xref>). Based on anatomical location, GFP-negative IO neurons are therefore also likely to express <italic>cdh2</italic> and <italic>cdh11</italic>, in addition to GFP-expressing ocular motor neurons.</p><p>Other cadherins exhibited more restricted expression patterns, with the most marked differences observed between dorsal and ventral nIII.

In contrast, other cadherins were robustly expressed by all nIII neurons, but to varying degrees: expression of <italic>cdh8</italic> (type II; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F, J and L</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>) was far higher in ventral than in dorsal nIII, whereas <italic>cdh7a</italic> expression (type II; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B, F and L</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref>) was lower in ventral neurons compared to dorsolateral nIII neurons. In addition, we observed differences between dorsolateral and dorsomedial domains for some cadherins, including <italic>cdh7a</italic> and <italic>cdh8</italic>, although these tended to be smaller than those observed between dorsal and ventral domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1L</xref>). At 72 hpf, ocular motor neurons continued to express cadherin combinations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>), with continued broad CNS expression of <italic>cdh11</italic> and <italic>cdh2</italic>; cdh2 continued to be the most highly expressed cadherin across both nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3C, J and Q</xref>). Several cadherins showed higher overall expression in nIII compared to 48 hpf, most notably <italic>cdh4</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3D, K and Q</xref>) and <italic>cdh13</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3I, P and Q</xref>). Despite this, differential expression between dorsal and ventral nIII was maintained: expression of <italic>cdh10a</italic> remained absent from the most medial part of ventromedial nIII, resulting in lower levels of expression compared to dorsolateral nIII (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3G, N and Q</xref>), whereas expression of <italic>cdh8</italic> was higher compared to dorsal nIII (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3F, M and Q</xref>). IO neurons may also differentially express additional type II cadherins which display less uniform expression, although their lack of <italic>Isl1:GFP</italic> expression prevents us from evaluating this definitively. In sum, 2/7 cadherins surveyed showed general expression within ocular motor nuclei at both developmental stages, whereas the remaining cadherins displayed differential and dynamic expression across (sub)nuclei. These results reveal a complex organisation of cadherin expression in developing ocular motor neurons, whereby dorsal and ventral ocular motor subnuclei are defined by unique combinations of cadherin expression during the timeframe of nucleogenesis, and point to a role for both type I and type II cadherins in their development.</p><media id="video1" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-56725-video1.mp4"><label>Video 1.</label><caption><title>Expression of <italic>cdh8</italic> (magenta) in ocular motor neurons (green) in <italic>Tg(Isl1:GFP)</italic> embryo at 48 hpf in confocal z-stack.</title><p>Video displays z-stack moving from most ventral to dorsal and reveals high ventral expression.</p></caption></media><media id="video2" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-56725-video2.mp4"><label>Video 2.</label><caption><title>Expression of <italic>cdh7a</italic> (magenta) in ocular motor neurons (green) in <italic>Tg(Isl1:GFP)</italic> embryo at 48 hpf in confocal z-stack.</title><p>Video displays z-stack moving from most ventral to dorsal and reveals low ventral expression.</p></caption></media></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Perturbing cadherin function disrupts clustering of dorsal oculomotor neurons</title><p>As ocular motor neurons express a number of cadherins, we next sought to assay the role of cadherin expression during nucleogenesis by perturbing general cadherin adhesive function in cranial motor neurons in a stable transgenic line, Tg(<italic>isl1:cdh2ΔEC-mCherry</italic>)/Tg(<italic>Isl1:GFP</italic>), hereafter referred to as <italic>cdh2ΔEC.</italic> In this line, a dominant negative cadherin construct is expressed under the control of a cranial motor neuron-specific regulatory enhancer of the <italic>Isl1</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rebman et al., 2016</xref>).

Two main phenotypes were observed: Firstly, neurons were more sparsely distributed than their wild-type counterparts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C–D’</xref>). Secondly, they were often also scattered over a wider area, so that occasionally small groups of dorsal cells were found clustered a greater distance away from the rest of the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E–E’</xref>). Interestingly, the density and positioning of neurons located in ventromedial nIII was not perturbed. In order to measure the degree of dispersion, as well as the overall spatial extent of dorsal nIII neurons, three-dimensional cell coordinates were recorded for the dorsal half of nIII (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C–E’</xref>). The number of cells measured per side, per larva did not differ depending on the genotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>), suggesting that normal programmes of differentiation were unlikely to be affected following perturbation of cadherin function, recapitulating previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Astick et al., 2014</xref>).

We initially sought to characterise the time frame of zebrafish SR contralateral migration in early development. Using live time-lapse imaging of wild-type <italic>Isl1:GFP</italic> embryos, we found that bilateral ventral nIII neurons are initially separated at ~43.5 hpf and progressively converge towards the midline, until cells of either side are in contact from ~47 hpf. Using immunohistochemistry against GFP in order to examine their arrangement, we found that ventral nIII neurons are found interdigitated at the midline by 72 hpf, suggesting that migration is underway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). We estimate that SR neuron migration is complete by ~4 dpf based on contralateral cells counts following unilateral application of DiI to the orbit of fixed <italic>Isl1:GFP</italic> embryos of various developmental stages, (data not shown).</p><p>We next asked whether cadherin-adhesive function could play a role in regulating SR neuron migration by examining the organisation of ventral nIII neurons at the midline at 50 hpf, when midline convergence is usually complete. Whereas wild-type ventral nIII neurons were found fully interdigitated at the midline in the majority of embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), only a few <italic>cdh2ΔEC-</italic>expressing neurons had successfully converged, leaving a gap between large numbers of cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). In order to quantify the degree of midline convergence, we measured the area of GFP fluorescence present in a single sagittal section directly at the midline, obtained from resliced z-stacks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E–G</xref>). This was always seen as one large area rather than multiple smaller spots (irrespective of genotype), indicating that cells move towards the midline in a collective fashion. There was a significant decrease in the area of GFP fluorescence imaged in <italic>cdh2ΔEC</italic> embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F and G</xref>) compared to wild types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>), whereas no difference was detected in the total numbers of nIII neurons between them. This suggests that the convergence of SR neurons towards the midline is perturbed in <italic>cdh2ΔEC</italic> embryos, which is unlikely to be due to delayed neurogenesis. Interestingly, our live imaging experiments at 72 hpf show that <italic>cdh2ΔEC</italic>-expressing SR neurons eventually reach the midline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and D–E</xref>). Overall, these results indicate that perturbing cadherin function delays, but does not prevent, the convergence of SR neurons towards the midline.</p><p>We next sought to investigate whether cadherin adhesivity regulates later stages of contralateral migration, during which SR neurons cross the midline and migrate into the contralateral nucleus. Using unilateral application of DiI to the oculomotor nerve of fixed larvae at 5 dpf, we labelled groups of contralateral oculomotor neurons in wild types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I–I’</xref>); however, in <italic>cdh2ΔEC</italic> larvae, nIII-labelled neurons were only found on the ipsilateral side (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J–J’</xref>), suggesting that contralateral migration is abolished following the loss of cadherin adhesion. In order to examine the distribution of SR neurons in greater detail, we adopted a sparse labelling approach at the same developmental stage. Using unilateral retro-orbital dye fills, oculomotor neurons of <italic>Isl1:GFP</italic> larvae can be traced from their muscle targets and assigned a subnuclear identity based on presence (or absence) of GFP fluorescence and anatomical location (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Greaney et al., 2017</xref>). Live imaging revealed dye-filled GFP-positive (SR) cells on the contralateral side in wild types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3K–K’’</xref>), whereas there was a dramatic reduction in the number of contralateral cells labelled in <italic>cdh2ΔEC</italic> larvae, despite successful labelling of ipsilateral neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3L–L’’</xref>). Examination of the pooled data revealed a significant relationship between genotype and subnuclear identity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3M</xref>). There was a significant reduction in the proportion of contralateral GFP-positive nIII cells in <italic>cdh2ΔEC</italic> larvae compared to wild types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3N</xref>), with 15/16 larvae exhibiting proportions of &lt;5% of labelled SR neurons compared with 10/15 wild-type larvae, which had proportions of &gt;5% ranging up to 65%. We reasoned that there should be a concomitant increase in the proportions of dye-filled ipsilateral GFP-positive cells, should <italic>cdh2ΔEC</italic> expression have interfered with the ability of SR neurons to migrate. Indeed, there was a significant increase in the proportion of ipsilateral GFP-positive cells in <italic>cdh2ΔEC</italic> larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3O</xref>), which likely reflects the additional detection of SR neurons which have failed to migrate to the contralateral side, in addition to IR/MR cells. In contrast, we found no difference in the proportions of dye-filled IO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3P</xref>) or SO/nIV neurons between genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3Q</xref>). Taken together, our results indicate that the contralateral migration of SR neurons depends on cadherin-mediated adhesion. Our finding that SR neurons with perturbed cadherin adhesivity eventually reach the midline, but do not cross it, suggests that contralateral migration proceeds via a two-phase process: an initial convergence towards the midline, followed by somal translocation across it.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Dominant negative cadherin expression results in mispositioning of trochlear neurons along the dorsoventral axis</title><p>In addition to nIII, the trochlear nucleus (nIV), which is located proximal to nIII in r1 of the hindbrain is labelled in <italic>Isl1:GFP</italic> fish.

This revealed that the overall cellular distribution for IO neurons was significantly different between genotypes (k = 0.2427, p&lt;0.0001). In wild types, probabilities of IO location are biased towards medial locations and are found along the DV axis, with slightly higher probabilities for dorsal regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). In <italic>cdh2ΔEC</italic> larvae, reduced dorsal and slightly more lateral probabilities were observed for IO neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C–D</xref>); however, the overall arrangement of IO neurons as a subnucleus appeared similar. In order to estimate the full extent of IO neuron distribution, we used a non-parametric Bayesian approach where the probability of a neuron to be placed in any of the 60 bins in the grid is described as a Dirichlet distribution, which is then estimated by performing statistical inference from the observed data. Estimated DV-ML occupancy distributions confirmed differences in the overall spatial distribution of IO neurons between genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E–G</xref>). We investigated the directionality of the shift along the two major axes and found an overall tendency towards higher, dorsal values for DV subdivision in wild types compared to <italic>cdh2ΔEC</italic> larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>). Additionally, there was a slight tendency overall to lower, medial values for wild types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I</xref>). This demonstrates that overall, the positioning of IO neurons of <italic>cdh2ΔEC</italic> larvae is altered compared to wild types: IO neurons are located more ventral and lateral, consistent with a shift away from adjacent IR/MR and SR subnuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J–K</xref>). In sum, these results suggest that cadherin-dependent neuron-neuron adhesive interactions between oculomotor subnuclei also contribute to the appropriate positioning of the IO subnucleus. However, we cannot rule out an alternative possibility that the observed shift in IO subnucleus position could also be a mechanically driven consequence of changes to the arrangement of the other oculomotor subnuclei; novel tools to target expression of <italic>cdh2ΔEC</italic> to IO neurons specifically would allow us to address this possibility definitively.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Neuromuscular connectivity is preserved in <italic>cdh2ΔEC</italic>-expressing ocular motor neurons</title><p>Whereas some studies report that perturbations to cadherin signalling in hindbrain cranial motor neurons affect the positioning of soma, while preserving stereotyped patterns of axon outgrowth and pathfinding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Astick et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rebman et al., 2016</xref>), others have identified a role for specific classical cadherins in the regulation of normal axonal development in motor neurons, including pathfinding, axon outgrowth and branching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brusés, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barnes et al., 2010</xref>).

We have previously shown that synaptogenesis is underway in all muscles from 72 hpf (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Clark et al., 2013</xref>), correlating with the onset of spontaneous saccadic eye movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Easter and Nicola, 1997</xref>). We next asked whether cadherin function could be required for the formation of NMJs. Cadherins have known roles in the formation of central synapses (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Salinas and Price, 2005</xref>) and cdh2 is known to localise at developing NMJs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cifuentes-Diaz et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brusés, 2011</xref>). We performed immunohistochemistry against the presynaptic vesicle protein SV2 and labelling of postsynaptic acetylcholine receptors using fluorescently tagged α-bungarotoxin at 4 dpf and identified extraocular NMJs according to their spatial location using brightfield signal. We found that pre- and postsynaptic components colocalise as discrete patches on respective EOMs both in wild types and <italic>cdh2ΔEC</italic> larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A–H’’</xref>), including on the medial rectus (MR) muscle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D–G’’</xref>), which is one of two muscles driving horizontal eye movements of the larval optokinetic reflex.

However, we cannot exclude an effect on synapse stabilisation at later stages of development or in the regulation of synaptic strength. Taken together, our findings suggest that perturbing cadherin function does not erode the peripheral connection between ocular motor neurons and muscle targets.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Abrogating cadherin function in developing oculomotor neurons causes eye movement defects</title><p>We next considered whether perturbing cadherin-mediated adhesion in oculomotor neurons could impact their emergent motor function by assaying the larval optokinetic reflex (OKR). The OKR is a well-conserved gaze-stabilising reflex which consists of slow-phase and fast reset eye movements in response to optic flow. In zebrafish, the OKR is robust by 3–4 dpf (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Easter and Nicola, 1997</xref>). We measured the OKR of immobilised zebrafish at 5 dpf by capturing the eye movements of larvae, which were placed within a circular arena, from above with a high-speed video camera as they viewed vertical black and white moving bars of varying speed, contrast, and spatial frequency. The horizontal eye movements of the OKR rely on the action of two antagonistic EOMs, the oculomotor-driven medial rectus and abducens nucleus-controlled lateral rectus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). These muscles drive nasal (adduction) and temporal (abduction) eye movements, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A–A’</xref>). As nVI neurons of <italic>cdh2ΔEC</italic> larvae do not express <italic>cdh2ΔEC</italic>, expression is restricted to MR neurons which are known to be contained within dorsal nIII and display a severely scattered phenotype in <italic>cdh2ΔEC</italic> larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).

We found that <italic>cdh2ΔEC</italic> larvae displayed severe defects in the efficiency of their nasal eye movements when compared to wild types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>), exhibiting a significant decrease in the eye gain for both eyes across all trials, with the strongest effect seen for the strong eye.

Taken together, these data show that the efficiency of nasal eye movements (mediated by the MR muscle) as well as overall range of movement is significantly impaired in larvae in which cadherin-mediated adhesion in oculomotor neurons is reduced. Our finding that the temporal eye movements of the OKR are not impaired is consistent with a specific effect of <italic>cdh2ΔEC</italic> expression on MR-driven motor control rather than visual impairment and suggests that the clustered arrangement of these neurons is important for the function of the motor circuit.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we investigated the role of cadherin-mediated adhesion in the development of subnuclear topography, a unique phenomenon whereby clusters of neurons innervating functionally-related muscles via distinct nerve branches further group together, and its effect on motor function. We demonstrate that cadherins control distinct aspects of cranial motor neuron positioning, including the clustering of neurons belonging to dorsal oculomotor subnuclei and the contralateral migration of ventral SR neurons, while also regulating subnuclear position through adhesive interactions between constituent oculomotor subnuclei. In addition, we find that eye movements driven by oculomotor neurons in which clustering is perturbed are defective, raising the possibility that their assembly into nuclei is important for circuit function.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Cadherins play roles in the development of specific subnuclei</title><p>Our findings show that cadherin-based interactions likely coordinate the positioning of motor neurons both <italic>within</italic> and <italic>between</italic> subnuclei. This is evidenced by the observations that dorsal nIII (IR/MR) and ventral (SR) neurons display differential positioning defects when cadherin function is disrupted in these subnuclei, and that the location of the adjacent IO subnucleus is shifted following this perturbation. It has previously been proposed that cadherins globally expressed by motor neurons provide a baseline level of adhesion, while selective expression of other cadherins facilitates their sorting into distinct nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Demireva et al., 2011</xref>). We find that several cadherins, including <italic>cdh2</italic> and <italic>cdh11</italic>, are expressed by all subnuclei, highlighting them as prime candidates to drive baseline levels of adhesion via homophilic interactions. Recent work raises the possibility that heterophilic interactions between type II cadherins belonging to specificity groups, such as <italic>cdh8</italic> (expressed to varying degrees by IR/MR and SR) and <italic>cdh11</italic> (expressed by all ocular motor neurons), could also participate, in collaboration with <italic>cdh2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brasch et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dewitz et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Although we find that that the clustering of dorsal nIII neurons requires cadherin adhesivity, as previously shown for other cranial motor nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Astick et al., 2014</xref>), ventral SR neurons do not appear to depend on cadherin function in the same way – here cadherins regulate transmedial migration. Dorsal nIII neurons, which are generated earlier and migrate dorsally, express additional cadherins during development. As such, their coalescence may be more cadherin-dependent. In addition, dorsal subnuclei differentially express several classical cadherins, including <italic>cdh4</italic> and <italic>cdh10a</italic>. In the future, defining the unique transcriptional identities of individual nIII subnuclei would allow us to manipulate cadherin expression profiles will allow us to uncover the specific roles of these cadherins.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Contralateral migration of SR neurons</title><p>SR-innervating oculomotor neurons are one of a small number of neuronal cell types known to complete transmedial migration during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Simon and Lumsden, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Taniguchi et al., 2002</xref>). We identify cadherins as one of the few molecular factors regulating this distinctive migration. Our analyses show that they facilitate the timely convergence of SR neurons towards the midline and are required for their subsequent ability to cross it, suggesting that contralateral migration occurs in two steps. Cadherins are known to contribute to cell migration by coupling to retrograde actin flow, thereby acting as a molecular clutch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bard et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Garcia et al., 2015</xref>). This constitutes one possible mechanism by which cadherins facilitate the movement of SR neurons across the midline; whether the migration is driven by multiple cadherins or a single cadherin such as <italic>cdh2</italic>, such as in the case of tangential migration of facial branchiomotor neurons, is unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wanner and Prince, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rebman et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>SR migration is underlain by tight spatial and temporal control gated by Slit/Robo-mediated repulsion from the midline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bjorke et al., 2016</xref>), while midbrain dopaminergic neurons have been proposed as a possible source of chemoattractants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Puelles, 1978</xref>). Expression of Neuropilins and their class III Semaphorin ligands is dynamic and differential during nIII development, suggesting that the timing of SR migration depends on these cues and receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chilton and Guthrie, 2003</xref>). While exact roles are yet to be established experimentally, the dynamic expression of receptors could mean that they are downregulated at the time at which migration is usually complete. Delayed convergence resulting from perturbed cadherin-mediated adhesion could therefore affect the ability of SR neurons to respond to guidance cues at the appropriate time. What is the importance of SR contralateral migration for circuit function? The organisation of ocular motor circuitry is highly stereotyped, whereby motor neuron groups controlling coactive muscle pairs on opposite sides of the body are found on the same side of the brain. The failure of SR neurons to complete contralateral migration is likely to be detrimental to motor function, as contralateral innervation of the SR muscle is key to the vertical eye movements of the gaze-stabilising vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Schoppik et al., 2017</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Role of cadherins in the development of motor circuit function</title><p>Our data show that although the nasal OKR is significantly perturbed when cadherin-mediated adhesion is reduced, the peripheral connection between motor neuron and muscle is left intact, suggesting that these deficits arise as a result of impaired central connectivity of dorsal MR neurons, which fail to coalesce. How might the stereotyped positioning of MR neurons driven by cadherins serve circuit function? MR neurons receive inputs from abducens internuclear neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cabrera et al., 1992</xref>), which coordinate conjugate eye movements and could plausibly rely on correct MR neuron positioning for targeting. Whereas IR and SR neurons are innervated by central vestibular neurons, which in lateral-eyed vertebrates drive the torsional and vertical eye movements of the VOR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bianco et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Schoppik et al., 2017</xref>), these neurons may utilise a similar mechanism to connect to their oculomotor neuron partners. It would therefore be interesting to test whether the mispositioning of dorsal oculomotor neurons observed as a result of cadherin perturbation leads to a failure of presynaptic populations to correctly innervate their targets. Equally, if SR neurons which have failed to migrate across the midline were now innervated by central vestibular neurons that would usually synapse onto their contralateral counterparts, one might expect defects in the vertical component of the VOR. Together, these experiments would provide compelling evidence that spatial positioning is a major developmental strategy enabling oculomotor neurons to acquire the correct afferent input.</p><p>Indeed, previous studies indicate that somal positioning is crucial for arriving sensory afferents: in the mammalian spinal cord, clustering and correct positioning of motor neurons along the dorsoventral axis ensures input specificity and correct motor functioning; similar organisational principles also extend to premotor interneurons which segregate along the mediolateral axis according to their antagonistic output (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sürmeli et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tripodi et al., 2011</xref>). In contrast, respiratory behaviours driven by zebrafish facial branchiomotor neurons appear to be robust to manipulations that shift their rostrocaudal location but do not otherwise alter their subnuclear topography, suggesting that they still receive inputs despite perturbed positioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">McArthur and Fetcho, 2017</xref>). As such, some aspects of positioning may be more important for the acquisition of input than others.</p><p>In addition to controlling somal location, one further possible mechanism to mediate the effect of cadherins on larval eye movements could relate to findings that cadherin-dependent clustering of motor neurons underlies the development of gap junction coupling and spontaneous activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Montague et al., 2017</xref>), both of which are known to contribute to mature activity patterns required for motor control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Warp et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chang et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Korn and Bennett, 1975</xref>). Cadherins may also contribute to selective molecular recognition between neurons within sensorimotor circuits, indeed type II cadherin expression has been shown to delineate functional circuits and control diverse cellular interactions throughout the CNS (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Redies, 2000</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Basu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Friedman et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Duan et al., 2018</xref>). Circuit function may therefore depend on classical cadherins both for the coordination of cell body positioning, placing critical spatial constraints on connectivity between pre- and postsynaptic partners, and for specificity at the level of central synapses between motor neurons and their inputs.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Importance of subnuclear topography</title><p>Our data show that cadherin-based interactions between subnuclei control the global positioning of a single oculomotor subnucleus, in addition to those which drive the precise positioning of neurons within individual subnuclei. What is the advantage of subnuclear topography? In the mammalian spinal cord, the layout of somatic motor neurons adheres to a higher order spatial plan, whereby pools innervating functionally related limb muscles are further grouped into columns along the dorsoventral axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Romanes, 1964</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Vanderhorst and Holstege, 1997</xref>). An analogous organisational hierarchy may be present in the brainstem, where some cranial motor nuclei are composed of adherent subnuclei which innervate muscles with synergistic functions. With the exception of the MR subnucleus, which receives input from abducens internuclear neurons, oculomotor subnuclei innervating related muscle pairs receive inputs from the same population of central vestibular neurons, which participate either in the torsional upward (IO-SR) or downward (SO-IR) eye movements of the VOR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bianco et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Schoppik et al., 2017</xref>). The grouping of these subnuclei may therefore represent an efficient developmental strategy by which functionally related neuronal populations acquire inputs from interneurons which drive reflex circuits. The multi-layered organisation of motor neurons is therefore likely to have important implications for the development of connectivity. During nucleogenesis, classical cadherins are likely to co-participate with several other cell adhesive systems to give rise to the stereotyped anatomical arrangement of ocular motor subnuclei. Other studies have highlighted roles for protocadherins, as well as nectin-afadin signalling in the positional control of developing motor neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dewitz et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Asakawa and Kawakami, 2018</xref>). Our analyses reveal the complexity of motor neuron positioning programmes regulated by a single molecular family within a functional motor circuit. The precise anatomy, robust function, and tractability of the zebrafish ocular motor system make it uniquely suited for further investigations into the structure-function relationships underlying circuit formation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table

Specimens were then carefully placed in a small petri dish with a sylgard-coated bottom containing PBS and secured with the eye facing up using a Tungsten minuten pin. The eye was carefully removed from the orbit with sharp forceps and DiI (D3911, Invitrogen) was applied to the tissue at the corner of the orbit, where the oculomotor and trochlear nerves enter, using a blunt microinjection needle held by a micromanipulator. DiI was left to bind to the tissue for 3–5 min, after which embryos were stored overnight in PBS at 4°C. The following day, brains were dissected from whole larvae and mounted for imaging. For live retro-orbital dye fills, ocular motor nuclei were retrogradely labelled as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Greaney et al., 2017</xref>). Crystallised fluorescently-conjugated Alexa Fluor 647 dye (10,000 molecular weight, Thermo Fisher D-22914) was applied unilaterally to the orbit of anesthetised fish at four dpf and the side of incision and dye application was recorded for each larva.

The SO-innervating nIV is visible as a discrete nucleus separated from nIII by the midbrain-hindbrain boundary (MHB), therefore contralateral dye-filled nIV neurons are easily distinguished from nIII neurons. Contralateral GFP-positive neurons belonging to nIII are therefore classified as SR neurons. Dye-filled ipsilateral neurons are therefore assigned based on presence or absence of GFP fluorescence: GFP-negative neurons belong to the IO subnucleus, whereas GFP-positive neurons are IR/MR neurons.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Microscopy and image analysis</title><p>For all in vivo and ex vivo preparations, embryos were mounted in 1% low-melting point (LMP) agarose and imaging was performed on a Zeiss LSM880 Laser Scanning confocal microscope with a 20x (NA 0.95) water-immersion objective.

For image analysis, Fiji/Image J (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_002285">SCR_002285</ext-link>) and Imaris 9 (Bitplane; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_007370">SCR_007370</ext-link>) software was used.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Analysis of cadherin expression using RNAscope in situ hybridisation</title><p>For quantification of RNAscope in situ hybridisation fluorescent signal of <italic>Isl1:GFP</italic> embryos/larvae, the GFP signal was thresholded to select nIII and nIV using the Imaris Absolute Intensity thresholding function and subsequently used to obtain a masked ATTO 550 channel. For quantification of ATTO 550 fluorescence within nIV and the three defined anatomical regions of nIII, five equally spaced slices along the dorsoventral (DV) axis were selected from each substack (excluding the first and last slice). Regions of interest (ROIs) were selected using the GFP signal and the mean grey value of ATTO 550 fluorescence was measured within ROIs for each slice. Average background fluorescence was computed for each specimen by measuring and subsequently averaging the mean grey value of ATTO 550 fluorescence within three GFP-positive ROIs within sections of the ocular motor nerves that did not contain visible ATTO 550-positive puncta. Measurements for each slice were performed on both sides on either side of the midline and corrected by subtracting the average background mean grey value, prior to averaging within each specimen. Each probe was quantified in three independent embryos/larvae.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Analysis of dorsal oculomotor neuron clustering</title><p>Dorsal oculomotor neurons were defined as neurons located in the dorsal half of the oculomotor nucleus as ascertained by finding the first and last optical section in the z-stack.

Motor neuron identity was assigned using simultaneous visualisation of confocal z-stacks in Imaris 9 (Bitplane; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_007370">SCR_007370</ext-link>) and Fiji/Image J (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_002285">SCR_002285</ext-link>) and cells were only counted which revealed a smooth distribution of dextran labelling. Cell locations were recorded using the Cell Counter functionality in Fiji/Image J (Kurt de Vos, University of Sheffield) while 3D-visualisation in Imaris 9 (Bitplane; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_007370">SCR_007370</ext-link>) was employed to distinguish between GFP-positive and -negative cells. The use of interactive 3D-visualisation in Imaris 9 offered considerable advantages to 2D-visualisation when distinguishing dimly fluorescent GFP-positive, dye-filled neurons from GFP-negative, dye-filled neurons. Adjustments to brightness and contrast using the Imaris Display Adjustment function revealed that the former possessed cell-shaped GFP signal which could be visualised from different angles, while the latter had no or only unstructured and noisy contaminating GFP signal from adjacent neurons.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Analysis of spatial distribution of IO cells</title><p>Confocal z-stacks were split into 15 and 4 equally spaced dorsoventral (DV) and mediolateral (ML) subdivisions (<italic>z0</italic> to <italic>z14</italic>, ventral to dorsal; <italic>x0</italic> to <italic>x3</italic>, medial to lateral) per larva. This was based on the first and last GFP- or Alx647-positive nIII cell for DV subdivisions and on the distance between the lateral most nIII cell and the midline for ML subdivisions. Each ipsilateral GFP-negative dye-filled neuron was assigned a DV and ML coordinate based on location. We adopted a Bayesian approach to provide a non-parametric characterisation of the spatial distribution of IO neurons. We attributed an occupancy probability to each of the <italic>K</italic> = 15×4 mutually exclusive bins across DV and ML axes. Occupancy probabilities were modelled by a Dirichlet distribution with corresponding parameters estimated from the observed data using statistical inference. We used custom R scripts employing the JAGS library (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_017573">SCR_017573</ext-link>) to draw 20,000 Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) samples from the posterior distribution of the occupation probabilities, code available on GitHub (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/giovannidiana/MN_topo">https://github.com/giovannidiana/MN_topo</ext-link>). This method allowed us to estimate average occupancy distributions as well as confidence intervals. To examine the overall difference between the posterior distributions of IO neuron location between genotypes, we estimated the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between their occupancy distributions across the MCMC samples. To choose a sufficient number of posterior samples we used the stability of the posterior <italic>KL</italic> distribution as convergence criterion. The directionality of shifts in IO location between genotypes along DV (<italic>z-shift</italic>) and ML (<italic>x-shift</italic>) axes was computed by calculating the difference between the average DV and ML positions from the occupancy probabilities of each genotype (e.g. <italic>z_shift</italic> = <italic>z_shift_wt – z_shift_cdh2ΔEC)</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Analysis of axon pathways and neuromuscular junctions</title><p>For analysis of ocular motor axons, FIJI Cell Counter plugin was used to manually count numbers of axon branches for each target muscle in confocal z-stacks. Branches were counted within a 50 μm x 50 μm window. All branches were counted if they (a) innervated a target muscle or (b) emerged as secondary processes from a branch innervating a target muscle. Branch width was not considered. For analysis of NMJs, synaptic sites were identified based on their anatomical location in the orbit using brightfield signal. Colocalisation of pre-synaptic and post-synaptic components was performed on ROIs of substacks taken from larger confocal z-stacks.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Optokinetic reflex (OKR) assay and analysis</title><p>Horizontal eye movements were assayed at five dpf using a custom-built apparatus similar in design to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brockerhoff, 2006</xref> and controlled using custom LabView (National Instruments, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_014325">SCR_014325</ext-link>) routines. Larvae were mounted singly in a small drop of 2% LMP agarose (A9414, Sigma) with the dorsal side up, in the middle of a 35 mm non-treated petri dish, to which 1x Danieau solution was added. For OKR recordings, we used a projector (AAXA P2 Jr) and a cold mirror (Thorlabs) to project vertical stripes onto a cylindrical screen. Larvae were positioned in the centre of this screen. A 850 nm LED array illuminated the fish from below. Imaging was performed at 100 Hz using a camera (Thorlabs) fitted with a machine vision lens and a filter (R72 52 mm HOYA) to block visible light. Each larva was presented with a horizontally moving vertical grating of varying stimulus parameters, including varying speeds, spatial frequency and contrast using Psychophysics Toolbox (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brainard, 1997</xref>). Gratings reversed direction every 6 s. Eye position was tracked online by thresholding images and computing the central moments of the two largest binary objects, which invariably corresponded to the eyes. The gain of OKR slow-phase movements was quantified separately for left and right eyes as well as for nasal and temporal directions, as the ratio of eye velocity to grating velocity (custom MATLAB scripts). The range of eye movement (from the resting position of the eye towards rostral or caudal positions in degrees) was evaluated as the maximum/minimum position for each eye. Strong and weak eyes for each larva were assigned based on the eye displaying the greatest eye range.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Quantification and statistical analysis</title><p>All standard statistical analyses were performed in Prism7 (Graphpad; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_002798">SCR_002798</ext-link>) or MATLAB (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_00162">SCR_00162</ext-link>). For normally distributed data, parametric tests were used to make statistical comparisons between groups. For one or more independent groups, Welch’s t-tests (with the Holm-Sidak method for multiple comparisons, where applicable) were used. For non-normally distributed data, non-parametric tests were used to make statistical comparisons between groups. For two independent groups, the Mann-Whitney U test was used. For multidimensional data, a multivariate extension of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was applied. In order to assess differences between experimental conditions with categorical outcomes, chi-squared-tests were used. Bayesian statistics were applied to perform non-parametric estimation of the spatial organisation of IO neurons. Wherever possible, analyses were performed blind. For behavioural experiments, the number of experimental animals per group was chosen to approximate or slightly exceed that of previously published studies employing a similar experimental design (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Schoonheim et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bianco et al., 2012</xref>).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Corinne Houart for giving us the <italic>foxg1a</italic> probe for in situ hybridisation, David Schoppik for assistance with the retro-orbital dye fill technique, Isaac Bianco and Ivana Poparic for initial assistance with the OKR assay and Stephen Price for valuable advice and discussion.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Marianne Bronner as the Senior and Reviewing Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Kimberly McArthur (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, when editors judge that a submitted work as a whole belongs in <italic>eLife</italic> but that some conclusions require a modest amount of additional new data, as they do with your paper, we are asking that the manuscript be revised to either limit claims to those supported by data in hand, or to explicitly state that the relevant conclusions require additional supporting data.</p><p>Our expectation is that the authors will eventually carry out the additional experiments and report on how they affect the relevant conclusions either in a preprint on bioRxiv or medRxiv, or if appropriate, as a Research Advance in <italic>eLife</italic>, either of which would be linked to the original paper.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This nicely written and generally well-presented study uses the zebrafish model's advantages to integrate an investigation of the molecular basis of nucleogenesis with behavioral output.

Sometimes, motor neurons form sub-nuclei that innervate distinct the muscle targets of a motor single nerve. This paper focuses on the oculomotor neurons which form three distinct sub-clusters, asking: what the molecular mechanism of sub-cluster formation? The authors start by describing the expression of a number of type-I and type-II cadherins in the oculomotor and nearby trochlear nuclei. Then they use isl1 to drive dominant-negative form of <italic>Cdh2</italic> to block all cadherin adhesive function in motor neurons in a stable transgenic line and describe the consequences on oculomotor sub-nuclear organization. They observe a looser, scattered organization and a failure of DN-expressing neurons to complete a characteristic cross-midline migration, which they detect using retrograde labeling. They also observe a subtle mispositioning of DN-expressing trochlear neurons, and even more subtle non-autonomous effect on the positions of inferior-oblique innervating neurons. Finally, they show a specific defect in the eye movements driven by oculomotor neurons in an optokinetic response assay.</p><p>While the findings are clearly presented and meticulously quantified, the use of a single, blunt instrument (<italic>cdh2ΔEC</italic>) is insufficient to understand the function of cadherin-based adhesion in nucleogenesis. That cadherin-based adhesion is important for motor neuron segregation into nuclei is not unexpected, since these and other authors have shown it to be the case for other cranial and spinal motor nuclei. The more mechanistic questions-about which cadherins cause the segregation of which motor neurons from each other and/or from other cells in their environment, and at what stage of motor neuron development this happens-are not addressed using this one tool. Consequently, I feel that the paper does not constitute enough of an advance to be appropriate for publication in <italic>ELife</italic>.</p><p>Figure 1: The authors schematize cadherin expression in a pseudo-quantitative format in Figure 1B, C. Despite their skillful quantification of phenotypes in the rest of the paper, this map appears to be qualitative, and does not always appear to match the representative figures. Furthermore, not all representative images used to generate this map are shown. For instance, transverse images are not shown for the genes analyzed in Figure 1—figure supplement 1 and Figure 1—figure supplement 2. These should be included. For instance, for <italic>cdh4</italic> the authors indicate different expression levels between the ventral/medial and dorsal/medial domains, and similar expression levels between the dorsal/medial and dorsal/lateral domains, neither of which appear consistent with the image in Figure 1I. This map could be improved by quantitative measurement of fluorescence levels in the three domains in their 3D images across multiple animals. If the font sizes in the schematic are based on pixel intensities in the various motor nucleus regions, how many embryos were used? In some cases, expression is not bilaterally symmetric, for example in the dorsal view of <italic>cdh10a</italic>. Is this asymmetry consistent from embryo to embryo?</p><p>Figure 1: the evaluation of cadherin expression is done at 48 hpf, after motor innervation of eye muscles is complete and oculomotor neurons are at least partly subdivided into subnuclei. What was cadherin expression like when the motor neurons are first detectable by isl1:GFP expression? Presumably it is from this earlier stage that <italic>cdh2ΔEC</italic> will disrupt the process of sub-nucleogenesis.</p><p>Figure 5: In the Results and the Discussion, the authors frame the non-autonomous effect of <italic>cdh2ΔEC</italic> expression on IO neurons as evidence of cadherin-based interactions between different sub-nuclei. While this is one possible interpretation, it is equally likely that changes in the organization of the other subnuclei (e.g. shifts in the position, span, or density of these subnuclei) could cause subtle shifts in the IO nucleus position indirectly by mechanical means. For instance, expanding the volume taken up of the dorsal subnucleus could push the IO nucleus more ventrally. If the authors could show that <italic>cdh2ΔEC</italic> expression in IO neurons and not other nIII neurons had the same effect on both populations, their conclusion of cadherin-based interactions between them would be better supported. As it stands, the authors should consider both direct and indirect mechanisms.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.56725.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The lack of quantitative analysis of Figure 1 (cadherin expression) stands in contrast to the rest of the paper, and should be improved.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an excellent suggestion.

However, we were unable to address this question with this line in our initial attempts due to its very weak expression and spectral overlap with the mCherry tag of the dominant negative cadherin construct. When Covid restrictions allow, it is our intention to undertake further experiments to examine the innervation of ocular motor neurons by its presynaptic neurons, which we will be happy to provide as a preprint to bioRxiv or submit as a Research Advance to <italic>eLife</italic>, and we have expanded our Discussion to reflect this.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>[…] 1) The Discussion in general does a nice job of putting the work into a broad context.

This analysis has been performed for n=3 animals, for each time point and each cadherin within different regions of nIII, as well as nIV. We have updated our schematics in Figure 1 and Figure 1—figure supplement 3., Results and Materials and methods sections to reflect these analyses and have also included transverse images which were previously not shown for the genes analysed in Figure 1—figure supplement 1 and Figure 1—figure supplement 3 (previously Figure 1-supplement 2). In relation to Figure 1I, our new analyses confirm that <italic>cdh4</italic> expression is higher in dorsomedial nIII than in ventral nIII as identified before – as some cells anterior to the outlines shown of nIV show higher intensities than those seen most medially. However expression in dorsolateral nIII is indeed slightly higher than in dorsomedial nIII, as reviewer 3 has observed. On the whole, we find that expression levels are generally very similar on left and right sides, however in a few cases there may be small asymmetries such as that highlighted for <italic>cdh10a</italic> at 48 hpf. In our new analyses, we have averaged measurements for left and right sides for each slice analysed, within the same specimen.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 1: the evaluation of cadherin expression is done at 48 hpf, after motor innervation of eye muscles is complete and oculomotor neurons are at least partly subdivided into subnuclei.

As ventral neurons have been shown to be born later than dorsal neurons, with neurogenesis of this population completing ~50 hpf, we opted to assay cadherin expression at 48 hpf. Furthermore, our published data show that motor innervation of eye muscles in zebrafish is not complete until 72 hpf, and this was the rationale for choosing the later time point. We agree that oculomotor neurons would be expected to express cadherins as soon as they are postmitotic, however assaying this was beyond the scope of this study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 5: In the Results and the Discussion, the authors frame the non-autonomous effect of cdh2ΔEC expression on IO neurons as evidence of cadherin-based interactions between different sub-nuclei.

Without this supporting evidence, we have therefore toned down our conclusion to include the possibility of indirect mechanisms as suggested.</p><p>“In sum, these results suggest that cadherin-dependent neuron-neuron adhesive interactions between oculomotor subnuclei also contribute to the appropriate positioning of the IO subnucleus. However we cannot rule out an alternative possibility that the observed shift in IO subnucleus position could also be a mechanically-driven consequence of changes to the arrangement of the other oculomotor subnuclei; novel tools to target expression of <italic>cdh2ΔEC</italic> to IO neurons specifically would allow us to address this possibility definitively.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
