systems and prioritise their own recombinases. Here, we present biochemical and structural analysis of two phage proteins, gp5.9 and Abc2, which target the DNA break resection complex RecBCD. These exemplify two contrasting mechanisms for control of DNA break repair in which the RecBCD complex is either inhibited or co-opted for the benefit of the invading phage. Gp5.9 completely inhibits RecBCD by preventing it from binding to DNA. The RecBCD-gp5.9 structure shows that gp5.9 acts by substrate mimicry, binding predominantly to the RecB arm domain and competing sterically for the DNA binding site. Gp5.9 adopts a parallel coiled-coil architecture that is unprecedented for a natural DNA mimic protein. In contrast, binding of Abc2 does not substantially affect the biochemical activities of isolated RecBCD. The RecBCD-Abc2 structure shows that Abc2 binds to the Chi-recognition domains of the RecC subunit in a position that might enable it to mediate the loading of phage recombinases onto its single-stranded DNA products.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>bacterial immunity</kwd><kwd>DNA break repair</kwd><kwd>bacteriophage</kwd><kwd>RecBCD</kwd><kwd>helicase</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>100401/Z/12/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dillingham</surname><given-names>Mark S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/S007261/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dillingham</surname><given-names>Mark S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000289</institution-id><institution>Cancer Research UK</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>C6913/A2160</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wigley</surname><given-names>Dale B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>209327/Z/17/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wigley</surname><given-names>Dale B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MR/N009258/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wigley</surname><given-names>Dale B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.

This is facilitated by RecBCD’s ability to switch between different modes of action at free DNA ends. In the destructive mode, RecBCD recognises free DNA ends and acts as a processive nuclease that degrades both strands of the DNA duplex into fragments of single-stranded DNA. This can be detrimental to bacteriophage for multiple reasons (for details, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dillingham and Kowalczykowski, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Levy et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bobay et al., 2013</xref>); it can directly degrade and inactivate linear phage genomes upon entry into the bacterial cell, provides immunity against future phage infections because the DNA fragments are captured by Cas1-Cas2 integrase for CRISPR libraries, and prevents phage replication in the rolling circle mode. However, RecBCD can also act in a recombinogenic mode to convert DSBs into substrates for RecA-dependent strand exchange and recombination with a homologous undamaged DNA molecule. This facilitates DNA break repair which also underpins replication and protects the genetic stability of the host genome. The switch from the destructive to the recombinogenic mode is triggered during RecBCD translocation along DNA by recognition of a specific octameric ssDNA sequence called Chi (crossover hotspot instigator; 5′-<named-content content-type="sequence">GCTGGTGG</named-content>-3′) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cheng et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bianco and Kowalczykowski, 1997</xref>). Chi recognition causes profound biochemical changes in RecBCD. The enzyme continues to translocate and unwind DNA beyond Chi, upregulates cleavage on the 5′-strand, and no longer cuts DNA on the 3′-strand downstream of Chi, generating a long 3′-terminated ssDNA overhang (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dixon and Kowalczykowski, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Anderson and Kowalczykowski, 1997a</xref>). Moreover, Chi recognition imparts RecBCD with the ability to load RecA protein onto the 3′-tailed product to produce a nucleoprotein filament that engages in strand exchange with the homology donor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Anderson and Kowalczykowski, 1997b</xref>). Chi sequences are highly over-represented in host genomes but are often lacking in bacteriophage DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dillingham and Kowalczykowski, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">El Karoui et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tracy et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cardon et al., 1993</xref>). Therefore, regulation of RecBCD by Chi has been viewed as a form of self-recognition which instructs RecBCD to repair host DNA but to destroy and catalogue foreign DNA (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Subramaniam and Smith, 2022</xref> for an opposing view).</p><p>Bacteriophage could evade the immunity function of RecBCD in several different ways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bobay et al., 2013</xref>). One strategy is to select for Chi sequences within their genome, but this is thought to incur a significant fitness penalty: phage are themselves dependent on recombination for packaging and genetic variation, and the use of the RecBCD pathway may provide suboptimal outcomes and limit the breadth of possible hosts. Instead, many phage express inhibitors of RecBCD which enable them to avoid genome degradation and prioritise the use of their own autonomous recombination system; the phage-encoded exonuclease (<italic>exo</italic>) and recombinase (<italic>bet</italic>) genes. A well-characterised example of this strategy is provided by coliphage λ Gam protein. Gam acts as a DNA mimic protein to bind directly to RecBCD and inhibit all of its activities by competing for the DNA binding site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Court et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Murphy, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Murphy, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Poteete et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wilkinson et al., 2016b</xref>). Analogous RecBCD inhibitors are also present in phage T4, T7, and SPP1, but these do not share sequence identity with Gam and are less well-characterised in comparison (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pacumbaba and Center, 1975</xref>). The T7 gp5.9 protein, which is one subject of this work, was discovered as a protein responsible for reduced ATP-dependent exonuclease activity in extracts from cells infected with T7 and was subsequently shown to reduce the activity of purified RecBCD in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pacumbaba and Center, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lin, 1992</xref>). Despite the lack of any detectable homology to λ Gam, gp5.9 is also a small and highly acidic protein, both of which are properties associated with DNA mimicry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wang et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore, T7 gp5.9 may act via a similar mechanism to Gam by competing for the RecBCD DNA binding locus. Remarkably, bacterial strains containing the Ec48 retron system have turned this RecBCD evasion strategy to their own advantage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Millman et al., 2020</xref>). Within such cells, RecBCD interaction with Gam or gp5.9 acts as a sensor of phage infection and triggers cell suicide, protecting the whole bacterial population at the expense of infected cells.</p><p>A completely different strategy to evade the anti-phage activities of RecBCD is exemplified by the Abc2 protein of <italic>Salmonella</italic> phage P22 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Poteete et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Murphy, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Murphy, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Murphy, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Murphy and Lewis, 1993</xref>). Abc2 binds to the RecC subunit, from where it is proposed to hijack RecBCD to promote recombination (rather than degradation) of phage. At the molecular level, this might be achieved by promoting the conversion of RecBCD into its recombinogenic mode and adapting the RecA-loading function for the phage-recombinase. This possibility is supported by several observations: phage encoding Abc2-like proteins apparently lack an exonuclease function (which would instead be provided by the co-opted RecBCD complex), Abc2 expression eliminates the SOS response to DSBs which requires RecA loading, and Abc2-RecBCD fails to respond to Chi yet displays properties somewhat similar to the Chi-modified enzyme constitutively (i.e. upregulated 5′-nuclease activity).</p><p>In this work, we present a comparative study of the interactions between RecBCD and the phage-encoded gp5.9 and Abc2 proteins. We find that there are stark differences in the effects of the two proteins on RecBCD activity. Whereas gp5.9 inhibits all tested activities of RecBCD, Abc2 has no significant effect on the ability of the complex to bind and unwind DNA. Accordingly, cryoEM structures of gp5.9-RecBCD and Abc2-RecBCD show that the two phage proteins bind to entirely different parts of the RecBCD structure. The gp5.9 protein uses DNA mimicry to bind the RecB arm domain and compete for the interaction between RecBCD and DNA ends. The Abc2 protein, together with a host encoded prolyl-isomerase, binds to the RecC subunit from where it might influence the recombinase loading step of homologous recombination.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Gp5.9, but not Abc2, inhibits RecBCD helicase activity</title><p>The T7 gp5.9 protein was shown previously to inhibit RecBCD, but the mechanism was not determined. Therefore, we made recombinant gp5.9 and studied its effects on RecBCD activity in vitro. We found that gp5.9 expression was toxic to <italic>E. coli</italic>, and therefore used insect cell expression to express and purify the protein with a cleavable histidine tag (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Unless stated otherwise, all experiments were performed with a preparation of gp5.9 with the tag removed. We first assessed the effect of T7 gp5.9 on RecBCD helicase-nuclease activity using a simple gel-based DSB resection assay. As expected, RecBCD rapidly unwound a linearised duplex DNA substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>, lanes 1–4). In the presence of excess purified gp5.9 (1 µM), the RecBCD enzyme was strongly inhibited (compare lanes 4 and 5). To assess the specificity of gp5.9 for RecBCD, we performed analogous experiments using the AddAB helicase-nuclease, a RecBCD orthologue from <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yeeles and Dillingham, 2010</xref>), and observed no inhibition of DNA degradation (lanes 6–10). This strongly suggests that gp5.9 acts by binding directly and specifically to the RecBCD complex, as opposed to blocking DNA ends.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>RecBCD helicase activity is inhibited by gp5.9 but not Abc2.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Gel-based double-stranded DNA break (DSB) resection assay.

It has been established previously that Abc2 binds directly to RecBCD but, in comparison to gp5.9 and Gam, it seems to have only moderate effects on its DNA binding, helicase, and nuclease activities in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Murphy, 2000</xref>). We were unable to purify the Abc2 polypeptide alone. Therefore, to confirm these observations, we purified the intact RecBCD-Abc2 complex which was found to co-purify with host peptidyl-prolyl <italic>cis-trans</italic> isomerase B (<italic>E. coli</italic> PpiB) as observed previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Court et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Murphy, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). It was found that the expression of the Pro68Ala mutant form of Abc2 (Abc2<sup>P68A</sup>) with RecBCD prevented co-purification with the host PpiB protein, allowing us to also isolate the RecBCD-Abc2<sup>P68A</sup> complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Therefore, in the following experiments, we compare the biochemical activities of independently purified samples of free RecBCD, RecBCD-Abc2<sup>P68A</sup>, and the RecBCD-Abc2-PPI complex. As expected based on previous work, the observed DNA unwinding activities of the three preparations were very similar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>, compare lanes 1–4 with 11–14 and 16–19), and all three preparations were completely inhibited by excess gp5.9 (lanes 5, 15, and 20).</p><p>To provide more quantitative insights into RecBCD inhibition by gp5.9, we next employed a continuous multiple turnover helicase assay which uses a fluorescent biosensor for ssDNA (fSSB) to monitor DNA unwinding in real time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chisty et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dillingham et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hedgethorne and Webb, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). RecBCD was pre-incubated at a low concentration (10 pM) with a linear DNA substrate (100 pM molecules) that was devoid of Chi sequences. DNA unwinding was then initiated by the addition of ATP in the presence of fSSB. A rapid increase in fluorescence indicated that RecBCD unwound the DNA over several hundred seconds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). We next repeated the experiment in the presence of increasing concentrations of gp5.9, measuring the initial rate of unwinding in each case. Increasing concentrations of gp5.9 inhibited RecBCD helicase and a plot of [gp5.9] versus unwinding rate was well-fit to an inhibitor dose–response curve yielding IC<sub>50</sub> = 1.3 nM (solid line; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). Equivalent experiments using a gp5.9 preparation retaining the histidine tag yielded a significantly higher IC<sub>50</sub> value of 23 nM (dotted line; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). This suggests that the N-terminal region of the protein is important functionally. Together, these experiments show that both gp5.9 and Abc2 bind directly to RecBCD, but only gp5.9 acts as an inhibitor of RecBCD DNA unwinding activity.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Gp5.9 inhibits RecBCD-DNA interaction independently of Abc2 binding</title><p>To determine the mechanistic basis for inhibition of RecBCD by gp5.9, and to assess whether the phage proteins could bind simultaneously to RecBCD, we next performed EMSA and 'inverse EMSA' experiments to monitor DNA binding by different RecBCD-inhibitor complexes. In conventional EMSA experiments, a Cy5-labelled DNA substrate (25mer blunt duplex) at low concentration (5 nM) was incubated with RecBCD or RecBCD-Abc2 either in the presence or absence of excess gp5.9 (1 µM). RecBCD caused a shift in the mobility of the substrate indicative of the expected RecBCD-DNA interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>). This gel shift was largely eliminated by the addition of gp5.9 to RecBCD before DNA was added. The RecBCD-Abc2 complex behaved identically to wild type. It was able to bind the duplex DNA substrate, but binding was largely inhibited by excess gp5.9. The phage protein alone did not interact with DNA. In complementary 'inverse' EMSA experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>), RecBCD-DNA or RecBCD-Abc2-DNA complexes were run at high concentrations in native polyacrylamide gels that were imaged for Cy5-DNA using a confocal scanner and then stained with Coomassie to detect protein-containing complexes. Note in these experiments that free DNA is not detected as it has run off the bottom of the gel (lane 1). RecBCD was able to bind to DNA as expected (lane 2). However, addition of gp5.9 before DNA dramatically reduced the amount of DNA detected and caused a small increase in the mobility of the RecBCD complex showing it was interacting directly (compare lanes 2 and 3). The RecBCD-Abc2 complex displayed a reduced mobility compared to RecBCD alone (compare lanes 2–4 with 5–7). There was evidence for a small amount of free RecBCD in the preparation in the form of a fine band running with identical mobility to the RecBCD-alone preparation. Importantly, both bands co-migrated with Cy5-DNA showing that DNA and Abc2 can bind simultaneously to RecBCD (lane 5). Pre-addition of gp5.9 to the RecBCD-Abc2 preparation reduced Cy5-DNA binding to both protein complexes (compare lanes 5 and 6). Together, these data show that the gp5.9 binding site on RecBCD is distinct from that of Abc2 and that gp5.9 inhibits DNA binding, potentially by direct competition at the DNA binding locus.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>gp5.9 is a DNA mimic protein with an unprecedented architecture</title><p>We next purified the RecBCD-gp5.9 complex (using the tag-free form of gp5.9) and analysed its structure using single-particle cryoEM. The dataset was found to be relatively homogeneous with evident additional density for the phage protein on the surface of the complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). There was structural heterogeneity only within the RecD protein, suggesting that the RecD conformation becomes uncoupled to the rest of the complex when bound to gp5.9. This was improved by 3D classification, after which an ordered high-resolution class (30% of the classified particles) was separated for the RecBCD-gp5.9 complex with the RecD 1A and 1B domains resolved but not the 2A nor SH3 domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1e</xref>). A 3.2 Å resolution cryoEM map was obtained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1h</xref>) facilitating the building of a model for two chains of gp5.9, both containing residues 1–49 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). The structure reveals that gp5.9 adopts a parallel coiled-coil architecture in which the N-termini are slightly braced apart by a short anti-parallel beta-sheet. Many aspartate and glutamate residues are displayed on the outer surface of this exceptionally negatively charged protein (pI = 4.0; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b and c</xref>). The phage protein engages RecBCD in a position which overlaps extensively with the DNA binding site and also with the binding site for the DNA mimic protein Gam (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d–f</xref>). The C-terminal end of the coiled-coil binds to the extended RecB arm domain, while the N-terminus binds closer to the RecBCD core, making contacts with both the RecB and RecC subunits and helping to explain the reduced efficacy of inhibition by purified gp5.9 retaining an N-terminal tag (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). The overall structures of RecBCD when bound to either DNA or gp5.9 are almost identical, although small rigid body domain movements help accommodate differences in the dimensions of the two ligands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>CryoEM structure of the RecBCD-gp5.9 complex.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) CryoEM map of the RecBCD-gp5.9 complex.

These imitate a subset of the contacts formed between the negatively charged DNA phosphates and K/R residues in the RecBCD-DNA complex and, on this basis, we can conclude that gp5.9 acts by DNA mimicry. Interestingly, the contacts formed between RecBCD and Gam (another DNA mimic protein) are equivalent to a different subset of the RecBCD-DNA interactions such that only a few of the charge-based interactions (with RecB Arg residues 254, 255, and 761) are conserved across all three complexes (see highlighted residues in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Indeed, besides their dimeric, α-helical, and highly charged structures there is little else in common between the two phage proteins and the coiled-coil architecture of gp5.9 is unprecedented for a DNA mimic. In addition to charge-based interactions that mimic contacts with DNA phosphates, gp5.9 makes additional protein–protein interactions which presumably provide specificity for RecBCD (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata1">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>), as opposed to other DNA binding proteins including AddAB.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>gp5.9 is a DNA mimic protein.</title><p>Charge pair interactions between R/K residues in RecBCD (blue) and either phosphates or D/E residues (red) for DNA (<bold>a</bold>), gp5.9 (<bold>b</bold>), or Gam (<bold>c</bold>).

The Abc2 protein adopts an extended alpha-helical structure and binds to the surface of the 'inactivated helicase domains' of RecC which play a key role in Chi recognition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c–e</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata1">Figure 4—source data 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Murphy, 2000</xref>). Consistent with biochemical observations, this location suggests a role for Abc2 in modulating the late stages of the DSB processing reaction catalysed by RecBCD (i.e. Chi recognition and associated conformational changes mediated by a 'latch' structure in RecC, or the subsequent loading of RecA protein). The binding site is also close to the interface with the helicase domains of RecB, and to a tunnel between RecB and RecC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>) which has been suggested to allow exit of a recombinogenic ssDNA loop (the site of RecA loading) after Chi recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cheng et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yang et al., 2012</xref>). In the RecBCD-Abc2-PPI structure, RecBCD and Abc2 are essentially identical, but Abc2 is also bound to the host PpiB protein. Abc2 interacts extensively with the Chi-recognition domains of RecC as before, but there are no interactions between PpiB and RecBCD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>). The structure can be superposed onto the corresponding translocation activated RecBCD-DNA structure (PDB: 5LD2; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wang et al., 2019</xref>), containing the same DNA substrate and non-hydrolysable ATP analogue, ADPNP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3a</xref>). This shows that Abc2 has no significant effect on the conformation of the majority of the RecBCD complex except for a minor opening of the nuclease domain relative to RecC and RecD.

A <italic>cis</italic> proline conformation at this position would disrupt the helical secondary structure and potentially direct the disordered C-terminus of Abc2 towards the RecB-RecC interface. In fact, when the RecBCD-Abc2-PPI map is blurred and contoured down, a continuous weak density path can be observed for the continuation of the Abc2 C-terminus through the PpiB binding cleft and out towards the RecB helicase domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4c</xref>). Looking around the RecB helicase domains, additional unaccountable patches of density are found above the noise in-between the 1A and 2A motor domains which enclose the ATP-binding site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">Figure 4—figure supplement 5a</xref>). This additional density is not seen in the Abc2 complex without bound PpiB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">Figure 4—figure supplement 5b</xref>). AlphaFold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Yüksel et al., 2016</xref>) models of the Abc2 C-terminus are highly divergent and cannot be used to interpret the density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s6">Figure 4—figure supplement 6</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this work, we used biochemical and structural methods to study the interactions of two phage proteins, T7 gp5.9 and P22 Abc2, with the <italic>E. coli</italic> RecBCD complex. We found that low nanomolar concentrations of gp5.9 specifically inhibit RecBCD helicase activity in vitro by preventing DNA substrate binding. Our structure of the RecBCD-gp5.9 complex explains the biochemical observations by showing how gp5.9 competes directly for the DNA binding site through mimicry of the natural DNA substrate.</p><p>The T7 gp5.9 protein is functionally analogous to Gam from phage λ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Murphy, 2007</xref>). Moreover, both are small, dimeric, and highly acidic proteins which form a compact and predominantly alpha-helical structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Court et al., 2007</xref>). Despite these similarities, their primary structures, overall folds, and the molecular-level details of their interaction with RecBCD are different. Indeed, DNA mimic proteins display a remarkable structural diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wang et al., 2014</xref>) and, to the best of our knowledge, the coiled-coil architecture observed here for gp5.9 has not been observed in nature before this study. Interestingly, however, this fold has been used previously as the structural framework for the rational design of synthetic DNA mimics targeting restriction endonucleases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Yüksel et al., 2016</xref>). Our work here validates the choice of coiled-coils for producing such synthetic proteins and may help inform their design against novel targets.</p><p>In cells containing the bacterial retron Ec48, the presence of either gp5.9 or Gam (either of which are indicative of phage infection) triggers programmed cell death as an abortive infection mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Millman et al., 2020</xref>). Because the Ec48 system is not tolerated in a Δ<italic>recB</italic> mutant, and because Gam was known to bind mainly to RecB, it was suggested that the retron binds directly to RecB and its release is triggered by Gam or gp5.9 to activate downstream effectors of cell suicide by unknown mechanisms. This model implies that Gam and gp5.9 bind to the same interface on RecB. Our results here are consistent with this hypothesis because Gam and gp5.9 do indeed share the same binding location on the RecB arm domain and other nearby regions of RecB and RecC. Therefore, DNA, Gam, gp 5.9, and possibly the retron all compete for the same site on RecBCD. In retron-free <italic>E. coli</italic> cells, expression of gp5.9 likely sequesters all of the available RecBCD complex present at only ~10 copies per cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lepore et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Taniguchi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Taylor and Smith, 1980</xref>) in an inactive form, thereby protecting T7 DNA from degradation and prioritising the use of phage-recombinases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). In addition to its natural roles, gp5.9 may also find use as a biotechnology tool for enhancing recombineering efficiency, improving cell-free transcription-translation systems, or stabilising DNA nanostructures in vivo through its ability to potently inhibit RecBCD exonuclease activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sitaraman et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Klocke et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yu et al., 2000</xref>).</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Hypothetical models for control of RecBCD by T7 gp5.9 and P22 Abc2.</title><p>In uninfected cells (pathway i), free DNA ends are processed by RecBCD to yield a recombinogenic 3’-terminated ssDNA overhang coated with host RecA protein. The reaction proceeds in five steps. (1) RecBCD binds to the free DNA end. (2) RecBCD translocates and unwinds the duplex DNA degrading both strands as it progresses into fragments of single-stranded DNA of varying lengths. This activity is detrimental to phage as it can help degrade invading linear DNA species and initiates CRISPR acquisition. (3) RecBCD recognises a Chi sequence (these are over-represented in host DNA). (4) RecBCD continues to unwind DNA and to degrade the 5’-terminated DNA strand, but the 3’-terminated strand is protected from degradation and forms an expanding loop structure. (5) RecBCD loads RecA protein onto the ssDNA loop ready for subsequent strand invasion and further steps of DNA repair. In T7-infected cells (pathway ii), the gp5.9 protein titrates RecBCD by competing for the DNA binding site. Linear phage DNA cannot be degraded by RecBCD and is available for phage recombination and replication. In P22-infected cells (pathway iii), Abc2 binds to the RecBCD complex and modifies the enzyme to load the P22 recombinase (Erf), as opposed to RecA, onto the ssDNA products. Recombinase loading might occur either constitutively as indicated here or in response to Chi-recognition as in the unperturbed pathway.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-83409-fig5-v2.tif"/></fig><p>The effects of Abc2 on RecBCD activity are complex and remain less well understood than is the case for the two DNA mimic proteins. Expression of Abc2 in <italic>E. coli</italic> eliminates RecBCD-dependent recombination but exonuclease activity is retained (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Murphy and Lewis, 1993</xref>). We found here that there is no substantial effect of Abc2 on RecBCD helicase activity in vitro. This stands in stark contrast to the complete inhibition of all activities afforded by interaction with gp5.9. Our results differ somewhat from previous biochemical studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Poteete et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Murphy, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Murphy, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Murphy, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Murphy and Lewis, 1993</xref>) which showed that Abc2 had modest effects on RecBCD DNA binding (two- to fourfold tighter) and helicase-nuclease activity (three- to fourfold lower) in vitro. Such differences are potentially explained by known prep-to-prep variability in RecBCD-specific activity. Importantly, however, it was also shown that the enzyme failed to respond to Chi and displayed properties that are somewhat akin to a constitutively Chi-activated complex (upregulated 5′-exonuclease activity). Based upon their observations, Murphy and co-workers developed a model in which Abc2 hijacks RecBCD to generate the ssDNA required for phage recombination and modifies its RecA loading function to instead recruit its own recombinase (called Erf) to the ssDNA products (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Our biochemical and structural data are consistent with this hypothesis. Abc2 is bound to RecC in close proximity to both a 'latch helix' which is thought to control conformational changes in response to Chi, and to an 'alternative exit channel' in the RecBCD complex which is thought to accommodate a ssDNA loop in the post-Chi state (i.e. the recombinogenic mode) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cheng et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Handa et al., 2012</xref>). Under normal circumstances, this loop would be loaded with <italic>E. coli</italic> RecA protein to promote subsequent steps in the host DNA break repair pathway. Given its location, it is plausible that Abc2 prevents RecA loading at this site and/or promotes the binding of Erf to the emerging ssDNA, but this remains to be tested experimentally. In addition to Abc2 and Erf, the P22 recombination system also includes the uncharacterised proteins Abc1 (Anti-RecBCD protein 1) and Arf (Accessory recombination factor) which are both required for full activity during P22 infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Murphy, 2012</xref>). The role of Abc1 is unknown and its ability to bind directly to RecBCD has never been tested. Likewise, exactly how Arf influences P22 recombination is unclear, but its small size and acidic primary sequence hint that it might be a DNA mimic protein. Finally, the significance of the interaction between Abc2 and host PpiB is not clear. Our structure shows that the PPI active site almost certainly engages P68 of Abc2, and it is therefore plausible that proline isomerisation may in some way modulate Abc2 activity and therefore P22 infection. In this respect, it is interesting to note that proline isomerisation has been found to be critical for infection of <italic>E. coli</italic> by phage fd (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Eckert et al., 2005</xref>). Further work will be required to fully understand the influence of P22 infection on homologous recombination in bacterial cells which may also have implications of our understanding of RecA loading by the native RecBCD complex.</p><p>The RecBCD complex and related systems such as AddAB (also known as RexAB) have been considered as attractive targets for antibacterial drug development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lanyon-Hogg, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Amundsen et al., 2012</xref>).

Outlying poor quality images, based on CTF figure of merit, defocus value and predicted resolution were removed to give 4080 micrographs for further processing.

A total of 1,458,124 picked particles were extracted 2× binned in RELION3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zivanov et al., 2018</xref>).

The output particles were then subjected to Bayesian polishing and refined as before in RELION3 producing a map at a resolution of 3.5 Å. A round of CTF refinement of the per-particle defocus values significantly improved the map, which was subsequently refined to a resolution of 3.1 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1d</xref>). A round of 3D classification was then with local angular searches and without a mask to separate any heterogeneity within the complex into three classes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1e</xref>). A class containing 163,484 particles (30% of those classified) with strong density for the full complex was selected out from low-resolution classes with mixed occupancies and refined to a resolution of 3.2 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1f</xref>). A focused 3D classification was then run using a soft mask around the gp5.9 and RecB arm domain region of the complex and without image alignment.

RecBCD-GamS structure (PDB ID: 5MBV, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Anderson and Kowalczykowski, 1997b</xref>) was docked into the density using Chimera (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dillingham et al., 2008</xref>) and refined with jelly-body restraints using Refmac5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brown et al., 2015</xref>) in CCPEM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Burnley et al., 2017</xref>). A focused refinement in RELION3 with the mask around the gp5.9 binding site used during data processing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1g</xref>) generated a more resolved map to facilitate the building of gp5.9 and remodelling of interacting regions of the RecB arm and RecC C-terminal domains respectively in Coot (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Konno et al., 1996</xref>). Initially a long idealised α-helix was docked in to start gp5.9 building with an N-terminal ß-strand extension clearly visible. At this resolution and with the majority of the peptide ordered, sequence assignment was clear and straightforward with residues 1–49 modelled. The chain was duplicated and docked into the density for the second gp5.9 molecule within the homo-dimer, with only minor adjustments required for the very N-terminal residues and some altered side-chain conformers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). An AlphaFold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Yüksel et al., 2016</xref>) model of gp5.9 was later used to help validate our model. Notably, an AlphaFold model of the RecBCD complex combined with observations of inconsistencies between the model and map in the RecB arm led to the finding that the protein register within this domain was off by seven residues for residues 241–289, which are flanked by disordered loops in prior RecBCD structures. Two tryptophan residues positioned seven residues apart in this region had become the basis for the misalignment in the first model built for RecBCD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Singleton et al., 2004</xref>), and it was not uncovered with the ambiguous nature of the density in this region in the subsequent RecBCD structures that followed, until this significantly higher-resolution gp5.9 complex map (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>). We went back through past RecBCD complex structures and found that the new RecB arm model fit significantly better into all of the past maps. Comparative analyses of RecBCD structures in this article use the corrected models.</p><p>The published RecBCD-DNA-ADPNP structure (PDB ID: 5LD2, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wilkinson et al., 2016a</xref>) with the corrected RecB arm domain was docked into the 3.4 Å Abc2-containing map using Chimera and refined with jelly-body restraints using Refmac5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brown et al., 2015</xref>) in CCPEM. Additional density was present on the surface of RecC that was sufficiently ordered and resolved to facilitate manual building of the novel Abc2 polypeptide chain from residues 6–52 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4a</xref>) in Coot with iterative rounds of manual building and Phenix real-space refinement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams et al., 2010</xref>). Initially, three α-helices were docked in and connecting loops built. Sequence was assigned based on a combination of secondary structure prediction generated by JPRED (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Drozdetskiy et al., 2015</xref>) and register matching of density size and environment to the chemical properties of the known amino acid sequence. Concurrently, the surrounding RecC region was adjusted to fit the density with minor remodelling except for a surface bundle including residues 252–294 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3b</xref>). This helical bundle peels back to allow Abc2 binding and then loosely clamps back to hold Abc2 in place, although the density in its new position was insufficient for model building (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3c</xref>).</p><p>For the Abc2 and PPI-containing map at 3.8 Å resolution, the final RecBCD-DNA-Abc2 model was docked in and refined with jelly-body restraints as described above. As well as containing additional density for PPI, the map showed further density for building an extended part of the C-terminal region of the Abc2 model up to residue 66 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplements 4b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">5a</xref>). The density in this region was ambiguous as indicated by local resolution estimation identifying the resolution to be worse than 5 Å for PpiB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1h</xref>). As a result, the crystal structure of <italic>E. coli</italic> PpiB (PDB: 1LOP) was docked into the density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>) for the purpose of figures but not for the deposition of a 3D model. It is unclear what changes are induced in Abc2 and in PPI itself upon PPI binding to the C-terminal portion of Abc2. However, the model is strongly suggestive of P68 of Abc2 binding within the active site of the prolyl isomerase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4f</xref>). The final models of each structure were real-space refined in Phenix against the deposited maps with ADP-factor refinement enabled and model quality assessed by MolProbity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Williams et al., 2018</xref>) to generate the final model statistics (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Materials availability statement</title><p>Expression vectors used in this study are available from the corresponding authors upon request.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Data availability statement</title><p>Newly generated structural models from this work have been deposited at the PDB and EMDB.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen Volker Dötsch as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Interestingly, Abc2 cannot be purified by itself alone but is stable only in complexes with RecBCD. Because of a Proline residue (Pro68) in Abc2, which is a substrate of prolyl-isomerase (PPI), WT Abc2 is tightly associated with PPI, but the mutant Abc2P68A can be separated from PPI. Therefore, the authors have prepared both RecBCD- Abc2P68A and RecBCD- Abc2-PPI. The biochemical characterization of the effects of Abc2 on RecBCD is a repeat of KC Murphy's paper, but different from KC Murphy's in the effects of Abc2 on dsDNA-end binding (2-4 fold increase, by Murphy) and helicase activity (3-4 fold reduced, by Murphy) of RecBCD (reference 15). Here, both RecBCD- Abc2P68A and RecBCD- Abc2-PPI have comparable enzymatic activities as RecBCD alone and both can be blocked by gp5.9 as by Gam (Murphy). The cryoEM structures reveal Abc2 binds the Chi-recognition RecC subunit and potentially modifies RecBCD in response to the Chi sequence. But in the absence of DNA, the structure does not explain the in vivo function of Abc2 hijacking RecBCD, nor how Abc2 alters dsDNA binding and helicase activity of RecBCD as reported by Murphy. This needs to be discussed.</p><p>2) The manuscript seems to be written primarily for RecBCD experts. Please explain RecBCD function and mechanism in DSB repair (Chi sequence and RecA recruitment) and in CRISPR activity better and more clearly. For example, the diagram in Figure 1b shows the exonuclease activity of RecBCD, but how could the single nucleotides of phage DNA be incorporated into CRISPR? Even with the endonuclease activity, RecBCD produces single-stranded phage DNA fragments only. How this ssDNA be incorporated into CRISPR is unclear.</p><p>3) Whereas the gp5.9 structure fully rationalizes the effect of gp5.9 on RecBCD activity, the Abc2 structure – while illuminating the docking site on RecBCD, a clear advance – does not clarify how Abc2 impacts RecBCD function.

The manuscript is written for the RecBCD experts only. It is rather cryptic to all others. The authors may explain the RecBCD function and mechanism in DSB repair (Chi sequence and RecA recruitment) and in CRISPR better and more clearly. For example, the diagram in Figure 1b shows the exonuclease activity of RecBCD, but how could the single nucleotides of phage DNA be incorporated into CRISPR?

Is phage-encoded Abc2 not species specific? Can <italic>Salmonella</italic> phage P22 infect <italic>E. coli</italic>?</p><p>3. Could the authors discuss and explain the different results of Abc2-RecBCD between their group and Murphy's, such as DNA substrate and assay setup?</p><p>4. Is gp5.9 alone a dimer and folded as in the complex of RecBCD-go5.9?</p><p>5. When describing the RecBCD-gp5.9 structure, additional details may be included. For Example, which residues in gp5.9 are involved in specific interactions with RecBCD and cannot bind AddAB?</p><p>6. In Figure 3, additions of residue numbers of some side chains will help orient readers. Based on the blue (involving binding) and grey colors (not involving binding), Many more RecB residues are in contact with DNA than interacting with gp5.9 or Gam inhibitors. Could the authors please explain how gp5.9 can inhibit RecBCD from DNA binding?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.83409.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Interestingly, Abc2 cannot be purified by itself alone but is stable only in complexes with RecBCD.

This needs to be discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>Regarding the first point (Murphy’s results). We have now included more detail about Murphy’s results and a brief comparative discussion of our own (page 13). An important caveat in interpreting small (&lt;5-fold) effects on RecBCD activity is that the complex is known to possess different levels of specific activity between preparations (from 20% to 100% active based on titration of DNA ends). This is especially problematic when assessing the effect of Abc2 on RecBCD because (unlike gp5.9 for instance) the protein cannot be purified in isolation and titrated into free RecBCD to monitor how activity changes. Instead, one is comparing activity between different preparations either including Abc2 or not.</p><p>Regarding the second point (how much does the structure tells us about the mechanism of Abc2?). We agree with the general sentiment here: the mechanism of RecBCD hijacking by Abc2 is still a “work in progress”. Nevertheless, the structure is suggestive of effects on Chi recognition and/or RecA loading which is both consistent with biochemical results and suggests new avenues for further investigation. This is highly related to point (3) and so we discuss it further below in that response.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The manuscript seems to be written primarily for RecBCD experts.

Even with the endonuclease activity, RecBCD produces single-stranded phage DNA fragments only. How this ssDNA be incorporated into CRISPR is unclear.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added more detail to the introduction to better explain RecBCD function (page 3). Note that the mechanism by which RecBCD initiates CRISPR adaption is currently unknown and involves additional factors including Cas1 and Cas2. What does seem to be clear is that DNA sequences upstream of Chi somehow become integrated into CRISPR arrays in a RecBCD-dependent manner. This strongly suggests that the CRISPR adaption substrates include degradation products from RecBCD end-processing reactions.</p><p>RecBCD does not typically produce single nucleotides as products but rather stretches of ssDNA which vary greatly in length depending on the solution conditions (especially the ATP/Mg<sup>2+</sup> ratio). We have now altered both the text and figures in the paper to hopefully avoid giving the impression that the products of RecBCD degradation are single nucleotides (Figure 5 and legend).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Whereas the gp5.9 structure fully rationalizes the effect of gp5.9 on RecBCD activity, the Abc2 structure – while illuminating the docking site on RecBCD, a clear advance – does not clarify how Abc2 impacts RecBCD function. The authors speculate that Abc2 binding prevents RecA loading on the unwound DNA 3' strand while favoring the loading of the phage recombinase Erf.</p><p>Does the structure provide impetus and clues for further experiments to elaborate on that question and, if so, how?</p></disp-quote><p>We accept this point. While the RecBCD-gp5.9 structure “nails” the inhibition mechanism as steric exclusion of substrate, the RecBCD-Abc2 structure is less informative. Previously published biochemical and in vivo analyses of Abc2 show that it modulates rather than completely inhibits the enzyme. The hypothesis is that Abc2 modifies the process of Chi recognition and/or RecA loading (which are themselves coupled processes) in order to facilitate loading of the phage recombinase Erf. Given current structural models for the mechanism of RecBCD, it is not entirely obvious from the structure of RecBCD-Abc2 what exactly this small phage protein is doing, because (a) there is no significant change to the structure of RecBCD induced by Abc2 interaction and (b) no <italic>known</italic> protein interaction site (eg with RecA) is blocked. Indeed, our original manuscript ended with an acknowledgement that understanding how P22 controls recombination in <italic>E. coli</italic> was ongoing work.</p><p>As we see it, in addition to simply revealing the binding site of Abc2, our structure has two significant impacts. Firstly, it is consistent with and extends the existing hypothesis. For example, (a) the interaction of Abc2 with RecC is precisely with the domains of the protein that are responsible for Chi recognition and close to a <italic>putative</italic> site of RecA loading; (b) the recognition that a conserved proline in Abc2 interacts with the active site of PPI implies that Abc2 function is dependent on proline isomerisation; (c) the possible bridging of RecB and RecC by the C-and N-terminal regions of the protein suggest that Abc2 might hinder inter-subunit conformational changes. Secondly, the structure facilitates the testing of this hypothesis. For example, (a) does RecA and/or Erf loading depend on interactions with the surfaces destroyed or created by Abc2 at the interface with RecC (b) does P68A mutation inactivate Abc2?; (c) does failure to recognise and respond to Chi require bridging of RecB and RecC that limits conformational transitions? Crucially, as we explain in the discussion, the future study of the P22 recombination system will require the purification and characterisation of additional factors (Abc2, Arf and Erf) beyond just Abc2. This is something we are working on currently in the lab and consider to be beyond the scope of this work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1) Please be consistent and clear in Methods in defining buffers as Tris-HCl (if this is indeed what they are) rather than &quot;Tris&quot; or &quot;tris-Cl&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>We accept the point and have modified the methods accordingly throughout.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) There should be spaces between numbers and units: e.g., please correct &quot;pH7.5&quot; and &quot;20nM&quot; on p. 7.</p></disp-quote><p>We have changed the text as requested (pg 17).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Be consistent in the use of &quot;min&quot; as a standard abbreviation to signify minutes.

The manuscript is written for the RecBCD experts only. It is rather cryptic to all others. The authors may explain the RecBCD function and mechanism in DSB repair (Chi sequence and RecA recruitment) and in CRISPR better and more clearly. For example, the diagram in Figure 1b shows the exonuclease activity of RecBCD, but how could the single nucleotides of phage DNA be incorporated into CRISPR? Even with the endonuclease activity, RecBCD produces single-stranded phage DNA fragments only. How this ssDNA is incorporated into CRISPR is unclear to this reader.</p></disp-quote><p>See essential revisions section point (2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Is phage-encoded Abc2 not species specific? Can Salmonella phage P22 infect <italic>E. coli</italic>?</p></disp-quote><p>A literature search suggests that the P22 phage cannot infect <italic>E. coli</italic> (at least the K and C strains). However, expression of P22 Abc2 protein alone in <italic>E. coli</italic> confers phenotypes which are associated with <italic>recb</italic>/<italic>recc</italic> knockout such as ciprofloxacin sensitivity (our unpublished work). This strongly suggests that Abc2 is active against RecBCD in vivo in a cross-species manner. This is perhaps unsurprising given the very high sequence similarity between <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>Salmonella</italic> RecC proteins (~89% identity). Moreover, P22-like coliphage (eg HK542) encode Abc2 proteins with &gt;90% identity to the P22 protein. Nevertheless, we thank the reviewer for making this interesting point because it remains plausible that the effects of Abc2 on the <italic>E. coli</italic> enzyme may not fully recapitulate those on its natural target.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.

When describing the RecBCD-gp5.9 structure, additional details may be included. For Example, which residues in gp5.9 are involved in specific interactions with RecBCD and cannot bind AddAB?</p></disp-quote><p>We have added more detail to our analysis of the RecBCD-gp5.9 structure to address this point. Specifically, we now include a complete table of contacts formed between RecBCD and gp5.9 as Source Data for Figure 3 which includes all H-bonding contacts at the interface rather than just ion-pair contacts (which were emphasised to illustrate DNA mimicry). We also highlight this new information in the main text. For completeness and consistency, we also made an equivalent Supplementary Table for the Abc2 structure (Source data Figure 4)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. In Figure 3, additions of residue numbers of some side chains will help orient readers. Based on the blue (involving binding) and grey colors (not involving binding), Many more RecB residues are in contact with DNA than interacting with gp5.9 or Gam inhibitors. Could the authors please explain how gp5.9 can inhibit RecBCD from DNA binding?</p></disp-quote><p>We have added residue numbers for the interacting side chains as requested (Figure 3 and accompanying legend). Regarding the second point, the structure shows that gp5.9 inhibits RecBCD from binding DNA by steric exclusion. The relative binding affinities of DNA and gp5.9 for this site, as well as the concentrations of DNA breaks and gp5.9 in the cell, will determine the efficacy of gp5.9 as an inhibitor. Note that interactions between RecBCD and gp5.9 are more extensive than just the ion pair contacts shown in Figure 3 (see new Supplementary Tables and the response to point 5). Empirically, inhibition of RecBCD by gp5.9 is quite potent in vitro (IC<sub>50</sub> = 1.5 nM under our experimental conditions).</p></body></sub-article></article>
