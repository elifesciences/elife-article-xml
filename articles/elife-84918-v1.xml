Spectrins were first discovered and characterized in red blood cells but are expressed in many cell types. Spectrins can bind to cell membranes and F-actin, linking them together. They are generally thought to act as heterotetramers, composed of two α subunits and two β subunits. <italic>Drosophila</italic> has one α-spectrin (α-Spec) and two β-spectrins: β-spectrin (β-Spec) and β-heavy spectrin (β<sub>H</sub>-Spec, encoded by <italic>karst</italic> [<italic>kst</italic>]), which could potentially generate two distinct spectrin heterotetramers: (αβ)<sub>2</sub> and (αβ<sub>H</sub>)<sub>2</sub>. β-Spec and β<sub>H</sub>-Spec interact with F-actin through their N-terminal domains, which contain two actin-binding calponin-homology (CH) domains, connecting the spectrin cytoskeleton to the actin cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Liem, 2016</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila</italic> epithelia, it has been reported that β-Spec localizes to the lateral sides of cells, β<sub>H</sub>-Spec localizes to the apical sides of cells, and α-Spec localizes both laterally and apically, leading to inferences that spectrin exists as lateral (αβ)<sub>2</sub> tetramers and apical (αβ<sub>H</sub>)<sub>2</sub> tetramers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dubreuil et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lee et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Thomas et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zarnescu and Thomas, 1999</xref>). Despite common assumptions that spectrins act as tetramers, there is some evidence that alternative arrangements may exist. In <italic>Drosophila</italic> ovarian follicle cells, the absence of α-Spec diminishes the recruitment of β<sub>H</sub>-Spec to the apical domain, but it does not affect the recruitment of β-Spec to the lateral domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lee et al., 1997</xref>). Examination in <italic>Drosophila</italic> of a mutant form of α-Spec that, based on <italic>in vitro</italic> studies, is unable to bind β-Spec and compromised in its ability to bind β<sub>H</sub>-Spec revealed that it could nonetheless rescue the lethality of an <italic>α-Spec</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Khanna et al., 2015</xref>). Experiments done with a mammalian homolog of β<sub>H</sub>-Spec, βV-Spec, showed that it can homodimerize through its C-terminal region, raising the possibility that βV-Spec might be able to cross-link F-actin by itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Papal et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Several studies have reported that spectrins also regulate Hippo signaling, with effects on readouts of Hippo signaling reported in <italic>Drosophila</italic> imaginal discs and ovarian follicles, as well as in cultured mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Deng et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Deng et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fletcher et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wong et al., 2015</xref>). Hippo signaling is a signal transduction network that responds to diverse upstream inputs, including the cytoskeleton and cells’ physical environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Misra and Irvine, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zheng and Pan, 2019</xref>). Hippo signaling modulates cell proliferation and fate, largely through the regulation of Yap family transcriptional co-activator proteins (Yorkie, Yki, in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, YAP1 and TAZ in humans). Yki is primarily regulated through phosphorylation by the kinase Warts (Wts), which promotes the cytoplasmic localization of Yki. Various potential mechanisms for biomechanical regulation of Yki/Yap activity have been described, but the best-characterized mechanism in <italic>Drosophila</italic> is the Jub biomechanical pathway. This involves tension-dependent recruitment of an Ajuba LIM protein (Jub in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, LIMD1 in mammals) to α-catenin at adherens junctions (AJs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alégot et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ibar et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rauskolb et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rauskolb et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sarpal et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sun et al., 2015</xref>). Jub then recruits and inhibits Wts, resulting in increased Yki activity.</p><p>Studies of the influence of spectrins on Hippo signaling have suggested different mechanisms by which this might occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Deng et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Deng et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fletcher et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wong et al., 2015</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fletcher et al., 2015</xref>, focusing on β<sub>H</sub>-Spec, suggested that the spectrin cytoskeleton influences the membrane density, and thereby the activation state, of upstream regulators of Hippo signaling. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wong et al., 2015</xref>, focusing on β-Spec, suggested that spectrins might influence Hippo signaling by modulating levels of F-actin; increased levels of F-actin have been reported in other studies to be associated with increased Yki/Yap activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aragona et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fernández et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sansores-Garcia et al., 2011</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Deng et al., 2015</xref>, focusing on α-Spec, reported that spectrins regulate levels of phosphorylated myosin light chain (required for myosin activation) but surprisingly did not affect levels of myosin or recruitment of Jub, leading them to infer that spectrins can act through a novel tension-dependent but Jub-independent pathway. These same authors later reported that in the pupal eye, spectrins can act through Jub, while suggesting that the action of spectrins in the pupal eye differs from their action in the wing disc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Deng et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Deng et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>The disparate models for how spectrins influence Hippo signaling have led to confusion over whether a distinct spectrin-based mechanism exists for the mechanical regulation of Hippo signaling. We were particularly interested in investigating claims that spectrins could alter cytoskeletal tension in wing discs without affecting Jub localization or levels of myosin. Our results reveal that both β<sub>H</sub>-Spec and α-Spec influence Jub recruitment to AJ, and their effects on Yki activity depend upon Jub. Together, these observations argue that spectrins influence Hippo signaling through the Jub biomechanical pathway. Unexpectedly, our investigations also reveal that β<sub>H</sub>-Spec and α-Spec act separately in wing discs - they do not co-localize, nor do they influence each other’s localization. These observations argue that β<sub>H</sub>-Spec does not act as part of an (αβ<sub>H</sub>)<sub>2</sub> tetramer in the wing disc but rather exerts its functions independently of α-Spec. Finally, we establish that β<sub>H</sub>-Spec and myosin reciprocally antagonize each other’s apical localization in wing discs - myosin inhibits β<sub>H</sub>-Spec, and β<sub>H</sub>-Spec inhibits myosin. We further show that myosin can compete with β<sub>H</sub><italic>-</italic>Spec for binding to F-actin <italic>in vitro</italic>. Together with structural modeling, our observations argue that β<sub>H</sub>-Spec and myosin compete with each other for binding to F-actin <italic>in vivo</italic>. This competition could explain how β<sub>H</sub>-Spec influences myosin activity and further suggests a simple mechanism for the contribution of β<sub>H</sub>-Spec to ratcheting processes that alter cell shape via actomyosin contractility.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>β<sub>H</sub>-Spec regulates myosin activity and levels in wing imaginal discs</title><p>Prior studies have reported that mutation or RNAi-mediated knockdown of spectrins in wing and eye imaginal discs increased myosin activity, as visualized by staining for myosin light chain phosphorylated at activation sites (pMLC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Deng et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Forest et al., 2018</xref>). Surprisingly, it was also reported that levels of GFP-tagged myosin light chain (encoded in <italic>Drosophila</italic> by spaghetti squash, Sqh:GFP) or F-actin were nonetheless unaffected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Deng et al., 2015</xref>), whereas changes in myosin activity generally correlate with changes in myosin accumulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fernandez-Gonzalez et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Noll et al., 2017</xref>). To re-examine this, we analyzed wing imaginal discs in which the apical, β<sub>H</sub>-Spec <italic>kst</italic> was knocked down in posterior wing cells by expressing UAS-RNAi lines under <italic>en-Gal4</italic> control (RNAi validation is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). This approach leaves unaffected anterior wing disc cells as an internal control. These experiments typically also include a neutral transgene expressed under en-Gal4 control to mark posterior cells (e.g. UAS-RFP) and a transgene expressing Dicer2 (Dcr2) to increase the efficacy of RNAi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dietzl et al., 2007</xref>). This increased apical pMLC in posterior cells, where levels of β<sub>H</sub>-Spec were reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B and D</xref>), consistent with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Deng et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Forest et al., 2018</xref>). A difference in junctional tension between anterior (control) cells and posterior (β<sub>H</sub>-Spec RNAi) cells in our experiments was confirmed by measuring the recoil velocity of cell junctions after laser cutting, which demonstrated an increased tension in the β<sub>H</sub>-Spec depleted sides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). To examine myosin protein levels, we employed the myosin light chain GFP fusion Sqh:GFP. We found that depletion of β<sub>H</sub>-Spec led to increased levels of junctional myosin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). To quantify these effects on Sqh:GFP levels, we made maps of Sqh:GFP intensity normalized against E-cad intensity. These are displayed on a red (high) to blue (low) heat map (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pan et al., 2018</xref>) and we also used this analysis to calculate the ratio of intensities of the anterior (control) versus posterior (experimental) compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alégot et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–E, H–I</xref>). This was further confirmed by using a distinct β<sub>H</sub>-Spec RNAi line (<italic>UAS-kstRNAi<sup>HMS00882</sup></italic>), which similarly increased myosin levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2E</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Knockdown of β-heavy spectrin (β<sub>H</sub>-Spec) or α-spectrin (α-Spec) increases junctional myosin levels in wing discs.</title><p>(<bold>A–C</bold>) Apical sections of wing discs stained for E-cad (red/gray) expressing en-Gal4 UAS-RFP UAS-dcr2 sqh:GFP crossed to control (Oregon-R, OR) (<bold>A</bold>), UAS-kstRNAi(v37075) (<bold>B</bold>), or UAS-α-specRNAi (<bold>C</bold>) showing the effect on Sqh:GFP (green/gray) levels and localization in the posterior compartment (marked by RFP, blue).

Both imaging and western blotting of wing discs confirmed that this CRISPRa approach effectively increased expression of Kst:GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A–B</xref>). Examination of myosin under β<sub>H</sub>-Spec overexpression conditions, using Sqh:GFP, revealed a substantial reduction of myosin localization to AJs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A, C and E–F</xref>), and a reduction in tension along cell junctions as assayed by the recoil speed after laser cutting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7I</xref>).

We focused on investigating claims that spectrins could alter cytoskeletal tension in wing discs by regulating pMLC levels without affecting localization of myosin or Jub (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Deng et al., 2015</xref>). In contrast to prior studies, we observed that when β<sub>H</sub>-Spec or α-Spec levels are decreased by RNAi, levels of junctional myosin are increased. This increase in junctional myosin levels is associated with increased junctional tension and with increased recruitment of Jub to AJ. We are not certain why these effects were missed in prior studies, but we note that our observations are consistent with studies linking recruitment of both myosin and Jub to AJ under tension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alégot et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fernandez-Gonzalez et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ibar et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Noll et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rauskolb et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rauskolb et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Razzell et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sarpal et al., 2019</xref>). Moreover, our results are further supported by the observation that <italic>jub</italic> is genetically required for the influence of spectrin knockdown on Yki activity and wing growth. Taken together, these observations imply that β<sub>H</sub>-Spec and α-Spec regulate Hippo signaling in wing discs through the Jub biomechanical pathway, rather than through hypothesized alternate mechanisms.</p><p>Spectrin has been suggested to form two distinct complexes in <italic>Drosophila</italic> epithelial cells, (αβ)<sub>2</sub> and (αβ<sub>H</sub>)<sub>2</sub> heterotetramers, which localize to the lateral and apical sides of cells, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Deng et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dubreuil et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fletcher et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lee et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Thomas et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zarnescu and Thomas, 1999</xref>). However, our observations indicate that β<sub>H</sub>-Spec functions independently of α-Spec in wing imaginal discs. α-Spec and β<sub>H</sub>-Spec do not exhibit significant co-localization. Moreover, α-Spec and β<sub>H</sub>-Spec are not required for each other’s localization to apical cell junctions. This contrasts with the requirement for β-Spec for recruitment of α-Spec to lateral membranes in wing discs. The requirement is not entirely reciprocal, as α-Spec knockdown only partially reduces β-Spec recruitment, but this likely reflects mechanisms that recruit spectrins to cell membranes: β-Spec subunits, but not α-Spec subunits, have a pleckstrin homology domain that can mediate membrane association, as well as possessing the CH domains that mediate F-actin association. Thus β-Spec can associate with lateral membranes without α-Spec, but α-Spec does not have a way to associate with lateral membranes without β-Spec.</p><p>An independent role for β<sub>H</sub>-Spec has also been suggested in mammalian photoreceptors, where it was reported that that mammalian βV-Spec does not co-localize with αII-spectrin, and that βV-Spec could form homodimers, potentially allowing it to cross-link actin by itself, enabling α-Spec-independent functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Papal et al., 2013</xref>). The observation that a mutation in <italic>Drosophila</italic> α-Spec that disrupts binding to β-Spec <italic>in vitro</italic> has only mild phenotypes also suggests that spectrin functions do not depend entirely on αβ interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Khanna et al., 2015</xref>). Collectively, our results together with these earlier studies emphasize that the dogma that “spectrin comprises α- and β-subunits that interact in an antiparallel manner to form an αβ dimer” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Liem, 2016</xref>) should be revised. Nonetheless, our results do not exclude the possibility that β<sub>H</sub>-Spec and α-Spec might act together in a physical complex in other tissues, or under distinct physiological conditions.</p><p>The conclusion that β<sub>H</sub>-Spec and α-Spec act independently in wing discs implies that they influence tension at apical junctions through distinct mechanisms. We suggest that α-Spec could influence AJ tension in wing discs through the mechanism proposed to explain the influence of α- and β-Spec in pupal eyes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Deng et al., 2020</xref>). It was inferred that α- and β-Spec maintain cell rigidity by linking F-actin to membranes. In the absence of α- or β-Spec, it was proposed that dissociation between F-actin and the membrane leads to an expansion of the apical regions. This expansion increases cytoskeletal tension at AJs, which bind F-actin independently of spectrins. Consistent with this suggested mechanism, we observed a decrease in cell height in α-Spec knockdown cells in wing discs, in conjunction with increased tension at apical junctions. The alteration in cell shape was not observed in β<sub>H</sub>-Spec knockdown cells, further supporting the conclusion that β<sub>H</sub>-Spec and α-Spec act in different ways to regulate junctional tension.</p><p>Instead, our experiments analyzing the relationship between β<sub>H</sub>-Spec and myosin revealed an entirely different mechanism by which β<sub>H</sub>-Spec influences tension at AJ. We observed a mutual antagonism between β<sub>H</sub>-Spec and myosin <italic>in vivo</italic> for localization to apical F-actin: decreasing β<sub>H</sub>-Spec increases junctional myosin, while increasing β<sub>H</sub>-Spec decreases junctional myosin. Reciprocally, increasing myosin activity decreases β<sub>H</sub>-Spec localization to apical F-actin, while decreasing myosin activity increases β<sub>H</sub>-Spec localization to apical F-actin. <italic>In vitro</italic> studies with purified protein domains revealed that myosin can compete with β<sub>H</sub>-Spec for binding to F-actin. Finally, computational modeling of protein structures revealed that myosin and β<sub>H</sub>-Spec would interfere with each other’s binding to F-actin. Together, these observations indicate that β<sub>H</sub>-Spec and myosin can directly compete with each other for localization to F-actin. We suggest therefore that the influence of β<sub>H</sub>-Spec on junctional tension is likely to be a direct consequence of its competition with myosin for overlapping binding sites on F-actin.</p><p>Despite β<sub>H</sub>-Spec and myosin sharing overlapping binding sites on F-actin, and competing reciprocally <italic>in vivo</italic>, in our co-sedimentation experiments we could only detect a partial ability of myosin to compete for β<sub>H</sub>-Spec binding, and we could not detect an ability of β<sub>H</sub>-Spec to compete for myosin binding. Several factors are likely to contribute to these observations. First, we could not use higher protein concentrations of myosin or β<sub>H</sub>-Spec due to the need to keep the salt concentration constant and close to physiological levels, and to prevent protein precipitation. Second, it has been suggested for β-Spec that the CH2 domain regulates the actin binding function of the CH1 domain through steric hindrance when the two domains are associated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Avery et al., 2017</xref>). A specific mutation in β-Spec CH2 (L253P) has been shown to lower the energetic barrier between closed and open structural states, increasing the affinity of β-Spec for F-actin around 1000-fold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Avery et al., 2016</xref>), but it is unknown how β-Spec or β<sub>H</sub>-Spec conformational changes are normally regulated <italic>in vivo</italic> and whether both proteins share this regulatory feature. Additionally, phosphorylation of myosin regulatory light chain shifts myosin from a compact, autoinhibited conformation to a filamentous, active conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kiehart and Feghali, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Vasquez et al., 2016</xref>). The autoinhibited conformation binds F-actin very weakly (K<sub>D</sub>&gt;100 µM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Heissler and Manstein, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sellers et al., 1982</xref>) compared to the active conformation, suggesting that spectrin could outcompete autoinhibited myosin more effectively than active myosin for binding to F-actin. Our <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments used an active form of myosin. In addition, other factors including other actin-binding proteins and cytoskeletal tension are likely to influence the dynamic localization and actin-binding properties of both proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Duan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Greenberg et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>The competition between β<sub>H</sub>-Spec and myosin also provides key insights into how β<sub>H</sub>-Spec contributes to ratcheting of apical constriction. The apical constriction of cells in the ventral furrow that initiates <italic>Drosophila</italic> mesoderm invagination occurs through fast constriction pulses interrupted by pauses during which cells must stabilize their constricted state before reinitiating constriction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Martin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Xie and Martin, 2015</xref>). This ratcheting-like behavior is thought to be a consequence of the finite length of actin filaments. Myosin contracts the cytoskeleton by driving filaments past each other, and extensive contractions require release and reassociation with new pairs of filaments. β<sub>H</sub>-Spec participates in ratcheting of apical constriction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Krueger et al., 2020</xref>). When β<sub>H</sub>-Spec is knocked down, cells can undergo cycles of unratcheted apical constriction during which they alternately constrict and then expand. Consequently, most β<sub>H</sub>-Spec-depleted embryos fail to complete normal mesoderm invagination. It was proposed that the actin cross-linking function of β<sub>H</sub>-Spec could hold F-actin in place for the next cycle of myosin-mediated contraction, but this raises the question of how myosin and β<sub>H</sub>-Spec association with F-actin are coordinated so that β<sub>H</sub>-Spec prevents relaxation without interfering with constriction. Our results suggest a simple solution: since they compete for the same binding site, the release of myosin from F-actin at the end of a cycle of contraction would naturally be coupled to the accessibility of F-actin for binding by β<sub>H</sub>-Spec. Thus, the competition between myosin and β<sub>H</sub>-Spec for binding to F-actin enables myosin-mediated cell contraction to effectively alternate with β<sub>H</sub>-Spec-mediated stabilization.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title><italic>Drosophila</italic> genetics</title><p>Unless otherwise indicated, crosses were performed at 29°C.

A stock medium was prepared using Grace’s medium (Sigma, G9771) without sodium bicarbonate but with the addition of 5 mM Bis-Tris and the pH was adjusted to 6.6–6.7 at room temperature. This was stored at 4°C for less than a month. Before every experiment, we added 5% fetal bovine serum (Thermo Fisher, 10082147), penicillin-streptomycin (Thermo Fisher, #15070063, 100× stock solution), and 10 nM 20-hydroxy-ecdysone (Sigma, H5142) to the medium. Larvae were floated on 25% sucrose and transferred into glass dishes with culture medium. Larvae of the desired genotype were selected and sterilized in 70% ethanol for 1 min. Then, we drew a circle on the glass bottom of a 35 mm glass-bottomed Petri dish (MatTek, P35G-0-14C) using glue made by mixing heptane with tape (Tesa, 5388). Wing discs were dissected out of larvae, transferred into this Petri dish, and oriented using tungsten needles. Then, we covered the discs with a Cyclopore Polycarbonate membrane (GE Health, 7060-2513) and glued it to the glass bottom to immobilize discs. Discs were imaged every 0.2 s on a Perkin Elmer Ultraview spinning disc confocal microscope, and ablation of junctions was achieved using a Micropoint pulsed laser (Andor Technology) tuned to 365  nm. Paired cutting of junctions, one in the anterior compartment and another in the posterior compartment at a similar location, were performed and compared. The displacement of vertices for the first second after ablation was used to calculate the velocities.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Quantification and statistical analysis</title><p>To obtain the surface of the wing disc and remove signals from the peripodial epithelium, we used the MATLAB toolbox ImSAnE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Heemskerk and Streichan, 2015</xref>) to detect and isolate a slice of the disc epithelium that surrounds the AJs, using E-cad as a reference, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pan et al., 2016</xref>). The KstGFP, KstYFP, SqhGFP, and JubGFP images were created using ImSAnE.</p><p>For the fluorescence intensity heat maps, a custom MATLAB script was used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alégot et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alégot et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pan et al., 2018</xref>). The script generates a 3D mask with the normalization channel (E-cad) keeping only the relevant pixels. The wing disc center (intersection between AP/DV boundaries) is picked for each image manually. Then, the picture is split into blocks of a given xy size (3×3 µm<sup>2</sup>), starting from the center, and the average intensity per pixel of each channel is measured. The intensity of the reference channel and the channel of interest are normalized over their respective average intensity. The ratio of the channel of interest over the reference channel is then determined. To average several discs, only matrices of the same xy size blocks were used. The center of the disc serves as a reference point; smaller matrices were expanded to correspond to the size of the biggest matrix and filled with NaN (Not-a-Number). We determined the minimum number of values required (usually three) to average the ratio for a given position. This means that the edges of the average disk are composed of the same minimum number of values, which corresponds to the n given for each experiment. Finally, signals from several wing discs were averaged and represented by the heat map, and a posterior versus anterior ratio was calculated.</p><p>Pearson’s correlation coefficient was calculated to establish co-localization between different proteins by using the Coloc 2 Plugin for ImageJ (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://imagej.net/plugins/coloc-2">https://imagej.net/plugins/coloc-2</ext-link>).</p><p>Statistical significance was determined with GraphPad Prism software by performing Student’s t-test (for comparison between two observations) or analysis of variance (ANOVA) with p&lt;0.05 set as the criteria for significance.

The authors find that both βH-Spec and its canonical binding partner α-Spec reduce junctional localization of the protein Jub and thereby restrict Jub's inhibitory effect on Hippo signaling resulting in activation of the Hippo effector Yorkie regulating tissue shape and organ size. From genetic epistasis analysis and analysis of protein localization, the authors conclude that βH-Spec and α-Spec act independently in this regulation. The major point of this study is that the apical localization of βH-Spec and myosin is mutually exclusive and that the proteins antagonize each other's activity in wing discs. <italic>In vitro</italic> co-sedimentation assays and in silico structural modeling suggest that this antagonization is due to a competition of βH-Spec and myosin for F-actin binding.</p><p>The study's strengths are the genetic perturbation that is the basis for the epistasis analysis which includes specific knockdowns of the genes of interest as well as an elegant CRISPR-based overexpression system with great tissue specificity. The choice of the model for such an in-depth analysis of pathway dependencies in a well-characterized tissue makes it possible to identify and characterize quantitative differences between closely entangled and mutually dependent components. The method of quantifying protein localization and abundance is common for multiple figures which makes it easy to assess differences across experiments. The flow of experiments is logical and in general, the author's conclusions are supported by the presented data. The findings are very well embedded into the context of relevant literature and both confronting and confirming literature are discussed.</p><p>The study shows how components of the cytoskeleton are directly involved in the regulation of the mechanosensitive Hippo pathway in vivo and thus ultimately regulate organ size supporting previous data in other contexts. The molecular mechanism regulating myosin activity by out-competing it for F-actin binding has been observed for small actin-binding proteins such as cofilin but is a new mode for such a big, membrane-associated actin-binding protein. This may inspire future experiments in different morphogenetic contexts for the investigation of similar mechanisms. For example, the antagonistic activity of βH-Spec and myosin in this tissue context might help explain phenomena in other systems such as spectrin-dependent ratcheting of apical constriction during mesoderm invagination (as the authors discuss). Against the classical view, the work shows that βH-Spec can act independently of α-Spec. Together the results will be of interest to the cell biology community with a focus on the cytoskeleton and mechanotransduction.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.84918.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Ibar and colleagues address the role of the spectrin cytoskeleton in the regulation of tissue growth and Hippo signaling in an attempt to elucidate the underlying molecular mechanism(s) and reconcile existing data.

However, it is still formally possible that this could be a parallel pathway that is being masked by the strong phenotype of Ajuba RNAi flies.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: While it is formally true that the genetic requirement for Jub could reflect a role in parallel to, rather than downstream of, spectrins, our conclusion that spectrins act through Jub is based not only on the genetic requirement for Jub, but also on the influence of spectrins on junctional tension and Jub localization, which indicate that spectrins influence Jub activity in a manner consistent with their affecting the Hippo pathway through Jub.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>One of the major points of the manuscript is the observation that alpha- and beta-heavy-spectrin are potentially working independently and not as part of a spectrin tetramer. This is mostly dependent on the observation that alpha- and beta-heavy-spectrin appear to have non-overlapping localizations at the membrane and the fact that alpha- and beta-heavy-spectrin localize at the membrane seemingly independently. It is not entirely obvious that a potential lack of colocalization and the fact that protein localization at the membrane is not affected when the other partner is absent is sufficient to argue that alpha- and beta-heavy-spectrin do not form a complex. Moreover, it is possible that the spectrin complexes are only formed in specific conditions (e.g. by modulating tissue tension).</p></disp-quote><p>Response: Our results argue that alpha- and beta-heavy-spectrin do not form a detectable complex in the wing disc under the conditions examined, and thus that they act independently is this context. However, we agree that it is possible that they could function together contexts, eg in other tissues or under different conditions, and we have revised the text in the Discussion to note this.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>If indeed spectrins function independently, would it not be expected to see additive effects when both spectrins are depleted?</p></disp-quote><p>Response: Not necessarily, since both alpha- and beta-heavy-spectrin act through Jub, and there may be a limit as to how much Yki activity can be increased by Jub eg the increases in wing size induced by spectrin RNAi are similar to the increases in wing size observed with constitutive recruitment of Jub through alpha-catenin mutation (Alegot et al 2019).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Related to the two previous points, the fact that the authors suggest that both alpha- and beta-heavy-spectrin regulate Hippo signaling via Ajuba would be consistent with the necessity of an alpha- and beta-heavy-spectrin complex being formed. How would the authors explain that both spectrins require Ajuba function but work independently?</p></disp-quote><p>Response: The different spectrins both affect Jub because they both affect cytoskeletal tension, but our results suggest that they act in different ways to affect tension. We have made some revisions to the Discussion section to try to make this clearer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Another major point of the manuscript is the potential competition between beta-heavy-spectrin and myosin for F-actin binding. The authors suggest that there is a mutual antagonism between the two proteins regarding apical F-actin. However, this has not been formally assessed. Moreover, despite the arguments put forward in the discussion, it seems hard to justify a competition for F-actin when beta-heavy-spectrin seems to be unable to compete with myosin. Myosin can displace beta-heavy-spectrin from F-actin but the reciprocal effect seems unlikely given the <italic>in vitro</italic> data.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: We show <italic>in vivo</italic>, <italic>in vitro</italic>, and in silico data that are all consistent with the inference that beta-heavy-spectrin and myosin compete for binding to F-actin. As the reviewer notes, and as we discuss, the <italic>in vitro</italic> competition experiments were limited because, for technical reason, we were unable to increase the protein concentrations higher. We also note that our <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments used an active form of myosin, which binds F-actin much more strongly than inactive myosin.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>While the flow of experiments is logical in general, I see major problems regarding the structure of the manuscript and essential controls:</p><p>• It is very confusing to have samples (kst-CRISPRa) in figures 1-3 that were not introduced in the text until the second-last paragraph of the results. I would suggest introducing this elegant overexpression experiment early in the manuscript as it fits well in the scope of these experiments or alternatively (if the authors prefer) make a new figure containing all the data regarding the overexpression in the end.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: We have now moved these results to a new figure (new Fig 7) that is described later in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• At the beginning of the manuscript, essential controls regarding the knockdown efficiency are missing in the main figure. Many of the key experiments are based on KD and as a reader, I want to assess their efficiency. Only in Figure 4, at the end of the manuscript, KST and α-Spec KD efficiency is revealed - this should be shown earlier and quantified properly. While reading the manuscript in its current form, the doubt remains that differences e.g. in α-Spec and KST KD can be explained by varying knockdown efficiencies as their levels can't be assessed.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: We have now moved these results to a new supplemental figure (Fig 1-supplement 1) that is cited earlier in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• On a similar line, in Figure 5 where myosin activity is perturbed, induction or repression of myosin activity is only suggested but not formally shown. The authors have to demonstrate that this is indeed the case by showing the myosin signal, ideally accompanied by measurement of tissue tension.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: This was not included because we and others have assessed these manipulations in earlier publications. However, as requested we have now added a supplemental figure (Fig 6 supplement 1) showing myosin levels in these genotypes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• On p. 7, the authors claim that &quot;The epistasis of jub to kst suggests that βH-Spec regulates wing size through its tension-dependent regulation of Jub.&quot; While the authors show that KST KD increases myosin and junctional Jub, and that the wing overgrowth phenotype of KST KD depends on Jub, the tension-dependency was not demonstrated. To make that claim, the tension profile should be perturbed e.g. by overexpression of rok, myosin mutants (as the authors do in Fig 5) and the effect on Jub should be analyzed. Induction of tension in these conditions should be measured by laser ablation or a suitable alternative method. It might well be that the induction of Jub in KST KD is not via tension but an alternative mechanism such as the release of steric hindrance, interaction competition, etc. Also: Does KD of Jub affect spectrin localization?</p></disp-quote><p>Response: The effect of tension on Jub, and the effects of the myosin activity changes we employed on tension, have been analyzed in prior publications (eg Rauskolb et al 2014). To further address the issue raised by the reviewer here as to whether Kst affects Jub and wing growth via tension, we have also now added an additional experiment (Fig 3 supplement 1) in which we decreased tension in a βH-Spec RNAi wing disc by simultaneously expressing RNAi targeting Rok. The results show that the wing growth and Jub accumulation associated with βH-Spec RNAi are suppressed by Rok RNAi, consistent with our conclusion that these effects are mediated via cytoskeletal tension.</p><p>As KD of Jub alters the pattern of myosin accumulation in wing discs (Rauskolb et al 2019) it could be expected to have a complementary influence on βH-Spec localization, but we have not examined this.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• The authors make a very strong point in saying &quot;The influence of βH-Spec on junctional tension is thus a direct consequence of its competition with myosin for overlapping binding sites on F-actin.&quot; While the authors provide some <italic>in vitro</italic> and in silico evidence, it was for example not possible to outcompete myosin by increasing levels of KST CH1-CH2 domains <italic>in vitro</italic> (for possible reasons the authors discuss). More importantly, the hypothesis that competition for actin binding is the definite cause of the antagonizing effect was not tested in vivo. Overexpression of a mutant version of KST that is unable to bind F-actin, or that has an increased affinity (etc) for actin was not tested. Such an experiment would be very valuable to enrich this manuscript but at least, claims like that have to be less bold and need to be written in a more speculative language.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: We consider creating and analyzing mutant forms of Kst in vivo to be beyond the scope of this manuscript, but as suggested we have now modified the text highlighted by the Reviewer to be more cautious.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Further points:</p><p>• Why does the thickness of the wing disc epithelium change due to KST and α Spec KD, the authors should introduce this experiment better and draw a proper conclusion. Is there any relocalization of myosin along the apical-basal axis? Can the authors speculate about the differences between KST and α Spec KD?</p></disp-quote><p>Response: The epithelium thickness changes with α-Spec KD, but does not change with Kst KD. We think the explanation is provided by work from the Pan lab (done mainly in pupal eyes), which reported decreased cortical tension and increased apical area when α-Spec is lost. The interpretation in essence is that with the loss of attachment of F-actin to membranes along the lateral sides of the cells, the sides of the cells are &quot;softer&quot; and the cells expand laterally and thus also (by conservation of volume) shorten apical-basally. This is somewhat speculative, and it's not a focus of our study, but we have added some text to try to explain this better. Myosin along apical-basal axis was not visibly altered, but it is harder to analyze as it is very weak compared to junctional myosin.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• Given the authors' observation of differences in the relative localization of KST and α Spec (Figure 4), proper quantification of KST, α Spec and myosin levels along the apical-basal cell axis would be important. This would also ease data interpretation.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: We have now added a higher resolution image and also a line scan of Kst, α-Spec and Myo in a new supplemental figure (Fig 6 supplement 1)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• KD of α Spec seems to induce myosin activity more, causes a bigger reduction of wing thickness, a stronger induction of Jub, and a similar effect on wing size. What lead the authors to focus on KST rather than α Spec regarding the detailed analysis of myosin competition?</p></disp-quote><p>Response: Our observations identify a competition between Kst and myosin, but we have no indication that α-Spec competes with myosin. (It's conceivable that β-Spec might also compete with myosin in some contexts, but wing discs would not be a good place to examine this because the localization profiles of β-Spec and Myosin are so different).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• A big criticism regarding the figures is the bad color choice which makes it difficult to decipher the fluorescent signals. Likewise, the labels are difficult to read with the present coloring. They should really be changed.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: We have now changed the single color images to gray scale (for multi-color images we retain RGB coloring).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A minor point:</p><p>• To make the manuscript more accessible for researchers outside the <italic>Drosophila</italic> field, I'd suggest adding explanatory labels for <italic>Drosophila</italic>-specific terms such as hyperactive myosin for sqhEE, a scheme to show where UAS-dcr2 is active, explain the purpose of Rfp expression as a control for tissue specificity, etc.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: We have added some explanations to the text to try to make this clearer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Major points:</p><p>In lines 99-101, the authors mention that Deng et al., 2015 report that the depletion of spectrins leads to an increase in pMLC, with no associated changes in the colocalization of myosin and F-actin. It is more accurate to mention that Deng et al. suggest that the levels of a GFP-tagged rescue construct of MLC (Sqh) are unchanged in alpha-spectrin mutants, although this was not formally quantified. Moreover, there was not a formal assessment of colocalization between MLC and F-actin, but rather a suggestion that F-actin levels are unaffected by the alpha-spectrin mutation. Finally, Deng et al. mostly analyzed alpha-spectrin so it remains possible that the new results shown by the authors are compatible with the initial observations from Deng and colleagues.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: As suggested, we revised the text to note that Deng et al., 2015 specifically examined Sqh:GFP. While we agree that our focus is more on Kst and Deng et al focused on α-Spec, we also examined α-Spec, and as described our results examining Myosin and Jub differ from what was reported by Deng et al 2015.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>As mentioned above, it is still possible that spectrins and Ajuba are working in parallel and Ajuba is not necessarily downstream of spectrins. The strong phenotype of Ajuba RNAi flies in adult wings could mask the effect of spectrins. Are the results similar in other settings, such as in the absence of Dicer2? Also, can Ajuba RNAi phenotypes be modified by overexpression of spectrins? This would provide further evidence of a link to Ajuba function.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: While formally it is true that the genetic requirement for Jub could reflect a role in parallel to, rather than downstream of, spectrins, our conclusion that spectrins act through Jub is based not only on the genetic requirement for Jub, but also on the influence of spectrins on junctional tension and Jub localization, which indicate that spectrins influence Jub activity in a manner consistent with their affecting the Hippo pathway through Jub.</p><p>We would not expect over-expression of spectrins in a jub RNAi background to further reduce Hippo signaling, and as the jub RNAi phenotype is much stronger than the Kst over-expression phenotype even if there were an effect it would likely be difficult to detect.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Regarding the potential independent functions of spectrins, it would be interesting to determine if alpha- and beta-heavy-spectrin can still interact at the level of the AJ despite the fact that their distributions appear to be partly non-overlapping. Would it be possible to assess this using PLA? If an interaction is not detected via PLA, it would be more convincing that spectrins are functioning independently.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: We have now performed this experiment, and no significant signal was detected by PLA. As a control, we used identical antibodies (GFP and α-Spec) to conduct PLA on α-Spec and β-Spec, and we did detect signal by PLA. These results (included in a revised Figure 4) further support the conclusion that α-Spec and βH-Spec are not physically associated in wing discs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Related to this point, if the spectrins work independently, it is reasonable to assume that they could display additive effects. Is this the case? If alpha- and beta-heavy-spectrin are simultaneously depleted are the phenotypes more severe than either depletion alone?</p></disp-quote><p>Response: We disagree here. Since both alpha- and beta-heavy-spectrin act through tension and Jub, and there is likely a limit as to how much Yki activity can be increased by this pathway. For example, the increases in wing size induced by spectrin RNAi are similar to the increases in wing size observed with constitutive recruitment of Jub through alpha-catenin mutation (Alegot et al 2019), which may thus represent the maximum increase that can be induced through this pathway (as there are multiple, independent factors that regulate Hippo signaling).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Authors should modulate membrane tension and assess if this affects the localization of alpha- and beta-heavy-spectrin and, specifically, their colocalization, as their interaction could be regulated.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: As reported, we do see effects of tension on βH-Spec localization. We would not expect significant effects of membrane tension on α-Spec localization, but we consider analysis of this outside the scope of this manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In lines 185-187, the authors mention that beta-spectrin depletion does not affect beta-heavy-spectrin localization. Interestingly, Figure 4E appears to show that the levels of Kst-YFP appear to be lower in the beta-spectrin-depleted tissue. The localization of beta-heavy-spectrin is not necessarily affected but the overall levels could be.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: Indeed the levels appear slightly lower, but elucidating the reason for this will require further experiments that are beyond the scope of this manuscript (we suspect it is because cytoskeletal tension increases in β-Spec-depleted tissue as it does in α-Spec depleted tissue, which based on our observations should decrease levels of Kst at near junctions). The key point of these experiments was to show that α-Spec localization does not require βH-Spec, but does require β-Spec, which supports our conclusion that in wing discs α-Spec forms a complex with β-Spec but not with βH-Spec.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In lines 200-203, the authors state that beta-heavy-spectrin and myosin colocalize extensively at the apical region. However, this colocalization is not as clear as stated. Do the authors have alternative data that suggests that the two proteins are indeed colocalizing? Would it be possible to perform PLA to detect a potential colocalization?</p></disp-quote><p>Response: Unfortunately we do not have antibodies against both proteins that work well enough for PLA. However, we quantified the co-localization by analysis of Pearson's correlation coefficient, as reported in the manuscript. We also added an additional higher magnification image, and a line scan, in a supplemental figure (Fig. 6 supplement 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Authors should try to assess and quantify colocalization with F-actin for both beta-heavy-spectrin and myosin in wild-type conditions and when the levels (and/or activity) for each of them are modulated.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: We have added quantification of the co-localization of βH-Spec with F-actin and of myosin with F-actin to the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor points:</p><p>In lines 122-124, the authors should clarify the relevance of the observation that alpha-spectrin knockdown affects the thickness of the wing disc epithelium.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: We have added some text to try to elaborate on this.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In the intro, it is perhaps necessary to mention that there are conflicting reports regarding the role of spectrins in the regulation of cell proliferation, at least in the follicular epithelium. For instance, Ng et al., 2016 argued that spectrins do not regulate cell proliferation in FECs.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: Rather than wading into a detailed discussion of issues that are peripheral to this study, we modified the text in the Introduction to avoid implying that spectrins control cell proliferation in the ovary.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Figures 1, 2, 3, and 4 (and respective supplements), it is encouraged that, wherever appropriate, the authors mark the different compartments or the relevant boundary using dashed lines, to more clearly indicate the regions to compare.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: We have now done this.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Figure 2, supplement 1 panels C and D should have an indication of the genotype for clarity.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: We have now added this.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In lines 362-367, the authors suggest that other actin-binding proteins are likely to influence the role of beta-heavy-spectrin.
