~2000 OR alleles in the mouse genome in a probabilistic, yet stereotypic fashion. Here, we propose that topographic restrictions in OR expression are established in neuronal progenitors by two opposing forces: polygenic transcription and genomic silencing, both of which are influenced by dorsoventral gradients of transcription factors NFIA, B, and X. Polygenic transcription of OR genes may define spatially constrained OR repertoires, among which one OR allele is selected for singular expression later in development. Heterochromatin assembly and genomic compartmentalization of OR alleles also vary across the axes of the olfactory epithelium and may preferentially eliminate ectopically expressed ORs with more dorsal expression destinations from this ‘privileged’ repertoire. Our experiments identify early transcription as a potential ‘epigenetic’ contributor to future developmental patterning and reveal how two spatially responsive probabilistic processes may act in concert to establish deterministic, precise, and reproducible territories of stochastic gene expression.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>olfaction</kwd><kwd>chromatin</kwd><kwd>nuclear architecture</kwd><kwd>patterning</kwd><kwd>heterochromatin</kwd><kwd>genomics</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000055</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01DC018745</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lomvardas</surname><given-names>Stavros</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100015326</institution-id><institution>Common Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U01DA052783</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lomvardas</surname><given-names>Stavros</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100012636</institution-id><institution>New York State Stem Cell Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>C030133</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gronostajski</surname><given-names>Richard M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100012636</institution-id><institution>New York State Stem Cell Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>C30290GG</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gronostajski</surname><given-names>Richard M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>The BRAIN Initiative</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U19NS112953</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fleischmann</surname><given-names>Alexander</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000055</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01DC013561</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Barnea</surname><given-names>Gilad</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Dorsoventral gradients of transcription factors NFIA, B, and X impose epigenetic and transcriptional spatial restrictions to olfactory receptor expression.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The development of multicellular organisms relies on gene expression programs that are precisely regulated in space and time. To transform probabilistic biochemical reactions, such as transcription and translation, into reproducible differentiation processes, plants, and animals convert individual cellular variability into predictable cell population averages. Yet, there are cases in biology where gene expression variability is desirable, as it generates diverse cellular identities that are difficult to obtain with deterministic gene regulation. For example, the production of antibodies via VDJ recombination, and evasion of immunological responses by antigenic variation represent biological systems that seek utmost randomness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ba et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Borst, 2002</xref>). Other biological functions, however, benefit from balancing absolute determinism with complete randomness, producing biased stochasticity. Genetically encoded biased stochasticity is often observed in the nervous system, where gene expression choices generated by neurons must integrate into functional and reproducible circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Courgeon and Desplan, 2019</xref>). In fly ommatidia, for example, biased randomness preserves a ratio of photoreceptor neuron identities across animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Johnston and Desplan, 2014</xref>), whereas in mammals, random Protocadherin promoter choice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Canzio and Maniatis, 2019</xref>), was recently shown to obey spatial patterns in the mouse neocortex, assuring proper tiling between neighboring neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lv et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>Mammalian OR gene choice provides an extreme case of hardwired biased randomness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Buck and Axel, 1991</xref>). OR transcription starts in neuronal progenitors of the main olfactory epithelium (MOE), which transiently express 5–15 ORs out of &gt;1000 OR genes distributed in genomic clusters across chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hanchate et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Saraiva et al., 2015</xref>). As these progenitor cells differentiate into post-mitotic olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs), they switch from polygenic to monogenic and monoallelic OR transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chess et al., 1994</xref>). This transition is mediated by the assembly of a multi-chromosomal enhancer hub over the chosen OR allele (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lomvardas et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Markenscoff-Papadimitriou et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Monahan et al., 2019</xref>), followed by the stabilizing effects of an OR-elicited feedback signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lyons et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dalton et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Serizawa et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Shykind et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lewcock and Reed, 2004</xref>). During this developmental progression, heterochromatic silencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Magklara et al., 2011</xref>) and genomic OR compartmentalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Clowney et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Le Gros et al., 2016</xref>) act together to assure that the non-chosen OR alleles will remain transcriptionally repressed for the life of the OSN. Interestingly, the position of the OSN across the dorsoventral (DV) axis of the MOE predisposes this singular transcriptional choice towards a group of 50–250 OR genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tan and Xie, 2018</xref>), providing reproducible topographic restrictions in OR expression. The anatomical segments of the MOE that express a specific collection of OR identities are known as ‘zones,’ with their total number varying from 4 to 9, depending on the analyses and criteria used to define them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ressler et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Vassar et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Miyamichi et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zapiec and Mombaerts, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ruiz Tejada Segura et al., 2022</xref>). Although zonal restrictions in OR expression have a well-established influence on the wiring of the olfactory circuit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sullivan et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sullivan et al., 1995</xref>), the mechanisms that bias this singular transcriptional choice towards specific OR identities remain unknown.</p><p>Here, we identified genetically encoded mechanisms that introduce topographic biases in OR gene regulation. We report that OSN progenitor cells from various MOE segments transcribe OR mixtures consisting of ORs with the corresponding or with more dorsal expression identities. Ectopic expression of dorsal identity ORs at the polygenic stage of OR transcription is rectified during differentiation by preferential genomic silencing that is skewed towards ORs with more dorsal expression identities than the identity of the OSN. Patterns of polygenic OR transcription and genomic OR silencing are influenced by gradients of transcription factors NFI A, B, and X (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gronostajski, 2000</xref>). Triple NFI (NFIA, B, and X) deletion both eliminates heterochromatic silencing and genomic compartmentalization from ORs with ventral identities, as well as extinguishes their transcription in olfactory progenitors. Furthermore, spatial transcriptomics revealed a dramatic expansion of dorsomedial identity OR expression towards the ventral MOE and reciprocal transcriptional reduction of ventral identity ORs in triple NFI knockouts (cKOs), suggesting that patterns of genomic OR silencing and polygenic OR transcription influence OR gene choice. Indeed, transcriptional induction of an OR allele in OSN progenitors biases the choice towards this allele in mature OSNs (mOSNs) throughout the MOE. Strikingly, by modulating the levels of OR induction in progenitor cells we can restrict the expression of this OR allele to more dorsal OSNs, where heterochromatic silencing and genomic compartmentalization are less prevalent. Thus, our studies reveal that position-responsive OR transcription in OSN progenitors may act as an ‘epigenetic’ signal for future singular choice among the previously transcribed ORs. Moreover, our data suggest that polygenic OR transcription and heterochromatic silencing/genomic compartmentalization could act as opposing regulatory ‘heostats’ that determine in a spatially influenced fashion the exact OR repertoire that is available for stochastic singular choice in mature OSNs.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>OSN progenitors co-transcribe an increasing number of zonal OR identities toward the ventral MOE</title><p>The mouse MOE is divided into a limited series of stereotypic segments, based on the expression of OR genes, that exhibit bilateral symmetry between the two nasal cavities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

Intricate invaginations of the MOE occurring during embryonic development and early postnatal growth convolute this dorsoventral segmentation pattern, especially when viewing coronal sections of the MOE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

However, before the onset of singular OR expression, mitotically active OSN progenitors, the immediate neuronal precursor (INP) cells, co-express multiple lowly expressed ORs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hanchate et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Saraiva et al., 2015</xref>). To determine whether zonal restrictions are operational from this polygenic stage of OR transcription, we performed plate-based single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) analysis of FAC-sorted OSNs and OSN progenitors isolated from the MOE, which was micro-dissected into two parts: a more dorsal (zone 1–2) and a more ventral (zone 3–5) segment.

We first detect OR mRNAs in INP3 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), which consistently transcribe multiple ORs. Next, we examined the zonal identity of ORs co-transcribed within individual dorsal or ventral INP3 cells. We created a separate category for the ~100 ‘class I’ OR genes, which were grouped based on homology and resemblance to OR genes first identified in fish. Virtually all class I OR genes are expressed in zone 1, but their expression is likely regulated though a separate mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hirota et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Enomoto et al., 2019</xref>), thus we chose to analyze them separately. Surprisingly, while dorsally positioned INPs transcribe almost exclusively dorsal identity ORs, ventrally positioned INPs transcribe complex mixtures consisting of ORs of every zonal identity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–D</xref>). Overall, ventral INPs transcribe a greater number of OR genes compared to dorsal INPs. Focusing on OR genes detected with at least three unique transcripts, we detect dorsal identity ORs in 43 ventral INP cells and ventral identity ORs in only 29 of them, while dorsal INP cells express predominantly dorsal ORs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–D</xref>). Moreover, as the ventral INPs differentiate to iOSNs, dorsal identity OR transcription is replaced by the ‘correct’ (zone-appropriate) ventral OR transcription, culminating in singular expression of an OR allele with the correct zonal identity in mOSNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). These observations were independently confirmed by bulk RNA-seq on FAC-sorted INP and mOSN cells extracted from trisected dorsal (zone 1), dorsomedial (zone 2–3), and ventral (zone 4–5) MOE, using the same labeling and FAC-sorting approach used for the single-cell experiments. This bulk analysis showed that in every case INPs co-transcribe ORs with the correct as well as more dorsal zonal identities, while further differentiation replaces dorsal ORs with ORs of the correct identity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). This finding immediately poses mechanistic questions about the process that shuts off dorsal ORs and enhances the transcription of the ORs expected to be expressed in each MOE segment.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Heterochromatin eliminates ectopically expressed ORs along the dorsoventral MOE axis</title><p>We previously showed that OSN differentiation coincides with heterochromatin-mediated OR gene silencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Magklara et al., 2011</xref>). If heterochromatinization contributes to singular OR choice by eliminating every non-chosen OR allele transcribed in INPs, then in any MOE segment silencing should be preferentially applied to ORs with the correct or more dorsal zonal identities. We performed native ChIP-seq in the MOE to determine the deposition of histone marks associated with heterochromatin including H3K9me3, a marker of constitutive heterochromatin, and H3K79me3, which we also found labeling heterochromatin on OR gene clusters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Markenscoff-Papadimitriou et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Monahan et al., 2017</xref>). We predicted that dorsal-most identity (zone 1) ORs, which are expressed in INPs throughout the MOE, should have the highest levels of heterochromatin, whereas ventral-most identity (zone 5) ORs, which are transcribed only in ventral INPs, should have the lowest, with the rest of the OR repertoire having intermediate levels of heterochromatin marks. Indeed, visual inspection of ChIP-seq genomic tracks along OR gene clusters with mixed zonal constitution reveals the highest H3K9me3/H3K79me3 levels on the dorsal identity OR genes and the lowest on the ventral identity OR genes of the cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Aggregate ChIP-seq analysis of all the OR genes grouped by their zonal identities corroborates the gradual reduction of H3K9me3 and H3K79me3 enrichment from dorsal to ventral ORs for the whole OR repertoire (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). The only exception from this pattern is found at the dorsally expressed class I ORs, which rely on different regulatory mechanisms than the canonical class II ORs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hirota et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Enomoto et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Finally, using the FACS-based strategy described earlier, we confirmed that both heterochromatic marks are predominantly deposited during the INP to iOSN transition, simultaneously with the transition from polygenic to singular, zonally appropriate OR expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

We performed ChIP-seq in mOSNs isolated from dissected dorsal (zone 1), dorsomedial (zone 2–3), and ventral (zone 4–5) segments of the MOE. In each segment, OR genes with either the correct or more dorsal zonal identities had a higher level of heterochromatin compared to more ventral identity ORs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Intriguingly, this is the same zonal pattern observed for OR gene transcription in INP cells. Only the OR gene identities able to be transcribed in the INP cells of a given zonal MOE segment acquire heterochromatin. Thus, most OR genes are heterochromatic in ventral OSNs; dorsal and dorsomedial identity OR genes are heterochromatic in dorsomedial OSNs; and only dorsal identity OR genes have some heterochromatin in dorsal OSNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Although each zonal identity OR group is heterochromatic in the MOE segment where it is expressed by mOSNs, the level of H3K9me3/H3K79me3 enrichment is lower than in more ventral segments, where it is not chosen for stable expression. Thus, dorsal identity ORs have less heterochromatin in dorsal OSNs than in the rest of the MOE, and dorsomedial identity ORs have less heterochromatin in dorsomedial OSNs than ventral OSNs. Similarly, at the ventral end of the DV axis, ventral identity ORs have less heterochromatin than dorsal and dorsomedial identity ORs. Detection of heterochromatin on OR genes with the correct zonal identity is not counterintuitive, as only one OR allele from the ones co-transcribed will be eventually chosen, and the rest must be silenced. Thus, in a pure population of ventral mOSNs expressing <italic>Olfr1507</italic> (a ventral, zone 5 identity OR), the remaining non-chosen zone 5 identity OR genes are silenced with the same level of heterochromatin as OR genes with more dorsal zonal identities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>). In other words, in every MOE segment, OR heterochromatinization is preserved only for the ORs that have the potential to be expressed and is not applied to more ventral ORs, which were not transcriptionally active in INPs. This is consistent with recent reports of heterochromatin marks being detected on trace amine-associated receptor (TAAR) genes only in TAAR-expressing OSNs and not the rest of the MOE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fei et al., 2021</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>DV gradient of OR gene compartmentalization follows patterns of heterochromatin assembly</title><p>Heterochromatic OR genes converge into multi-chromosomal genomic aggregates of extreme chromatin compaction that contribute to the effective and stable silencing of non-chosen ORs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Clowney et al., 2012</xref>). We thus asked if the spatially determined pattern of OR heterochromatinization at the linear genome coincides with a similar pattern of 3D genomic compartmentalization. We performed in situ Hi-C in FAC-sorted mOSNs isolated from MOE segments along the DV axis and determined the frequency with which OR genes form long-range interactions in each segment. We saw a striking resemblance between the deposition of heterochromatic marks on OR genes and genomic compartmentalization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>). For example, inspection of the long range <italic>cis</italic> genomic interactions between 3 OR gene clusters on chromosome 2 shows that a cluster of predominately ventral identity OR genes is recruited to OR compartments only in ventral OSNs, where they are heterochromatic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). In contrast, the other two OR gene clusters, which are either enriched for dorsal ORs, or have mixed constitution, make strong genomic contacts with each other in all three MOE segments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). To expand this analysis to every OR, we measured the frequency of interchromosomal <italic>trans</italic> genomic interactions between OR genes with different DV identities. To do so, we annotated each OR gene cluster bin at 50 kb resolution according to the zonal identity of the residing ORs and plotted the average interchromosomal contacts between bins of different constitution, excluding class I OR genes, which formed very few contacts with other ORs. This analysis yielded the same conclusion: Interactions between dorsal OR genes is the default in every OSN, whereas compartmentalization for the remaining of the OR repertoire increases along the DV axis of the MOE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Intriguingly, as with levels of heterochromatin, we detect the following recurrent pattern of OR compartmentalization: every OR has intermediate Hi-C contact frequencies with other OR genes in their segment of expression in the MOE, lower Hi-C contact frequencies in more dorsal MOE segments, and higher Hi-C contacts in more ventral segments.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Zonal olfactory receptor (OR) compartmentalization permits OR genes from more ventral zones to be recruited into the OR compartment.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) In situ Hi-C contact matrices of a 90 Mb region of chromosome 2 that contains three large OR gene clusters, depicted with boxes under the contact matrices.

We performed Dip-C in 48 dorsal and 48 ventral mOSNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). To retain allelic information, we used heterozygous mice from a cross between <italic>Omp-IRES-GFP</italic> (a mOSN reporter) and Castaneous (Cas) mice, and used Cas-specific SNPs to distinguish Cas from non-Cas alleles. Analyzing single-cell genomic contacts, we saw a greater enrichment of contacts between OR gene loci in ventral cells relative to dorsal cells, consistent with our bulk Hi-C data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). We then used the haplotype resolved chromatin contacts to compute distances of all genomic loci at 20 kb resolution, from which we generated 3D genome structures for all cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tan et al., 2019</xref>). Analyzing distances between pairs of OR loci in the 3D genome structures we determined the size and complexity of OR compartments in each cell. We confirmed that OR compartments in ventral mOSNs are larger and contain more OR genes from more chromosomes than in dorsal mOSNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Importantly, in each cell, significantly fewer ventral identity OR genes were found in OR compartments compared to dorsal (zone 1) or dorsomedial (zone 2–3) identity OR genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>). From this result we can conclude that the ‘stronger’ Hi-C contacts among dorsal ORs observed in bulk, represent an increased number of dorsal ORs participating in OR compartments in each OSN. Thus, extrapolating Dip-C results to H3K9me3/H3K79me3 enrichment, we conclude that ‘intermediate’ silencing levels of each OR group in their own zone likely reflect less frequent silencing of these ORs than ORs with more dorsal zonal identities. In this note, OR compartmentalization is highly probabilistic, with each one of the 48 dorsal and ventral OSNs having unique maps of OR-OR genomic interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A–B</xref>). Thus, we propose that the balance between two probabilistic yet DV-responsive processes, early transcription and genomic silencing, may define the OR ensemble that is available for singular choice along the DV axis.

RNA-seq analysis of the FAC-sorted cKO OSNs from the whole MOE revealed significant transcriptional reduction of ventral OR identities and reciprocal increase of dorsomedial ORs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). In contrast, triple NFI deletion only in mOSNs, using the <italic>Omp-IRES-Cre</italic> driver, has no measurable effects on OR expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). To determine whether the reduced transcription of ventral ORs reflects a developmental defect of ventral OSN differentiation, versus a <italic>bona fide</italic> dorsalization of ventral OSNs, we performed RNA-seq in cKO OSNs isolated specifically from ventral MOE microdissections. This experiment revealed ectopic expression of OR genes with dorsomedial zonal identities in place of the OR genes with proper ventral ones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>), a result confirmed by immunofluorescence (IF) experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D–E</xref>). This transcriptional transformation of ventral OSNs satisfies the original criteria of homeosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bateson, 1894</xref>), since the overall mOSN identity is not altered by the triple NFI deletion: Only 13 out of ~200 OSN-specific genes are significantly different with at least a twofold change between control and cKO OSNs, and 113/207 non-OR ventral markers are still highly expressed in the ventral-most zones, acting as independent fiducial markers for our zonal dissection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1F</xref>).

Since our goal was to decipher zonal patterns of OR expression across the dorsoventral MOE axis without requirements for single-cell resolution, we opted for the Visium Spatial Gene Expression workflow (10 X Genomics) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Ståhl et al., 2016</xref>). This workflow is ideal for the interrogation of spatial OR expression in mOSNs, as OR mRNAs are highly abundant and readily detectable in most spatial spots that contain OSN mRNAs. For increased stringency, we only included spatial spots that include more than two OR genes and three OR transcripts. We analyzed 2 MOE sections each from an NFI ABX triple cKO and age-matched control mouse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Expression data on OR genes were normalized and integrated across replicates (see methods). We performed PCA analysis, by which spatial spots were arranged in five clusters in control and cKO MOEs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Interestingly, while dimensionality reduction and unbiased clustering generated OR clusters that correspond to zonal patterns of OR expression (i.e. each cluster contains OR genes with one zonal identity) in control MOEs, only dorsal-most zone 1/class I OR genes followed this correlation in cKO MOEs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). The other 4 clusters in the cKO homogenously express dorsomedial zone 2–4 ORs, with expanded expression of zone 2 ORs in every cluster and complete loss of ventral-most zone 5 OR expression. Thus, conditional triple NFI deletion causes loss of spatial patterning for zone 2–4 OR genes and loss of expression for zone 5 OR genes, without influencing the expression of zone 1 ORs.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Spatial transcriptomics shows dorsalization and homogenization of the main olfactory epithelium (MOE) upon NFI A, B, and X deletion.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic depicting our analysis pipeline: Spatial transcriptomics was performed on sections of wt control and NFI ABX conditional knockout (cKO) MOE.

The same clusters were generated for NFI cKO sample (right heatmap). Although cluster 1 expresses exclusively zone 1 ORs, like in control MOEs, clusters 2–5 exhibit homogenous OR expression, with ventral expansion of zone 2/3 ORs, and reduced representation of zone 4/5 ORs.

We then overlaid the corresponding values against the histological images of the control (wt) and NFI ABX cKO MOEs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). As observed in the clustering and heatmap analysis, dorsal-most zone 1 OR expression is confined to the same anatomical region for both samples.

Unlike control MOEs, where spot assignment reproduces zonal anatomical positions, most spatial spots in the cKO MOEs, excluding the unchanged zone 1, are assigned a zone 2 identity.

Our experiments so far have identified three spatially responsive processes that may contribute to the dorsoventral patterning of OR gene choice: polygenic OR transcription in INPs, OR heterochromatinization, and genomic compartmentalization during the INP to iOSN transition. Thus, we explored the effects of triple NFI deletion in all three processes. First, we investigated the effects of NFI deletion on OR heterochromatinization with ChIP-seq in triple NFI cKO OSNs from the ventral-most MOE segments. ChIP-seq revealed an almost complete loss of heterochromatin from ventral ORs as well as a reduction on zone 3 dorsomedial ORs in NFI cKO ventral OSNs and INPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1F–G</xref>).

In contrast, dorsal ORs did not exhibit strong changes in ChIP-seq and Hi-C contacts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and B</xref>). Strikingly, in both processes, heterochromatin assembly and genomic compartmentalization, the patterns observed in ventral OSNs upon NFI deletion are similar to those observed in dorsomedial OSNs from the control MOEs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A–B</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>NFI A, B, and X regulate chromatin state and olfactory receptor (OR) compartment formation .</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Native ChIP-seq for H3K9me3 (top) and H3K79me3 (bottom) in NFI ABX knockout mature OSNs (mOSNs) from ventral main olfactory epithelium (MOE).

In fact, the vast majority of mOSNs from zones 1–4 are GFP<sup>+</sup>, and only in the ventral-most zone 5 we detect a more sporadic pattern of ectopic <italic>Olfr17</italic> choice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D and E</xref>). We hypothesized that reduced frequency of ectopic <italic>Olfr17</italic> expression in the most ventral segment reflects the fact that heterochromatin levels and genomic compartmentalization of this dorsomedial OR allele is highest at this MOE segment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>). This immediately suggests that the balance between transcriptional activation and heterochromatic silencing during INP to iOSN transition determines whether an OR can be chosen for singular expression. If this hypothesis is correct, then reducing <italic>Olfr17</italic> transcription in INP/iOSN cells should preferentially prohibit ectopic <italic>Olfr17</italic> expression in ventral MOE segments, where heterochromatic silencing is stronger. To test this, we pharmacologically manipulated tTA activity using a low level of doxycycline (1 ug/ml in water) administered throughout gestation and postnatal life of the mouse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>), which reduces but does not eliminate tTA-driven transcription.

The solution to the perplexing segmentation of the MOE into distinct and reproducible territories of OR expression may be the following: polygenic OR transcription in neuronal progenitors highlights a small group of ORs that can be chosen for singular expression later in development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>). In each MOE segment this OR mixture includes ORs that should be expressed in mOSNs of the segment, as well as ORs that are only expressed in more dorsal MOE segments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>). As these progenitor cells differentiate into iOSNs, heterochromatic silencing may preferentially decommission from this mixture more dorsal ORs, and with lower efficiency, ORs that could be expressed in the segment, biasing this singular choice towards a spatially appropriate OR repertoire (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>). Our scRNA-seq analysis revealed two vectors in the determination of the OR ensemble that is co-transcribed in each OSN progenitor: chance, as every OR combination is unique, and determinism, as the overall zonal identities of the co-transcribed OR mixtures are informed by the position of the progenitor cell along the dorsoventral axis. Similarly, analysis of OR gene compartments with Hi-C revealed that genomic silencing also follows skewed patterns, eliminating preferentially ORs with more dorsal expression signatures than ORs that could be expressed in each zone, while Dip-C suggests that OR compartmentalization also retains an element of skewed randomness. The final product of these opposing probabilistic ‘rheostats’ may be the generation of gene expression programs that do not have sufficient resolution to determine which specific OR will be chosen in every OSN but are precise enough to generate reproducible dorsoventral expression territories for each one of the ~1400 OR genes. Recent reports describing opposing effects of chromatin compaction and transcriptional activation in the probabilistic expression patterns of the Spineless gene in R7 photoreceptors argue for the generality of this regulatory principle in vertebrates and invertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Voortman et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>We identified gradients of transcription factors NFI A, B, and X as partial orchestrators of the dorsoventral patterning of OR expression, which they establish as follows: they contribute to the silencing of some dorsomedial (primarily zone 3) ORs; they activate both polygenic transcription and silencing of ventral (zone 4 and 5) ORs; and they have no influence on the expression of dorsal-most (class I and zone 1) ORs. Without NFI transcription factors, the majority of the MOE, excluding dorsal-most zone 1, defaults to a zone 2 identity. Given that NFI factors are predominantly known as regulators of embryonic and adult stem cell biology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Clark et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adam et al., 2020</xref>), it is surprising that in the olfactory system, their deletion does not interfere with the maintenance of stem cell populations, but with the OR expression patterns in post-mitotic, fully differentiated mOSNs. Interestingly, triple NFI deletion after the onset of singular OR choice has no effect on OR patterning, consistent with the emerging model that OR specification takes place exclusively at the INP to iOSN transition, and the notion that these patterning factors are not required for maintenance of OR transcription. Thus, we speculate that singular OR gene choice in OSNs can be executed by the common nucleoprotein complex of Lhx2/Ebf/Ldb1 bound to the multi-enhancer hub, consistent with the fact that we detect hubs of similar constitution associating with active ORs in different zones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Monahan et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>A question emerging from these observations is why not use the same transcription factor gradients to regulate both polygenic and monogenic OR transcription? The answer is likely related to the absolute requirement for transcriptional singularity: transcription factor gradients can transcribe specific OR mixtures in a DV-responsive fashion, but they cannot activate only a single OR promoter among the many they can bind to. But even if singularity was achievable by transcription factor combinations and the OR-elicited feedback, OR promoters with the strongest binding motifs would be consistently chosen first, excluding ORs with weaker promoters in a ‘winner takes all’ model. This would result in preferential choice of specific ORs, reduced diversity in OR representation, and a narrower sensory spectrum for the olfactory system. With the process revealed here, any OR promoter activated in INPs/iOSNs is probabilistically chosen for singular expression in OSNs. Thus, by segregating OR gene regulation into two stages, polygenic transcription in progenitor cells and singular choice in OSNs, the olfactory system can impose deterministic biases while assuring equitable receptor representation. Of course, this system has limitations in preserving transcriptional equity: artificial transcriptional induction of an OR allele in OSN progenitors under the powerful tetO promoter bypasses these constraints and results in a biased choice of this allele in most mOSNs. This immediately suggests that <italic>cis</italic> OR regulatory elements are subject to selective pressure that preserves their weak transcriptional activation properties, explaining why robust OR transcription in mOSNs requires the assembly of interchromosomal multi-enhancer hubs.</p><p>In this note, zones may also have evolved to satisfy the requirement for distributed OR representation: if dorsal-most ORs, which are detected in every OSN progenitor regardless of DV origin, have the most frequently activated promoters, then silencing them in more ventral MOE segments assures that other OR identities will also have the chance to be expressed. Consistent with this model is the observation that mutations on the Lhx2 or Ebf binding sites of the promoter of dorsal OR M71 result in less frequent and more ventral M71 expression patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rothman et al., 2005</xref>). Thus, DV segmentation of the MOE may serve as a mechanism that prevents ORs with stronger differences in promoter strength from competing for singular expression, assuring that every OR is expressed at meaningful, for odor perception, frequencies. In addition, as our spatial transcriptomic data showed, zonal regulation assures that ORs are expressed in a reproducibly patterned fashion in the MOE. While in wild-type mice unbiased machine learning approaches identify at least five distinct OR expression patterns, in the triple NFI cKO mice these patterns become intermixed for all but zone 1 ORs. With recent observations arguing that individual mitral cells, the second-order neurons in the olfactory circuit, have patterned projections in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chen et al., 2022</xref>), non-random OR expression in the MOE may contribute to putative hardwired components of odor perception and valence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kobayakawa et al., 2007</xref>).</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Polygenic OR transcription as the arbiter between OR gene silencing and OR gene choice</title><p>A peculiar feature of the OR gene family that had emerged from our past work is that OR gene silencing is highest in the very cells that express ORs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Magklara et al., 2011</xref>). Our zonal analysis further strengthened this intriguing correlation, as both H3K9me3/H3K79me3 and genomic compartmentalization in each MOE segment are strongest on OR groups that are transcriptionally active during OSN differentiation. A fascinating implication of this observation is that early OR transcription is the signal for both genomic silencing and singular choice. Although the former is only implied by the strong correlation between OR transcription in OSN progenitors and genomic silencing, the latter is experimentally supported by the striking observation that strong transcriptional induction of <italic>Olfr17</italic> at the INP/iOSN stage results in strong recruitment of the Greek Island hub, and stable choice of this OR allele in most mOSNs throughout the MOE. Such a mechanism of promoter choice influenced by spatially-determined early transcription could also explain the recent demonstration that clustered Pcdh choice, which is regulated by anti-sense transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Canzio et al., 2019</xref>), abides by spatial restrictions in the neocortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lv et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>How could two fundamentally opposite gene expression outcomes be encoded on the same molecular feature? We propose that the timing and levels of transcriptional induction could be the arbiters between genomic silencing and singular choice. ORs that are transcribed first in the INP stage, when the Greek Island hub cannot yet form due to the continuous expression of Lamin b receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Clowney et al., 2012</xref>), are most likely to be silenced. OR alleles activated during the assembly of the multi-enhancer hub, at the INP to iOSN transition, may compete for hub recruitment. The OR allele that will first associate with a multi-enhancer hub will be stably protected from heterochromatic silencing, possibly due to the significantly increased rates of OR transcription, whereas the other co-transcribed ORs will succumb to heterochromatic silencing. If timing and rates of OR transcription determine whether an OR allele will be silenced or chosen, then an OR allele that is highly transcribed in both INP and iOSN stages should evade silencing and dominate the competition for hub recruitment, explaining the striking expression pattern of the tTA-induced <italic>Olfr17</italic> allele. Thus, according to this model, in each OSN ORs with more dorsal identity will be transcribed first, because they have stronger promoters, and therefore will become silenced in higher frequency; ORs with the correct zonal identity will be transcribed later, with a chance to associate with the Greek Island hub, explaining why one is chosen and the rest are silenced; ORs with more ventral identities will not be transcribed at all, thus, will not be silenced but also will not be chosen. In other words, singular OR transcription may not depend on the silencing of every single OR in the genome: by encoding silencing and stable choice with the same exact molecular feature, OSNs choose one and silence a small fraction of the whole OR repertoire in each nucleus—the rest are not relevant. Notably, this constitutes a refinement of our original model, which proposed that all but one OR allele become silenced in each OSN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Magklara et al., 2011</xref>). Without knowledge of the zonal identity of most ORs, and without the technical ability to perform Hi-C and ChIP-seq on micro-dissected MOE zones, the striking patterns of gradual increase of OR silencing along the D-V axis of the MOE were not appreciated. As the cellular and temporal resolution of our genome-wide approaches increases, the aforementioned model will be further refined.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Limitations of this study</title><p>Our experiments did not clarify whether NFI proteins bind directly on OR promoters, or act indirectly by activating other transcription factors and chromatin modifying enzymes. Although there is a statistically significant enrichment of NFI motifs on zone 4/5 OR promoters compared to the other OR promoters (data not shown), we were not able to detect direct binding of NFI proteins on these promoters, which is expected since these promoters are active in less than 1% of the cells. Given that our studies provide the mechanism by which NFI gradients establish zonal boundaries, via polygenic OR transcription and chromatin-mediated silencing, answering this question is not essential for understanding the mechanism of dorsoventral patterning of OR expression. A second limitation of this study is that it did not reveal the mechanisms that regulate the expression of the dorsal-most ORs (zone 1 ORs), as NFI deletion had no effects on the expression and chromatin regulation of these OR genes. However, having revealed the regulatory logic whereby these patterns are established, we expect that other transcription factors with zonal expression patterns identified here regulate early transcription and silencing of these genes across the MOE.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Experimental model and subject details</title><p>Mice were treated in compliance with the rules and regulations of IACUC under protocol numbers AC-AAAT2450 and AC-AABG6553.

For all OR expression analysis, we used a threshold of 3UMI for an OR to be considered expressed.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-5"><title>Bulk RNA-seq in olfactory lineage cell types</title><p>GBC, INP, iOSN, and mOSN were isolated from <italic>Mash1-CreER; tdTomato; Ngn1-GFP</italic> pups as described above with the tissue being dissected into a ventral (mostly zone 4–5), dorsal OE (mostly zone 1) and a central section (that is enriched for zone 2-3). The experiment was performed in biological replicate. RNA was extracted from FAC-sorted cells using Trizol and libraries were prepared with the Nugen NuQuant RNA-seq library system and sequenced 50PE on HiSeq2500 or 75PE NextSeq (and trimmed to 50 bp before aligning). Cutadapt was used to remove adapter sequences and reads were aligned to the mm10 genome with STAR. Samtools was used to select high mapping quality reads (-q 30). Normalization, calculation of FPKM (which we converted to TMP), and differential expression analysis were performed in R with DEseq2. For all RNA-seq data p-values refer to adjusted p-value (padj), which corrects for multiple hypothesis testing using the Benjamini-Hochberg method.</p><p>To find zone 5 enriched transcription factors at each developmental stage we used DEseq2 to determine significantly differentially expressed transcription factors (from the Gene Ontology database annotation ‘DNA binding transcription factor activity’) between ventral and dorsal cells with a padj less than 0.05 and at least a twofold change in expression (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>.)

To find non-zonal mOSN markers, we made a list of significantly upregulated genes (with a padj less than 0.05, and a fold change greater two) in mOSNs (tomato-, GFP dim cells) across all zones compared to iOSNs (tomato-, GFP + bright cells) across all zones. We further filtered out genes that were significantly differentially expressed between ventral and dorsal or dorsomedial mOSNs and took the top 200 most significant genes.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-7"><title>RNA-seq in ventral NFI knockout mOSNs</title><p>To look at gene expression changes resulting from NFI deletion in olfactory progenitors we used NFI ABX triple knockout (<italic>Nfia</italic>, <italic>Nfib</italic>, and <italic>Nfix</italic> fl/fl; <italic>tdTomato; Omp-IRES-GFP; Krt5-CreER</italic>), NFI AB double knockout (<italic>Nfia</italic>, <italic>Nfib</italic> fl/fl; <italic>tdTomato; Omp-IRES-GFP</italic>, <italic>Krt5-CreER</italic>), NFIX only knockout (<italic>Nfix</italic> fl/fl, <italic>tdTomato</italic>, <italic>Omp-IRES-GFP</italic>, <italic>Krt5-CreER</italic>) or wt control (<italic>tdTomato</italic>, <italic>Omp-IRES-GFP</italic>, <italic>Krt5-CreER</italic>) mice and followed the same induction protocol for early knockout (described above) for all knockout genotypes as well as wt control animals. After rebuilding the MOE from knockout progenitors, we dissected ventral (zone 5) MOE and FAC-sorted GFP + mOSNs. RNA was extracted from sorted cells using Trizol and RNA-seq libraries were prepared with Nugen Nuquant RNA-seq library prep kit and sequenced 75PE on Nextseq 550. Reads were aligned exactly as described for zonal olfactory lineage data and similarly DEseq2 was used to determine differentially expressed genes between the different knockout and wt cells. To determine if ventral mOSN, dorsal mOSN, and non-zonal mOSN markers change in ventral NFI knockout cells, we analyzed the expression differences of the genes in our marker lists.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-8"><title>Spatial transcriptomics</title><p>Whole MOE from NFI ABX knockout (using the <italic>Krt5-CreER</italic>) and wt control mice (two mice for each genotype) were embedded in OCT and frozen on dry ice. 14 µm cryosections of tissue were mounted onto Visium Spatial Gene Expression slides (10 X Genomics) and kept at –80 °C prior to processing. Tissue sections were fixed in methanol, stained with Hematoxylin and Eosin y, and imaged using a Nikon Eclipse Ti2 inverted microscope. Barcoded cDNA libraries of tissue sections were generated using the Spatial Gene Expression Reagent Kit (10 X Genomics) according to the manufacturer’s protocols. Libraries were sequenced on an Illumina NovaSeq instrument at the University of Chicago Genomics Core with the following runtype: 28 cycles (Read 1); 10 cycles (i7 index); 10 cycles (i5 index); 120 cycles (Read 2).

Unless otherwise indicated all steps were carried out at 4 °C. Briefly, FAC-sorted cells were pelleted at 600 rcf for 10 min in a swinging bucket centrifuge at 4 °C and resuspended in cold Buffer I (0.3 M Sucrose, 60 mM KCl, 15 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.1 mM EGTA, 15 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 0.1 mM PMSF, 0.5 mM DTT, 1 x protease inhibitors). Cells were lysed by adding equal volume cold BufferII (Buffer I with 0.4% NP40) and incubating for 10 min on ice. Nuclei were pelleted 10 min at 1000 rcf and resuspended in 250 ul cold MNase buffer (0.32 M Sucrose, 4 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 0.1 mM PMSF, 1 x protease inhibitors). Micrococcal Nuclease digestion was carried out by adding 0.1 U Micrococcal Nuclease (Sigma) per 100 ul buffer and incubating for 1 min 40 s in a 37 °C water bath, then stopping the digestion by adding EDTA to a final concentration of 20 mM. The first soluble chromatin fraction (S1) was collected by pelleting nuclei 10 min at 10,000 rcf at 4 °C and taking the supernatant to store at 4 °C overnight. Undigested, pelleted material was resuspended in 250 ul cold Dialysis Buffer (1 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 0.2 mM EDTA, 0.1 mM PMSF, 1 x protease inhibitors) and rotating overnight at 4 °C. The second soluble chromatin fraction (S2) was collected by pelleting insoluble material 10 min at 10,000 rcf at 4 °C and taking the supernatant. S1 and S2 chromatin fractions were combined and used for immunoprecipitation with 5% material being retained for input. Equal cell numbers were used for control and knockout IPs, or between different cell types or zones. To perform IP, chromatin was diluted to 1 ml in Wash Buffer1 (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 10 mM EDTA, 125 mM NaCl, 0.1% Tween-20, 5 mM 1 x protease inhibitors) and rotated overnight at 4 °C with 1 ug antibody. Dynabeads (10 ul Protein A and 10 ul Protein G per IP) were blocked overnight with 2 mg/ml yeast tRNA and 2 mg/mL BSA in Wash Buffer 1. Blocked beads were washed once with Wash Buffer 1, then added to antibody-bound chromatin and rotated 2–3 hr at 4 °C. Chromatin-bound beads were washed 4 x with Wash Buffer 1, 3 x with Wash Buffer 2 (50mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 10 mM EDTA, 175 mM NaCl, 0.1% NP40, 1 x protease inhibitors), and 1 x in TE pH 7.5. IP’d DNA was eluted by resuspending beads in 100 uL Native ChIP Elution Buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH7.5, 1 mM EDTA, 1% SDS, 0.1 M NaHCO<sub>3</sub>) in a thermomixer set to 37 °C and 900 rpm for 15 min, repeating the elution 2 x and combining the eluates. IPs and inputs (diluted to 200 ul in elution buffer) were cleaned up with Zymo ChIP DNA columns (Zymo Research, D5205).

Duplicate reads were removed with Picard, and high mapping quality reads were selected with Samtools (-q 30). After confirming the nChIP replicates looked similar, they were merged with HOMER and used to generate signal tracks at 1 bp resolution normalized to a library size of 10,000,000 reads. Thus, one of three replicates of H3K79me3 native ChIP-seq in zonal mOSNs was excluded for poor signal-to-noise ratio. Signal density over OR genes was calculated with HOMER annotatePeaks.pl then normalized to the length of each OR gene. Native ChIP heatmaps were generated with deeptools with OR gene bodies re-scaled to 6 kb and showing 2 kb flanking on each side.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-12"><title>In situ Hi-C</title><p>In situ Hi-C and library preparation were performed exactly as described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Monahan et al., 2019</xref>.

Nuclei were pelleted at 2500 rcf, permeabilized in 0.05% SDS for 20 min at 62 °C, then quenched in 1.1% Triton-X100 for 10 min at 37 °C. Nuclei were then digested with DpnII (6 U/ul) in 1 × DpnII buffer overnight at 37 °C. In the morning, nuclei were pelleted at 2500 g for 5 min and buffers and fresh DpnII enzymes were replenished to their original concentration, and nuclei were digested for two additional hours. Restriction enzyme was inactivated by incubating for 20 min at 62 °C. Digested ends were filled in for 1.5 hr at 37 °C using biotinylated dGTP. Ligation was performed for 4 hr at room temperature with rotation. Nuclei were pelleted and sonicated in 10 mM Tris pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, 0.25% SDS on a Covaris S220 (16 min, 2% duty cycle, 105 intensity, Power 1.8–1.85 W, 200 cycles per burst, max temperature 6 °C). DNA was reverse crosslinked with RNAseA and Proteinase K overnight at 65 °C then purified with 2 × Ampure beads following the standard protocol and eluted in water. Biotinylated fragments were enriched with Dynabeads MyOne Strepavidin T1 beads and on-bead library preparation was carried out with NuGEN Ovation V2 DNA-Seq Library Preparation Kit, with some modifications: instead of heat inactivation following end repair beads were washed 2 x for 2 min at 55 °C with Tween Washing Buffer (TWB) (0.05% Tween, 1 M NaCl in TE pH 7.5) and 2 x with 10 mM Tris pH 7.5 to remove excess detergent. After ligation of adapters beads were washed 5 x with TWB and 2 x with 10 mM Tris pH 7.5. Libraries were amplified for 10 cycles and cleaned up with 0.8 V Ampure beads.

The maximum value on the color scale was set to 150 contacts per 100 kb bin. Analysis of zonal OR gene cluster contacts was performed with normalized counts binned at 50 kb resolution.

The process of selecting this OR in each OSN is the consequence of both deterministic developmental processes involving transcription factors, and more stochastic processes. How this balance is implemented is a major problem in molecular neuroscience, one whose solution has significant systems-level implications for odor coding. In Bashkirova et al the authors substantially revise the canonical view of how this process works. By querying single cell transcriptomes and genetic architecture across OSN development, the authors demonstrate that OSN progenitors express ORs for their zone and for more dortsal zones, and that the degree of heterochromatinization of non-expressed ORs varies as a function of which zone a given OSN resides in. Through additional genetic experiments (including knockouts of transcription factors that seem to be associated with zonal identity, and the clever use of OR transgenes) they synthesize these findings into a model in which progenitors co-express many ORs - both ORs that are appropriate for their zone and ORs that are dorsal to their zone - and that this expression both facilitates heterochromatinzation of non-selected and extra-zonal ORs, and enables singular OR selection. The experiments are careful and the data are novel, and definitely revise our simplistic current view of how this process works; as such this work will have significant impact on the field. As presented the model requires additional experiments to fully flesh it out, and to definitively demonstrate that i.e., precocious expression leads to gene silencing, but with some additional clarifications in the discussion this paper both breaks new ground and sets the stage for future work exploring mechanisms of OSN development and OR selection.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.87445.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>In this study, Bashkirova et al. analyzed how the gene choice of olfactory receptors (ORs) is regulated in olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) during development. In the mouse olfactory system, there are more than 1000 functional OR genes and several hundred pseudogenes. It is well-established that each individual OSN expresses only one functional OR gene in a mono-allelic manner. This is referred to as the one neuron - one receptor rule. It is also known that OR gene choice is not entirely stochastic but restricted to a particular area or zone in the olfactory epithelium (OE) along the dorsoventral axis. It is interesting to study how this stochastic but biased gene-choice is regulated during OSN development, narrowing down the number of OR genes to be chosen to eventually achieve the monogenic OR expression in OSNs.</p><p>In the present study, the authors cell-sorted OSNs into three groups; immediate neuronal precursors (INPs), immature OSNs (iOSNs), and mature OSNs (mOSNs). They found that OR gene choice is differentially regulated positively by transcription factors in INPs and negatively by heterochromatin-mediated OR gene silencing in iOSNs. The authors propose that by the combination of two opposing forces of polygenic transcription (positive) and genomic silencing (negative), each OSN finally expresses only one OR gene out of over 2000 alleles in a stochastic but stereotypic manner.</p><p>The authors' model of OR gene choice is supported by well-designed experiments and by large amounts of data. In general, the paper is clearly written and easy to follow. It will attract a wide variety of readers in the fields of neuroscience, developmental biology, and immunology. The present finding will give new insight into our understanding of gene choice in the multigene family in the mammalian brain and shed light on the long-standing question of monogenic expression of OR genes.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.87445.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>This manuscript investigates how a seemingly random choice of odourant receptor (OR) gene expression is organised into sterotypic zones of OR expression along the olfactory epithelium. Using a varietty of functional genomics methods, the authors find that along the differentiation axis (progenitor to mature olfactory sensory neuron, OSN) multiple ORs are initally transcribed and from among these, only one OR is selected for expression. The rest are suppressed through chromatin silencing. In addition to this, the authors report a dorso-ventral gradient in OR expression at the immature stage - dorsally expressed ORs are also expressed ventrally and these then get silenced. The expression of the ventrally expressed ORs, on the other hand, are restricted to the ventral region. They suggest a role for the transcription factor NF1 in this dorsoventral process.</p><p>This is a valuable study. The data are compelling and generally well presented.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa4"><front-stub><article-id
