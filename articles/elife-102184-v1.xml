exhibit pause responses conveying information about rewarding events, but the mechanisms underlying these pauses remain elusive. Thalamic inputs induce a pause mediated by intrinsic mechanisms and regulated by dopamine D2 receptors (D2Rs), though the underlying membrane currents remain unknown. Moreover, the role of D5 receptors (D5Rs) has not been addressed so far. Here, we performed ex vivo studies showing that glutamate released by thalamic inputs in the dorsolateral striatum induces a burst in SCINs, followed by a pause mediated by the activation of a Kv1-dependent delayed rectifier current. Endogenous dopamine promotes this pause through D2R stimulation, while pharmacological stimulation of D5Rs suppresses it. Remarkably, this pause is absent in parkinsonian mice rendered dyskinetic by chronic L-DOPA treatment but can be reinstated acutely by the inverse D5R agonist clozapine. Blocking the Kv1 current eliminates the pause reinstated by the D5R inverse agonist. In contrast, the D2-type receptor agonists quinpirole and sumanirole failed to reinstate a pause in dyskinetic mice. In conclusion, stimulation of thalamic inputs induces excitation followed by a pause in SCINs, which is lost in parkinsonian mice that have been rendered dyskinetic. This pause is mediated by delayed rectifier Kv1 channels, which are tonically blocked in dyskinetic mice by a mechanism depending on D5R ligand-independent activity. Targeting these alterations may have therapeutic value in Parkinson’s disease.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>striatal cholinergic interneuron</kwd><kwd>pause response</kwd><kwd>L-DOPA induced dyskinesia</kwd><kwd>D5 receptors</kwd><kwd>Kv1 channel</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100006668</institution-id><institution>Fondo para la Investigación Científica y Tecnológica</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PICT 2020-325</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Murer</surname><given-names>Mario Gustavo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100005363</institution-id><institution>Universidad de Buenos Aires</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PIDAE 2025-7</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Murer</surname><given-names>Mario Gustavo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100005363</institution-id><institution>Universidad de Buenos Aires</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>UBACYT2018-305</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Murer</surname><given-names>Mario Gustavo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Restoring the Kv1-mediated pause in striatal cholinergic interneurons by reducing D5 receptor activity may help recover striatal function lost in dyskinetic parkinsonian mice.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Dopamine (DA), released by neurons from the ventral tegmental area and substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc), and acetylcholine (ACh), mainly released by striatal cholinergic interneurons (SCINs), are the main modulators of cortico-striatal circuits. Both types of neurons are tonically active, and their activity is altered by unexpected rewards or by the sensory cues that predict those rewards. These events evoke a burst in dopaminergic neurons coincident with a pause response in SCINs. The resulting increase in DA and decrease in ACh are critical for striatal-dependent learning and decision-making through modulatory effects on striatal ‘medium spiny’ projection neurons (MSNs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cragg, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ding et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Reynolds et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>In vivo recordings show that the phasic response of striatal tonically active neurons (TANs, putative SCINs) to salient events typically involves a brief burst of action potentials followed by a short pause (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kimura et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aosaki et al., 1994a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aosaki et al., 1994b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Apicella, 2007</xref>). Recent in vivo studies in rodents show variations in the SCIN pause response across striatal subregions, where the initial excitation preceding the pause is typically seen in the dorsolateral striatum but may be minimal or absent in the dorsomedial region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Duhne et al., 2024</xref>). The precise mechanisms underlying this response remain elusive. Evidence suggests the involvement of both dopaminergic and thalamic inputs in the generation of the pause. Neurons of the intralaminar nuclei of the thalamus, which send excitatory projections to the striatum, also respond to reward and salient stimuli, and the TAN pause is absent when the thalamus is locally inhibited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Matsumoto et al., 2001</xref>). Dopamine D2 receptor (D2R) antagonists or genetic elimination of D2Rs from cholinergic neurons have been shown to reduce the duration of the pause (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Watanabe and Kimura, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ding et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kharkwal et al., 2016</xref>), implicating a direct contribution of D2R-mediated inhibition of SCINs. Additionally, ex vivo studies reveal heterogeneous responses of SCINs to stimulation of dopaminergic axons, with a more pronounced dopaminergic influence on the pause response in the dorsal vs the ventral striatum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chuhma et al., 2014</xref>). Further evidence suggests that the pause in SCINs arises from intrinsic mechanisms activated by depolarization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Reynolds et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Wilson and Goldberg, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Sanchez et al., 2011</xref>). Experiments conducted in brain slices demonstrate that the pause that follows stimulation of SCIN excitatory inputs persists even after blocking GABA-A receptors, indicating the involvement of voltage (Kv) or calcium-dependent (KCa) potassium currents, with DA likely modulating these currents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ding et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Schulz and Reynolds, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">McGuirt et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>The importance of DA is underscored by the absence of pause in animals with chronic nigrostriatal lesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aosaki et al., 1994a</xref>). While reduced D2R stimulation may explain this, genetic elimination of D2Rs from cholinergic neurons reduces but does not eliminate the pause (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kharkwal et al., 2016</xref>), suggesting that additional factors are involved. SCINs also express dopamine D5 receptors (D5Rs), which have been recently linked to SCIN functional changes in parkinsonian animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Paz et al., 2022</xref>). However, their role in regulating phasic SCIN responses remains unaddressed, and whether alterations in D5R signaling contribute to the absence of pause in DA-depleted animals remains unclear.</p><p>Here, we report ex vivo studies showing that specific activation of intralaminar thalamostriatal inputs triggers an initial excitation followed by a pause in SCINs recorded from the dorsolateral striatum. This pause requires the activation of an intrinsic delayed rectifier current mediated by Kv1 channels and is modulated by D2Rs and D5Rs. Furthermore, we found that this SCIN pause is absent in parkinsonian mice with chronic L-DOPA treatment, but can be acutely reinstated by the inverse D5R agonist clozapine. Finally, the pause reinstated by clozapine is abolished by blocking the Kv1 current, indicating that inhibition of constitutive D5R signaling releases this current from a tonic restraining effect, aligning with our prior findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Paz et al., 2022</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The timing of thalamic input interacts with SCIN intrinsic mechanisms to determine the duration of the pause response</title><p>To induce a pause in SCINs in response to thalamic activation, we injected an AAV2-CamKII-ChR2-YFP viral vector into the intralaminar nuclei of the thalamus in adult Chat<sup>Cre/+</sup>;Rosa26<sup>LSL-tdTomato/+</sup> mice. We used these mice to facilitate the localization of SCINs in brain slices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Tubert et al., 2016</xref>). Four weeks later, we sacrificed the animals and made coronal slices of the striatum for ex vivo patch clamp recordings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Histological analysis confirmed the site of AAV injection and the labeling of thalamostriatal projections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). We recorded SCINs in the cell-attached configuration and stimulated thalamic axons with 2-ms-long pulses of blue light at 20 Hz and 10 mW (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). All the experiments were performed in the presence of picrotoxin (PIC, 100 μM) in the bath. When the stimulation elicited a minimal response (1 spike), the latency of the evoked spike decreased with the time separating the stimulus from the preceding spontaneous spike (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D and E</xref>). Thus, a stimulus arriving after an average baseline interspike interval (ISI) has elapsed produces a shorter latency response than a stimulus arriving shortly after the preceding spontaneous spike (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), as expected given the strong after-hyperpolarization (AHP) that follows SCIN spikes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Reynolds et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Wilson and Goldberg, 2006</xref>). While a similar inverse relationship is observed under conditions of ‘sham stimulation’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), after optical stimulation, the response latencies were significantly smaller at intervals shorter and longer than the average ISI, indicating that the stimulation increased spike probability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Remarkably, the interval that followed these minimal responses was 30% longer than the average ISI (baseline ISI: 464.61±42.44 ms; pause after 1 elicited spike: 609.3±59.5; p=0.0181, paired t-test), indicating that even an initial excitatory response consisting in a single spike delays the next SCIN spike.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Striatal cholinergic interneurons (SCIN) burst-pause response to activation of thalamic terminals.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Experimental design.

Different train durations were required to evoke a given burst response across SCINs, probably relating to variability in the density of ChR2-expressing afferent fibers across experiments. To minimize the effect of this source of variability, we studied the pause duration as a function of the number of spikes in the burst evoked by thalamic stimulation. The duration of the SCIN pause increased with the number of spikes in the burst (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>), without changes in baseline ISI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>), as expected if the pause depended on the recruitment of a depolarization-activated hyperpolarizing current (average pause durations: 1 elicited spike = 609.3±59.5 ms; 2 elicited spikes = 744.2±92.4 ms; 3 elicited spikes = 964.7±92.3 ms; 4 elicited spikes = 1065.7±136.5 ms; baseline ISI: 1 elicited spike = 464.6±42.4 ms; 2 elicited spikes = 427.7±36.3 ms; 3 elicited spikes = 430.5±39.9 ms; 4 elicited spikes = 440.3±53.4 ms).</p><p>A pioneering in vivo study showed that the thalamic neurons presumptively driving the burst-pause response of SCINs show a burst followed by a pause that ends with a rebound of activity, in connection with reward-related events. This thalamic burst-pause response temporally coincides with the burst-pause response of the presumptive SCINs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Matsumoto et al., 2001</xref>). This suggests that a decrease in excitatory afferent activity may be necessary for the expression of the SCIN pause. To evaluate the effect of a second volley of excitatory inputs on the SCIN pause duration, we delivered a second thalamic stimulus train 350 ms after the end of the first stimulus. We found that the second stimulus train could terminate the pause, although its effect is delayed as more spikes are recruited in the burst by the first stimulus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J and K</xref>). This is consistent with a graded recruitment of an intrinsic current that reduces the excitability of SCINs, delaying their response to the second stimulus.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>The pause response to thalamic stimulation requires activation of Kv1 channels</title><p>In previous work, we found that Kv delayed rectifier channels constituted by Kv1.3 and Kv1.1 subunits contribute to the slow AHP current in SCINs of adult mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Tubert et al., 2016</xref>). Moreover, a train of EPSPs evoked by thalamic afferents stimulation is followed by an AHP, which persists in the presence of the GABA-A receptor antagonist PIC and is blocked by the Kv1.3 channel blocker margatoxin (MgTx) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Tubert et al., 2016</xref>). We asked whether this Kv1 current is recruited during the SCIN pause response. Both MgTx at 30 nM – but not at 3 nM – and dendrotoxin (DTx, 100 nM, a Kv1.1 and Kv1.6 channel blocker) abolished the pause response without changing the spontaneous firing rate or the burst duration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–E</xref>). Previous studies showed that Kv1.1 and Kv1.3 mRNAs are expressed in SCINs but not in striatal tissue samples lacking SCINs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Tubert et al., 2016</xref>), consistent with independent findings showing that Kv1.3 mRNA is absent in MSNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Shen et al., 2004</xref>). These findings suggest that the effect of MgTx on the pause response is likely mediated by direct actions on SCINs.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Contribution of the Kv1 current to the pause response.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of the tested hypotheses.

Furthermore, we found a small effect of the selective D2R antagonist sulpiride, limited to the pauses that followed 4-spike bursts, supporting a modulatory role of D2Rs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F–I</xref>).

Further work suggested the involvement of a slow current mediated by Kv7 channels in juvenile mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>), but this current is developmentally downregulated and does not seem to contribute significantly in adult SCINs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">McGuirt et al., 2022</xref>; present findings), even though SCINs retain a high reserve of Kv7 channels that remain responsive to pharmacological activators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Paz et al., 2018</xref>). Whether this Kv7 channel reserve is recruited under particular conditions not captured in our slice preparation remains to be determined.</p><p>Previously, we found that SCIN excitability is strongly modulated by Kv1 channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Tubert et al., 2016</xref>). Heteromeric channels constituted by Kv1.3 and Kv1.1 subunits can be blocked by the binding of a single MgTx molecule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hopkins, 1998</xref>). In SCINs, MgTx enhances subthreshold EPSP summation and blocks the subsequent AHP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Tubert et al., 2016</xref>). The present study extends these findings by showing that specific blockers of channels constituted by Kv1.3 and Kv1.1 subunits suppress the pause that follows action potential bursts induced by thalamostriatal inputs in adult mice. Although SCINs express inwardly rectifying Kir2 channels capable of amplifying hyperpolarizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Wilson, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Paz et al., 2021</xref>), our findings suggest they do not contribute to the pause, likely because of insufficient membrane hyperpolarization to recruit Kir currents.</p><p>Remarkably, the duration of the SCIN pause response is not only dependent on intrinsic mechanisms but also shaped by thalamic inputs. In vivo, SCIN spontaneous firing synchronizes with excitatory synaptic input fluctuations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Krok et al., 2023</xref>). The phasic SCIN response may reflect synchronization with thalamic inputs, which themselves exhibit a burst-pause-rebound firing pattern in response to reward-related stimuli in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Matsumoto et al., 2001</xref>). The potential influence of thalamic rebound activity on pause duration has not been examined before in brain slices. We observed that a second bout of stimulation of thalamic afferents shortens the pause, although this effect is delayed by additional spikes in the initial SCIN burst, potentially recruiting a more robust Kv1 current (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Tubert et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Importantly, a significant pause could be detected even when only a single spike was evoked by thalamic afferent stimulation. This finding aligns with previous studies showing that SCIN Kv1 currents are recruited by thalamic input trains that elicit subthreshold depolarizing responses, leading to an AHP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Tubert et al., 2016</xref>). This is particularly interesting given that, in behaving animals, SCIN pauses are not always preceded by a burst of spikes. Significant variability has been observed in the phasic responses of TANs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Zhang and Cragg, 2017</xref>) and SCINs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Duhne et al., 2024</xref>) to reward-related stimuli in behaving animals, which appears to depend on multiple factors, including striatal location and whether outcomes are appetitive or aversive. While our ex vivo model may not fully capture the complexity of these responses, it successfully reproduces a key feature: the disappearance of the pause response in TANs following the induction of parkinsonism in monkeys. This provides a valuable opportunity to investigate the underlying mechanisms for the first time.</p><p>Recent in vivo studies showed anticorrelated changes of DA and ACh striatal levels, not only during rewarded tasks but also during spontaneous behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chantranupong et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Krok et al., 2023</xref>). Several studies support that DA positively modulates the pause response of SCINs through D2R-mediated effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Watanabe and Kimura, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ding et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kharkwal et al., 2016</xref>), and constitutive ablation of D2Rs from cholinergic neurons disrupts the anticorrelated DA-ACh signal during specific portions of an operant task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chantranupong et al., 2023</xref>). However, striatal ACh transients persist and even increase after blockade of striatal DA receptors or lesion of nigrostriatal neurons, while they are reduced after intrastriatal infusion of glutamate receptor antagonists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Krok et al., 2023</xref>). Although these findings suggest that slow variations of striatal glutamate, rather than DA, control ACh release from SCINs at the space and timescales resolved by fiber photometry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Krok et al., 2023</xref>), they do not rule out a fine dopaminergic regulation of phasic SCIN responses to glutamatergic inputs, which could be embedded within broader modulations of DA and ACh levels. Our ex vivo data support that endogenous activation of D2R modulates the pause induced by thalamic afferents in SCINs. Moreover, we found that ambient DA in the slice does not modulate SCIN activity through D5Rs, but pharmacological stimulation of D1/D5Rs markedly inhibited the pause response, likely through inhibitory effects of D5Rs on Kv1 channels. Overall, our data show that, in physiological conditions, Kv1 channels are necessary for the expression of the pause response in SCINs of adult mice, and that the pause can be modulated by D5Rs in addition to D2Rs. This D5R modulation may be relevant under conditions of phasic DA release producing synaptic concentrations of DA capable of activating the low-affinity D5Rs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>).</p><p>Learning deficits are believed to play a role in the development of Parkinson’s disease symptoms. A recent study demonstrates that practice worsens the performance of previously learned motor skills in parkinsonian mice, while practice combined with therapeutic doses of L-DOPA prevents skill deterioration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cheung et al., 2023</xref>). While this learning deficit may be due to the loss of DA, a possible contribution of SCIN dysfunction cannot be dismissed given that, in parkinsonian monkeys, the pause response of presumptive SCINs is lost and can be partially restored with apomorphine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aosaki et al., 1994a</xref>).</p><p>Our ex vivo studies provide a possible explanation for this pause response loss. We reported that the Kv1 current is diminished in parkinsonian mice and further suppressed 24 hr after the termination of a dyskinetogenic L-DOPA treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Tubert et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Paz et al., 2022</xref>). Consistent with a key role of this current in pause generation, we find that the pause that follows a burst of spikes induced by stimulation of thalamostriatal afferents in our ex vivo preparation is markedly diminished in this animal model. Importantly, in previous work, we reported that suppression of the SCIN Kv1 current in dyskinetic mice is caused by sustained cAMP signaling, likely due to enhanced ligand-independent activity of D5Rs, as demonstrated by showing that inverse agonists of D5Rs acutely restore the Kv1 current (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Paz et al., 2022</xref>). In the current study, we find that clozapine, an atypical antipsychotic that behaves as an inverse agonist of D5Rs in the absence of an agonist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>), reinstates the pause response of SCINs in OFF L-DOPA dyskinetic mice. Although clozapine also has D1/D5R antagonist properties, these effects would not manifest when DA has been depleted, as is the case in the OFF L-DOPA condition. Consistently, the prototypical D1/D5R antagonist SCH23390, which lacks inverse agonist activity on these receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Tiberi and Caron, 1994</xref>), neither reinstates the pause response nor alters SCIN spontaneous firing. However, SCH23390 blocks clozapine’s effect, supporting the conclusion that clozapine restores the pause response by reducing ligand-independent D5R activity. In addition, the pause restoring action of clozapine cannot be attributed to effects mediated by serotonin receptors as it persisted in the presence of a serotonin receptor antagonist.</p><p>Remarkably, while the Kv1.3 blocker MgTx has no effect on SCINs in dyskinetic mice, as expected given the loss of Kv1 currents in this animal model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Paz et al., 2022</xref>), the pause reinstated by clozapine is suppressed by MgTx. This is consistent with previous findings showing that D5R inverse agonists reinstate the Kv1 current in dyskinetic mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Paz et al., 2022</xref>) and supports the key role of the Kv1 current in the SCIN pause and in the dysfunction observed in SCINs after DA neuron lesion and L-DOPA treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). While our prior work has implicated sustained cAMP signaling in the suppression of the Kv1 current in dyskinetic animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Paz et al., 2022</xref>), further work is needed to link cAMP levels to the loss of the SCIN pause.</p><p>Importantly, since in DA-intact mice the SCIN pause induced by thalamic inputs is promoted by endogenous stimulation of D2-type receptors (our present findings and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aosaki et al., 1994a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Watanabe and Kimura, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ding et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kharkwal et al., 2016</xref>), lack of stimulation of these receptors in DA-depleted mice could be expected to contribute to the absence of the pause in this condition. However, the activation of D2Rs was not sufficient to rescue the pause in dyskinetic mice in our slice preparation. Additionally, D2 agonists failed to modify baseline firing rate in this condition, despite its known inhibitory effects in DA-intact mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Maurice et al., 2004</xref>) and partially DA-depleted mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">McKinley et al., 2019</xref>). Although not addressed in the present study, understanding why D2 agonists fail to restore the SCIN pause is an important question that warrants further investigation. Interestingly, previous studies have reported paradoxical effects of D2 agonists in SCINs in animal models of dystonia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Pisani et al., 2006</xref>), as well as under conditions where the SCIN’s constitutively active integrated stress response is diminished (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Helseth et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, our study demonstrates that Kv1 channels are essential for the pause response of SCINs. We also find that D1/D5R dysregulation of Kv1 channels may contribute to the loss of this pause response in parkinsonian animals chronically treated with L-DOPA. Previously, in the same animal model, we showed that D1/D5 inverse agonists normalize the spontaneous firing pattern and membrane excitability of SCINs by restoring various membrane currents, including Kv1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Paz et al., 2022</xref>). While antipsychotics having D5R inverse agonist properties bind to multiple metabotropic receptors that could contribute to their effects, our data highlight a key role of ligand-independent activity of D5Rs in the absence of the pause response in the OFF L-DOPA condition.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>Adult male and female mice (P60-250) allowing the identification of SCINs through cell-type-specific expression of the fluorescent protein tdTomato (Chat<sup>Cre/+</sup>;Rosa26<sup>LSL-tdTomato/+</sup>, for simplicity) were obtained as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Tubert et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Paz et al., 2021</xref>).

The neurotoxin 6-hydroxydopamine-HBr (6-OHDA; Sigma-Aldrich AB) was dissolved in 0.1% ascorbate-saline at the concentration 4 µg/µl (freebase). The skull was exposed, and a small hole was drilled at the desired injection site. The following stereotaxic coordinates were used to target the left medial forebrain bundle (MFB): 1 mm posterior (from Bregma), 1.1 mm lateral, and 4.8 mm ventral from dura (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Paxinos and Franklin, 2001</xref>). 1 µl was injected in adult mice (P90–110) at a rate of 0.5 µl/min using a 300 µm diameter cannula attached to a 25 µl Hamilton syringe controlled by a motorized pump (Bioanalytical Systems, USA). The injection cannula was left in place for 6 additional minutes before slowly retracting it. Littermates of lesioned mice received an injection of 0.1% ascorbate-saline in the MFB (sham group). After surgery, each mouse was daily weighed and received a subcutaneous injection of saline and an enriched diet. These cares continued until animals began to regain weight (7–20 days after surgery).

However, the critical issue remains unresolved.</p><p>I am still not convinced by the results presented in Fig. 6 and their interpretation. Since Clozapine acts as an agonist in the absence of an endogenous agonist, it may stimulate the D5R-cAMP-Kv1 pathway. Stimulation of this pathway should abolish the pause response mediated by thalamic stimulation in SCINs, rather than restoring the pause response. Clarification is needed regarding how Clozapine reduces D5R-ligand-independent activity in the absence of dopamine (the endogenous agonist). In addition, the author's argued that D5R antagonist does not work in the absence of dopamine, therefore solely D5R antagonist didn't restore the pause response. However, if D5R-cAMP-Kv1 pathway is already active in L-DOPA off state, why D5R antagonist didn't contribute to inhibition of D5R pathway? Since Clozapine is not D5 specific and Clozapine experiments were not concrete, I recommend testing whether other receptors, such as the D2 receptor, contribute to the Clozapine-induced pause response in the L-DOPA-off state.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the opportunity to clarify this point. It seems there may have been a misunderstanding regarding our proposal about clozapine's mechanism of action. We are not suggesting that clozapine acts as an agonist, but rather as an “inverse agonist”. Unlike classical agonists, inverse agonists produce a pharmacological effect opposite to that of an agonist. Although clozapine is best known for its antagonistic effects on dopamine and serotonin receptors, under conditions where no endogenous agonist is present, it has been shown to reduce the constitutive activity of D1 and D5 receptors (PMID: 24931197). This is explained in lines 240-254 in the Results section.</p><p>In contrast, the prototypical and selective D1/D5 receptor antagonist SCH23390 does not exhibit inverse agonist properties and would not be expected to produce effects in the absence of an agonist (PMID: 7525564). The observation that SCH23390 blocks the effects of clozapine in dopamine-depleted animals strongly supports the idea that clozapine acts through D1/D5 receptors. This is now clarified in lines 257264.</p><p>To further address your comments, we now include a new figure (Figure 6) presenting experiments that show D2-type receptor agonists do not restore the pause response in dyskinetic mice in the off-L-DOPA condition. These results are described in a new subsection of the Results section and discussed in a newly added paragraph in the Discussion (lines 369-380).</p><p>Finally, to exclude a potential contribution of serotonin receptors to clozapine’s effects, we have expanded what is now Figure 7 (formerly Figure 6) to show that clozapine continues to restore the pause response even in the presence of a serotonin receptor antagonist in the bath.</p><p>All these results are further discussed in lines 342-360.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript by Tubert et al. presents the role of D5 receptors (D5R) in regulating the striatal cholinergic interneuron (CIN) pause response through D5R-cAMP-Kv1 inhibitory signaling. Their findings provide a compelling model explaining the &quot;on/off&quot; switch of the CIN pause, driven by the distinct dopamine affinities of D2R and D5R. This mechanism, coupled with varying dopamine states, is likely critical for modulating synaptic plasticity in cortico-striatal circuits during motor learning and execution. Furthermore, the study bridges their previous finding of CIN hyperexcitability (Paz et al., Movement Disorder 2022) with the loss of the pause response in LID mice and demonstrates the restore of the pause through D1/D5 inverse agonism.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The study presents solid findings, and the writing is logically structured and easy to follow. The experiments are well-designed, properly combining ex vivo electrophysiology recording, optogenetics, and pharmacological treatment to dissect / rule out most, if not all, alternative mechanisms in their model.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>While the manuscript is overall satisfying, one conceptual gap needs to be further addressed or discussed: the potential &quot;imbalance&quot; between D2R and D5R signaling due to the ligand-independent activity of D5R in LID. Given that D2R and D5R oppositely regulate CIN pause responses through cAMP signaling, investigating the role of D2R under LID off L-DOPA (e.g., by applying D2 agonists or antagonists, even together with intracellular cAMP analogs or inhibitors) could provide critical insights. Addressing this aspect would strengthen the manuscript in understanding CIN pause loss under pathological conditions.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your comments. Although our primary focus is on the role of D5 receptors, we have also investigated the effects of two D2-type receptor agonists in dyskinetic mice in the off-L-DOPA condition. We found that neither quinpirole nor sumanirole was able to restore the pause response. These results are presented in Figure 6 and related text in the Results and Discussion sections.</p><p>Understanding why D2 agonists fail to restore the pause response—despite their expected effect of reducing cAMP levels—is an important question that warrants further investigation. Interestingly, previous studies have reported paradoxical effects of D2 receptor stimulation in SCINs in animal models of dystonia (PMID: 16934985, PMID: 21912682), as well as under conditions where the SCIN’s constitutively active integrated stress response is diminished (PMID: 33888613). This is now discussed in lines 369-380.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>Tubert et al. investigate the mechanisms underlying the pause response in striatal cholinergic interneurons (SCINs). The authors demonstrate that optogenetic activation of thalamic axons in the striatum induces burst activity in SCINs, followed by a brief pause in firing. They show that the duration of this pause correlates with the number of elicited action potentials, suggesting a burst-dependent pause mechanism. The authors demonstrated this burst-dependent pause relied on Kv1 channels. The pause is blocked by a SKF81297 and partially by sulpiride and mecamylamine, implicating D1/D5 receptor involvement. The study also shows that the ZD7288 does not reduce the duration of the pause, and that lesioning dopamine neurons abolishes this response, which can be restored by clozapine.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>While this study presents an interesting mechanism for SCIN pausing after burst activity, there are several major concerns that should be addressed:</p><p>(1) Scope of the Mechanism: It is important to clarify that the proposed mechanism may apply specifically to the pause in SCINs following burst activity. The manuscript does not provide clear evidence that this mechanism contributes to the pause response observed in behavioral animals. While the thalamus is crucial for SCIN pauses in behavioral contexts, the exact mechanism remains unclear. Activating thalamic input triggers burst activity in SCINs, leading to a subsequent pause, but this mechanism may not be generalizable across different scenarios. For instance, approximately half of TANs do not exhibit initial excitation but still pause during behavior, suggesting that the burstdependent pause mechanism is unlikely to explain this phenomenon. Furthermore, in behavioral animals, the duration of the pause seems consistent, whereas the proposed mechanism suggests it depends on the prior burst, which is not aligned with in vivo observations. Additionally, many in vivo recordings show that the pause response is a reduction in firing rate, not complete silence, which the mechanism described here does not explain. Please address these in the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the opportunity to clarify these points. We acknowledge that the response of SCINs to optogenetic stimulation of thalamic afferents in brain slices represents a model system that may not capture all aspects of TAN responses to behaviorally salient events. Nevertheless, this approach allows us to test mechanistic hypotheses that are difficult to address in behaving animals with current technologies. This is now stated in lines 311-314.</p><p>Importantly, our ex vivo preparation reproduces, for the first time, the loss of TAN responses observed in non-human primates with parkinsonism, enabling investigation of the underlying mechanisms. In line with your suggestion, we have expanded the Discussion (third and fourth paragraphs) to address the sources of variability in pause responses.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Terminology: The use of &quot;pause response&quot; throughout the manuscript is misleading. The pause induced by thalamic input in brain slices is distinct from the pause observed in behavioral animals. Given the lack of a clear link between these two phenomena in the manuscript, it is essential to use more precise terminology throughout, including in the title, bullet points, and body of the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for raising this important point. We agree that it is essential to be precise in describing the nature of the pause observed in our ex vivo model. While we believe that readers would recognize from the abstract and methods that our study focuses on a model of the pause response, we understand your concern about potential confusion. In response, we have revised the terminology in the abstract, bullet points, and throughout the manuscript to more clearly reflect that we are describing an ex vivo model of the pause observed in behaving animals.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Kv1 Blocker Specificity: It is unclear how the authors ruled out the possibility that the Kv1 blocker did not act directly on SCINs. Could there be an indirect effect contributing to the burst-dependent pause?</p></disp-quote><p>Clarification on this point would strengthen the interpretation of the results.</p><p>This issue is addressed in lines 147-150.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Role of D1 Receptors: While it is well-established that activating thalamic input to SCINs triggers dopamine release, contributing to SCIN pausing (as shown in Figure 3), it would be helpful to assess the extent to which D1 receptors contribute to this burst-dependent pause. This could be achieved by applying the D1 agonist SKF81297 after blocking nAChRs and D2 receptors.</p></disp-quote><p>Figure 3C shows that the D1/D5 receptor antagonist SCH23390 does not modify the pause, while the full D1/D5 agonist SKF81297 abolishes it, indicating that in our slice preparation, baseline dopamine levels are not contributing to the pause through D1/D5 receptor stimulation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) Clozapine's Mechanism of Action: The restoration of the burst-dependent pause by clozapine following dopamine neuron lesioning is interesting, but clozapine acts on multiple receptors beyond D1 and D5. Although it may be challenging to find a specific D5 antagonist or inverse agonist, it would be more accurate to state that clozapine restores the burst-dependent pause without conclusively attributing this effect to D5 receptors.</p></disp-quote><p>As explained in our response to Reviewer #1, the effect of clozapine is blocked by the D1/D5-selective antagonist SCH23390. Additionally, new data presented in Figure 7C show that clozapine's ability to restore the pause response is maintained even in the presence of a broad-spectrum serotonin receptor antagonist. Since SCINs do not significantly express D1 receptors, we believe that these findings strongly support a role for D5 receptors in SCINs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comments on revisions:</p><p>The authors have addressed many of my concerns. However, I remain unconvinced that adding an 'ex vivo' experiment fully resolves the fundamental differences between the burst-dependent pause observed in slices - defined by the duration of a single AHP - and the pause response in CHINs observed in vivo, which may involve contributions from more than one prolonged AHP. In vivo, neurons can still fire action potentials during the pause, albeit at a lower frequency. Moreover, in behaving animals, pause duration does not vary with or without initial excitation. The mechanism proposed demonstrates that the pause duration, defined by the length of a single AHP, is positively correlated with preceding burst activity.</p></disp-quote><p>As discussed in paragraphs 3 and 4 of the Discussion (starting at line 285), and illustrated in Figure 1J–K, our data show that the duration of the pause can be modulated by rebound excitation from thalamic input. The absence of this rebound allows us to observe a longer pause when more spikes are elicited during the initial excitatory phase, providing a clearer readout of the contribution of intrinsic membrane mechanisms. We do not claim that intrinsic mechanisms alone account for the entire phasic response of SCINs in behaving animals (lines 295-303 in Discussion).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>To improve clarity, I recommend using the term 'SCIN pause' to describe the ex vivo findings, distinguishing them more explicitly from the 'pause response' observed in behaving animals. This distinction would help contextualize the ex vivo findings as potentially contributing to, but not fully representing, the pause response in vivo.</p></disp-quote><p>We did changes in the abstract, bullet points, and main text to clarify that we are not studying the in vivo response.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Again, it would be helpful to present raw data for pause durations rather than relying solely on ratios. This approach would provide the audience with a clearer understanding of the absolute duration of the burst-dependent pause and allow for better comparison to the ~200 ms pause observed in behaving animals.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your comment. Following your suggestion, we provide the average pause durations for the data shown in Figure 1H (lines 127–130). We opted not to include raw pause durations in the main text for all figures, as this would make the manuscript more difficult to read and, in our view, is unnecessary. The figures already allow readers to estimate absolute durations: in each case, pause durations are shown relative to baseline ISIs in one panel, while the corresponding absolute ISIs are shown side-by-side. This provides a clearer understanding of pause magnitude relative to the cell’s spontaneous firing, which is more informative than absolute values alone, since one would expect a pause to be longer than the average ISI. Please note that baseline ISI are significantly shorter in dyskinetic mice (Figure 5l). Showing the pause duration relative to baseline ISI allows readers to readily compare results across figures regardless of changes in SCIN baseline firing rate.</p><p>Additionally, it is important to note that, in vivo, pause durations are typically inferred from perievent time histograms (PETHs), which represent population averages across many trials. In contrast, in our ex vivo studies, we measured pause duration on a trial-by-trial basis. This approach enables us to analyze how the pause duration varies as a function of the initial burst size in the same neuron—something not typically reported in in vivo studies. As described in the first two paragraphs of the Results, the same SCIN may respond with a different number of spikes in successive trials, and this variability is influenced by factors such as the timing of the last spontaneous spike relative to stimulation onset (Figure 1D–F). We are not aware of studies reporting trial-by-trial analyses of pause duration in behaving animals, particularly in relation to the strength of initial excitation. Therefore, while our slice preparation may yield pause durations that are longer than those observed in vivo, direct comparison to PETH-derived pause durations from behaving animals is not straightforward.</p></body></sub-article></article>
