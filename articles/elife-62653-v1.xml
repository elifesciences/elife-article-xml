In <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, germline immortality involves proteostasis renewal at the beginning of each new generation, when oocyte maturation signals from sperm trigger the clearance of carbonylated proteins and protein aggregates. Here, we explore the cell biology of this proteostasis renewal in the context of a whole-genome RNAi screen. Oocyte maturation signals are known to trigger protein-aggregate removal via lysosome acidification. Our findings suggest that lysosomes are acidified as a consequence of changes in endoplasmic reticulum activity that permit assembly of the lysosomal V-ATPase, which in turn allows lysosomes to clear the aggregates via microautophagy. We define two functions for mitochondria, both of which appear to be independent of ATP generation. Many genes from the screen also regulate lysosome acidification and age-dependent protein aggregation in the soma, suggesting a fundamental mechanistic link between proteostasis renewal in the germline and somatic longevity.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>proteostasis</kwd><kwd>germ lineage</kwd><kwd>oocyte maturation</kwd><kwd>genetic screen</kwd><kwd>lysosome acidification</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Calico Life Sciences LLC</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Samaddar</surname><given-names>Madhuja</given-names></name><name><surname>Goudeau</surname><given-names>Jérôme</given-names></name><name><surname>Bohnert</surname><given-names>K Adam</given-names></name><name><surname>Ingaramo</surname><given-names>Maria</given-names></name><name><surname>Kenyon</surname><given-names>Cynthia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>OD010943</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hall</surname><given-names>David H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sanchez</surname><given-names>Melissa</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A whole-genome genetic screen links new aspects of oocyte maturation to proteostasis renewal in the immortal C<italic>aenorhabditis elegans</italic> germ-cell lineage and reveals similarities to somatic cell maintenance during aging.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The germ cells of an organism not only give rise to the rich diversity of somatic lineages, they also generate new germ cells that, by seeding subsequent generations, confer species immortality. This sequential rejuvenation of youthfulness is one of the most interesting mysteries in biology. How is it achieved? Not surprisingly, a process so crucial to the survival of the species involves multiple levels of quality control. At one level, an entire oocyte can be eliminated via apoptosis; for example, following DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hunter, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Luo et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Qiao et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Schumacher et al., 2001</xref>). Oocytes can also eliminate defective organelles or age-related molecular damage. For example, in mice, mitochondria containing defective DNA are eliminated during oogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fan et al., 2008</xref>), and in yeast, nuclear senescence factors and protein aggregates are extruded during meiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">King et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Unal et al., 2011</xref>). Mechanisms likely exist to counteract protein aggregation in <italic>Drosophila</italic> as well: relative to the soma, the eggs of <italic>Drosophila</italic> exhibit enhanced proteasome activity and resistance to protein aggregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fredriksson et al., 2012</xref>). Autophagy, a process known to eliminate damaged organelles and macromolecules, may play a role as well as it is required for the survival of the mouse germ lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gawriluk et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>The nematode <italic>C. elegans</italic> is a valuable organism for studies of germline quality control. The animal is transparent and genetically accessible, allowing one to analyze the effects of perturbations over time in living animals using fluorescent reporters. <italic>C. elegans</italic> is hermaphroditic, producing both sperm and oocytes in each of two symmetrical gonadal arms. Germ cells originate in stem-cell niches located at the distal ends of each arm and pass through successive stages of meiosis as they move proximally towards the spermatheca, where fertilization occurs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Crittenden et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hubbard and Greenstein, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">McCarter et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In 2010, Goudeau and Aguilaniu discovered that carbonylated proteins, known to accumulate during aging, are present throughout the distal germline, but are eliminated in proximal oocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Goudeau and Aguilaniu, 2010</xref>). Mutant worms that lack sperm and develop as females retain carbonylated proteins throughout the entire germline, indicating that sperm play a role in their elimination. In addition to carbonylated proteins, protein aggregates also accumulate in the proximal oocytes of females but not in those of hermaphrodites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bohnert and Kenyon, 2017</xref>). Signals from sperm trigger the elimination of protein aggregates in a process that is coupled to the broader choreography of oocyte maturation, which involves dramatic changes in organelle morphology and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bluemink et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Carroll, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Charbonneau and Grey, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">FitzHarris et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kobayashi et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Maller et al., 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mehlmann et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wasserman et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yamashita, 2018</xref>). In <italic>C. elegans,</italic> oocyte maturation is triggered by actin-like major sperm proteins (MSPs) released from sperm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kosinski et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Miller et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Miller et al., 2001</xref>) and involves changes in chromosome and nuclear dynamics linked to progression through meiosis, upregulation of translation, and changes in endoplasmic reticulum (ER), lysosomal and mitochondrial function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bohnert and Kenyon, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Huelgas-Morales and Greenstein, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Langerak et al., 2019</xref>). The shift in lysosomal physiology that occurs during oocyte maturation is crucial for aggregate removal: the sperm-derived signals trigger the acidification of lysosomes, which in turn engulf the aggregates by a process that resembles microautophagy morphologically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bohnert and Kenyon, 2017</xref>). Lysosomal acidification also triggers a conversion in mitochondrial dynamics from what appears to be a poised state, characterized by a high membrane potential, to an active state, in which the membrane potential is reduced. Conditions that prevent this mitochondrial membrane potential shift, such as inactivation of mitochondrial ATP synthase, prevent aggregate removal. However, how lysosomes become acidified in response to sperm signals, how mitochondria contribute to aggregate removal, and whether other organelles also play a role in aggregate clearance are important outstanding questions.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Identification of genes that prevent protein aggregation in maturing <italic>C. elegans</italic> oocytes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Diagram of the <italic>C. elegans</italic> germline.

Our findings deepen our understanding of many aspects of protein aggregation and clearance within the germline. Specifically, we find that (i) protein aggregates accumulate in young, newly formed oocytes in the absence of sperm—their formation is an integral part of oocyte development rather than a consequence of prolonged oocyte quiescence; (ii) inhibiting processes required for changes in ER morphogenesis and function during oocyte maturation, including protein synthesis and actin dynamics, prevents lysosome acidification by preventing the assembly of the V-ATPase lysosomal proton pump; (iii) mitochondria elaborate an energy-independent checkpoint that gates protein-aggregate removal; (iv) endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) proteins are required for aggregate removal, consistent with protein aggregates being removed via microautophagy; and, unexpectedly (v) as with proteasome inhibition, inhibiting TRiC-complex chaperonins or HSP70 chaperones promotes protein aggregation indirectly by acting upstream in the pathway to block lysosome acidification. Finally, we show that inhibiting lysosomal V-ATPase, vesicle-transport or proteasome function also accelerates age-dependent protein aggregation in the soma, thus bridging mechanisms that enhance proteostasis in the immortal germ lineage to those that maintain proteostasis in the aging soma.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A genome-wide RNAi screen identifies 81 genes that influence oocyte protein aggregation</title><p>To undertake an unbiased genome-wide RNAi screen for components of the germline proteostasis network, we utilized the Ahringer RNAi feeding library (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kamath et al., 2003</xref>), which targets ~87% of annotated <italic>C. elegans</italic> genes, to identify gene inhibitions that cause proteins to aggregate even in the presence of sperm; that is, in hermaphrodites. A germline-specific GFP::RHO-1 translational fusion was selected as the reporter for the screen as it forms dense patchy aggregates in female oocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bohnert and Kenyon, 2017</xref>) and in unfertilized oocytes of aging hermaphrodites, which deplete their stores of sperm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">David et al., 2010</xref>). Oocytes are formed in young adults, so RNAi was initiated at the beginning of the last larval stage (L4) to reduce the chance of missing genes with essential roles during development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The animals were examined manually by confocal microscopy on day 2 of adulthood for the presence of GFP::RHO-1 aggregates in proximal oocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A, B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The primary screen identified 367 genes whose knockdown led to GFP::RHO-1 aggregation in at least 50% of the animals. To eliminate false positives, the candidates were subjected to three independent rounds of validation using a similar workflow, with at least two independent rounds from two experimentalists (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). We note that false negatives could result from failure of an RNAi bacterial strain to grow adequately, from insufficient or excessive gene inhibition, or because of functional redundancy.</p><p>The resulting set of 88 genes represented diverse cellular processes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>), with highly enriched gene ontology (GO) categories including translation, RNA processing, and cytoskeletal organization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). In addition, ATP-hydrolysis-coupled proton transport and lysosome acidification were both highly enriched, in agreement with our previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bohnert and Kenyon, 2017</xref>). We sorted the candidates according to relative representation in major biological processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), after discarding candidates with known roles in male gonad and germ cell development (<italic>fkh-6, spe-15</italic>), in regulation of our proteostasis marker RHO-1 (<italic>cyk-4</italic>), or with potential off-target effects (<italic>adr-1</italic> and <italic>dhs-5</italic>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Protein synthesis and degradation, RNA processing, protein folding, and lysosome acidification were strongly represented biological processes, as were genes involved in cytoskeletal organization, including four of the five <italic>C. elegans</italic> actin genes. Among organelle systems, multiple candidates were associated with ER homeostasis (<italic>hsp-4, spcs-1,</italic> and <italic>srpa-68</italic>) and vesicle-mediated transport (<italic>copb-2, sec-24.1, sar-1, rab-11.1,</italic> and <italic>E03H4.8</italic>). We also identified genes that could not be classified into any of the highly enriched biological process categories and were designated ‘orphans’ (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).</p><p>We subjected representative candidates from each group, as well as all of the orphans, to an orthogonal screening approach, this time utilizing a different aggregation reporter, a germline-specific NMY-2::GFP fusion protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bohnert and Kenyon, 2017</xref>) that forms distinctive punctate aggregates in the absence of sperm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Out of the 55 candidates tested, 53 RNAi knockdowns also caused NMY-2::GFP protein-aggregate accumulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Thus, these genes are likely to have a general effect on protein-aggregate clearance rather than a specific effect on GFP::RHO-1.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Aggregates form in young proximal oocytes</title><p>We classified the RNAi phenotypes as strong, intermediate or subtle based on the degree of GFP::RHO-1 aggregation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Typically, the phenotypically strong gene knockdowns led to sterility, whereas the subtle knockdowns generally did not, though some reduced brood size. In principle, one could imagine that aggregates accumulate in oocytes from sterile hermaphrodites because oocytes that would normally undergo ovulation and pass into the uterus do not, and instead simply ‘age in place.’ Likewise, aggregates could accumulate in normal female oocytes because in the absence of sperm they proceed much more slowly through the spermatheca and into the uterus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">McCarter et al., 1999</xref>). As a consequence, proximal oocytes of females are technically older than those of age-matched hermaphrodites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kim et al., 2013</xref>). This oocyte-age discrepancy raises the question of whether aggregates accumulate only during long-term oocyte quiescence or whether they are present in newly formed female oocytes. To address this question, we collected age-matched late L4 (‘Christmas-tree’ stage) females and hermaphrodites and followed the hermaphrodites until their first oocytes were cellularized. We found that age-matched first-proximal oocytes of young females often contained protein aggregates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E,</xref> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Therefore, protein-aggregate accumulation does not require prolonged oocyte quiescence; instead, it appears to be part of the normal developmental sequence of oocytes that are not exposed to sperm.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>The ER influences protein aggregation</title><p>Many genes we identified were associated with the ER, so we explored ER biology in more detail.

We visualized the ER in <italic>C. elegans</italic> oocytes using a germline-specific mCherry::SP12 reporter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Joseph-Strauss et al., 2012</xref>). SP12 is a signal-peptidase subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Poteryaev et al., 2005</xref>), and <italic>spcs-1</italic>, which encodes SP12, was identified in our screen. In hermaphrodite oocytes, the ER assumed a fine network appearance, whereas in female oocytes, the ER formed bright, distinctive patches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A, C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). We also examined ER morphology in the first, newly formed female oocytes using the L4 staging procedure described above. Pristine female oocytes also exhibited ER patches, indicating that the altered ER architecture is an intrinsic property of female oocytes and not a consequence of prolonged quiescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,</xref> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). The fluorescent signal from the female ER was further enhanced as oocytes aged, possibly due to continued ER biogenesis coupled with oocyte compression caused by their packing within the gonad (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

The ER in pristine oocytes from both sexes appeared to be associated with ribosomes, indicative of active (or poised) protein synthesis, yet the female ER was distinctively clustered into parallel stacks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D,</xref> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>To test whether the stacked ER architecture of female oocytes could be reversed by sperm, we visualized fluorescently tagged ER and NMY-2::GFP aggregates simultaneously over time in female oocytes after mating.

The earliest changes in the ER were detected approximately 10 min after mating, and the morphology was significantly altered by 30 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). In contrast, the clearance of NMY-2 aggregates started a few minutes later, with aggregate clearance in the most proximal oocytes typically occurring between 20 and 30 min after mating (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">6A</xref>).</p><p>Next, we investigated whether the genes identified in our RNAi screen might contribute to proteostasis by influencing a process associated with ER architecture. To this end, we subjected mCherry::SP12-germline-labeled hermaphrodites to 35 RNAi treatments representing the various biological process categories as well as the individual orphans. This subset of RNAi clones, which we termed the ‘assay pool,’ was used for all subsequent large-scale phenotypic analyses (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). We visualized oocyte ER morphology in young adults subjected to the gene knockdowns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">Figure 2—figure supplement 6B</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Genes involved in cytoskeletal organization, protein synthesis and protein folding were required for maintaining normal ER morphology and led to an altered ER architecture when knocked down. Genes involved in RNA processing, protein degradation and trafficking comprised a mixed class, with some knockdowns appearing to affect ER morphology. We note that our analysis does not distinguish between genes with direct effects on ER morphogenesis, like the actin cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Poteryaev et al., 2005</xref>), and genes with indirect effects, like the proteasome, which is required for the degradation of GLD-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bohnert and Kenyon, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Goudeau et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Spike et al., 2018</xref>), a translational repressor involved in oocyte cell fate determination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Francis et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jones et al., 1996</xref>).

acidification</title><p>Signals from sperm elicit the lysosomal acidification required for the clearance of protein aggregates, and inhibiting the V-ATPase, which acidifies lysosomes, causes proteins to aggregate in hermaphrodite oocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bohnert and Kenyon, 2017</xref>). However, the mechanism by which lysosome acidification occurs in response to signals from sperm is not known (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Goudeau et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Spike et al., 2018</xref>). To address this question with minimal physiological disruption, we first attempted to fluorescently tag endogenously-expressed V-ATPase subunits using CRISPR/Cas9. We picked four different subunits, two from the membrane-embedded V<sub>0</sub> domain (VHA-4 and VHA-7) and two from the peripheral V<sub>1</sub> domain (VHA-11 and VHA-13) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Unexpectedly, although each one of these tagged proteins was visible in somatic tissues, we were unable to detect any fluorescence in the germline in either intact animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>) or in their dissected gonads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Germline fluorescence was also undetectable when imaging with a more sensitive wide-field system or following photobleaching of the strong intestinal signal, which we reasoned might mask a faint signal from the germline (data not shown). Endogenous genes tagged with fluorescent proteins can be silenced in the germline by the process of epigenetic RNAe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Shirayama et al., 2012</xref>); however, this explanation seems unlikely since, unlike V-ATPase RNAi-treated animals, these animals produced viable embryos.</p><p>We also considered the possibility that these V-ATPase proteins did not act cell-autonomously in the gonad, though V-ATPase mRNAs previously had been identified as direct targets of the germline-specific GLD-1 translational regulator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wright et al., 2011</xref>). To investigate cell autonomy, we carried out tissue-specific RNAi experiments using sterility as a phenotypic readout. Three hermaphrodite strains (wild type), globally RNAi-defective <italic>rde-1(mkc36)</italic> mutants DCL565, and germline-only RNAi-sensitive DCL569 animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zou et al., 2019</xref>) were subjected to RNAi from hatching (empty-vector, <italic>vha-12</italic> and <italic>vha-13</italic>). Both wild-type and germline-RNAi-permissive DCL569 animals exhibited sterility when fed <italic>vha-12</italic> and <italic>vha-13</italic> RNAi bacteria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B</xref>), whereas the whole-body RNAi-defective <italic>rde-1</italic> mutant did not. Thus, these V-ATPase subunits are expressed and required in the germline, despite our inability to detect them when tagged endogenously.</p><p>As a next-best approach for visualizing germline V-ATPase subunits, we obtained a Mos1-mediated single copy insertion (MosSCI) strain of GFP::VHA-13 driven by the germline-specific <italic>pie-1</italic> promoter. This strain expressed GFP::VHA-13 in a genetically stable fashion, though presumably at elevated levels. In these animals, we observed a striking, sperm-dependent pattern: GFP::VHA-13 formed distinct foci in hermaphrodite oocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3A</xref>) that colocalized with foci of LysoTracker, a dye that stains acidic lysosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B,</xref> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4A</xref>). In contrast, the proximal oocytes of females exhibited a diffuse GFP::VHA-13 fluorescent signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,</xref> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3B</xref>), with a slight enrichment in the perinuclear region. Female oocytes demonstrated very weak LysoTracker staining (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bohnert and Kenyon, 2017</xref>), and there was no significant overlap in the two signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B,</xref> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4B</xref>). To better control for effects of overexpression, we lowered the level of GFP::VHA-13 expression by serially diluting <italic>gfp</italic> RNAi bacteria. Even at the limit of fluorescence detection, hermaphrodites still exhibited GFP::VHA-13 foci, and females exhibited a diffuse distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2C</xref>). Thus, the germline harbors a mechanism by which VHA-13 is localized to discrete, acidic cellular locations, indicative of lysosomes, only in the presence of sperm. Notably, knocking down the <italic>vha-12</italic> gene, which encodes another peripheral V-ATPase V<sub>1</sub>-domain subunit, also prevented GFP::VHA-13 foci formation in hermaphrodite oocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2D</xref>), suggesting a coordinated assembly pathway.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Sperm-dependent lysosomal localization of VHA-13.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Distribution of GFP::VHA-13 in proximal oocytes of hermaphrodites (PHX1414) and females (CF4599).

All of the knockdowns that blocked lysosome acidification showed reduced GFP::VHA-13 skewness, albeit to varying degrees.

We were not able to visualize lysosome acidification in the head using LysoTracker, but these knockdowns did affect lysosome acidification in the intestine, where the RNAi treatment led to fewer discrete acidic lysosome-related organelles, thereby reducing the skewness of the LysoTracker signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>).

A key step in aggregate removal is the acidification of lysosomes, which subsequently engulf the aggregates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bohnert and Kenyon, 2017</xref>). In addition, mitochondria, which undergo morphological and metabolic changes in response to maturation signals, appear to play an important regulatory role as inhibition of mitochondrial ATP synthase prevents the downshift in mitochondrial membrane potential normally triggered by sperm and causes aggregates to form even when sperm are present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bohnert and Kenyon, 2017</xref>). In this study, we identified a key role for a third organelle, the ER, in proteostasis renewal, and, using genetic and cell biological approaches, we deepened our understanding of all three organelles, the ER, lysosomes, and mitochondria, in oocyte protein quality control.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Limits of our genetic screen</title><p>To identify additional genes and processes involved in protein-aggregate metabolism in oocytes, we carried out a genome-wide screen for RNA inhibitions that cause proteins to aggregate even in the presence of sperm, namely, in hermaphrodites. We expected to identify genes and processes that are directly involved in the sperm-dependent proteostasis switch, as well as genes that function more indirectly in protein homeostasis and cellular quality control. Many of the genes we recovered affected large multiprotein complexes, such as the ribosome and proteasome, making a compelling argument for these complexes influencing protein aggregation, directly or indirectly. However, we may have missed processes carried out by only one or a few genes if the corresponding RNAi bacteria were missing from the RNAi library or otherwise problematic; or if their inhibition produced milder protein-aggregation phenotypes, like the ESCRT genes that failed our initial, stringent validation tests (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>).</p><p>To place the genes into a proteostasis pathway, we asked which hallmarks of the sperm-triggered aggregate-clearance pathway (lysosome acidification, mitochondrial membrane-potential shift, etc.) were blocked by the knockdowns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). An intrinsic limitation of this strategy is that it only identifies the first role of a gene that acts in multiple steps in the process. For example, because inhibiting the proteasome prevents degradation of the proximal oocyte cell-fate determinant GLD-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bohnert and Kenyon, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kisielnicka et al., 2018</xref>) and inhibiting various other chaperones prevents lysosome acidification, we cannot determine whether these proteins also play a direct role in the process of aggregate clearance itself. Finally, we note that perturbations that prevent sperm from producing the MSP oocyte maturation signal would also cause protein aggregation in hermaphrodites. The fact that the great majority of the knockdowns did not replicate female oocyte morphology exactly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>) argues against this possibility, but we have not ruled it out definitively.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Model: biological processes implicated in the clearance of protein aggregates during oocyte maturation.</title></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-62653-fig7-v1.tif"/></fig></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>A role for the ER</title><p>Many of the genes we identified affected the ER (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). All of these gene inhibitions prevented lysosome acidification, arguing that ER function influences aggregate formation indirectly, acting at a relatively early step in the proteostasis pathway (though ER function could be required again, at later stages, as well). Using TEM and fluorescent reporters, we validated and extended previous observations of ER reorganization during <italic>C. elegans</italic> oocyte maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Langerak et al., 2019</xref>). We found that the ER assumes a stacked arrangement, spatially distinct from GFP::RHO-1 protein aggregates, in the proximal oocytes of females. Importantly, we found that neither the ER stacking nor protein-aggregate accumulation were a consequence of long-term oocyte quiescence (‘oocyte aging’) as both were present as soon as female oocytes appeared during development. When oocyte maturation was triggered by mating, the ER underwent a rapid reorganization that preceded aggregate removal, consistent with a model that ER activity might be a precondition for aggregate clearance.</p><p>The ER-gene inhibitions fell into two classes. First was a set of genes with known ER functions that did not appear to affect ER morphology: <italic>hsp-4</italic> (BIP), <italic>spcs-1</italic> (signal peptidase complex subunit), and <italic>srpa-68</italic> (signal recognition particle). This finding argues that ER reorganization does not require ER function itself. The second class did affect ER morphology, generally causing the ER from hermaphrodites to exhibit a bright patchy appearance characteristic of (though not necessarily identical to) that seen in female oocytes. Some of these gene knockdowns, such as that of <italic>itr-1,</italic> which encodes the channel that releases calcium stored in the ER, likely cause hermaphrodites to adopt a female-specific, stacked ER morphology. In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, the major wave of oocyte calcium release occurs after fertilization; this finding suggests that ER-dependent calcium metabolism plays an important earlier role as well. Other RNAi knockdowns may simply disrupt ER morphology more generally and might not identify genes that play an active role in the oocyte proteostasis switch. For example, the actin cytoskeleton is known to influence ER morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Poteryaev et al., 2005</xref>), and we recovered a number of cytoskeletal gene hits. Notably, TRiC-complex chaperonin genes fell into this class as well. The TRiC-complex chaperonin can counteract protein aggregation directly; for example, by promoting correct protein folding during protein synthesis. However, TRiC is known to assist in folding cytoskeletal components including actin and tubulin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Llorca et al., 2000</xref>), and it was interesting to find that the TRiC-complex genes we recovered, <italic>cct-1</italic> and <italic>cct-5,</italic> acted indirectly by affecting ER morphology and lysosome acidification. As mentioned above, the proteasome too affects aggregate clearance indirectly. In general, it might be valuable to assay lysosome acidification when analyzing the functions of these chaperone/chaperonin systems on the accumulation of protein aggregates in other cellular systems to test for the possibility of indirect effects. That said, it is also possible that TRiC-complex and other chaperones act at multiple points in the proteostasis pathway, with both indirect and direct effects on protein aggregation.</p><p>Finally, we identified several genes that, to our knowledge, were not previously known to influence ER morphology; namely, <italic>dlg-1</italic>, <italic>kin-2</italic> and <italic>ttr-14</italic> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>).

A central goal of this study was to better understand how this lysosome acidification is regulated in worms. To this end, we first generated functional, fluorescently tagged V-ATPase subunits expressed from their own loci. However, for reasons that we do not understand, none of these proteins was visible in the germline. We then obtained a stable, single-copy MosSCI strain in which <italic>gfp::vha-13</italic> was expressed from a germline-specific promoter. In these animals, GFP::VHA-13 was visible, and we observed a striking sperm-dependent localization pattern. In the presence of sperm (in hermaphrodites), GFP::VHA-13 was located on lysosomes; that is, it assumed a punctate appearance that colocalized with LysoTracker signal. In the absence of sperm (in unmated females), the protein was distributed throughout the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). The simplest interpretation of these findings is that signals from sperm trigger the localization of GFP::VHA-13 to lysosomes, and that this localization enables lysosome acidification. In principle, additional levels of control, such as translational repression of V-ATPase synthesis, could operate as well since our overexpressed construct could potentially override negative regulators, though we observed no evidence of this with serially diluted <italic>gfp</italic> RNAi treatments that progressively reduced visible GFP::VHA-13 protein levels.</p><p>In yeast, peripheral, cytoplasmic V<sub>1</sub> subunits of the V-ATPase (such as the VHA-13 ortholog VMA1) localize to lysosomes when the membrane-localized V<sub>0</sub> sector is trafficked there from the ER, where it is assembled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Graham et al., 1998</xref>). Thus, we propose that the extensive rearrangement in ER morphology triggered by sperm in <italic>C. elegans</italic> oocytes is coupled to movement of either preexisting or newly synthesized membrane-localized V<sub>0</sub> subunits of the V-ATPase from the ER to lysosomes, where they create docking sites for cytoplasmic, peripheral V<sub>1</sub> subunits. Consistent with this idea, RNAi of the ER genes, as well as each of the three genes required for vesicle trafficking from the ER to lysosomes, prevented GFP::VHA-13 localization to lysosomes, as did inhibiting genes encoding the membrane-localized V-ATPase V<sub>0</sub> subunits. Unfortunately, our efforts to observe the predicted sperm-activated movement of V<sub>0</sub> subunits from the ER to lysosomes were thwarted by our inability to visualize either of two functional wrmScarlet-tagged V<sub>0</sub> subunits, even when overexpressed using MosSCI technology. In the future, immuno-gold EM labeling of endogenous V<sub>0</sub> subunits might enable this model to be tested more directly.</p><p>We note that an interesting puzzle remains unexplained: If the multi-subunit lysosomal V-ATPase complexes are present in such low amounts in mature oocytes that they cannot be seen when we fluorescently tag the endogenous <italic>vha-13</italic> gene, then why do they appear when the tagged VHA-13 protein is overexpressed? How does the excess GFP::VHA-13 protein dock onto lysosomes? Perhaps the ER supplies lysosomes with alternative docking sites for unassembled V-ATPase subunits or perhaps the stoichiometry change due to the excess GFP::VHA-13 subunits triggers the production of entirely new V-ATPase complexes that incorporate the overexpressed GFP::VHA-13 subunits. This remains an unexplained but intriguing mystery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hughes and Gottschling, 2012</xref>).</p><p>The gene knockdowns identified by the screen nearly all prevented lysosomal acidification, reinforcing the central role of acidified lysosomes in clearing oocyte protein aggregates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Moreover, none of the knockdowns that failed to acidify lysosomes exhibited a punctate, lysosomal GFP::VHA-13 pattern (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). This finding suggests that V-ATPase activity may not only be necessary but also sufficient for lysosome acidification; however, this interpretation remains tentative since we may simply have failed to identify the relevant genes in our screen. Finally, several of the knockdowns from our screen did not appear to affect ER morphology (and have not been reported to affect ER function), but did prevent V-ATPase localization, for example, <italic>srab-17</italic>, a chemosensory gene of the serpentine receptor class ab, and <italic>lgc-46,</italic> involved in chloride ion transport (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>).

In response to sperm, the mitochondria of proximal oocytes reduce their relatively high membrane potential and shift from a fragmented to a tubular structure. Inhibiting mitochondrial ATP synthase preserves this high membrane potential even when sperm are present and causes aggregates to accumulate. Injecting ADP, whose levels would be expected to rise as maturing oocytes initiate protein synthesis and acidify lysosomes, reduces the mitochondrial membrane potential in female oocytes, in an ATP synthase-dependent fashion. Together, these findings suggested the model that in the absence of sperm, mitochondria are held in a quiescent, poised state that relaxes as metabolic activity and ATP synthesis commence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bohnert and Kenyon, 2017</xref>).</p><p>Whether <italic>C. elegans</italic> oocyte maturation is powered primarily by glycolysis or respiration is unknown; however, in principle, the accumulation of protein aggregates caused by inhibiting mitochondrial ATP synthase could reflect ATP limitation. However, if this were the case, then inhibiting components of the ETC should also cause protein aggregates to accumulate in hermaphrodites since this too limits ATP levels. However, although these knockdowns reduced oocyte ATP levels, body size, growth rates, and brood size, this was not the case; ETC knockdowns had no effect on protein aggregation. This unexpected finding suggests that ATP synthase knockdown prevents aggregate clearance not because of changes in ATP levels, but instead either because a continuously high mitochondrial membrane potential acts like a checkpoint to inhibit aggregate clearance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) or because of another, unknown role of ATP synthase in protein homeostasis.</p><p>Our screen revealed an additional requirement for mitochondria in protein homeostasis; specifically, for Krebs cycle activity. Inhibiting mitochondrial aconitase (<italic>aco-</italic>2) produced a different phenotype from inhibiting ATP synthase; namely, a failure to acidify lysosomes. Why might this be? Again, the explanation seems unlikely to involve energy limitation since inhibiting ETC components or ATP synthase did not produce this phenotype. One possibility is that inhibiting the Krebs cycle affects lysosome acidification by affecting redox potential, as several Krebs cycle enzymes affecting protein aggregation (<italic>ogdh-1</italic> and <italic>sdhd-1</italic>) encode dehydrogenases that produce the reducing agents NADH and FADH<sub>2</sub>, and aconitase supplies the substrate for another Krebs cycle dehydrogenase. Alternatively, other metabolites generated via Krebs cycle intermediates could influence the events leading to lysosome acidification. It will be interesting to explore this mechanism in the future.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Microautophagy</title><p>Previously, we observed lysosomes engulfing protein aggregates in a process reminiscent of microautophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bohnert and Kenyon, 2017</xref>). Before these observations, microautophagy had not been described in <italic>C. elegans.</italic> In this study, using a candidate approach, we showed that inhibiting ESCRT-complex members, which are known to mediate microautophagy in other organisms, prevents aggregate accumulation in maturing <italic>C. elegans</italic> oocytes. Moreover, they influence protein aggregation independently of lysosomal acidification, consistent with their having a direct role. These findings strengthen the case that microautophagy is an active proteostasis mechanism in <italic>C. elegans,</italic> and likely the mechanism by which aggregates are cleared in response to oocyte maturation signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>Implications for somatic proteostasis and aging</title><p>Together, our findings all point towards lysosomal acidification being a key determinative event in oocyte protein-aggregate clearance. Notably, the screen hits that affected the lysosomal V-ATPase and COPII (ER-to-lysosomal vesicle transport) had a striking ability to accelerate age-dependent protein aggregation in somatic cells. Thus, the same mechanisms that enhance oocyte proteostasis in the immortal germline likely enhance somatic proteostasis as well. These findings may have implications for aging and longevity more broadly. In yeast, lysosomal acidity declines with age, and overexpressing the yeast ortholog of the <italic>C. elegans</italic> V-ATPase gene <italic>vha-13</italic> delays this decline and extends replicative lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hughes and Gottschling, 2012</xref>). In worms, lysosome acidification also declines with age, and this decline is delayed in long-lived mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Baxi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sun et al., 2020</xref>). Whether increasing V-ATPase function might be sufficient to extend lifespan in <italic>C. elegans</italic> is unclear, but overproduction of the transcription factor HLH-30/TFEB, which augments many lysosomal functions, has been shown to do so (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lapierre et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">O'Rourke and Ruvkun, 2013</xref>), and in mammals, similar perturbations slow the aging of the immune system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>In summary, a genetic screen for proteostasis enhancers in the immortal germ lineage has revealed a landscape of interconnected processes spanning protein translation, cytoskeletal dynamics, Krebs cycle activity, ER activation and vesicle transport, that together enable lysosome acidification and clearance of protein aggregates during oocyte maturation. Lysosomal acidification maintains proteostasis in the aging soma as well. In addition to raising many new questions for future investigations, our findings support a growing body of evidence indicating that interventions which rejuvenate lysosomal activity during aging might yield new ways to increase human health and longevity.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>RNAi reagents (<italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>)</td><td>Multiple</td><td><italic>C. elegans</italic> RNAi Collection (Source BioScience)</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:SCR_017064">SCR_017064</ext-link></td><td><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref></td></tr><tr><td>Strains, (<italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>)</td><td>Multiple</td><td>Caenorhabditis Genetics Center (CGC)</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:SCR_007341">SCR_007341</ext-link></td><td><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref></td></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>GraphPad Prism 9.0.1</td><td>GraphPad</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:SCR_002798">SCR_002798</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>ImageJ/Fiji</td><td>Fiji</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:SCR_002285">SCR_002285</ext-link></td><td/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title><italic>C. elegans</italic> strains and maintenance</title><p>All strains used in this study are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>.

In categories such as translation or protein degradation, we specifically included at least one candidate of small and large ribosomal subunits or structural and regulatory proteasomal subunits, respectively. Similarly, in the actin cytoskeletal category, we ensured that both structural and regulatory genes were included. No other specific criteria were used to avoid any bias in candidate selection.

Samples were then incubated at 95°C, 5 min. cDNAs were synthesized from RNA templates using a reverse transcription mix following the manufacturer’s instructions. qPCR was carried out on an QuantStudio 6 Flex Real-Time PCR System using a SYBR green-based real‐time kit (Kapa Biosystems). The RNA polymerase II subunit <italic>ama-1</italic> was used as the housekeeping control. The qPCR primers were as follows: <italic>vps‐20</italic> [<named-content content-type="sequence">TCCGATCAGGATAATGCGATTT</named-content>]/[<named-content content-type="sequence">AGCGCCTGGAATTACCAAA</named-content>]; <italic>vps‐54</italic> [<named-content content-type="sequence">TTCACTCTTCACAGGTGAGTTC</named-content>]/[<named-content content-type="sequence">CCTGTGATCTACATGATTCTCTCTC</named-content>]; <italic>ama‐1</italic> [<named-content content-type="sequence">GACGAGTCCAACGTACTCTCCAAC</named-content>]/[<named-content content-type="sequence">TACTTGGGGCTCGATGGGC</named-content>].</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Data analysis and statistics</title><p>ImageJ Fiji was used to quantify and analyze attributes from image data, and images from a given experimental set were scaled and processed identically for comparison. Preparation of graphs and statistical analyses was performed using GraphPad Prism 8. Statistical tests used to determine significance and p-values are described in the figure legends of each experiment. Each violin plot representation includes the median and quartiles, and distributions in bar graphs represent mean ± standard deviation. Figures displaying numerical values obtained by analysis of microscopy images of dye-stained worms report the average of multiple independent values (technical replicates) from individual animals (biological replicates), each of which are represented as data points. Experiments reporting qualitative phenotypes from microscopy images were performed at least three times (independently) with 10–15 animals per condition in each individual experiment (except the primary screen that was done only once but validated in three independent experiments). For all other cases, sample sizes and replicates are included in the corresponding figure legends. No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample sizes. Investigators were blinded to identity of RNAi clones (except for controls) while imaging multiple knockdown conditions in 96-well plates.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank colleagues in the Kenyon lab and at Calico Life Sciences for advice and discussion, and Daniel Gottschling and Calvin Jan for comments on the manuscript.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Jessica Tyler as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, when editors judge that a submitted work as a whole belongs in <italic>eLife</italic> but that some conclusions require a modest amount of additional new data, as they do with your paper, we are asking that the manuscript be revised to either limit claims to those supported by data in hand, or to explicitly state that the relevant conclusions require additional supporting data.</p><p>Our expectation is that the authors will eventually carry out the additional experiments and report on how they affect the relevant conclusions either in a preprint on bioRxiv or medRxiv, or if appropriate, as a Research Advance in <italic>eLife</italic>, either of which would be linked to the original paper.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The reviewers agreed that the manuscript reports a significant, technically strong data on genes involved in triggering the clearance of protein aggregates from mature oocytes that is mediated by the lysosome switch following fertilization.</p><p>The central genome-wide screen is enabled by an elegant and carefully designed approach, followed by carefully validation of hits using a staged experimental design and this results in a high quality dataset of genes involved. The reviewers also agreed that the evidence provided is generally strong and found the core conclusions convincing. There was some difference in opinion regarding the novelty of these insights, mainly due to most of the target genes falling into gene families and pathways previously implicated in this process. However, it was noted that there are also a number a novel and potentially important observations, including the identification of ESCRT-complex members. The screen provides an unbiased, near full genome, assessment of genes that are critical for clearing protein aggregates in oocytes. Because of this, I feel that the absence of hits to unexpected genes and pathways is also a relevant insight. The majority view was that on the strength of the evidence there is sufficient novelty and interest to accept the manuscript for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>, subject to adequate responses to several major comments. These comments are listed below.</p><p>Essential revisions for this paper:</p><p>1) Defects of clearance of protein aggregates from the mature oocytes upon RNAi treatment may also be due to defects/limitations in sperm signalling. An important control that is missing is to show that the effects derive from the oocytes physiology rather than from the sperm. This could be tested by mating RNAi-treated animals (for all the RNAis that passed the screen) with wild-type males, and following oocyte proteostasis. This can be done for a representative gene from each category (proton pump, mitochondria, er, microautophagy). If collection of such data is not feasible due to COVID related limitations, this concern should be discussed and the question addressed in follow up work.</p><p>2) The authors also suggest that proteostasis promoting mechanisms in the germline also operate in the soma.

An important control that is missing is to show that the effects derive from the oocytes physiology rather than from the sperm. This could be tested by mating RNAi-treated animals (for all the RNAis that passed the screen) with wild-type males, and following oocyte proteostasis. This can be done for a representative gene from each category (proton pump, mitochondria, er, microautophagy). If collection of such data is not feasible due to COVID related limitations, this concern should be discussed and the question addressed in follow up work.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you very much for this comment. We agree, it should be addressed in the paper. The mating experiments are actually quite complicated and time consuming, as the mating events need to be observed in real time, and then the animals need to be transferred immediately to the confocal microscope to assay aggregate abundance, prior to ovulation. Because most of the RNAi treatments that produce aggregates disrupt fundamental aspects of oocyte cell biology (translation, lysosomal function, proteosome function, ER function, etc.), this careful timing, using young females, seems especially important, since we would want to ensure that the RNAi-treated oocytes are capable of aggregate clearance if their aggregation defect is due to defective sperm-signal (MSP) production. We did try another approach, using an auxin-inducible strategy we developed to clear a component of the MSP (sperm signal) response pathway to mimic mating, but unfortunately this strategy proved to be unfeasible. Thus, at this point we can say with certainty that the RNAi knockdowns do not only affect the sperm, as hermaphrodite oocytes exposed to our RNAi hits exhibit morphologies distinct from those seen in the stacked oocytes of normal females. Likewise, physiological aspects of oocytes from RNAi-treated hermaphrodites are distinct from females. For example, as we describe in the text, the ratio of the mitochondrial membrane potential (maturing oocytes / distal germline) is higher in the germlines of many RNAi-treated hermaphrodite than it is in normal females, as measured using DiOC6(3) (Figures 5A and Figure 5—figure supplement 1). Nonetheless, we cannot exclude the possibility that in some cases, gene knockdown causes aggregates to accumulate because it blocks MSP production by sperm, not because of the additional effects it had on oocytes. We now state this caveat in the section “limits of our genetic screen” (lines 524-528).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors also suggest that proteostasis promoting mechanisms in the germline also operate in the soma. This statement is based on one somatic reporter whose aggregation was increased upon RNAi treatments that were shown to affect lysosome acidification. Given the central role of the lysosome in other proteostasis promoting pathways such as autophagy, the correlation to germline proteostasis could be coincidental. These concerns should be addressed either experimentally or the section should be toned down or removed (it does not affect the main conclusions of the paper).</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this comment. We have now analyzed an additional somatic protein, the aggregation-prone polyQ protein, Q35, expressed in the body-wall muscle (Morley J et al., 2002). Similar to our results with the KIN-19 reporter, we find that a number of our germline hits lead to premature aggregation of the Q35::YFP reporter when knocked down using RNAi. While multiple genes identified in the Q35 screen overlap with those identified using KIN-19, there are also some interesting differences, some of which may reflect specific properties of different types of protein aggregates. For instance, <italic>vps-37</italic> RNAi resulted in aggregation of the Q35 reporter but not of KIN-19 (Figure 6—figure supplement 3 and 4). Notably, genes involved in macroautophagy (<italic>bec-1, lgg-1, atg-9</italic>) didn’t lead to aggregation in either somatic reporter under the conditions tested and criteria used for the rest of our analyses. Thus, together our results suggest that lysosome acidification is key for preventing protein aggregation in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> germline and soma, and likely involves mechanism(s) other than macroautophagy. We have updated the manuscript to include the new data in the Results (lines 471-484), Figures (Figure 6—figure supplement 3 and 4), and Materials and methods (lines 875-876 and 1032-1045).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Related to the same observation that knockdown of several of the genes identified also appears to affect protein aggregation in the soma (Figure 6) – and with reference to the final discussion, where the authors link their insights to possible future interventions to extend healthy lifespan, it would be informative to report healthspan or lifespan of worms subjected to those RNAi construct that increase endogenous protein aggregation (Figure 6D).

While we do not provide additional data regarding the healthspan or lifespan of animals subjected to RNAi that increased KIN-19 aggregation, most of the corresponding gene knockdowns have previously been reported to reduce lifespan. For example, the V-ATPase knockdown <italic>vha-13(RNAi)</italic> drastically shortens the lifespan of animals exposed to RNAi from L4 stage (Extended data figure 3 from Bohnert and Kenyon, 2017); RNAi treatments of most proteasome subunits during adulthood, including <italic>pbs-7</italic> RNAi and <italic>rpn-6</italic> RNAi, elicited a dramatic shortening of lifespan in wild-type animals (SI Table 1 from Ghazi et al., 2007). Likewise, <italic>copb-2</italic> RNAi (<italic>F38E11.5</italic> RNAi) shortens lifespan (Table S3 from Tacutu et al., 2012).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Revisions expected in follow-up work:</p><p>1) The authors use reduced size and growth rate as proxy for reduced energy availability and ATP levels with ETC RNAi.

The effects of various ETC knockdowns on ATP levels and growth and development have also been reported previously by multiple groups. For example, reduced ATP levels were described in multiple respiratory knockdowns including <italic>nuo-2, cyc-1</italic> and <italic>atp-3,</italic> by Dillin A et al., 2002. Further, reduced growth and slow development have previously been reported for ETC knockdowns e.g., Melo and Ruvkun, 2012 (<italic>atp-2</italic>), Fraser AG et al., 2000 (<italic>nuo-2</italic>) and Zipperlen P et al., 2001 (<italic>cyc-1</italic>).</p><p>To specifically investigate the effect of ETC knockdowns on germline ATP levels, requested by the reviewer, we utilized two approaches. First, we fed the worms Biotracker ATPRed dye, a live-cell imaging dye, and we observed reduced oocyte ATP levels in ETC knockdowns relative to the control animals. In addition, we injected a modified germline-specific FRET-based ATP sensor, Ateam (Imamura et al., 2009), to probe oocyte ATP levels. Unfortunately, Ateam expression was found to be highly variable and only a small number of animals demonstrated sufficient expression for conducting the FRET experiments reliably. However, even with the limited numbers of animals, we observed a marked reduction in ATP levels in oocytes of animals subjected to ETC RNAi. Thus, the results from both of these approaches confirm that ETC gene knockdowns markedly reduce germline ATP levels, and that this tissue is not protected from ATP depletion. We have updated the manuscript to include the new information in the Results (line 398), Discussion (lines 650-651), Figures (Figure 5—figure supplement 2) and Materials and methods (lines 941 and 969-985).</p><p>References:</p><p>Bohnert KA, Kenyon C. 2017.
