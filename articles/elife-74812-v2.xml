Recent work shows that histone methylation is associated with aging, yet the underlying mechanism remains unclear. In this work, we identified a class of putative histone 3 lysine 9 mono/dimethyltransferase genes (<italic>met-2, set-6, set-19, set-20, set-21, set-32,</italic> and <italic>set-33</italic>), mutations in which induce synergistic lifespan extension in the long-lived DAF-2 (insulin growth factor 1 [IGF-1] receptor) mutant in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>. These putative histone methyltransferase plus <italic>daf-2</italic> double mutants not only exhibited an average lifespan nearly three times that of wild-type animals and a maximal lifespan of approximately 100 days, but also significantly increased resistance to oxidative and heat stress. Synergistic lifespan extension depends on the transcription factor DAF-16 (FOXO). mRNA-seq experiments revealed that the mRNA levels of DAF-16 Class I genes, which are activated by DAF-16, were further elevated in the <italic>daf-2;set</italic> double mutants. Among these genes, <italic>tts-1</italic>, <italic>F35E8.7</italic>, <italic>ins-35</italic>, <italic>nhr-62</italic>, <italic>sod-3</italic>, <italic>asm-2,</italic> and <italic>Y39G8B.7</italic> are required for the lifespan extension of the <italic>daf-2;set-21</italic> double mutant. In addition, treating <italic>daf-2</italic> animals with the H3K9me1/2 methyltransferase G9a inhibitor also extends lifespan and increases stress resistance. Therefore, investigation of DAF-2 and H3K9me1/2 deficiency-mediated synergistic longevity will contribute to a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms of aging and therapeutic applications.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>longevity</kwd><kwd>epigenetic</kwd><kwd>insulin pathway</kwd><kwd>FOXO transcription factor</kwd><kwd>aging</kwd><kwd>histone methyltransferases</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100012226</institution-id><institution>Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Guang</surname><given-names>Shouhong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100012166</institution-id><institution>National Key Research and Development Program of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2019YFA0802600</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Guang</surname><given-names>Shouhong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>91940303</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Guang</surname><given-names>Shouhong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31870812</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Guang</surname><given-names>Shouhong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>32070619</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Feng</surname><given-names>Xuezhu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31871300</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Feng</surname><given-names>Xuezhu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31900434</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhu</surname><given-names>Chengming</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The depletion of a new class of putative histone methyltransferases, including MET-2, SET-6, SET-19, SET-20, SET-21, SET-32, and SET-33, induced synergistic lifespan extension in <italic>daf-2</italic> animals to an average lifespan nearly three times that of wild-type animals.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Lifespan is governed by complex interactions between genetic and environmental factors. The perturbation of insulin/insulin-like signaling, target of rapamycin (TOR) pathway, and mitochondrial functions have been shown to extensively modulate lifespan and health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fontana et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kenyon, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">López-Otín et al., 2013</xref>). These genetic manipulations often lead to significant changes in gene expression at both the transcriptional and translational levels. Inhibition of DAF-2, the <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> ortholog of the insulin growth factor 1 (IGF-1) receptor, doubles adult lifespan by activating the DAF-16 (FOXO) transcription factor to regulate downstream genes involved in stress resistance, detoxification, and metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kenyon et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kimura et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lin et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ogg et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Murphy et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">McElwee et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>In addition to genetic regulation, aging is also modulated by epigenetic processes. Epigenetic marks, including histone acetylation and methylation, as well as the associated chromatin states, are altered during aging. Aging-dependent loss of chromatin repression is correlated with alterations in gene expression patterns, which have been documented in species ranging from <italic>C. elegans</italic> to humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lee et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lund et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bennett-Baker et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lu et al., 2004</xref>). For example, the methylation of histone 3 lysine 4 methylation (H3K4me) is one of the posttranslational histone modifications that marks on regions of active transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Shilatifard, 2008</xref>). H3K4me is deposited by the MLL/COMPASS complex, which travels with elongating RNA Polymerase II during transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wood et al., 2007</xref>). In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, animals with reductions in COMPASS complex subunits (<italic>wdr-5, ash-2,</italic> and <italic>set-2</italic>) live longer than wild-type individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Greer et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>However, little is known about the importance of repressive histone modification for aging marks. The H3K27me3 demethylase UTX-1 regulates lifespan independently of the presence of the germline but in a manner that depends on the insulin-FOXO signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Maures et al., 2011</xref>). MET-2, a mammalian H3K9 methyltransferase SETDB1 homolog (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Loyola et al., 2006</xref>), likely monomethylates and dimethylates H3K9 in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Towbin et al., 2012</xref>). MET-2 is necessary both for a normal lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Tian et al., 2016</xref>) and for the lifespan extension of <italic>wdr-5</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lee et al., 2019</xref>). SET-6 is a putative H3K9me2/3 methyltransferase but not H3K9me1. Although the depletion of SET-6 does not significantly increase the lifespan of <italic>C. elegans</italic>, it may increase healthy aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Yuan et al., 2020</xref>). SET-25 is a putative trimethylase for H3K9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Towbin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Padeken et al., 2021</xref>). However, the deletion of SET-25 does not significantly change the worm lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Woodhouse et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>The enzymes responsible for histone lysine methylation are called histone methyltransferases (HMTs). HMTs typically contain a conserved catalytic domain called SET, which stems from <bold>S</bold>u(var)3–9, <bold>E</bold>nhancer of zeste, and <bold>T</bold>rithorax, the first HMTs known to carry this domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Tschiersch et al., 1994</xref>). The <italic>C. elegans</italic> genome encodes 38 SET domain-containing proteins, of which 5 are essential for viability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andersen and Horvitz, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Ni et al., 2012</xref>). However, the biological roles of most SET proteins are largely unknown.</p><p>To investigate the function of repressive histone methylation in lifespan regulation, we selected a number of putative H3K9 methyltransferases as well as methyltransferases that may indirectly regulate H3K9me and tested whether the loss-of-function of these SET proteins could change the lifespan of <italic>C. elegans</italic>. Interestingly, we found that the H3K9me1/2, but not H3K9me3, mutants exhibited a synergistic lifespan extension with <italic>daf-2</italic> mutation. These animals showed an average lifespan of approximately 60 days, which is approximately 70% longer than that of <italic>daf-2</italic> worms and is three times as long as that of wild-type N2 animals. The double mutants exhibited a maximal lifespan of approximately 100 days. The synergistic lifespan extension of DAF-2 and lifespan-limiting HMT mutants depend on the transcription factor DAF-16 (FOXO). mRNA-seq experiments showed that DAF-16 Class I genes (genes that are activated by DAF-16) are activated in long-lived worms. Therefore, we conclude that H3K9me1/2 may limit the lifespan of <italic>daf-2</italic> animals by repressing the expression of DAF-16 Class I genes.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The depletion of <italic>set-21</italic> extends lifespan and enhances stress resistance in <italic>daf-2</italic> mutant</title><p>SET-21 is a homolog of human isoform 1 of histone-lysine <italic>N</italic>-methyltransferase SUV39H2, with functions unknown in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wenzel et al., 2011</xref>).

Although it is unclear whether DAF-16 preferentially recognizes H3K9me2 or H3K9me3, we observed a much stronger enrichment of DAF-16 in the nucleus in <italic>daf-2;set-21</italic> than in <italic>daf-2</italic> animals, which suggested that H3K9me2 may prohibit the accumulation of DAF-16 in the nucleus. Third, DAF-2 may have other indirect effect on the SET proteins. Further ChIP experiments can be used to test whether <italic>daf-2</italic> mutation could affect the association of the SET proteins with chromatin. The ATAC-seq technology may allow us to investigate whether <italic>daf-2</italic> mutation have changed chromosome accessibility to facilitate the activity of SET proteins. In addition, identification of the substrate of SET proteins may help to elucidate their mechanism and functions.</p><p>In <italic>daf-2</italic> animals, DAF-16 modestly accumulated in the nucleus, as shown by the newly generated single-copy GFP-tagged DAF-16 transgene. Yet in <italic>daf-2;set-21</italic> double mutants, DAF-16 was strongly enriched in the nucleus. The depletion of DAF-16 completely blocked the synergistic lifespan extension in <italic>daf-2;set-21</italic> animals. The mRNA-seq experiments revealed that the mRNA levels of DAF-16 Class I genes were elevated in the long-lived <italic>daf-2;set-19</italic>, <italic>daf-2;set-21</italic>, and <italic>daf-2;set-32</italic> double mutants compared to those in control <italic>daf-2</italic> and short-lived <italic>daf-2;set-25</italic> mutants. Together, these data suggested that the activity to DAF-16 to Class I genes not only depends on the absence of insulin pathway, but also depends on the depletion of these SET proteins and H3K9me2. The single-copy GFP-tagged DAF-16 transgene may allow us to re-visit the mechanism of lifespan regulation pathways.</p><p>A trade-off has been proposed between fertility and lifespan, where increasing lifespan usually comes at the cost of reduced fertility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kirkwood, 1977</xref>). In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, removing the germ cells extends lifespan, triggers the nuclear localization of the DAF-16/FOXO transcription factor, and activates target genes in the intestine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berman and Kenyon, 2006</xref>). Some long-lived mutant worms, like <italic>daf-2</italic> and <italic>rsks-1</italic>, show reduced brood size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen et al., 2013</xref>). Consistently, we found that the long-lived worms daf-2;met-2, daf-2;set-6, daf-2;set-19, daf-2;set-20, daf-2;set-21, daf-2;set-32, and daf-2;set-33 all have reduced brood size compared to that of <italic>daf-2</italic> animals. However, additional investigations are necessary to examine whether removing the germline cells could further extend worm lifespan beyond the 100 days’ ceiling.</p><p>Lifespan is controlled by both genetic and epigenetic factors. The perturbation of insulin/insulin-like signaling, TOR pathway, and mitochondrial functions have been shown to extensively modulate the aging process and lifespan. Epigenetic marks, including histone acetylation and methylation, are altered during aging and regulate lifespan in a number of species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lee et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lund et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bennett-Baker et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lu et al., 2004</xref>). In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, both H3K4 and H3K27 methylation are involved in lifespan limitation. Animals with reduced H3K4me, for example, in <italic>wdr-5, ash-2,</italic> and <italic>set-2</italic> mutants, live longer than wild-type animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Greer et al., 2010</xref>). Interestingly, perturbation of H3K27 methylation, via either a decrease in <italic>mes-2</italic> mutants or an increase in <italic>utx-1</italic> mutants, is associated with enhanced longevity, suggesting context-dependent lifespan regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Maures et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Guillermo et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>H3K9me3 is a hallmark of heterochromatin and is often enriched on repetitive sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Peters et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Guenatri et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Martens et al., 2005</xref>). In addition, H3K9me1/2/3 have all been shown enrichment on repeat sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gerstein et al., 2010</xref>). H3K9 methylation and its association with the nuclear envelope help maintain silencing of repetitive sequences and may contribute to the maintenance and stability of heterochromatin-like regions in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Liu et al., 2011</xref>), as observed in other organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Peng and Karpen, 2008</xref>). A hallmark of heterochromatin is the enrichment of HP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">James and Elgin, 1986</xref>). The nematode <italic>C. elegans</italic> has two HP1 paralogous proteins: HPL-1 and HPL-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Couteau et al., 2002</xref>). Interestingly, HPL-2 may serve additional roles than HPL-1, as <italic>hpl-2</italic> mutants display diverse defects while <italic>hpl-1</italic> mutants generally lack obvious defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Garrigues et al., 2015</xref>). The pattern of HPL-2 most closely resembles H3K9me1 and H3K9me2 but less closely resembles H3K9me3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Garrigues et al., 2015</xref>). HPL-2-bound genes, especially those located on arms, possess significantly higher levels of H3K9me2, but show no significant difference in H3K9me3 levels when compared to genes not bound by HPL-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Garrigues et al., 2015</xref>). SET-25 is a putative H3K9me3 methyltransferase and is recruited to targeted genomic loci either by H3K9me2 which is deposited by MET-2 or by the somatic Argonaute protein NRDE-3 and small RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mao et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Padeken et al., 2021</xref>). SET-25 colocalizes with both H3K9me3 and HPL-1, but does not colocalize with HPL-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Towbin et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>H3K9me2 and H3K9me3 exhibit different patterns of repeat enrichment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">McMurchy et al., 2017</xref>). H3K9me2 is more associated with DNA transposons and satellite repeats, similar to the heterochromatin factors HPL-2, LET-418, LIN-13, LIN-61, and MET-2, whereas H3K9me3 is particularly associated with retrotransposon families, especially LINE and SINE elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">McMurchy et al., 2017</xref>). Moreover, H3K9me2 and the five heterochromatin factors are enriched at telomeres, whereas H3K9me3 is not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">McMurchy et al., 2017</xref>). Therefore, H3K9me2, rather than H3K9me3, may be more closely associated with canonical heterochromatin factors in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. It was postulated that losing repressive chromatin is detrimental to lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Villeponteau, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Tsurumi and Li, 2012</xref>). In humans, two premature aging diseases are caused by mutations in lamins that reduce heterochromatin and disrupt its nuclear localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Shumaker et al., 2006</xref>). In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, <italic>Drosophila,</italic> and mammals, heterochromatin decreases as individuals grow older (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Haithcock et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Wood et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Wood and Helfand, 2013</xref>). Additionally, mutations that increase repressive chromatin extend lifespan in eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kennedy et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Maures et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Larson et al., 2012</xref>). In N2 background animals, the depletion of <italic>hpl-2</italic> was shown increased lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Meister et al., 2011</xref>). However, we did not observe a further lifespan extension in <italic>daf-2;hpl-2</italic> animals, comparing to the <italic>daf-2</italic> mutant. Similarly, we did not observe a significant change in lifespan in <italic>daf-2;set-25</italic> mutants. The depletion of the two heterochromatin factors HPL-1 and HPL-2 failed to further extend the lifespan in <italic>daf-2</italic> mutant worms, suggesting that heterochromatin itself may not be sufficient to perturb lifespan in <italic>daf-2</italic> mutant worms.</p><p>MET-2, a mammalian H3K9 methyltransferase SETDB1 homolog (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Loyola et al., 2006</xref>), likely monomethylates and dimethylates H3K9 in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Towbin et al., 2012</xref>). MET-2 is necessary both for a normal lifespan in N2 background (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Tian et al., 2016</xref>) and for the lifespan extension of <italic>wdr-5</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lee et al., 2019</xref>). In <italic>met-2</italic> mutants, the lifespan is shortened compared to that of N2 animals. However, the lifespan was significantly extended in <italic>daf-2;met-2</italic> double mutants, suggesting context-dependent lifespan regulation by epigenetic machinery. SET-6 is a putative H3K9me2/3 methyltransferase that was postulated to prevent healthy aging rather than modulate the normal lifespan in N2 background (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Yuan et al., 2020</xref>). SET-6 accelerates behavioral deterioration in <italic>C. elegans</italic> by reducing mitochondrial function and repressing the expression of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial proteins. Here, we found that the depletion of <italic>set-6</italic> dramatically increased the lifespan of <italic>daf-2</italic> animals, which further supports the context-dependent lifespan regulation model.</p><p>We noticed that the stress resistance is enhanced in both <italic>met-2</italic> and <italic>daf-2;met-2</italic> animals, yet <italic>met-2</italic> single mutant shortens lifespan and <italic>daf-2;met-2</italic> extends lifespan. In addition, <italic>daf-2;set-15</italic> showed a modest increase of stress resistance, while <italic>daf-2;set-15</italic> revealed no further lifespan extension. The reason is unknown yet. Previous research showed correlations between stress resistance and lifespan extension in many mutant worms, for example <italic>daf-2</italic>. However, since <italic>daf-2</italic> mutation already twitched the homeostasis and increased the stress resistance of animals, it is unclear that to what extent this correlation can further increase lifespan and stress resistance. Alternatively, some of these putative lifespan-limiting HMTs may have additional functions. Further investigations are required to understand the mechanism of each putative lifespan-limiting HMT.</p><p>In this work, we examined the role of 10 putative H3K9 methyltransferases, most of which have not been directly characterized for their biochemical properties by in vitro experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Schwartz-Orbach et al., 2020</xref>). The presence of these many putative H3K9 methyltransferases, or methyltransferases that may indirectly regulate H3K9me, may lead to a complexity of the interaction network of histone modifications. In addition, some SET proteins may have multiple roles in mediating histone modification. For example, SET-19 is required for both H3K9me1/2 and H3K23me3 marks, further bringing up complexity of the regulation. Further investigations are necessary to reveal their enzymatic activities by in vitro experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Schwartz-Orbach et al., 2020</xref>). In addition, identifying the in vivo targeted genes will also be crucial to help understanding why and how these SET proteins are involved in lifespan regulation in <italic>daf-2</italic> mutants.</p><p>Additionally, we identified seven genes required for H3K9me1/2-involved lifespan extension in <italic>daf-2;set-21</italic> animals. Among them, <italic>tts-1</italic> is a long noncoding RNA on ribosomes of the <italic>daf-2</italic> mutant.

NHR-62 is known to be required for longevity in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Heestand et al., 2013</xref>). INS-35 is an insulin-like peptides and may act on DAF-2 to regulate UPR<sup>mt</sup> and mitochondrial dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2021</xref>). SOD-3 is a superoxide dismutase that is involved in the removal of superoxide radicals. ASM-2 is an ortholog of human acid sphingomyelinase (ASM) and is involved in ceramide biosynthetic processes and sphingomyelin catabolic processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lin et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Deng et al., 2008</xref>). The <italic>C. elegans</italic> genome encodes three ASM homologs, <italic>asm-1</italic>, <italic>asm-2,</italic> and <italic>asm-3</italic>. Among them, ASM-3 is most closely related to human ASM. During development and aging, ceramide and sphingosine accumulate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sacket et al., 2009</xref>). Interestingly, monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA) accumulation is necessary for the lifespan extension of H3K4me3-methyltransferase-deficient worms, and dietary MUFAs are sufficient to extend lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Han et al., 2017</xref>). However, when <italic>asm-1, asm-2, or asm-3</italic> was inactivated by RNAi knockdown, a modest lifespan extension phenotype was observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kim and Sun, 2012</xref>).

Human proteins containing ShK-like domains are MMP-23 (matrix metalloprotease 23) and MFAP-2 (microfibril-associated glycoprotein 2).

be affected by the presence of post-translational histone modifications, namely histone H3 lysine 9 mono- or di-methylation (H3K9me1/2). The authors find that the presence or absence of these marks plays a key role in modulating lifespan and stress resistance that synergizes with a long-lived insulin-pathway (daf-2) model. This work adds an important layer to aging regulation in organisms where a repressive chromatin state in specific genomic regions may limit the extent of lifespan. Hence, proper elucidation of this mechanism would be valuable to attain a comprehensive understanding of aging control and the reasons why these limits exist.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.74812.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Leiser</surname><given-names>Scott F</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/00jmfr291</institution-id><institution>University of Michigan</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Katz</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: (i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2021.10.27.466082">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.10.27.466082v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; (ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Carlos Isales as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: David Katz (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary of reviewer discussion:</p><p>The reviewers were all very positive about the central idea of the manuscript, that putative HMTs act synergistically with daf-2 to extend lifespan. During review and subsequent discussion, several key weaknesses of the manuscript were identified that will need to be addressed before the manuscript is suitable for publication at <italic>eLife</italic>. While many of these weaknesses can be addressed by modifying the text and including additional supplementary information likely on hand, they also include a limited number of experiments that are necessary to support the key findings of the manuscript. Of highest importance, revisions must address the lack of wild-type and mutant only controls in methylation studies and the assumption of the enzymes studied as being bona fide H3K9 methyltransferases. A revision should focus on what is being shown (changes in H3K9me1/2 that correspond with lifespan in daf-2 mutants), while either addressing or taking into account the remaining unknowns. Additionally, all the reviewer comments are included, from which the essential revisions were identified, that should be addressed before publication.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. The 6 genes being studied are putative methyltransferases, but are frequently described in the text as though they are validated and bona fide H3K9 methyltransferases. While the data presented support that they affect H3K9 methylation status, there are both direct and indirect ways this could occur. Some evidence that these putative HMTs are actual H3K9me1/me2 MTs (not acting indirectly, as observed in Schwartz-Orbach L et al., <italic>eLife</italic> 2020) and that they and daf-2 affect H3K9 methylation (ChIP seq) would greatly strengthen the manuscript. Barring this, the circumstantial data using inhibition would need to be strengthened and the text modified to clarify the lack of evidence (e.g., the introduction currently states that MET-2 and SET-25 are responsible for the <italic>methylation</italic> of H3K9, rather than saying the genes are required for the <italic>presence</italic> of H3K9me in vivo) on the direct nature of the observed effects.</p><p>2. To properly interpret the data, wild-type and mutant controls in methylation assays must be included. Presumably, based on the lifespan results, daf-2 changes methylation status in such a way that these genes are now limiting lifespan. Without control data, it is very difficult to interpret how this may work.</p><p>3. An explanation for why 6 different H3K9me1/me2 methylases would have such similar phenotypes. This explanation could come out of #1 and/or could involve other experiments and insights, including a better discussion of the individual HMTs and how they are similar/different. For example, addressing the H3K23me2/3 data in light of the Gu lab paper referenced in #1 may help in emphasizing the complexity of the interaction network and will also highlight the biological relevance of these findings.</p><p>4. Better discussion and clarity on the relationship between brood size and fertility tradeoffs in these animals, including inclusion of daf-2 single mutant brood sizes.</p><p>5. Better clarity on replication, blinding, and inclusion of summary survival data including conditions examined per assay, N, animals censored, median lifespan (along with average lifespan), and comparison used for determination of significance. If replicates are lacking, additional replicates may be necessary (see reviewer comments).</p><p>6. A significantly more detailed transcriptomic analysis and clarity about the analysis and it's methods: e.g., unbiased analysis to identify other pathways, differentiation between DAF-16 class I/II genes, better evidence to claim class I.</p><p>7. Tempered statements on generality, or more experiments to show generality, and clarified writing to more accurately report findings.</p><p>8. Use of the data to clarify the relationship between heterochromatin, H3K9me1/2, and H3K9me3.1.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1) The <italic>C. elegans</italic> enzymes described in the intro are still only putative methyltransferases. Most of them, outside of SET-2 have not been shown by in vitro methylation assays so should be referred to as putative methyltransferases (unless the authors wish to perform in vitro methylation assays to complement the in vivo findings of others which could still be indirect). Since so much of the manuscript is focused on H3K9 methylation it would be good to show that some of these enzymes (maybe just SET-21 if it is too much to show for them all) are indeed H3K9 methyltransferases.</p><p>2) It's important to see how H3K9 methylation changes in daf-2 worms relative to WT worms, both by WB at gross level and genome wide by ChIPseq. This change in H3K9me1/me2 genome wide should then be compared to daf-16 target gene lists to see if there is an enrichment.</p><p>3) For 6b you have to present all 4 conditions for epistasis experiments. The reader needs to see what the effect of lys-7 deletion is in the daf-2 background by itself. And then 2-way anova needs to be done to test whether the effect of lys-7 in the daf-2 background is different from in the daf-2;set-21 background.</p><p>4) Some attempt should be made to explain why there are 6 redundant H3K9me1/me2 methylases (again I'm not convinced yet that there are because of point 1) that all affect lifespan in the same manner. Are these enzymes expressed in the same tissue? Do they affect H3K9me1/me2 on the same genes? At the same time? Usually it is believed that different enzymes that modify the same mark have some sort of specificity but here they are not seeing that. I don't think it's necessary to perform tissue specific experiments for this initial manuscript but some experimental justification should be provided. Do they believe that it's the amount of heterochromatin DNA in general which is regulating this? Or is it a gene specific effect?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. As the authors mentioned in the discussion, H3K9me2 is the histone modification in <italic>C. elegans</italic> that corresponds best with canonical heterochromatin factors like HPL-2 (McMurchy et al., 2017). However, in their results, they focus on the lack of effect on lifespan seen for H3K9me3 modifiers like SET-25 to rule out any effect with heterochromatin. In fact, despite corresponding highly with H3K9me2, one of the marks implicated in further extending the lifespan of their HMT; daf-2 double mutants, hpl-1 and hpl-2 mutations had no effect in a daf-2 background (although they do seem to slightly decrease lifespan, and it would be interesting to see the statistical comparison of a log-rank test). The authors should clarify the relationship between heterochromatin, H3K9me1/2, and H3K9me3.</p><p>2. I was confused by the statements describing Figure 4C on lines 176-178. Both double and triple mutants were much longer-lived than daf-2 single mutants, rather than having similar lifespan extensions as the daf-2 single mutants. There was even a distinction between the daf-2; set-21 double mutant and the daf-2; set-21; set-2 triple mutant – the presence of a set-2 mutation represses the slight lifespan extension difference seen in the daf-2; set-21 double mutant when compared to the daf-2; set-2 double mutant. The authors should rephrase their description of their results to more accurately convey their findings.</p><p>3. My major concerns with the approach to transcriptomic analysis were conveyed in the public review, but I include more specific concerns here. Given that Class I genes are an important downstream consequence of DAF-16, it isn't clear why these are primarily unaffected in the daf-2 control condition shown in Figure 5A. Furthermore, the authors focus primarily on the top 50 Class I genes, but there are interesting effects seen in the top 50 Class II genes as well, especially given that mutations in the HMTs seem to suppress some of the upregulation observed in daf-2 control – why exclude these from their interpretations? Additionally, the brevity of the methods makes it hard to tell exactly what comparisons are being drawn – in the heatmaps shown in in Figure 5C, D, does the color refer upreglation in comparison to a wild-type control? Why not compare misregulation to a daf-2 single mutant instead? What does &quot;Top 50&quot; refer to – are these the fifty most-affected in these specific data sets, or are they a gene set identified by an independent metric? Why limit the analysis to only fifty genes? Finally, this analysis would be further strengthened by comparing locus-specific effects to the known locations of H3K9me1/2/3 peaks in wild-type genomes in previously published datasets (like in Li et al., 2021 or McMurchy et al., 2017) or even to H3K9me1/2/3 localization in datasets of relevant HMT mutants like set-32.</p><p>4. How were the 10 Class I DAF-16 target genes chosen? It doesn't seem like they were in the top 50 (or not that I could easily see). Furthermore, why were no Class II genes chosen? The authors should clarify how they chose to examine these specific candidates, and if necessary, extend the analysis for other targets to see whether the effects are specific to Class I targets only (as they argue in their model). Furthermore, each of these candidate genes needs to be examined in a daf-2 mutant background to fully interpret the meaning of the suppression of long-lived daf-2; set-21 mutants.</p><p>5. The authors claim that loss of H3K9me1/2 increases binding of DAF-16 at its target genes (line 282). There is no evidence to support this claim (and a lack of evidence for this claim, if we take the DAF-16 localization data in Figure S3 at complete face value). This could be part of their proposed model (outlined in Figure S7), but as written, it reads as if it were a summary of work presented in the paper. The authors should clarify their writing to ensure full accuracy for what their data can support.</p><p>6. Throughout the manuscript, it's difficult to build a cohesive understanding of the functional effects of the HMT mutants. In part, this is because the paper investigates several HMTs without discussing their specific effects (in certain tissues or cell types, or at specific stages). The analyses are sometimes too broad (immunoblots of total histone modifications) and at other times too narrow (focusing only on 50 Class I DAF-16 target genes). Given that H3K9me1/2 will likely have locus specificity, it is unsatisfying to leave the analysis at the global level of immunoblots (although it is very compelling to see global effects in their mutants). Including a deeper, and unbiased, analysis of their transcriptomic data will help to bridge the gap between the global and the locus-specific, and may even point out other interesting avenues that will further bolster their claims about potential mechanism (or open new avenues of study).</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;H3K9me1/2 methylation limits the lifespan of <italic>C. elegans</italic>&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Carlos Isales (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>Primarily, the three areas that remain an issue before submission are (1) a second replicate needs to be included (and ideally, performed blinded) for experiments such as Figures 1B, 4A, and 4B, (2) the appropriate epistasis controls should be included as requested by reviewer 1 to properly interpret the experiments (e.g., Figure 7), and (3) the text needs to be modified where precision remains an issue, as described by reviewer 1. There should be no technical issues with completing these experiments, and they're relatively straightforward, although I appreciate that it can take some time to complete longevity assays for these long-lived mutants. However, these experiments are necessary to experimentally validate the claims within the manuscript, along with responses to the reviewer comments below.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>In the revised manuscript &quot;H3K9me1/2 methylation limits the lifespan of <italic>C. elegans</italic>&quot; Huang M, Hong M et al., performed additional experiments to examine the role of putative H3K9 methyltransferases in the lifespan regulation of daf-2 mutant worms. While the new experiments do bolster some portions of the manuscript I felt that the critical questions which I had asked in my initial review weren't addressed and are still important. I understand that COVID has made it difficult to perform certain experiments but with those restrictions in mind then the paper needs to be reworked to reflect what the experiments actually show rather than the model the authors wish to be true. Most importantly the role of H3K9 methylation in daf-2 mutants is still not really clear. These genes seem to have virtually no effect in WT background so the text needs to really be rewritten to reflect that. Starting with the title of the manuscript and then from the intro on it should be written from the perspective of &quot;we wanted to examine how chromatin modifying enzymes were important in insulin receptor mutant worms&quot;.</p><p>1) As stated last review (major point #3), in epistasis experiments (such as WT and eat-2 +/- set-21 and WT and daf-2 +/- met-2, and Figure 3C +D, 7B) you need to include all 4 conditions in the experiment to make any conclusions. For example, you can't do the set-21 vs WT at a different time and assume that the set-21 is still going to have no effect in that particular experiment. There might be some unknown factor (food, temperature, etc) that makes set-21 actually have an effect in the WT worms in that experiment which would mean a very different conclusion. Then after the experiment is done you perform a 2 way ANOVA analysis to reveal whether set-21 has a significantly different effect in the WT context or the mutant context. This comment still holds true for asm-2, Y39G8B.7, etc… that I had asked for last review. You do not need to perform all possible combinations of these 3 genes but at the very least daf-2, daf-2;set-21, daf-2;asm-2 and daf-2;set-21;asm-2 if you want to make any conclusion about asm-2 relative to set-21 in the daf-2 background), examining 3 lines in an epistasis experiment rather than 4 is not really informative.</p><p>2) The text needs to be rewritten to reflect that this is all only occurring in daf-2 mutant worms and not in WT worms. This rewriting needs to start with the title (&quot;…limits the lifespan of daf-2 mutant <italic>C. elegans</italic>&quot;.) and work its way thru the intro, results and discussion (where the authors claim H3K9me regulators should be considered for lifespan regulation). Need to include explicit writing that deletion of all these putative enzymes has only modest effects on H3K9me and lifespan in the WT context and their role is only revealed in the daf-2 mutants. Need to speculate about what that is. What makes the daf-2 mutation special to reveal a regulatory role for these genes?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Upon resubmission, this paper is greatly improved – readers now have the evidence needed to evaluate the paper's main claim that H3K9 HMTs synergistically extend lifespan in daf-2 mutants, in part via DAF-16, but also via. The additional experiments, along with a more tempered approach to discussing their findings, significantly strengthen the paper.</p><p>However, several of our concerns were not addressed by these changes, nor in the rebuttal. For example, Reviewer 2 asked that some of the key lifespan experiments be replicated at least once and also performed blinded – there are several figures where only a single replicate is shown. Key controls are still missing, like in Figure 7, where Reviewer 1 had asked for appropriate controls to interpret the epistasis experiments for example, set-21 single mutants and daf-2; lys-7 double mutants. The authors' rebuttal mentioned generating new alleles for some genes, but providing appropriate single mutant and double mutant controls should require no new strains to be built (since the strains likely already exist if the authors generated the triple mutant).</p><p>The extended analysis of the mRNA-seq is better (and opens up an interesting line of questioning for future studies!). However, the authors failed to address most of Reviewer 2's Major Point 3 about their transcriptomic analysis, nor did they include further details about how the analysis was done. The methods for the mRNA-seq will need to be more detailed. What is their unbiased approach? What is the differential expression shown in the Figure 5? For example, I had previously asked: &quot;Does the color refer to upregulation in comparison to a wild-type control? Why not compare misregulation to a daf-2 single mutant instead?&quot; and the answer is still not clear. Furthermore, if Class I genes are defined as being induced in daf-2 mutants, why are they downregulated in Figure 5E? And if Class II genes are defined as being not induced in daf-2 mutants, why are they upregulated in Figure 5F? I may be misunderstanding the gene classifications, but it is a demonstration of how the text is unclear. Overall, I found the new transcriptomic analyses are compelling, but more care needs to be taken to fully explain what was done.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.74812.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1.

Actually, the relationship between heterochromatin, H3K9me1/2, and H3K9me3 is quite intriguing.</p><p>H3K9me3 is a hallmark of heterochromatin and is often enriched on repetitive sequences. In addition, H3K9me1/2/3 have all been shown enrichment on repeat sequences (GERSTEIN <italic>et al.,</italic> 2010). H3K9 methylation and its association with the nuclear envelope help maintain silencing of repetitive sequences and may contribute to the maintenance and stability of heterochromatin-like regions in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, as observed in other organisms. A hallmark of heterochromatin is the enrichment of HP1. The nematode <italic>C. elegans</italic> has two HP1 paralogous proteins: HP1 Like 1 and 2 (HPL-1 and HPL-2). Interestingly, HPL-2 may serve additional roles than HPL-1, as <italic>hpl-2</italic> mutants display diverse defects while <italic>hpl-1</italic> mutants generally lack obvious defects. The pattern of HPL-2 most closely resembles H3K9me1 and H3K9me2 but less closely resembles H3K9me3. HPL-2-bound genes, especially those located on arms, possess significantly higher levels of H3K9me2, but show no significant difference in H3K9me3 levels when compared to genes not bound by HPL-2. SET-25 is a putative H3K9me3 methyltransferase and is recruited to targeted genomic loci either by H3K9me2 which is deposited by MET-2 or by the somatic Argonaute protein NRDE-3 and small RNAs.

H3K9me2 is more associated with DNA transposons and satellite repeats, similar to the heterochromatin factors HPL-2, LET-418, LIN-13, LIN-61, and MET-2, whereas H3K9me3 is particularly associated with retrotransposon families, especially LINE and SINE elements. Moreover, H3K9me2 and the five heterochromatin factors are enriched at telomeres, whereas H3K9me3 is not. Therefore, H3K9me2, rather than H3K9me3, may be more closely associated with canonical heterochromatin factors in <italic>C. elegans</italic>.

My major concerns with the approach to transcriptomic analysis were conveyed in the public review, but I include more specific concerns here. Given that Class I genes are an important downstream consequence of DAF-16, it isn't clear why these are primarily unaffected in the daf-2 control condition shown in Figure 5A. Furthermore, the authors focus primarily on the top 50 Class I genes, but there are interesting effects seen in the top 50 Class II genes as well, especially given that mutations in the HMTs seem to suppress some of the upregulation observed in daf-2 control – why exclude these from their interpretations? Additionally, the brevity of the methods makes it hard to tell exactly what comparisons are being drawn – in the heatmaps shown in in Figure 5C, D, does the color refer upreglation in comparison to a wild-type control? Why not compare misregulation to a daf-2 single mutant instead? What does &quot;Top 50&quot; refer to – are these the fifty most-affected in these specific data sets, or are they a gene set identified by an independent metric? Why limit the analysis to only fifty genes? Finally, this analysis would be further strengthened by comparing locus-specific effects to the known locations of H3K9me1/2/3 peaks in wild-type genomes in previously published datasets (like in Li et al., 2021 or McMurchy et al., 2017) or even to H3K9me1/2/3 localization in datasets of relevant HMT mutants like set-32.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks very much for the suggestions.</p><p>We used two approaches to analyze the mRNA-seq data.</p><p>First, the depletion of DAF-2 reduces the insulin signaling pathway, promotes DAF-16 nuclear translocation, and leads to both upregulation and downregulation of large sets of genes, referred to as Class I and II genes, respectively.

The authors claim that loss of H3K9me1/2 increases binding of DAF-16 at its target genes (line 282). There is no evidence to support this claim (and a lack of evidence for this claim, if we take the DAF-16 localization data in Figure S3 at complete face value). This could be part of their proposed model (outlined in Figure S7), but as written, it reads as if it were a summary of work presented in the paper.

Throughout the manuscript, it's difficult to build a cohesive understanding of the functional effects of the HMT mutants. In part, this is because the paper investigates several HMTs without discussing their specific effects (in certain tissues or cell types, or at specific stages). The analyses are sometimes too broad (immunoblots of total histone modifications) and at other times too narrow (focusing only on 50 Class I DAF-16 target genes). Given that H3K9me1/2 will likely have locus specificity, it is unsatisfying to leave the analysis at the global level of immunoblots (although it is very compelling to see global effects in their mutants). Including a deeper, and unbiased, analysis of their transcriptomic data will help to bridge the gap between the global and the locus-specific, and may even point out other interesting avenues that will further bolster their claims about potential mechanism (or open new avenues of study).</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks very much for the suggestions.</p><p>We have generated in situ single-copy 3xFLAG-GFP tagged SET-21, SET-25 and SET-32 transgenes by CRISPR/Cas9 technology and single-copy GFP-3xFLAG-tagged SET-13 transgenic strains using the Mos1-mediated single-copy insertion (MosSCI) technology.

For example, SET-19 is required for both H3K9me1/2 and H3K23me3 marks, further bringing up complexity of the regulation. Further investigations are necessary to reveal their enzymatic activities by in vitro experiments.

For example, you can't do the set-21 vs WT at a different time and assume that the set-21 is still going to have no effect in that particular experiment. There might be some unknown factor (food, temperature, etc) that makes set-21 actually have an effect in the WT worms in that experiment which would mean a very different conclusion. Then after the experiment is done you perform a 2 way ANOVA analysis to reveal whether set-21 has a significantly different effect in the WT context or the mutant context. This comment still holds true for asm-2, Y39G8B.7, etc… that I had asked for last review.

These results together suggested that DAF-2 limits the effects of these SET proteins.</p><p>It is unclear how and why these SET proteins only limit lifespan in <italic>daf-2</italic> animals. There are three possibilities. First, DAF-2 may have profound effect on the chromatin accessibility. In <italic>daf-2</italic> mutants, the chromatin may be more compact and prohibit the activity of the SET proteins to conduct H3K9me2 modification. Second, <italic>daf-2</italic> mutation may sensitize the animals by increasing the nuclear accumulated DAF-16. Although it is unclear whether DAF-16 preferentially recognizes H3K9me2 or H3K9me3, we observed a much stronger enrichment of DAF-16 in the nucleus in <italic>daf-2;set-21</italic> than in <italic>daf-2</italic> animals, which suggested that H3K9me2 may prohibit the accumulation of DAF-16 in the nucleus. Third, DAF-2 may have other indirect effect on the SET proteins.
