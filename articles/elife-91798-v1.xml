essential nutrients and regulatory signals. This contact is achieved through specialized filopodia, termed transzonal projections (TZPs), that extend from the granulosa cells to the oocyte surface. Transforming growth factor (TGFβ) family ligands produced by the oocyte increase the number of TZPs, but how they do so is unknown. Using an inducible Cre recombinase strategy together with expression of green fluorescent protein to verify Cre activity in individual cells, we examined the effect of depleting the canonical TGFβ mediator, SMAD4, in mouse granulosa cells. We observed a 20–50% decrease in the total number of TZPs in SMAD4-depleted granulosa cell-oocyte complexes, and a 50% decrease in the number of newly generated TZPs when the granulosa cells were reaggregated with wild-type oocytes. Three-dimensional image analysis revealed that TZPs of SMAD4-depleted cells were longer than controls and more frequently oriented towards the oocyte. Strikingly, the transmembrane proteins, N-cadherin and Notch2, were reduced by 50% in SMAD4-depleted cells. SMAD4 may thus modulate a network of cell adhesion proteins that stabilize the attachment of TZPs to the oocyte, thereby amplifying signalling between the two cell types.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>oocyte</kwd><kwd>follicle</kwd><kwd>SMAD</kwd><kwd>granulosa</kwd><kwd>transzonal projections</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PJT153122</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Clarke</surname><given-names>Hugh J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000038</institution-id><institution>Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RGPIN-402138</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Clarke</surname><given-names>Hugh J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Depletion of the TGFβ signal-transducer, SMAD4, in granulosa cells of growing follicles reduces the number of filopodia, termed transzonal projections, that stably attach to and mediate communication with the oocyte.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The development of a healthy oocyte within the ovarian follicle requires continuing contact between the germ cell and the somatic granulosa cells that surround it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">El-Hayek and Clarke, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Clarke, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Richani et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Robert, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Li and Albertini, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Doherty et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Xie et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Marchais et al., 2022</xref>). Signals from the granulosa cells initiate the increase in the volume of the oocyte when primordial (non-growing) follicles are activated to enter the growth phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Saatcioglu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nagamatsu et al., 2019</xref>). Subsequently, the granulosa cells provide nucleotides, amino acids, and pyruvate to the growing oocyte via gap junctions that connect the two cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Xie et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Clarke, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Marchais et al., 2022</xref>). When gap junctional communication between the two cell types is genetically disrupted, oocytes do not develop normally and cannot be fertilized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gittens and Kidder, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Simon et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Winterhager and Kidder, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Carabatsos et al., 2000</xref>). Once the oocyte reaches full size, it acquires the ability to undergo the final stage of development, termed meiotic maturation, but is prevented from precociously doing so by cyclic GMP that is produced and transferred to it by the granulosa cells, also via gap junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jaffe and Egbert, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wigglesworth et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Norris et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zhang et al., 2010</xref>). In vitro, oocytes can develop normally when enclosed by granulosa cells but not when the granulosa cells are removed and provided in co-culture, further emphasizing the crucial importance of physical contact between the two cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">O’Brien et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Eppig, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Herta et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>In primordial follicles, a single layer of squamous granulosa cells surrounds the oocyte and contact it via adherens junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mora et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jorgensen, 2013</xref>). Following activation of growth, a glycoprotein-rich coat termed the zona pellucida becomes established around the oocyte (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Litscher and Wassarman, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wassarman and Litscher, 2018</xref>). The zona pellucida steadily thickens as growth continues, reaching a final thickness of about 7 μm in mice and 15 μm in humans. Despite the barrier imposed by the zona pellucida, the granulosa cells and oocyte maintain direct contact by a dense network of thin filopodia-like projections, termed transzonal projections (TZPs), that grow out from the granulosa cells through the zona pellucida (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Clarke, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Macaulay et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baena and Terasaki, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Motta et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Albertini and Rider, 1994</xref>). The tips of the TZPs establish contact with the oocyte plasma membrane through heterotypic adherens junctions comprising N-cadherin (granulosa cell) and E-cadherin (oocyte) and harbour the gap junctions that link the two cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mora et al., 2012</xref>) and likely also through focal adhesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">McGinnis and Kinsey, 2015</xref>). New TZPs are generated throughout follicular growth, thereby increasing intercellular molecular trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">El-Hayek et al., 2018a</xref>). A genetically imposed decrease in the number of TZPs leads to defects in oocyte gene expression and to abnormal meiotic maturation and embryonic development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Crozet et al., 2023</xref>). Despite the essential role of TZPs during oocyte development in mammals, as well as the presence of analogous structures in non-mammalian species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kessel et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Schroeder, 1981</xref>), the molecular mechanisms that govern their generation and stability are not yet understood.</p><p>The TGFβ signalling pathway regulates the functions and interactions of a wide range of cell types under various physiological and pathological conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Derynck and Budi, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Peng et al., 2022</xref>). Binding of the ligand to a complex of type I and type II receptors located at the cell surface activates signalling within the cell, most commonly through the members of the SMAD family of transcription factors, although SMAD-independent signalling can also occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aashaq et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Derynck and Budi, 2019</xref>). Upon phosphorylation of the tetrameric type II and type I receptors and subsequent phosphorylation of receptor-activated SMAD proteins (R-SMADs; SMAD1, 2, 3, 5, and 8), a heterotrimeric complex with SMAD4 is formed which enters the nucleus and regulates gene expression by binding to specific SMAD-binding DNA elements. Although R-SMADs can signal in the absence of SMAD4, evidence indicates that the presence of SMAD4 in the heterotrimer amplifies TGFβ cell signalling by stabilizing the complex and by favouring the binding of other transcriptional co-repressors or co-activators of target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aragón et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Guglielmi et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Genetic, pharmacological, and in vitro studies have revealed multiple roles for TGFβ/SMAD signaling during follicular growth and development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Patton et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pangas and Rajkovic, 2015</xref>). TGFβ signalling via SMAD3 in granulosa cells acts initially in primordial follicles to maintain their quiescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Granados-Aparici et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kang et al., 2014</xref>) and later, following their activation, becomes excluded from the nucleus in association with rapid granulosa cell growth and proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hardy et al., 2018</xref>). The TGFβ superfamily members, growth-differentiation factor (GDF) 9, which signals through SMAD2/3, and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) 15, which signals through SMAD1/5/8, are produced by the oocyte (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dong et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yan et al., 2001</xref>). Female mice lacking GDF9 rarely generate more than a single layer of granulosa cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Elvin et al., 1999b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Elvin et al., 1999a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dong et al., 1996</xref>). This defect can be rescued by preventing the production of inhibin, and the doubly mutant follicles can develop at least to the pre-antral stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wu et al., 2004</xref>). Genetic inactivation of SMAD4 in the granulosa cells from growing follicles leads to a reduction in the number of antral follicles and ovulated eggs, as well as the appearance of luteinized follicles containing entrapped oocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pangas et al., 2006</xref>). Similar phenotypes are observed when both SMAD2 and SMAD3 are inactivated in the granulosa cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Li et al., 2008</xref>). These effects are likely due at least in part to a failure of the cumulus layer to expand in response to the ovulatory surge of LH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pangas et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Li et al., 2008</xref>), as expansion is known to require SMAD signalling and to be required for ovulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dragovic et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hao et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mottershead et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Peng et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Yu et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Two lines of evidence point to a potential role for SMAD signalling in the generation or maintenance of TZPs. First, deletion of GDF9 leads to both a decrease in the number of TZPs and a failure of a proportion of the TZPs to correctly orient towards the oocyte (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Carabatsos et al., 1998</xref>). Second, TZP number is reduced in follicles grown in vitro following RNAi-mediated depletion of GDF9 in the oocyte (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">El-Hayek et al., 2018a</xref>). To test the role of SMAD4 specifically, we used a Cre-lox strategy to inactivate <italic>Smad4</italic> in granulosa cells, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jorgez et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pangas et al., 2006</xref>). Using image analysis tools and three-dimensional reconstructions, we show that depletion of SMAD4 in the granulosa cells decreases the number of TZPs that project from individual granulosa cells in both intact granulosa cell-oocyte complexes (GOCs) and in reaggregated complexes. Morphometric parameters including length and orientation are also altered. The decrease in TZP number in intact GOCs is associated with a reduction in the amount of N-cadherin and Notch2 in the granulosa cells, suggesting that the composition of the granulosa cell surface is perturbed in the absence of SMAD4. We propose that SMAD4, through its activity to increase expression of target genes, stabilizes TZPs by promoting their adhesion to the oocyte surface, thereby helping to increase the number of TZPs and communication between the growing oocyte and its follicular microenvironment.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>We began by verifying the expression of SMAD4 during folliculogenesis. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and consistent with prior reports, SMAD4 was detectable in primordial and growing follicles as well as in the granulosa cells collected from pre-antral follicles. SMAD2 and SMAD3 were also present, with SMAD2 being the major species detected in oocytes. Two strategies were tested to deplete SMAD4 from the granulosa cells of growing follicles. First, mice were generated carrying two floxed <italic>Smad4</italic> alleles and a transgene encoding Cre recombinase under the control of the <italic>Amhr2</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jorgez et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pangas et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). These mice also carried a transgene (<italic>mTmG</italic>, see Methods) constructed such that Tomato fluorescent protein is expressed in the absence of Cre activity, whereas Cre-mediated recombination switches expression to green fluorescent protein (GFP), thus allowing us to identify cells where Cre had been active. Upon immunostaining of ovarian sections or whole-mount intact follicles, only a small number of cells expressed GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, left). Consistent with this observation, less than 10% of FACS-sorted granulosa cells were GFP-positive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, right). Thus, in our system, <italic>Amhr2-Cre</italic> did not mediate efficient recombination of floxed DNA in granulosa cells.

This in vitro system was used for the experiments described here.</p><p>To examine the efficiency of Cre-mediated <italic>Smad4</italic> recombination, the mRNA level was assessed in intact GOCs using the RNAscope technique and in purified granulosa cells using qRT-PCR.

Control and experimental GOCs were treated with tamoxifen and incubated as above. After five days, they were exposed to calcein-AM, a fluorescent dye that can pass through gap junctions. The fluorescence in the oocyte of each GOC was bleached using the laser of a confocal microscope and its recovery was then recorded. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, which plots the fluorescence in the oocyte as a function of time after photobleaching and at the end of the recording period normalized to the initial fluorescence, we observed no difference between groups in the rate of transfer of fluorescence from the granulosa cells to the oocyte.

Using a tamoxifen-inducible Cre recombinase strategy, we were able to reduce SMAD4 in the granulosa cells to about 30% of its wild-type level. This reduction was associated with a decrease ranging from 20–50% in the number of TZPs in the granulosa cells assessed as a population (i) in intact GOCs and (ii) after removal of the granulosa cell bodies to increase optical resolution, and as individual cells (iii) in intact GOCs and (iv) in reconstructed complexes. Previous studies where SMAD4, or both SMAD2 and SMAD3, was depleted from granulosa cells described a loose or loss association of the cumulus cells with the oocyte in some follicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pangas et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Li et al., 2008</xref>). Moreover, as described in the Introduction, blocking the production of GDF9 by the oocyte leads to a decrease in the number of TZPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Carabatsos et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">El-Hayek et al., 2018a</xref>). Together these observations suggest that SMAD4 regulates the size of the population of TZPs in growing follicles.</p><p>The population of TZPs presumably reflects the net result of the generation of new TZPs and the retraction of existing TZPs, as is the case for filopodia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gallop, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Heckman and Plummer, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mattila and Lappalainen, 2008</xref>). SMAD4 could thus promote either or both processes. The observation that GFP-expressing granulosa cells in reaggregated complexes generated new TZPs implies that SMAD4 is not required for this process, although it does not rule out a role in increasing the rate of generation. A clue to the function of SMAD4 may lie in the observation that the decrease in the number of TZPs in SMAD4-depleted cells was quantitatively greater when the granulosa cell bodies were removed prior to analysis. This suggests that the process of removing the cell bodies also removed the TZPs more easily in the SMAD4-depleted cells than in wild-type cells.</p><p>In this context, it is intriguing that N-cadherin, which is thought to stabilize the attachment of the TZP tips to the oocyte surface, was depleted in the mutant cells. We propose that, by increasing the quantity of N-cadherin in the granulosa cells, SMAD4 increases the strength of adhesion of the TZPs to the oocyte surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). This in turn would decrease the probability of retraction, thereby increasing the steady-state number of TZPs. This model is consistent with the observation that the non-attached (free-ended) TZPs of SMAD4-depleted cells were on average longer and closer to the oocyte than those of wild-type cells. Specifically, if the ability of the TZPs to establish a stable contact with the oocyte wer impaired in SMAD4-depleted cells, a relatively large proportion might continue to ‘search’ for an attachment and to lengthen during the searching process.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Model for regulation of the size of the transzonal projection (TZP) population.</title><p>Upper: Dynamics of an individual TZP.

In view of the reduced quantity in the latter of Notch2, also a membrane-associated protein, it may be speculated that SMAD4 might act more broadly to regulate the expression of genes whose products maintain the normal configuration of the granulosa cell plasma membrane.

This suggests that the SMAD4-depleted granulosa cells in the GOCs studied here might have become luteinized, and that luteinization in turn caused a reduction in the number of TZPs. We did not detect increased expression of the luteinization markers (unpublished data), suggesting that luteinization did not occur under the conditions of our experiments. This difference may arise because we examined GOCs that had been maintained in vitro, whereas the previous study examined follicles in intact ovaries of prepuberal mice following the injection of an FSH analogue.</p><p>Regardless of the mechanism linking SMAD4 to TZP number, it is noteworthy that the number of TZPs that project from an individual granulosa cells – about 15 in this study and about 40 in a previous study where more advanced (antral) follicles were examined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baena and Terasaki, 2019</xref>) – considerably exceeds the number of filopodia that are present on individual blastomeres of mouse embryos (5-6) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fierro-González et al., 2013</xref>) or on chick embryonic cells (~4) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pröls et al., 2015</xref>). SMAD4 may, therefore, act in granulosa cells to amplify an innate ability to generate filopodia, which become TZPs and increase the efficiency of communication between the growing germ cell and its somatic microenvironment.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="top">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="top">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="top">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="top">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="top">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top">gene (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="top">Smad4</td><td align="left" valign="top">GenBank</td><td align="left" valign="top">Gene ID: 17128</td><td align="left" valign="top"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">strain, strain background (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="top">Smad4<sup>tm2.1Cxd</sup>/J</td><td align="left" valign="top">Jackson Laboratories</td><td align="left" valign="top">strain 017462</td><td align="left" valign="top">Supplied by Dr. Daniel.

Follicles were mechanically isolated by carefully tearing the ovaries apart and using fine needles to separate the follicles from each other in HEPES-buffered minimal essential medium (MEM, pH 7.2, Life Technologies, Burlington, ON) (MEM-H). A Pipetman P1000 was used to carefully pick up and transfer the individual follicles to dishes containing fresh medium. GOCs were obtained by incubating follicles in the presence of collagenase (10 μg/ml; Cedarlane, Burlington, ON) and DNase I (10 μg/ml; Sigma) for 5 min at 37 °C in air. GOCs were collected and briefly washed in NaHCO<sub>3</sub>-buffered MEM (MEM-C) and cultured in four-well plates containing 500 μl of MEM-C supplemented with ITS (10 μg/mL insulin, 5.5 μg/mL transferrin and 5 ng/mL selenium; Sigma), FSH (10 mIU/ml; EMD Serono, Mississauga, ON), and estradiol (10 nM, Sigma, E2758) in an atmosphere of 5% CO<sub>2</sub> in air.

After pipetting up and down for a few times to dissociate the cells, fetal bovine serum was added (4% final concentration) to inactivate the trypsin. Cells were centrifuged at 1500xg for 5 min and supernatant was carefully removed under the dissecting microscope to better visualise the pellet. FACs buffer containing PBS, 1% FBS, 1 mM EDTA, and 1 µg/ml of DAPI was used to resuspend the pellet. Cells were resuspended and passed through a Flowmi 40 µm strainer (Merck, BAH136800040) to remove oocytes and cell clumps, and then kept on ice for sorting. Resulting granulosa cells were analyzed on a BD FACSAria Fusion 8.0.2 sorter at the Immunophenotyping Facility of the RI-MUHC. All events were collected for each sample. A 488 nm excitation laser was used for both Tomato and EGFP excitation since the wavelength of 488 nm falls within the peak excitation of EGFP but only at 25% of peak excitation for tdTomato. Data were analyzed using FlowJo FACS analysis software. Cells were gated for singlets (using forward scatter vs. side scatter area), viability (DAPI scatter vs. side scatter area), and fluorescence (FITC and PE) without compensation.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Measurement of granulosa cell-oocyte communication using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP)</title><p>A protocol for FRAP was adapted from our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">El-Hayek and Clarke, 2015</xref>). GOCs were incubated for 15 min in MEM supplemented with calcein-AM and then for 60 min in calcein-free MEM to allow the transfer of calcein from the granulosa cells into oocyte. A circular region of interest of fixed diameter (10 µm, to ensure the bleaching did not extend to the surrounding granulosa cells) was set in the center of the enclosed oocyte and subjected to 60 repetitive bleaches of 50 iterations (1 min total duration) using the argon laser at 50% transmission strength. The intensity of fluorescence in the oocyte and the layer of granulosa cells immediately surrounding it was recorded before bleaching and after the 10<sup>th</sup>, 20<sup>th</sup>, 30<sup>th</sup>, 40<sup>th</sup>, 50<sup>th</sup>, and 60<sup>th</sup> bleaching. Fluorescence was calculated as intensity of fluorescence in granulosa cell layer at each time point divided by the pre-bleach intensity of the layer. As oocytes of all experimental groups were subjected to the same bleaching procedure within the fixed ROI, the loss in fluorescence was further divided by initial pre-bleach intensity of the oocyte normalized to intensity of fluorescence in oocyte at the given time point, in order to correct for differences in bleaching effect in oocytes of different sizes.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Generation of granulosa cell-oocyte reaggregates</title><p>GOCs were obtained from 12 day <italic>ER/Cre<sup>+</sup>; mTmG<sup>+</sup>; Smad4<sup>wt/wt</sup></italic> and <italic>ER-Cre<sup>+</sup>; mTmG<sup>+</sup>; Smad4<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice, exposed to tamoxifen for 24 hr and incubated for an additional five days as described above. They were then incubated in Ca-Mg-free PBS and drawn in and out of a mouth-controlled micropipette to generate a suspension of denuded oocytes surrounded by the zona pellucida and individual or small clumps of granulosa cells. Briefly, the granulosa cells were deposited together with oocytes from CD-1 mice into the base of a 200 μl microfuge tube and PBS was added to a total volume of 100 μl. The tube was spun at top speed in a microcentrifuge for 1 min, then rotated 180° and centrifuged for 1 min. This step was repeated twice more. The tube was then cut near the base and the cell pellet was carefully scooped out and incubated for two days in four-well plates in MEM supplemented with FSH, estradiol, and ITS. At the end of the incubation period, complexes of oocytes surrounded by granulosa cells were fixed and processed for analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Image analysis</title><p>To quantify the number of F-actin-stained-TZPs, a confocal optical section was obtained at the equatorial plane of the oocyte. Using Fiji software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD), a segmented circle was drawn around the oocyte in the middle of the zona pellucida, and the fluorescence intensity at each point on the line was obtained. Each point whose value was above the background value of the oocyte cytoplasm and higher than each of its immediately neighboring points was counted as a TZP.</p><p>To quantify EdU incorporation in granulosa cells, Fiji was used to calculate the ratio of Edu-labelled cells per GOC by dividing the number of EdU-positive cells by the total number of cells counterstained with DAPI.</p><p>To individually segment granulosa cells and their corresponding TZPs, Imaris 9.7.2 Software (Bitplane) was used. First, z-stacks of 0.2 μm thickness covering the middle region of a follicle were imaged to obtain a conventional 2D Maximum Intensity Projection (MIP). Then, a 3D rendered segmentation of GFP-positive granulosa cells was created with the ‘Cell detection’ tool where cell boundaries were detected based on GFP membrane staining. Smallest diameter was set to 100 µm, membrane detail of 0.2 μm and the threshold was adjusted based on local contrast. Segmented cells with a volume less than 100 µm<sup>2</sup> were deleted and fusing or fragmented cells were edited using the ‘merge’ or ‘split’ tools to match the original image. The oocyte was also segmented using the phalloidin red channel. After the edition, cells were converted to surface objects with the tool ‘Convert to surfaces’ to record their measurements. To render individual TZPs, the ‘Filament tracer’ tool and semi-automated tracing with the tool ‘Autopath’ was used to draw the path of each TZP from the granulosa cell body (start) to the oocyte surface (end) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). TZP diameter (thickness) was calculated automatically with a minimum diameter of 0.1 μm. To determine the distance of the TZP tip to the oocyte surface, the segmented TZP was automatically divided into discrete spots using the extension ‘Filament to Spots.’ This allowed the calculation of the distance from each spot to the oocyte surface. All measurements were exported using the ‘distance to oocyte surface’ from each TZP spot. To determine the TZP orientation (away or towards the oocyte), the distance of the spot located at the TZP start was subtracted from the distance of the spot located at the TZP tip. A positive difference indicates that the TZP tip is closer to the oocyte and a negative difference indicates that the TZP tip is farther from the oocyte (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Data are presented as mean ± standard error of the mean and were analyzed and represented using GraphPad Prism 8.4.2 software.

A recent study has also shown that depleting Myo10 in granulosa cells reduces the number of TZPs and leads to abnormalities in oocyte and embryo development. Thus, the importance of TZPs is well-established. These findings, which were insufficiently brought out in the Introduction of the original manuscript, have now been made more clearly (Introduction, 2nd paragraph). We recognize that these reports do not directly test a role for SMAD4-dependent TZPs. Unfortunately, it is beyond our technical capacity to obtain embryos following meiotic maturation and fertilization of oocytes that have grown in vitro, which wold be necessary for us to fully test the physiological role of SMAD4-dependent TZPs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>(1) The authors switch from Amhr2-cre to ER-cre to increase the number of GFP-positive granulosa cells in 12 d/o ovaries. To avoid disruption of FSH secretion by SMAD4, they use an in vitro model that requires 6 days in GEO culture (1 d tamoxifen + 5 d). Could it be that Amhr2-cre didn't work because most follicles would not have reached the atretic preantral stage in 12 d/o ovaries? Did the authors consider 6 days in vitro GEO culture to determine if Amhr2-cre would be efficient and avoid exposure to tamoxifen?</p></disp-quote><p>Please see below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>When is Amhr2 expressed?</p></disp-quote><p>Previous studies (Jorgez et al, 2004; Pangas et al, 2006) report that Amhr2 is expressed in growing follicles that have progressed beyond a single layer of granulosa cells (often defined as secondary and primary follicles, respectively). As shown in Fig. 1C, we did not observe evidence of widespread Cre activity in multilayer follicles. At least two factors may contribute why we observed relatively weak Cre activity. One possibility is that, on the genetic background our mice, Amhr2 is expressed relatively late during follicular growth. Thus, we might have observed more GFP-positive granulosa cells in antral or pre-ovulatory follicles. Because the granulosa cells of these late-stage follicles would already have produced many TZPs, the number of new TZPs generated in wild-type but not SMAD4-depleted cells after Amhr2 activation would be a relatively small proportion of the total population. This would make it more difficult to detect a reduction in TZP number in the absence of SMAD4.</p><p>A second point is that we used pre-puberal mice whereas Jorgez et al examined Amhr2 expression in ovaries of adult mice. Pangas et al evaluated both prepuberal and adult females. It may be that Amhr2 is expressed earlier or more strongly in granulosa cells of adult mice. Regarding the suggestion to culture complexes obtained from mice on the Amhr2-Cre background, as this might allow widespread expression of Cre without the need for tamoxifen, this is an excellent idea. If there is considerable heterogeneity among cells in the timing of Amhr2-Cre activity, though, this may further cloud efforts to uncover the role of SMAD4 in the production or stability of TZPs, as noted above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Did most of the GEO cultured in vitro reach the antral follicle stage after 6 days?</p></disp-quote><p>Since GOCs were treated with collagenase, the thecal layer was removed. Therefore, development of an antrum does not occur. We observed that, in some cases, the oocyte was extruded from the granulosa cell mass. These abnormal complexes were discarded.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3). Was the development/diameter of the oocyte in the GEO comparable to the oocyte growing in vivo?</p></disp-quote><p>We did not compare the diameter of the oocytes grown in vitro to those grown in vivo. Thus, we cannot say whether the oocytes grown in vitro reached the same size as those grown in vivo. We did, however, compare the diameter of the oocytes in the wt and ko groups and observed no difference (Figure 2). This indicates that depletion of SMAD4 in the granulosa cells does not impair oocyte growth. Importantly for our studies, it excludes the possibility that the reduction in TZP-number is simply due to a smaller surface area of the oocyte.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) SMAD4 depletion in granulosa cells disrupts steroidogenesis leading to increased progesterone levels and precocious luteinization of granulosa cells (Pangas et al., 2006). Did the authors determine the expression level of luteal markers of granulosa cells in the in vitro GEO culture Smad4 knockout model? Are their observations direct effects of the absence of SMAD4?</p></disp-quote><p>This is an excellent point. We checked our previously performed RNA-seq analysis of the wild-type and knockout granulosa cells, but found no difference in the quantities of Cyp11a1, Sfrp4, Star or Ptgfr. This is now described in the Discussion (4th paragraph). One potentially important difference between our study and that of Pangas et al (2006) is that they observed premature luteinization when prepuberal (3-week old) mice were injected with the FSH analogue, equine serum gonadotropin, whereas we studied granulosa-oocyte complexes cultured in vitro. This could underlie the apparent differences with respect to luteinization.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) Could the reduced number of TZPs in ER-cre+; Smad4fl/fl GOCs be explained by luteinization?</p></disp-quote><p>This interesting and logical possibility is related to the previous point. In other words, luteinization could be considered as a default pathway of differentiation that is suppressed by SMAD signaling. It is possible that luteinized cells are unable to generate or maintain TZPs. This model offers a potential mechanistic basis for our observation, and we now raise it in the Discussion (3rd paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>The expression and localization of N-cadherin should be observed in Smad4 and control granulosa cell-oocyte complexes.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this would be an excellent approach to confirm the decreased expression of N-cadherin in the granulosa cells that was observed by immunoblotting. We were confronted by two challenges, however. First, we were unable to consistently obtain strong staining of granulosa cell membranes in the inner layers of multilayer granulosa-oocyte complexes. Other antibodies are able to stain structures at the oocyte surface, indicating that antibodies are not physically blocked from penetrating the complex. More likely, the anti-N-cadherin does not bind its target strongly enough to generate a robust signal that can be detected through multiple overlying layers of cells. Second, whereas for immunoblotting we collect all granulosa cells from culture complexes, for immunofluorescence we are only able to examine those that remain in the complex. This means that, for immunofluorescence, we essentially but unavoidably select against cells that are only loosely attached – as would be expected for N-cadherin-deficient cells – to their neighbours. Given these challenges, we believe that the immunoblotting approach, which produced highly reproducible results over six biological replicates (Fig. 6), is the most reliable.</p></body></sub-article></article>
