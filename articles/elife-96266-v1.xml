Here, we investigate the connection between developmentally controlled PCD and fungal accommodation in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> roots, focusing on the root cap-specific transcription factor ANAC033/SOMBRERO (SMB) and the senescence-associated nuclease BFN1. Mutations of both dPCD regulators increase colonization by the beneficial fungus <italic>Serendipita indica</italic>, primarily in the differentiation zone. <italic>smb-3</italic> mutants additionally exhibit hypercolonization around the meristematic zone and a delay of <italic>S. indica</italic>-induced root-growth promotion. This demonstrates that root cap dPCD and rapid post-mortem clearance of cellular corpses represent a physical defense mechanism restricting microbial invasion of the root. Additionally, reporter lines and transcriptional analysis revealed that <italic>BFN1</italic> expression is downregulated during <italic>S. indica</italic> colonization in mature root epidermal cells, suggesting a transcriptional control mechanism that facilitates the accommodation of beneficial microbes in the roots.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>As plant roots grow deeper into the soil, they encounter various fungi and bacteria. Some of these microbes attempt to infect the roots, but certain interactions can be mutually beneficial, promoting microbe survival while protecting plants from harmful infections. However, microbes rarely invade the root tip, which is protected by a special type of tissue called the root cap.</p><p>As roots grow, root cap cells are constantly removed and replaced. In the model plant <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, root cap turnover occurs via a combination of cellular shedding and developmental programmed cell death (dPCD). Proteins known as SMB and BFN1 regulate this process by triggering cell death and ensuring dead cells are removed.</p><p>To investigate whether the rate of dPCD and the degree of post-mortem corpse clearance affect how fungi accumulate in plant roots, Charura et al. studied <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> plants with a non-functional SMB protein. Staining techniques revealed an accumulation of dead cells remaining in the root cap, as well as increased growth of the fungus <italic>Serendipita indica</italic> in the root tip. These changes also disrupted the growth-promoting effects typically initiated by the fungus. Taken together, the findings suggest that under normal conditions, SMB drives the continuous clearance of cells through dPCD, which limits fungal growth in the root tip that could otherwise harm the plant.</p><p>Charura et al. next looked at how <italic>S. indica</italic> infection affects the expression of genes that drive dPCD. This revealed reduced expression of the gene for BFN1 in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> plants infected with the fungus. Staining the roots of plants containing a non-functional form of BFN1 also revealed increased dead cell remnants and greater fungal growth further up the root, suggesting that <italic>S. indica</italic> may exploit host cell clearance pathways to colonize the roots.</p><p>In conclusion, the findings show that the rate of dPCD in plant roots is key to limiting fungal invasion. The decreased BFN1 gene expression observed with <italic>S. indica</italic> infection suggests that fungi may manipulate BFN1 to help them form more beneficial partnerships. Understanding the interplay between root cap turnover and fungal invasion could lead to more sustainable agricultural practices and may help researchers to improve plant nutrition and tolerance without relying on chemical fertilizers or pesticides.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>Serendipita indica</italic></kwd><kwd>developmentally programmed cell death</kwd><kwd>regulated cell death</kwd><kwd>plant-microbe interaction</kwd><kwd>meristematic stem cells</kwd><kwd>aging cells</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>A. thaliana</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Excellence Strategy of the Federal Republic of Germany -

As roots extend further into the soil environment, the newly formed root tissue is naturally exposed to microbial attack, challenging the successful establishment of root systems. However, microbial colonization at the meristematic zone is rarely detected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jacobs et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Deshmukh et al., 2006</xref>). The sensitive tissue of meristematic stem cells is surrounded by the root cap, a specialized root organ that orchestrates root architecture, directs root growth based on gravitropism and hydrotropism, and senses environmental stimuli. In addition, the root cap is presumed to have a protective function in soil exploration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kumpf and Nowack, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Moriwaki et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>In <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> (hereafter <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>), the root cap consists of two distinct tissues: the centrally located columella root cap at the very root tip and the peripherally located lateral root cap (LRC), which flanks both the columella and the entire root meristem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dolan et al., 1993</xref>). A ring of specific stem cells continuously generates both new LRC cells and root epidermal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dolan et al., 1993</xref>). However, despite the constant production of LRC cells, the root cap itself does not grow in size but matches the size of the meristem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kumpf and Nowack, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fendrych et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barlow, 2002</xref>). To maintain size homeostasis, root cap development is a highly regulated process that varies in different plant species. In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, a combination of dPCD and shedding of old cells into the rhizosphere has been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kumpf and Nowack, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bennett et al., 2010</xref>). The centrally located columella root cap along with adjacent proximal LRC cells is shed as a cell package, followed by a PCD process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Feng et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Shi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Huysmans et al., 2018</xref>). In contrast, LRC cells at the distal end of the root tip elongate and reach the edge of the meristematic zone where they undergo dPCD followed by corpse clearance on the root surface, orchestrated as part of a terminal differentiation program by the root cap-specific transcription factor ANAC33/SOMBRERO (SMB; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fendrych et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bennett et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Willemsen et al., 2008</xref>). SMB belongs to a plant-specific family of transcription factors carrying a NAC domain (NAM - no apical meristem; ATAF1 and –2, and CUC2 - cup-shaped cotyledon). SMB promotes the expression of genes associated with the initiation and execution of LRC cell death, including the senescence-associated bifunctional nuclease <italic>BFN1</italic> and the putative aspartic protease <italic>PASPA3</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Huysmans et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fendrych et al., 2014</xref>). BFN1 localizes in the ER, but upon cell death the protein is released and its nuclease activity ensures rapid and irreversible degradation of RNA and DNA in the nucleus and cytoplasm as part of a rapid cell-autonomous corpse clearance at the root surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Reza et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fendrych et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Farage-Barhom et al., 2011</xref>). Accordingly, DNA and RNA degradation in <italic>bfn1-1</italic> loss-of-function mutants is delayed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fendrych et al., 2014</xref>). Precise timing of cell death and elimination of LRC cells before they fully enter the elongation zone is essential for maintaining root cap size and optimal root growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fendrych et al., 2014</xref>). Loss of SMB activity results in a delayed cell death, causing LRC cells to enter the elongation zone where they eventually die without expression of dPCD executor genes in the root cap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fendrych et al., 2014</xref>). Interestingly, the aberrant cell death of LRC cells in the elongation zone of <italic>smb-3</italic> mutants is not followed by corpse clearance, resulting in an accumulation of uncleared cell corpses along the entire root surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fendrych et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Despite its importance in root morphology and plant development, little is known about the importance of dPCD and rapid cell corpse clearance on plant-microbe interactions. To address this question, we tested two well-characterized loss-of-function T-DNA insertion lines, <italic>smb-3</italic> and <italic>bfn1-1</italic>, during colonization with <italic>Serendipita indica</italic>, a beneficial fungus of the order Sebacinales. As a root endophyte, <italic>S. indica</italic> colonizes the epidermal and cortex layers of a broad range of different plant hosts, conferring various beneficial effects, including plant growth promotion, protection against pathogenic microbes and increased tolerance to abiotic stresses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boorboori and Zhang, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mahdi et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fesel and Zuccaro, 2016</xref>). The colonization strategy of <italic>S. indica</italic> comprises an initial biotrophic interaction, followed by a growth phase associated with a restricted host cell death that does not, however, diminish the beneficial effects on the plant host. The induction of restricted cell death in the epidermal and cortex layers is a crucial component of the colonization strategy of <italic>S. indica</italic> and is accompanied by an increased production of fungal hydrolytic enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zuccaro et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Deshmukh et al., 2006</xref>). The switch between the biotrophic and the cell death-associated phase can vary depending on the host system and environmental conditions, but has been postulated to occur approximately 6–8 days post inoculation (dpi) in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zuccaro et al., 2011</xref>). Although several effector proteins involved in fungal accommodation have been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dunken et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nostadt et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Nizam et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Weiß et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wawra et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akum et al., 2015</xref>), the exact mechanism by which <italic>S. indica</italic> manipulates host cell death and the role of dPCD in fungal accommodation in the roots are largely unclear.</p><p>Here, we show that the accumulation of uncleared LRC cell corpses on the roots of <italic>smb-3</italic> mutants triggers hypercolonization by <italic>S. indica</italic>, especially around the meristematic zone, and delays <italic>S. indica</italic>-induced root growth promotion. We propose that a tight regulation of host dPCD and rapid and complete clearance of root cap cell corpses play important roles in restricting fungal colonization at the root apical meristem. Furthermore, we show that <italic>S. indica</italic> downregulates <italic>BFN1</italic> in older and differentiated epidermal cells to promote fungal accommodation. Our results emphasize that beneficial microbes have the ability to modify plant dPCD processes to enhance host colonization.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The SMB-mediated clearance of dead cells protects the root meristem and regulates symbiosis</title><p>dPCD and corpse clearance are the final steps in LRC differentiation, maintaining root cap organ size in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> root tips. This process is orchestrated by the LRC-specific transcription factor SMB and executed by its direct and indirect downstream targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). To characterize the role of disrupted dPCD in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> LRCs, we analyzed the phenotypic implications of the SMB loss-of-function allele <italic>smb-3</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Willemsen et al., 2008</xref>). We employed two staining methods to visualize the extent of cell death and protein aggregation in the <italic>smb-3</italic> T-DNA insertion line. We first used Evans blue staining, a viability dye that penetrates damaged/dying cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Vijayaraghavareddy et al., 2017</xref>).

This observation highlights that the loss of SMB activity specifically affects the induction of dPCD in LRC cells at the transition between meristematic and elongation zone.

We quantified extraradical colonization using the chitin-binding fluorescent marker Alexa Fluor 488 conjugated to Wheat Germ Agglutinin (WGA-AF 488) as a proxy for fungal biomass. We compared staining intensities of WGA-AF 488 between <italic>S. indica</italic>-colonized WT and <italic>smb-3</italic> roots. <italic>S. indica</italic> showed a clear hypercolonization phenotype along the main root axis of <italic>smb-3</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>). On WT roots, <italic>S. indica</italic> preferentially colonized the differentiation zone, leaving the meristematic and elongation zone largely uncolonized, whereas mycelial growth was clearly detectable at the root tips of <italic>smb-3</italic> plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jacobs et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Deshmukh et al., 2006</xref>). Intraradical colonization by <italic>S. indica</italic> was quantified by comparing fungal and plant single-copy housekeeping marker genes using quantitative PCR (qPCR), after washing of roots to remove outer fungal mycelium. The results showed a significant increase in intraradical fungal accommodation in <italic>smb-3</italic> mutants compared to WT roots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). To assess the biological implications of hypercolonization, we measured <italic>S. indica</italic>-induced root growth in WT and <italic>smb-3</italic> mutants. While <italic>S. indica</italic> consistently and significantly increased root length in WT plants at 8, 10 and 14 dpi, increased length of <italic>smb-3</italic> mutant roots was only observable at later stages of colonization, indicating a delayed growth promotion phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Detailed cytological analysis confirmed that <italic>S. indica</italic> grew extensively around the meristematic zone of <italic>smb-3</italic> mutants but not of WT roots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>) and showed increased colonization of <italic>smb-3</italic> mutants in the differentiation zone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>).

Together, these findings indicate that loss of SMB activity in the root cap results in an accumulation of uncleared LRC cell corpses that promotes fungal colonization from the meristematic to the differentiation zone. Therefore, we postulate that the continuous clearance of root cap cells in WT roots is important to limit microbial colonization along the entire root axis and prevent microbial colonization in the meristematic zone.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title><italic>smb-3</italic> mutants display extraradical hypercolonization and increased intraradical colonization by <italic>S.</italic> <italic>indica</italic>.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative images show extraradical colonization of 10-day-old WT and <italic>smb-3</italic> mutant seedlings (seed inoculated). <italic>S. indica</italic> was stained with WGA-AF 488.

Together, these results emphasize that downregulation of <italic>BFN1</italic> during colonization is beneficial for intra- and extraradical fungal accommodation in the differentiation zone.</p><p>Next, we investigated the impact of other beneficial microbes on dPCD by examining transcriptional responses in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> roots colonized by different organisms.

Our findings indicate that microbes may benefit from delayed post-mortem corpse clearance after dPCD in host plants and suggest that beneficial microbes may have evolved mechanisms to manipulate dPCD pathways to increase colonization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>dPCD and its proposed effects on plant-microbe interactions.</title><p>The root cap protects and covers the stem cells of the root apical meristem. Its size in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> is maintained by a high cellular turnover of root cap cells. While the columella root cap is shed from the root tip, a dPCD machinery marks the final step of LRC differentiation and prevents LRC cells from entering into the elongation zone. Induction of cell death by the transcription factor SMB is followed by irreversible DNA fragmentation and cell corpse clearance, mediated by the nuclease BFN1, a downstream executor of dPCD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fendrych et al., 2014</xref>). The absence of dPCD induction in the <italic>smb-3</italic> knockout mutant leads to a delay in LRC differentiation and allows LRC cells to enter the elongation zone, where they die uncontrolled, resulting in an accumulation of LRC cell corpses along the differentiation zone. In a WT background, the fungal endophyte <italic>S. indica</italic> colonizes the differentiation zone of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> roots and can also be found in shed columella cell packages. The impaired dPCD of the s<italic>mb-3</italic> mutant phenotype results in a hypercolonization of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> roots, along the differentiation zone as well as the meristematic zone, highlighting that the continuous clearance of root cap cells is necessary for restricting microbial accommodation at the meristematic zone. Loss of the downstream dPCD executor <italic>BFN1</italic> does not affect fungal colonization in the meristematic zone but increases accommodation by <italic>S. indica</italic> in the differentiation zone, where BFN1 appears to be involved in dPCD of senescent epidermal cells and undergoes downregulation during <italic>S. indica</italic> colonization.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-96266-fig6-v1.tif"/></fig></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we investigated the functional link between dPCD and microbial accommodation in roots. Impaired dPCD in the <italic>Arabidopsis smb-3</italic> and <italic>bfn1-1</italic> mutants increased colonization by the beneficial endophyte <italic>S. indica</italic>. The <italic>smb-3</italic> mutants displayed hypercolonization along the entire primary root, suggesting that the extra sheet of cell corpses surrounding <italic>smb-3</italic> roots provide additional and easily accessible nutrients that fuel fungal colonization. In fact, we observed a clearing effect with progressive colonization stages. Furthermore, hypercolonization of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, caused by the loss of dPCD in the root cap, mitigated the beneficial effects of <italic>S. indica</italic> by delaying the induction of growth promotion. Most notably, we observed hypercolonization of the meristematic zone of <italic>smb-3</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). The root apical meristem embedded in this zone of the root tip is essential for root growth, as all primary root tissue originates from these continuously dividing stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hamamoto et al., 2006</xref>). This sensitive tissue is surrounded by the root cap, which protects it from external stresses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kumar and Iyer-Pascuzzi, 2020</xref>). The phenotype of <italic>smb-3</italic> mutants shows resemblance to the human skin disease hyperkeratosis. In healthy human skin, a pool of stem cells produces layers of cells that divide, differentiate, die, and are shed. Such developmental programs form a physical and dynamic barrier against environmental factors. Microbes attempting to establish themselves are consistently removed by skin exfoliation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dettmer, 2021</xref>). Patients with hyperkeratosis show an accumulation of dead cells on the outer skin layer, making them more susceptible to microbial infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cheng et al., 1992</xref>). Likewise, malfunctions within regulated cell death in mammal gut epithelial cells produce death-induced nutrient release (DINNR) that can fuel bacterial growth and infection and could cause a variety of disorders such as inflammatory diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anderson et al., 2021</xref>). The importance of an intact root cap in plant-microbe interactions is further highlighted by the fact that the physical removal of root caps in maize plants leads to increased colonization of the root tip by the plant growth promoting rhizobacterium (PGPR) <italic>Pseudomonas fluorescens</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Humphris et al., 2005</xref>) and to changes in the rhizosphere microbiome composition along the root axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rüger et al., 2023</xref>). Moreover, it has been suggested that border cells released from the root cap may distract root-feeding nematodes from attacking plant roots (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Rodger et al., 2003</xref>). Our results provide strong evidence that root cap size maintenance in the form of constant root cap cell turnover in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> acts as a dynamic barrier, analogous to epidermal cell turnover in animals. It thus represents a sophisticated physical mechanism to prevent or reduce intracellular microbial colonization near the root meristematic tissue and contributes to the maintenance of a beneficial interaction with root endophytes.</p><p>Mutation of <italic>BFN1</italic> displayed significantly increased colonization in the differentiation zone but not in the meristematic zone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). The differences in colonization patterns to the <italic>smb-3</italic> mutants likely reflect spatial expression and localization patterns of SMB and BFN1 activity throughout <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> roots. While the expression of the transcription factor <italic>SMB</italic> is restricted to the LRC, the senescence-associated nuclease <italic>BFN1</italic> is expressed in different tissues undergoing dPCD and senescence below and above ground (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Escamez et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Farage-Barhom et al., 2008</xref>). Here, we show that <italic>BFN1</italic> is additionally expressed in differentiated root epidermal cells that undergo nuclear degradation during root maturation. This suggests an age-dependent dPCD in the outer epidermal layer of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> roots where expression of <italic>BFN1</italic> possibly pre-dates cortical and epidermal abscission during secondary root growth and contributes to clearance of cell corpses during periderm emergence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wunderling et al., 2018</xref>). This process resembles root cortical senescence and cell death in grass species such as wheat, barley, and corn, which typically start in the epidermis and spread toward the endodermis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Drew et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p>Additionally, we observed distinct differences in the presence and distribution of protein aggregates in <italic>smb-3</italic> and <italic>bfn1-1</italic> mutants. In <italic>smb-3</italic> mutants, protein aggregates are restricted to LRC cells adhering to the primary root. This localized distribution may be attributed to the absence of SMB-induced proteases in the LRC cells of these mutants. The absence of these proteases likely impairs protein turnover and degradation, leading to accumulation and aggregation specifically in these cells. In contrast, <italic>bfn1-1</italic> mutation results in a more extensive and diffuse pattern of protein aggregation in the epidermal cell layer of the differentiation zone, regardless of the occurrence of cell death. This widespread distribution suggests that BFN1 plays a broader role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and protein quality control throughout the root epidermis and differentiation zone. These distinct patterns of protein aggregation and cell death in <italic>smb-3</italic> and <italic>bfn1-1</italic> mutants underscore the importance of these genes in maintaining cellular integrity and protein homeostasis. The contrasting phenotypes highlight the distinct roles of these genes in cellular processes.</p><p>While we show that dPCD protects the meristem from microbial colonization, we propose that some adapted microbes manipulate host dPCD processes by affecting the transcriptional expression of <italic>BFN1</italic> to facilitate accommodation in the root. Whether active interference by fungal effector proteins, fungal-derived signaling molecules or a systemic response of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> roots underlies <italic>BFN1</italic> downregulation by <italic>S. indica</italic> remains to be investigated. It was recently demonstrated that small active metabolites produced either by Toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR)-containing leucine-rich repeat (NLR) receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Yu et al., 2022</xref>) or by fungal-derived enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dunken et al., 2022</xref>) through hydrolysis of RNA/DNA can mediate host cell death. This raises an exciting possibility that RNAse and DNAse activities of BFN1 may be involved in producing small, active nucleotide-derived metabolites that affect cell death, cell corpse clearance, proteostasis and fungal accommodation in the differentiation zone. To explore this hypothesis further, metabolomic and proteomic approaches should be employed in future studies. Notably, we have shown that colonization by other beneficial microbes such as the closely related fungus <italic>S. vermifera</italic> and bacterial members of the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and <italic>H. vulgare</italic> microbiota (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mahdi et al., 2022</xref>) also led to the downregulation of <italic>BFN1</italic> in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. These findings emphasize the presence of a conserved pathway influenced by diverse beneficial microbes to downregulate <italic>BFN1</italic> expression in epidermal tissue to facilitate symbioses.</p><p>Transcriptomic analysis of both established and predicted key dPCD marker genes revealed diverse patterns of upregulation and downregulation during <italic>S. indica</italic> colonization. These findings provide a valuable foundation for future studies investigating the dynamics of dPCD processes during beneficial symbiotic interactions and the potential manipulation of these processes by symbiotic partners.</p><p>In conclusion, our data show that tight regulation of host dPCD in epidermal- and root cap-tissue plays an important role in restricting fungal colonization. From a microbial perspective, dPCD pathways represent a potential nexus for enhancing symbiotic interactions and potentially improving nutrient availability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). These results shed light on the complex relationship between PCD and microbial accommodation in plant roots, offering valuable insights into the development of plants that establish more efficient

Inoculated and mock-treated seedlings were stained directly on agar plate by pipetting 2 ml of 1 X Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, 137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 10 mM Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>, 1.8 mM KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>) solution containing Alexa Fluor 488 conjugated with Wheat Germ Agglutinin (5 µl/mL from 1 mg/ml stock; WGA-AF 488, Invitrogen). After 2 min of incubation, the roots were washed twice on the plate with 1 X PBS solution. The stained seedlings were transferred to a fresh ½ MS square plate (Greiner Bio-One). In order to perform a correct and focused scan of the agar plate with the roots, it was checked that the solid MS medium was flat and even and had no unevenness. To scan the agar plate, we used an Odyssey M Imaging System (LI-COR Biosciences) and the LI-COR Acquisition Software 1.1 (LI-COR Biosciences). In the software, we selected custom assay and then membrane. We selected the area in the agar plate to be scanned and selected the channels 488 (for WGA-Alexa Flour 488) and RGB trans (for bright field). We defined the focus offset between 3.5 mm and 4.0 mm (depending on the thickness of the MS medium). For resolution we selected 10 µm when scanning two plants or 100 µm when scanning several plants. Quantification of WGA-AF 488 fluorescence was performed using EmpiriaStudio Software (LI-COR Biosciences).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>RNA extraction (intraradical colonization assay)</title><p>To measure intraradical colonization via RNA extraction and PCR, plants were harvested at three time points around 7, 10, and 14 dpi. The roots were extensively washed with ddH<sub>2</sub>O and tissue paper was used to carefully wipe off mycelium on the surface of the roots. After cleaning, the roots were shock frozen in liquid nitrogen and RNA was extracted with TRIzol (Invitrogen, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Schwerte, Germany). After a DNase I (Thermo Fisher Scientific) treatment according to the manufacturer’s instructions to remove DNA, RNA was used to generate cDNA through the utilization of the Fermentas First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Quantitative RT-PCR analysis</title><p>The quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was performed using a CFX connect real time system (BioRad) with the following program: 95 °C 3 min, 95 °C 15 s, 59 °C 20 s, 72 °C 30 s, 40 cycles and melting curve analysis.

Protein extracts were obtained using native lysis buffer (300 mM NaCl, 100 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 2 mM EDTA, 2% Triton X-100) supplemented with 1 x plant protease inhibitor (Merck). Cell debris was removed by several centrifugation steps at 8000 x <italic>g</italic> for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was separated, and protein concentration determined using the Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher). A cellulose acetate membrane filter (GE Healthcare Life Sciences) and 3 filter papers (BioRad, 1620161) were immersed in 1 x PBS and placed in a slot blot apparatus (Bio-Rad) connected to a vacuum system. The membrane was equilibrated by 3 washes with equilibration buffer (native buffer containing 0.5% SDS). 300, 200, and 100 µg of the protein extract were mixed with SDS at a final concentration of 0.5% and filtered through the membrane. The membrane was then washed with 0.2% SDS and blocked with 3% BSA in Tris-Buffered Saline 0.1% Tween (TBST, 50 mM Tris-CL, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.5) for 30 minutes, followed by three washes with TBST. Incubation was performed with anti-polyQ [1:1000] (Merck, MAB1574). The membrane was washed 3 times for 5 min and incubated with secondary antibodies in TBST 3% BSA for 30 min. The membrane was developed using the Odyssey M Imaging System (LI-COR Biosciences). Extracts were also analyzed by SDS-PAGE and western blotting against anti-Actin [1:5000] (Agrisera, AS132640) to determine loading controls.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) and proteostat staining quantification</title><p>CLSM images were acquired using either the FV1000 confocal laser scanning microscope (Olympus) or a Meta 710 confocal microscope with laser ablation 266 nm (Zeiss). All images were acquired using the same parameters between experiments. Excitation of WGA-AF 488 was done with an argon laser at 488 nm and the emitted light was detected with a hybrid detector at 500–550 nm. Proteostat was excited at 561 nm and the signal was detected between 590 and 700 nm.

Three biological replicates were used for each condition. The RNA-seq libraries were generated and sequenced at US Department of Energy Joint Genome Institute (JGI) under a project proposal (Proposal ID: 505829) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Eichfeld et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zuccaro and Langen, 2020</xref>). For each sample, stranded RNA-Seq libraries were generated and quantified by qRT-PCR. RNA-Seq libraries were sequenced with Illumina sequencer. Raw reads were filtered and trimmed using the JGI QC pipeline. Filtered reads from each library were aligned to the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> genome (TAIR10) using HISAT2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kim et al., 2015</xref>) and the reads mapped to each gene were counted using featureCounts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Liao et al., 2014</xref>). Samples harvested at 1 dpi were omitted from the analysis because we decided to focus on the time points at which the interaction between <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and <italic>S. indica</italic> is well established. Differential gene expression analysis was performed using the R package DESeq2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Love et al., 2014</xref>). Genes with an FDR adjusted p-value &lt;0.05 were considered as differentially expressed genes (DEGs). The adjusted p-value refers to the transformation of the p-value obtained with the Wald test after considering multiple testing. To visualize gene expression, genes expression levels were normalized as Transcript Per kilobase million (TPM).</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>All statistical analyses, except for the transcriptomic analysis, were performed using Prism8.

Maybe S1 would be more informative as main figure.</p></disp-quote><p>As an indicator of membrane integrity loss and cell death, Evans blue staining was used to characterize all dPCD mutants described in this study and their interactions with <italic>S. indica</italic>. To avoid redundancies with other publications, we restructured Figure 1, incorporating panel S1A to provide an introductory overview of the <italic>smb-3</italic> phenotype. The former Figure 1B is now located in Figure S1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- It is not clear how the analysis of protein aggregates fits into the rationale, why analyze these formations? What role should they have in the process of PCD or interaction with microbes?</p></disp-quote><p>The manuscript has been modified the following way to clarify the analysis of protein aggregates in the dPCD mutants: “The transcription factor SMB promotes the expression of various dPCD executor genes, including proteases that break down and clear cellular debris and protein aggregates following cell death induction. In the LRCs of <italic>smb-3</italic> mutants, the absence of induction of these proteases potentially explains the accumulation of protein aggregates in uncleared dead LRC cells.”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Is the accumulation of misfolded and aggregated proteins also present during physiological PCD of LRC cells in the WT?</p></disp-quote><p>The biochemical mechanisms underlying PCD can vary depending on the affected cell types and tissues. Within the root tip of Arabidopsis, two different modes of PCD have been described, differentiating between columella root cap cells and LRC cells. For clarification the manuscript has been adjusted the following way:” Under physiological conditions in WT roots, we previously observed protein aggregate accumulation in sloughed columella cell packages, but not during dPCD of distal LRC clearance (Llamas et al., 2021). This aligns with the findings that dPCD of the columella is affected by the loss of autophagy, while dPCD of the LRC is not (Feng et al., 2022).”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- I suggest being more careful when using the term &quot;root cap&quot; instead of &quot;LRC&quot; to reduce ambiguity (i.e. lines 56; 137), maybe you need to double-check the text.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that a clear distinction between “root cap” and “LRC” is very important. We have adjusted the manuscript to avoid any misunderstandings.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- A technical question regarding qPCR sample preparation: doesn't washing the smb-3 roots cause a loss of LRC stretched cells and would it therefore lead to an alteration of the results?</p></disp-quote><p>The mechanical washing of roots is essential to ensure a clear distinction between intraradical fungal growth and accommodation around roots. While we cannot exclude the possibility that mechanical washing removes LRC cells, intraradical quantification of fungal biomass aims to measure <italic>S. indica</italic> growth in the epidermal and cortical cell layers, underneath the uncleared LRC cells. Thus, we complemented this assay with extraradical colonization assays to quantify external fungal biomass with intact LRC cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- It is not clear if S. indica promotes PCD in wt and/or in smb-3, could you comment on it?</p></disp-quote><p>It remains an open question whether and to what extent <italic>S. indica</italic> promotes PCD, although there are strong indications that this fungus activates different cell death pathways at various developmental stages, including dAdo mediated cell death. We posit that certain microbes have evolved to regulate and manipulate different dPCD processes to enhance colonization, implicating a complex crosstalk between various PCD pathways. We have adjusted the manuscript to underscore this perspective the following way:” Transcriptomic analysis of both established and predicted key dPCD marker genes revealed diverse patterns of upregulation and downregulation during S. indica colonization. These findings provide a valuable foundation for future studies investigating the dynamics of dPCD processes during beneficial symbiotic interactions and the potential manipulation of these processes by symbiotic partners.”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- How analysis of BFN1 expression in whole root confirms its downregulation at the onset of cell death in S. indica-colonized plants. Moreover, is the transcriptional regulation of BFN1 important for PCD, or is the BFN1 protein level correlated with the establishment of cell death?</p></disp-quote><p><italic>BFN1</italic> gene expression in Arabidopsis shows a transient decrease around 6–8 days after <italic>S. indica</italic> inoculation, coinciding with the proposed onset of <italic>S. indica</italic>-induced cell death. While we can only speculate on a potential correlation between <italic>BFN1</italic> downregulation and the onset of <italic>S. indica</italic>-induced cell death, we have described other pathways through which <italic>S. indica</italic> induces cell death. For example, it produces small metabolites such as dAdo through the synergistic activity of two secreted fungal effector proteins (Dunken et al., 2023). This suggests that <italic>S. indica</italic> recruits different pathways to induce cell death, which may vary depending on the host plant and interact with each other as shown for many other immunity related cell death pathways which share some components.</p><p>Regarding the second part of the question, <italic>BFN1</italic> expression correlates positively with cells primed for dPCD (Olvera-Carrillo et al., 2015). BFN1 protein accumulates in the ER lumen and is released into the cytoplasm upon cell death induction to exert its DNase functions (Fendrych et al., 2014). If accumulation of BFN1 is cause or consequence of cell death remains to be validated.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Line 190: there is a typo &quot;in the nucleus&quot;, this is superfluous given that the reporter is nuclear.</p></disp-quote><p>The manuscript has been adjusted accordingly; see line L208. However, we consider the distinction important as we aim to emphasize the difference between the nuclear localization of the fluorescent signal in &quot;healthy&quot; cells and the dispersed fluorescent signal spreading in the cytoplasm of cells priming or undergoing dPCD.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Line 255: there is a typo, stem cells can not differentiate.</p></disp-quote><p>The manuscript has been adjusted.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- During root hair development some epidermal cells undergo PCD to allow the emergence of root hairs. Furthermore, during plant defense against pathogens, epidermal cells undergo cell death to prevent further colonization. Have these cell death events been reported to occur under physiological conditions during development?</p></disp-quote><p>Plant defence responses in roots and the hypersensitive response (HR) still remain largely unexplored. The HR is a defence mechanism that consists of a localized and rapid cell death at the site of pathogen invasion. It is triggered by pathogenic effector proteins, usually recognized by intracellular immune receptors (NLRs), and accompanied by other features such as ROS signalling, Ca2+ bursts and cell wall modifications (Balint-Kurti, 2019). Notably, HR has been widely described in leaves, but no strong evidence has been shown for the occurrence of HR in plant roots (Hermanns et al., 2003, Radwan et al., 2005). Additionally, previous studies have not shown any transcriptional parallels between common dPCD marker genes and HR PCD in Arabidopsis (Olvera-Carrillo et al., 2015; Salguero-Linares et al., 2022).</p><p>While <italic>S. indica</italic> is a beneficial root endophyte that does not induce classical hypersensitive response (HR) in host plants, the impact of dPCD on <italic>S. indica</italic> colonization should not be overlooked. <italic>S. indica</italic> promotes root hair formation in its hosts (Saleem et al., 2022), and in Arabidopsis, root hair cells naturally undergo cell death 2–3 weeks after emergence (Tan et al., 2016). This aspect could be particularly relevant for understanding the dynamics of <italic>S. indica</italic> colonization.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Showing the analysis of pBFN1 in smb-3 would help in validating the idea that the downregulation of BFN1 by S. indica is regulated independently of SMB.</p></disp-quote><p>SMB is known to be a root cap specific transcription factor (Willemsen et al., 2008; Fendrych et al., 2014). The pBFN1:tdTOMATO reporter line shows that <italic>BFN1</italic> expression occurs in many different tissues undergoing dPCD, above and below ground, where SMB is not expressed or present. Therefore, we can postulate that the downregulation of <italic>BFN1</italic> by <italic>S. indica</italic> in the differentiation zone is regulated independently of SMB.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- A question of great interest still remains open: is it the microbe that induces the regulation of BFN1 causing a delay in cell clearance and favoring the infection or is it the plant that reduces BFN1 to favor the interaction with the microbe? In other words, is the mechanism a response to stress or a consolidation of the interaction with the host?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with this reviewer that this question remains open. Whether active interference by fungal effector proteins, fungal-derived signaling molecules, or a systemic response of Arabidopsis roots underlies BFN1 downregulation during <italic>S. indica</italic> colonization remains to be investigated. Yet, it is noteworthy that the downregulation of <italic>BFN1</italic> in Arabidopsis is not specific to <italic>S. indica</italic> but also occurs during interactions with other beneficial microbes such as <italic>S. vermifera</italic> and two bacterial synthetic communities. This suggests that it could be a broader plant response to microbial presence. However, at this stage, we can only speculate on these possibilities. We therefore changed some of the statements in the paper to moderate our conclusions: e.g. “Expression of plant nuclease BFN1, which is associated with senescence, is modulated to facilitate root accommodation of beneficial microbes” to leave open who exactly is controlling <italic>BFN1</italic>, the plant or the microbes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>This is a straightforward study, well executed and well written. I have only a few specific comments, and some concern the statistics which is a bit more serious and where I would like to get answers first. Looking at the figures, I am sure that the authors can easily clarify the issues in the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the positive feedback and included clarifications in the statistical section in the material and methods.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Statistics:</p><p>- The statistics are not detailed in Material and Methods, but are only briefly indicated in the headings of the figures. Include a statistics section in Material and Methods.</p></disp-quote><p>We added an extra paragraph with statistical analysis in the Material and Method section for clarifications, which reads as follows:” All statistical analyses, except for the transcriptomic analysis, were performed using Prism8. Individual figures state the applied statistical methods, as well as p and F values. p-values and corresponding asterisks are defined as following, p&lt;0.05 *, p&lt;0.01**, p&lt;0.001***.”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Figure 1/ Figure S3, etc: First of all, a **** with p&lt; 0.00001 does not exist! Significance in statistics just means that we assume that there is a difference with some kind of probability that has been defined as p&lt;0.05 *, p&lt;0.01**, p&lt;0.001***, and NOT more! Even if p&lt;0.000001, it is still p&lt;0.001***. Stating the meaning of asterisks in a separate Statistics section in Materials and Methods would also avoid repetitive explanations (e.g. Figure 4, L68: 'Asterisk indicates significantly different...').</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and have updated the manuscript accordingly. See comment above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Also, it is advisable to reduce the digits of the p-values to a meaningful length e.g. Figure 2 L 36: (*P&lt;0.0466) should be (F[1, ?] = ?; p&lt;0.047). The * is not necessary in the text, as p&lt;0.05 is already given. We do not obtain more information by a more exact p-value, because all we need to know is that p&lt;0.05.</p></disp-quote><p>We adjusted the p-values accordingly throughout the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- It is NOT sufficient to communicate just the p-value of a statistical analysis. What is always needed is the F-value (student test and ANOVA) with both nominator and denominator degrees of freedom (e.g. F[2, 10]=) AND the p-value.</p></disp-quote><p>We included F-values throughout the manuscript in all main and supplemental figures to provide more clarity for the readers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- The reason becomes clear in Fig. 2D where the authors state that they used 3 biological replicates, each with 40 plants. I assume the statistics was wrongly based on calculating with 120 plants (F[1,120]=) as technical replicates instead of correctly the biological replicates (3 means of 40 technical replicates each, (F[1,3]=))?? If F-value and df had been given, errors like this would be immediately visible - for any reviewer/reader, but also to the authors.</p><p>=&gt;Please re-analyze the statistics correctly.</p></disp-quote><p>To assess <italic>S. indica</italic>-induced growth promotion, we measured and compared the root length of Arabidopsis plants under <italic>S. indica</italic> colonization or mock conditions at three different time points. Each genotype and treatment combination involved measuring 50 plants, with each plant serving as an independent biological replicate inoculated with the same <italic>S. indica</italic> spore solution. For comprehensive statistical analysis, we conducted the experiment a total of 3 times, using fresh fungal inoculum each time, originally referred to as &quot;three biological replicates.&quot; We maintain that including all plant measurements is essential for a thorough statistical analysis of our growth promotion experiment. However, in order to avoid confusion, we have updated the figure legend to clarify the experimental set-up as following: “(D) Root length measurements of WT plants and <italic>smb-3</italic> mutant plants, during <italic>S. indica</italic> colonization (seed inoculated) or mock treatment. 50 plants for each genotype and treatment combination were observed and individually measured over a time period of two weeks. WT roots show <italic>S. indica</italic>-induced growth promotion, while growth promotion of <italic>smb-3</italic> mutants was delayed and only observed at later stages of colonization. This experiment was repeater 2 more independent times, each time with fresh fungal material. Statistical analysis was performed via one-way ANOVA and Tukey’s post hoc test (F [11, 1785] = 1149; p &lt; 0.001). For visual representation of statistical relevance each time point was additionally evaluated via one-way ANOVA and Tukey’s post hoc test at 8dpi (F [3, 593] = 69.24; p &lt; 0.001), 10dpi (F [3, 596] = 47.59; p &lt; 0.001) and 14dpi (F [3, 596] = 154.3; p &lt; 0.001).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Figure 2, L 18; Figure 5, L 95, Figure S5 L53, etc: I am worried about executing a statistical test 'before normalization' - what does it mean?? WHY was a normalization necessary, WHAT EXACTLY was normalized and do we see normalized plots that do NOT correspond to the data on which the statistics was based? At least this implies 'before normalization'! Please explain, and/or re-analyze the statistics correctly.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the phrasing “before normalization” may lead to confusion, as the normalization of data to the mean of the control group does not alter the statistical analysis. Normalization was performed to achieve a clearer visual representation. Additionally, Evans blue staining is quantified by measuring the mean grey value, which does not correspond to a specific unit. Normalizing the data allows for the representation of relative staining intensities. The manuscript has been adjusted accordingly throughout.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Statistics in Figure 1: L8/9: 'in reference to B' is unclear, I guess the mean of the control was used as a reference? This would also explain the variation in relative staining intensity (Figure 1C). if normalization was carried out (see above) all control (WT) values should be exactly 1, but they are not. I guess it was normalized to the mean of the control?</p></disp-quote><p>“In reference to X” or “corresponding to X” typically means that Figure X shows an example image from the dataset on which the statistical quantification is based.

OR can we at least say that the 10 measured roots were independent of each other crucial (!) precondition for executing student's test or ANOVA? Then you would have at least 10 replicates (mean of 4 pictures taken per root for each).</p></disp-quote><p>Quantification of Evans blue staining intensity involved taking 4 pictures along the main root axis of each plant. We re-evaluated the statistical analysis correctly with the averaged datapoints for each plant root. We adjusted main figures (Fig.1C and 5B) and supplementary figures (Fig. S1C and S4B) and changed the material and methods section of the manuscript as following: “4 pictures were taken along the main root axis of each plant and averaged together, for an overview of cell death in the differentiation zone.”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Statistics in Figure 4, L 69: what means 'adjusted p-value'? Which analysis?</p></disp-quote><p>The material and method section of the manuscript has been adjusted as following for clarification: “Differential gene expression analysis was performed using the R package DESeq2 (Love et al., 2014). Genes with an FDR adjusted p-value &lt; 0.05 were considered as differentially expressed genes (DEGs). The adjusted p-value refers to the transformation of the p-value obtained with the Wald test after considering multiple testing. To visualize gene expression, genes expression levels were normalized as Transcript Per kilobase million (TPM).”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Statistics in Figure 5, L102-105: see above! Were the statistics correctly calculated with 7 reps, or wrongly with 30? # I guess each time point was normalized to the mean of WT? By the way, it is not clear if repeated measurements were done on the same plants. If repeated measurements were done on the SAME plants, then these data are statistically not independent anymore (time-series analysis), and e.g. MANOVA must be used and significant (!) before proceeding to ANOVA and Tukey.</p></disp-quote><p>The statistics for quantifying intraradical colonization of Arabidopsis roots were calculated with 7 replicates.

That means you have means of 4 pictures for 5 biological replicates - the figure shows 20 replicates. However, the statistics must be based on 5 reps! You may indicate the 4 pictures per root by different colours.

If I understand it correctly, Spearman correlation is NOT a distance measure. You used Spearman correlation to cluster gene expression.

The outcome depends very much on the clustering method. Therefore, this information is important.</p></disp-quote><p>To perform gene clustering, we set the option “clustering_distance_rows = &quot;spearman&quot; “ of the Heatmap function included in the ComplexHeatmap package.
