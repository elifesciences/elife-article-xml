They must find enough food to fuel the chemical processes that keep them alive – known as their metabolism – and store leftover fuel to use when food is not available. Bats, for example, have a fast metabolism and powerful flight muscles, which require a lot of energy. Some bat species, such as the tent-making bats, survive on fruit juice, and their food sources are often far apart and difficult to find. These bats are likely to starve if they go without food for more than 24 hours, and therefore need to conserve energy while they are resting.</p><p>To deal with potential food shortages, bats and other animals can enter a low-energy resting state called torpor. In this state, animals lower their body temperature and slow down their heart rate and metabolism so that they need less energy to stay alive. However, many animals that live in tropical regions, including tent-making bats, cannot enter a state of torpor, as it is too hot to sufficiently lower their body temperature. Until now, scientists did not fully understand how these bats control how much energy they use.</p><p>Now, O’Mara et al. studied tent-making bats in the wild by attaching small heart rate transmitters to four wild bats, and measured their heartbeats over several days. Since each heartbeat delivers oxygen and fuel to the rest of the body, measuring the bats’ heart rate indicates how much energy they are using. The experiments revealed for the first time that tent-making bats periodically lower their heart rates while resting (to around 200 beats per minute). This reduces the amount of energy they use each day by up to 10%, and helps counteract heart rates that can reach 900 beats per minute when the bats are flying.</p><p>Overall, these findings show that animals have evolved in various ways to control their use of energy. Future research should use similar technology to continue uncovering how wild animals have adapted to survive in different conditions. This knowledge will help us to understand how life has become so diverse in the tropics and the strategies that animals may use as climates change.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Uroderma bilobatum</kwd><kwd>flight</kwd><kwd>heart rate</kwd><kwd>ecological physiology</kwd><kwd>torpor</kwd><kwd>energetics</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006363</institution-id><institution>National Geographic Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GEFNE124-14</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>O'Mara</surname><given-names>M Teague</given-names></name><name><surname>Wikelski</surname><given-names>Martin</given-names></name><name><surname>Dechmann</surname><given-names>Dina KN</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Max Planck Institute for Ornithology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>O'Mara</surname><given-names>M Teague</given-names></name><name><surname>Wikelski</surname><given-names>Martin</given-names></name><name><surname>Dechmann</surname><given-names>Dina KN</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>University of Konstanz</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>O'Mara</surname><given-names>M Teague</given-names></name><name><surname>Wikelski</surname><given-names>Martin</given-names></name><name><surname>Dechmann</surname><given-names>Dina KN</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Marie Sklodowska-Curie Actions</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>O'Mara</surname><given-names>M Teague</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000038</institution-id><institution>Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RGPIN-04158-2014</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Burness</surname><given-names>Gary</given-names></name><name><surname>Desantis</surname><given-names>Lanna M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Novel heart rate strategies that minimize energy expenditure during the day are necessary to cope with high energy nocturnal lifestyles of tent-making bats.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Energy intake, incorporation and expenditure are fundamental to animal behavior and evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brown et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Weiner, 1992</xref>). Animals must balance between generating enough metabolic power to find and acquire food and maintaining sufficient reserves to sustain daily maintenance, and repair and reproduce. This basic requirement of life can drive the foraging strategies of entire clades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Williams et al., 2014</xref>) and extensive links among various behavioral and physiological strategies have evolved in response to single ecological pressures including diet and pathogen environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cohen et al., 2012</xref>). This is largely a consequence of the sequential and linear process of energetic input (feeding), and that energy expenditure is additive across parallel aspects of physiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Weiner, 1992</xref>). Energetic networks then link across physiological systems from mitochondrial oxidation to digestion, to respond to changes in resource availability and maintain physiological integrity. Well-adapted energy metabolisms must then both be able to conserve reserves and deliver enormous energetic power outputs in an efficient and effective manner. However, few animal models currently allow us to follow energy from intake to delivery of energetic currency to fuel metabolism, and finally to the countermeasures taken to slow down energetic expenditure when it is not needed. Furthermore, accumulating evidence shows that data collected in laboratory settings may not reflect the full range of strategies animals employ to deal with this energetic dilemma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bishop et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bowlin et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Calisi and Bentley, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Geiser et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Ward et al., 2002</xref>). This makes quantitative data from naturally behaving animals in the wild even more important to test the balance and integration of physiological adaptations to energetic limitations.</p><p>Flying vertebrates are an excellent example of this balance. While flight is one of the most efficient modes of locomotion per unit distance traveled, it is costlier per unit time than any other mode of locomotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Norberg, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Schmidt-Nielsen, 1979</xref>). To fulfill the exceptional demands of powered flight, both birds and bats have undergone dramatic physiological reorganization that emphasizes the need to supply fuel to large flight muscles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Maina, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Norberg, 1990</xref>). Bat flight in particular is an extreme case of vertebrate locomotor energetics. In comparison to those of non-flying mammals of comparable size, hearts and lungs of bats are larger and have higher blood oxygen transport potential, delivering more oxygen per heart beat than non-flying terrestrial mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Neuweiler, 2000</xref>). Bats use some of the highest mass-specific metabolic rates during flight; 3–5 times greater than any other mammals and maximum increases of 15–16 times minimum resting metabolic rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Speakman and Thomas, 2003</xref>). This may place bats at their energetic ceiling, and integrated physiological networks that allow them to maintain high metabolic rates at or near their limits over extended periods of time may be under equally strong selection to reduce resting energetic expenditure below what is commonly found in mammals.</p><p>Bats launch themselves directly into energy-demanding flight at the onset of their activity period and on an empty stomach, fueling flight by limited fat reserves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Voigt et al., 2010</xref>). They must then efficiently find and ingest food, and make energy available to their metabolism rapidly, as high metabolic rates and small body size place them at risk of starvation if sufficient food is not found. This risk is enhanced in the many species that specialize on ephemeral food sources. One strategy to cope with this energetic vulnerability is through daily reduction of metabolic rate (torpor) found in small-bodied bat species especially from the temperate zone. By entering a distinct low-energy state characterized by low body temperature, some bats reduce metabolic rates by 99% during torpor when ambient temperatures are lower than their thermoneutral zone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Geiser and Stawski, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ruf and Geiser, 2015</xref>). In tropical and sub-tropical regions where ambient temperatures are high, it may be impossible to lower body temperature beyond these critical minimum temperatures to save energy, therefore reductions in heart rate may reflect reductions in cellular respiration rates and gene expression in multiple pathways and be an effective measure of energetic conservation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dechmann et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dzal et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">McNab, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Storey and Storey, 2004</xref>). This may be particularly important in those that feed on sugar dense foods as they are at the highest risk of starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">McNab, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Voigt and Speakman, 2007</xref>).</p><p>Heart rate has a quadratic relationship with metabolic oxygen consumption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bishop and Spivey, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Grubb, 1982</xref>), and by measuring it directly it is possible to gain insight into energetic expenditure at high temporal resolution. Heart rates in bats may more than double in the transition from rest to flight, reflecting enormous flight power requirements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Thomas, 1975</xref>). Controlled experiments in wind tunnels and laboratory conditions have yielded incredible insight into the regulation of metabolism and energy consumption across a wide variety of activities and physiological states. However, heart rates of exercising animals in nature are unpredictable and metabolic rates measured during wind tunnel flight may not indicate the full scope of natural behavior. In a tropical insectivorous bat, heart rate increases from 129 bpm in the roost to 847 bpm during flight, a six-fold increase that is larger than predicted from other captive bats in wind tunnels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dechmann et al., 2011</xref>). Alternatively, heart rates of free-flying animals may be much lower than expected. For example, bar-headed geese traverse the Himalayas with heart rates of 250–475 bpm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bishop et al., 2015</xref>), 20% lower than what is expected from captive measures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Ward et al., 2002</xref>), and during migration, heart rates in Swainson’s thrushes are 10% lower than comparable long flights in wind tunnels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bowlin et al., 2005</xref>). This indicates that sustainable metabolic rates possible during exercise may differ greatly from maximal rates or extrapolations in captive studies and we have only been able to get an initial glimpse into the heart rates used by flying bats.</p><p>Once they begin to feed, bats fuel their enormous demand for power by directly and rapidly metabolizing ingested food, but this can lead to high risk of starvation via rapid fat turnover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Caviedes-Vidal et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Voigt and Speakman, 2007</xref>). One mechanism that may help animals to adjust the timing and intensity of shifts in metabolic scopes are glucocorticoids. They are key integrators between the environment and energy balance that ensure rapid response to changes in energetic needs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cohen et al., 2012</xref>). Elevated levels of glucocorticoid hormones in blood plasma suppress glycogen formation and promote gluconeogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Haase et al., 2016</xref>), fat oxidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brillon et al., 1995</xref>), and play a primary role in energy balance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nieuwenhuizen and Rutters, 2008</xref>). Most bats that have been studied show high baseline glucocorticoid concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Reeder et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">2006</xref>), which indicates that they are in a ready state to rapidly mobilize glucose and glycogen reserves. By manipulating circulating levels of glucocorticoids or those tied to binding globulin, individual use of energy reserves can be modulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Schneider, 2004</xref>).</p><p>Bats are then faced with an energetic dilemma where they must rapidly power flight, but quickly switch to conserving energetic stores gained during foraging. To better understand the interplay of energy expenditure and conservation, we describe the daily energetic life of Peters’ tent-making bat (<italic>Uroderma bilobatum</italic>, family Phyllostomidae) in Gamboa, Panamá. These bats are central-place foragers that leave a stable roost location to feed primarily on juice extracted from ripe figs (<italic>Ficus</italic> spp). We hypothesized that they would not use torpor during their regular daily life and that their energy intake and turnover rates would be high. Daily energy intake and expenditure should then be closely matched, resulting in a specialized life-style at the energetic edge. Testing our hypotheses was made possible by newly miniaturized heart rate transmitters to describe both the activity patterns of the species and their instantaneous energetic expenditure throughout the day, including the first flying heart rates of free-ranging individuals. We also tested how these bats fuel their metabolism through measurement of metabolic incorporation rates and fat turnover from stable isotope ratios in their breath in short-term captivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Voigt and Speakman, 2007</xref>). In combination with an estimate of energy mobilization potential via elevated circulating cortisol, this allows us a more complete view into how these small-bodied, high-metabolic frugivores meet daily energetic demands.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Activity patterns</title><p>We tracked the heart rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) of four bats for 13.6 ± 4.9 hr (mean ± SD) each day for two to four days (13 days total). This included 4.03 ± 0.05 hr of activity outside of the roost at night and the approximately 12 hr that bats spend in their roost during the day for 350 hr of total recording time. All bats left their roosts between 18:00 – 18:30 and flew three to seven minutes to their initial foraging sites. Bats executed multiple short flights of 1–2 min each (mean ± SD: 1 ± 1.5 min) that were consistent with flying to a fruiting tree, selecting a fruit, and carrying it to a separate feeding perch. During our tracking, flight accounted for 13 ± 6% (30.6 ± 15.6 min) of the time outside of the roost. We were able to locate several food trees, all of which were <italic>Ficus insipida</italic>, but all bats also fed for short periods across the Panama Canal at sites inaccessible during tracking. Bats returned to their day roosts between 22:30 – 06:00. When bats returned early in the night, they left for an additional one to two hours later in the morning. The minimum time that we tracked a bat foraging, including short bouts away from the roosts was two hours and the maximum total time outside of the roost was 10 hr. All bats returned to their home roost each night where they remained for the rest of the day.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Field metabolic rates and cyclic bradycardia</title><p> <italic>Uroderma bilobatum</italic> used a large range in heart rates (f<sub>H</sub>) across the day, ranging from 173 to 1066 bpm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).

As hypothesized, we found that heart rate derived energy expenditure of <italic>U. bilobatum</italic> during flight is high and this is achieved through rapid incorporation of ingested food into their metabolism. We found flying heart rates that were 4–5 times higher than resting rates during the day and twice the heart rates of bats roosting at night. These bats replace nearly half of their fat reserves within a single day, resulting in short potential starvation times. <italic>Uroderma bilobatum</italic> counter this high energetic expenditure by spending relatively little time in flight and they have exceptionally low circulating cortisol values at rest during the day. These low basal values promote conservation of glucose reserves, but can be elevated up to 15 times, at least in response to stress, and could be used to generate the high metabolic power needed for flight. Most surprising, we found that by cyclically lowering heart rates during the day, they save 10% of their energy budget. This cyclic bradycardia is a novel strategy that minimizes energetic expenditure at relatively high ambient temperatures and allows <italic>U. bilobatum</italic> to maintain a FMR expected for their size. Only by completely sampling these high-resolution data from naturally behaving bats were we able to detect these lowered heart rates and quantify their effect on bat energetic strategies.</p><p>Using the energetic expenditure derived from median heart rates of resting bats in their natural roosts during the day (0.54 kJ h<sup>−1</sup> or 0.27 W) we can estimate a RMR of 13.0 kJ day<sup>−1</sup>, which closely approximates previous measures of BMR (12.8 kJ day<sup>−1</sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">McNab, 1969</xref>]). After commuting to the foraging patch, figs are collected during short flights of 1–2 mins and most of the remaining time is spent more or less at rest in their night feeding roosts resulting in only 30 mins per night in actual flight. Although this may differ among sites or during periods of less favorable food availability, this perch-resting with short fruit collection flights is an important part of their energy saving strategy. The subsequently low heart rates and activity patterns estimate an estimated FMR of ca. 46 kJ day<sup>−1</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bishop and Spivey, 2013</xref>), which is within the general predictions for FMR based on body mass from a broad taxonomic sampling of studies using doubly-labeled water (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Speakman, 2005</xref>). While energetic expenditure met estimates for 16–19 g bats, this was only possible due to <italic>U. bilobatum</italic> restriction of total active flying time to less than about two hours per night (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) and the cyclic suppression of heart rates while resting during the day.</p><p>The cyclic bradycardia during daytime rest in our study is unprecedented. It is possible that these cycles are linked to REM and pre-REM sleep, but when humans and cats sleep their heart rate slows immediately prior to the elevation of heart rates during REM cycles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Taylor et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Verrier et al., 1998</xref>). In both taxa the change in heart rate lasts only seconds and amounts to a total change of 3–5% from the resting heart rate as compared to the minutes-long 30% reduction in <italic>U. bilboatum</italic>. A reversed pattern in heart rate is found in hibernating ground squirrels that show irregular heart rates that speed up for 30–50 s before slowing again to a steady rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Milsom et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Milsom et al., 1999</xref>). The regular occurrence of this cyclic bradycardia suggests that it is a standard and regular aspect of the way that <italic>U. bilobatum</italic> rests and is likely a further extension of the energy conservation of sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Benington and Heller, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kilduff et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Schmidt, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Walker et al., 1979</xref>). Bradycardia is common aspect of the dive response where diving mammals slow their heart rates to conserve oxygen when submerged for long periods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Noren et al., 2012</xref>). Mammals in torpor are also bradycardic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Currie et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dechmann et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Elvert and Heldmaier, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Heldmaier et al., 2004</xref>), but the cyclic and varying nature of the heart rate depressions we find in <italic>U. bilobatum</italic> are not characteristic of any of these physiological states. Animals enter torpor and hibernation through controlled reductions of heart rate via increased inter-beat interval and skipped beats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Elvert and Heldmaier, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Milsom et al., 1999</xref>). It may be that the slowed heart rates in <italic>U. bilobatum</italic> reflect the initial descent into short and shallow torpor events with a decrease in heart rate preceding the shift to torpor. Further investigation into the nervous control of bradycardic states in <italic>U. bilobatum</italic> would clarify both how these reductions are executed and any similarity to a sleep-torpor transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Milsom et al., 1999</xref>).</p><p>Thus far, bats and hummingbirds in torpor and at rest have showed low and constant heart rates without any indication of the cycling we observe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Currie et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dechmann et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Schaub and Prinzinger, 1999</xref>). Species that are capable of daily torpor generally lower their body temperatures to maximize energetic savings, particularly when exposed to cold temperatures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ruf and Geiser, 2015</xref>), and this commonly occurs in tropical and sub-tropical mammals at temperatures below 24°C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Canale et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Geiser and Stawski, 2011</xref>). However, a similar torpor response is not possible for the tropical <italic>U. bilobatum</italic>. Instead, they actively defend their body temperatures when exposed to cold, and more than triple metabolic rates to maintain a body temperature of 36<bold>°</bold>C at ambient temperatures of 10<bold>°</bold>C vs 30<bold>°</bold>C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">McNab, 1969</xref>). In our respirometry calibrations, <italic>U. bilobatum</italic> maintained a constant body temperature around 37°C across the measured range of heart rates of 300–800 bpm. In fact, they may alter heart rate dynamics independently of body temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Tøien et al., 2011</xref>). The low heart rates we observed are similar to the minimum resting heart rates of small bats (i.e., 200–400 bpm) in thermonetural conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Currie et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kulzer, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Leitner, 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Leitner and Nelson, 1967</xref>).

It is unclear if the frequency and intensity of the cycling we observed are in response to ecological and energetic interactions, such as lowered foraging success, that decouples resting metabolic rates from overall FMR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nilsson, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Welcker et al., 2015</xref>). Decoupling resting metabolic rates from total energetic expenditure is hypothesized to be found in animals that live near their energetic ceilings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Welcker et al., 2015</xref>) with high metabolic rates, like <italic>U. bilobatum</italic>. We found the number of cycles per hour varied both within and among individuals, but we do not yet have enough information on the relationship between total nightly energy expenditure, energy intake, and the lowering of heart rates. However, it is unclear why these bats move between two apparently stable low energy states at rest. Further investigation into the potential relationship between this heart rate change and more commonly perceived torpor states would help understand energetic adaptations in tropical environments.</p><p>There are relatively few data on the heart rates of free-flying animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Green, 2011</xref>) all of which are larger than <italic>U. bilobatum</italic>. Furthermore, accurately estimating energy consumption during flight under controlled conditions has often been unpractical or impossible due to the conditions needed in wind tunnels and mask respirometry. Our bats' heart rates and metabolic power are surprisingly low and variable when compared to flight tunnel studies. The heart rate derived estimate for cost of flight in <italic>U. bilobatum</italic> (1.36 ± 0.23 W, range 0.98–2.3 W) was slightly lower than mass loss estimates for bats of similar sizes and wing shapes (1.96–2.45 W: (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">von Busse et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Winter and von Helversen, 1998</xref>). However, <italic>U. bilobatum</italic> show a mass specific power of 76 W kg<sup>−1</sup> with a maximum output of 145 W kg<sup>−1</sup>, which is within the power requirements of bats that are up to 44 times larger (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Carpenter, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Thomas, 1975</xref>). While our estimates of energy consumption were not directly calibrated with flying bats, they provide the best potential estimates available based on broad patterns of the relationships among heart rate, stroke volume, and oxygen consumption during exercise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bishop and Spivey, 2013</xref>), and must be interpreted with some caution. The large changes in heart rate among activity states remain lower than would be expected based on body size and reinforce the emerging pattern of lower energy consumption by free-flying animals versus those in controlled laboratory conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bishop et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bowlin et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Ward et al., 2002</xref>). Metabolic power of bat flight may be difficult to predict as a function of body size, but more likely the context in which the animals fly plays a strong role in determining the energy used. Laboratory experiments have been our best window into animals' physiological possibilities, but it is increasingly important to study energetics in relevant ecological settings to understand how these physiological mechanisms evolve.</p><p>The ability to rapidly fuel metabolism through ingested food seems to be a common adaptation among hummingbirds and bats with diets of simple carbohydrates and the fastest incorporation rates measured for vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Welch et al., 2016</xref>). Nectarivorous hummingbirds (3–5 g) and bats (10 g) fuel 50% of their metabolism within 3–9 min of feeding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Suarez et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Voigt and Speakman, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Welch et al., 2008</xref>). At three times their body size, <italic>U. bilobatum</italic> shows similar fractional incorporation rates. In contrast, other fruit-eating bats use incorporation rates of 10–12 min regardless of body size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amitai et al., 2010</xref>). These comparative data indicate strong pressure on all flying frugivores, regardless of size, to mobilize ingested food to power flight and this is mediated through paracellular absorption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Caviedes-Vidal et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Price et al., 2014</xref>). While initiating flight on stored energy, <italic>U. bilobatum</italic> and other sugar-focused bats rely heavily on ingested carbohydrates to supplement rapidly depleted glycogen at the onset of flight, further taxing the sugar oxidation cascade to push energy to muscle as quickly as possible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Suarez et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Welch et al., 2016</xref>). Frugivorous bats deplete the large glycogen stores in their liver within 24 hr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Pinheiro et al., 2006</xref>). Our fat turnover experiments also showed that half of fat and sugar storage is mobilized within a single day. Specialization on foods rich in simple but rapidly incorporated carbohydrates seems to come with high risks that necessitate additional physiological and behavioral strategies to ensure energetic stability.</p><p><italic>Uroderma bilobatum</italic> further control energetic incorporation and conservation by maintaining exceptionally low baseline cortisol levels that then are elevated to some of the highest recorded naturally induced values for mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sapolsky et al., 2000</xref>). Basal glucocorticoid values of other bat species are especially high for mammals of their size (100–800 ng ml<sup>−1</sup>; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Reeder et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">2006</xref>) and show large potential maximal output when challenged with ACTH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lewanzik et al., 2012</xref>). However, the difference between baseline and restraint-induced circulating cortisol especially in female <italic>U. bilobatum</italic> is more similar to the extremes found in lemmings (<italic>Lemmus trimucronatus</italic>) that seasonally elevate their baseline corticosterone values by 10–80 times to concentrations of over 4000 ng ml<sup>−1</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Romero et al., 2008</xref>) or in flying squirrels (<italic>Glaucomys sp)</italic> that elevate cortisol values 38–40% above already high baseline values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Desantis et al., 2016</xref>). The low baselines we found may be a consequence of capturing resting or sleeping animals in their day roosts at least 4 hr after sunrise when circulating glucocorticoids were at their lowest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sapolsky et al., 2000</xref>). However, this cannot explain peak values 1.5x greater than those observed in other mammals. We suggest that rapid increases in circulating cortisol levels during the acute stress response act in concert to mobilize energy stores, but more importantly, by suppressing glucocorticoid secretion during rest these bats are able to further minimize energetic expenditure and lower their metabolic rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Haase et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nieuwenhuizen and Rutters, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Palme et al., 2005</xref>) and minimize additional fat oxidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brillon et al., 1995</xref>).</p><p>Unpredictable fruit availability can have dramatic effects on survival and some bats, including <italic>U. bilobatum</italic> take advantage of their roosts to leverage social information and identify newly available food items (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">O'Mara et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ramakers et al., 2016</xref>). Furthermore, the potential for rapid declines in food availability has likely shaped conservative physiological strategies in these bats to minimize energy expenditure while allowing for rapid resource mobilization needed for powered flight. These dynamic energetic strategies likely contribute to the success and diversity of the over 1300 bat species throughout the world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Simmons, 2005</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>All methods were approved by the Autoridad Nacional del Ambiente, Panama (SE/A-88–13; SE/AP-12–14; SE/A-73–14) and by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute (2012-060-2015; 2014-0701-2017).

We trimmed the dorsal fur below the shoulder blades. A topical analgesic was then applied (Xylocaine gel, Astra Zeneca, Wedel Germany) and after disinfecting the electrodes and back of the bats with 70% EtOH, the transmitter’s two copper plated gold electrodes were inserted ca. 3 mm through a puncture made with a 23 G sterile needle. The transmitters were mounted on thin, flexible cloth and glued over the electrode insertion points using a silicone-based skin adhesive (Sauer Hautkleber, Manfred Sauer, Germany). The electrodes are flexible and do not appear to disturb the animals, and we expect superficial healing of the small punctures within one hour. While behavioral responses may not directly reflect physiological stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ditmer et al., 2015</xref>), our radio tracking data show typical behavior for this species, and both the large variation and temporal consistent heart rate data we collect do not indicate that bats are either under excessive stress or that habituation was needed to accommodate the added load of the transmitter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">O'Mara et al., 2014b</xref>).

This was then recorded via mini-dv output to a wave file (44.1–48 kHz) on a digital recorder (Tascam DR-05). Receivers were placed under roosts to record f<sub>H</sub> during the full inactive cycle during daylight hours. One to two people then followed the bats at emergence (ca 18:00) for 4–8 hr during the night’s activity and continuously recorded estimated activity (flight, inactivity, grooming) via fluctuations in the amplitude of the transmitted signal. Transmitter signal could be detected within 70–100 meters in the forest and up to a kilometer over open space (the Panama Canal). This gave us 18–20 hr of heart rate recordings per individual per day for a total of 350 hr. Daytime mean ambient temperature was 25.87 ± 1.21°C (mean daytime minimum to mean maximum: 23.38–28.24), and mean nightly ambient temperature was 23.74 ± 0.50°C (mean nightly minimum to mean maximum: 22.74–24.78°C). Ambient temperature was recorded by the Autoridad del Canal de Panamá for Gamboa and provided by the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute’s Physical Monitoring Program.</p><p>Heart rate from radio transmitters was scored previously by visually measuring the interval needed to encompass 5–10 heart beats at sampling intervals of 0.5–10 min apart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barske et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bowlin et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dechmann et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sapir et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Steiger et al., 2009</xref>). We fully sampled the recorded data using an automated approach in R 3.2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Core Team, 2016</xref>) to identify and count all heartbeats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). We used a finite impulse response filter in <italic>seewave</italic> with a window length of 1500–2000 samples to select the carrier frequency of the transmitter. We counted individual heartbeats by applying a timer function in <italic>seewave</italic> that ran over non-overlapping windows of 500 samples. This created a resolution of 88–98 sampling windows per second. We then applied a kernel density filter in <italic>KernSmooth</italic> to further eliminate noise that was outside of the 90% quantile. This approach is conservative in that it may have eliminated some heart rate outliers, but the autocorrelated nature of heart rate allowed us to filter out errors likely induced by static or other interference in the recordings. Automated samples were inspected periodically to validate the filtering method, particularly in periods with high variation.</p><p>We then estimated total energy consumption in two ways.

While we attempted to get a range of f<sub>H</sub> within the respirometry chamber, we could not attain the high heart rates typical of <italic>U. bilobatum</italic> during flight or the very low f<sub>H</sub> we observed during day rest. Furthermore, high f<sub>H</sub> of animals due to factors other than exercise, such as our respirometry chamber, may under-estimate energy consumption caused by changes in stroke volume and oxygen extraction efficiency during exercise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bishop and Spivey, 2013</xref>). However, we can use the relationship between heart mass (M<sub>h,</sub> a proxy for stroke volume), and body mass (M<sub>b</sub>) to model oxygen consumption as function of f<sub>H</sub> as <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf8"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mover><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">V</mml:mi><mml:mo>˙</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>O<sub>2</sub> = 0.0402 M<sub>b</sub><sup>0.328±0.05</sup>M<sub>h</sub><sup>0.913±0.045</sup>f<sub>h</sub><sup>2.065±0.03</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bishop and Spivey, 2013</xref>).

Bats were captured from their day roosts and housed individually in mesh-lined cages. At time zero, bats were removed from their cage and immobilized by gently wrapping them in cotton gauze, excluding their heads and feet. They were then placed into a 6 × 6 × 4 cm plastic container with an 18 G needle hermetically attached. After sealing the container, ambient air was washed of CO<sub>2</sub> using NaOH and flushed through the plastic container at a flow rate of 700 mL min<sup>−1</sup>. The flushing gas exited the container through the attached needle. The pump was turned off 2 min prior to collection to allow breath to accumulate in the plastic box. To collect accumulated CO<sub>2</sub> we pierced the teflon membrane of an exetainer (LabCo Exetainer Buckinghamshire, UK) with the needle tip attached to the plastic container. This vacuumed approximately 4.5 ml of headspace into the vacutainer.</p><p>After the initial sample collection (time 0), bats were removed from the container and fed either freshly-collected <italic>Ficus insipida</italic>, or approximately 1.5 ml of a solution of 20% (w/w) agave nectar (Organic Blue Agave Nectar, Wholesome Sweeteners, Sugar Land Texas, USA), 2% (w/w) Nutri-Cal (Vétoquinol Prolab Inc, Princeville, Québec, Canada) and water using a transfer pipette. Breath samples were collected at 0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 60, and 90 min after the initial feeding. Bats fed figs (n = 6) were placed back in their home cage and allowed to feed <italic>ad libitum</italic> after sample collection at 40 mins and 60 mins. Bats fed agave nectar (n = 8) were fed an additional 0.5 ml of the agave nectar solution after sample collection at 30 and 60 min to ensure that the bats’ breath was equilibrated isotopically with the new diet. Additional samples at 50 and 70 mins post initial feeding were collected during the agave feeding experiments.

Bats were offered agave nectar and water <italic>ad libitum</italic> and were also fed by hand every 3 hr to ensure that they were feeding consistently. Food was removed during the day and bats were fasted for at least 10 hr prior to sample collection. At the beginning of each night were removed from their holding cages to collect a single breath sample as in the previous experiment to measure their baseline δ<sup>13</sup>C. Following breath collection, bats were fed with the agave nectar solution and returned to their holding cages. Body mass and body condition were monitored throughout the experiment to ensure animal optimum health, and one animal was released after night 2 because of weight loss.</p><p>Breath samples were then shipped to the stable isotope laboratory of the Leibniz Institute for Zoo and Wildlife Research where δ<sup>13</sup>CO<sub>2</sub> was analyzed in a blind protocol using a GasBench (Thermo Scientific, Bremen Germany) connected to a stable isotope ratio mass spectrometer (Delta V Advantage Thermo Scientific, Bremen Germany). Samples were analyzed together with a laboratory standard gas that was previously calibrated with the international <sup>13</sup>C reference materials NBS 19 and L-SVEC. Ratios of <sup>13</sup>C and <sup>12</sup>C were expressed relative to the international standard (Vienna-PeeDee Belemnite) using the δ notation in parts per mill (‰): δ<sup>13</sup>C<sub>V-PDB</sub> = <italic>R</italic><sub>sample</sub>/<italic>R</italic><sub>standard</sub>-1) x 10<sup>3</sup> where <italic>R</italic><sub>sample</sub>/<italic>R</italic><sub>standard</sub> is the ratio of heavy and light carbon isotopes (<sup>13</sup>C/<sup>12</sup>C) in the sample and the standard. Precision was always better than ±0.06‰ (1 SD). To measure the isotopic composition of the agave nectar solution a sample was dried in a drying oven until constant mass and 3 subsamples were then separated, weighed, and loaded in a tin capsule. Samples were analysed together with laboratory standards of known stable carbon isotope ratios using an elemental analyser (Flash elemental analyser, Thermo Scientific, Bremen, Germany) connected in continuous mode via a Conflo III to a stable isotope mass spectrometer (Delta V Advantage; Thermo Scientific, Bremen, Germany). Samples were combusted under chemically pure helium gas in the analyser and resulting gases were then routed to the IRMS for the analysis of stable carbon isotope ratios. The analytical precision was always better than 0.13 per mille (one standard deviation).</p><p>We estimated the fractional rate of isotopic incorporation (k) using a one-pool model for each individual bat as δ<sup>13</sup>C<sub>breath</sub> (<italic>t</italic>) = δ<sup>13</sup>C<sub>breath</sub>(∞) + [δ<sup>13</sup>C<sub>breath</sub>(0) – δ<sup>13</sup>C<sub>breath</sub> (∞)] e<sup>-kt</sup>; where δ<sup>13</sup>C<sub>breath</sub> (<italic>t</italic>) is the isotope composition, δ<sup>13</sup>C<sub>breath</sub> (∞) is the asymptotic equilibrium isotope composition, and k is the fractional rate of isotope incorporation. The time at which 50% of carbon isotopes are exchanged in the animal’s breath is calculated as t<sub>50</sub>=-ln(0.5)/k. The reciprocal of the fractional incorporation rate (k<sup>−1</sup>) estimates the average residence time of a carbon atom in fat reserves. We used a one-compartment model as this typically reflects isotopic incorporation into breath better than models with more complicated dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Martínez Del Rio and Anderson-Sprecher, 2008</xref>).

Baseline cortisol samples were collected by puncturing the antebrachial or cephalic vessels with a sterile 23 G needle and collecting ca. 70 uL of blood in heparin-coated hematocrit tubes. Blood samples were collected within 3 min of capture and placed on ice. Bats were placed in a soft cloth bag for 60 min and then a second blood sample of equal volume was collected.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors and the evaluation has been overseen by the Reviewing Editor and Ian Baldwin as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal his identity: Fritz Geiser (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission. Whereas we realize the number of essential revisions is rather extensive in this particular case, we believe that rewriting this manuscript such that it is more rigorous is entirely feasible based on the excellent style of the submitted manuscript. In general, we are mostly concerned with overstatements and a lack of essential information needed to place the findings in context; we do not question your key field observations.</p><p>Please comply to your best ability to the comments and provide point-by-point responses indicating at the start of every response if you comply, explain, or respectfully disagree.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The manuscript by O'Mara et al., reports the discovery of a new cyclic bradycardic state in tropical fruit bats that saves energy by reducing the heart rate to extremely low values for a series of short moments during day rest. This is a unique and exciting find that advances our understanding of the mammalian cardiovascular system and metabolism. The technical accomplishment of measuring heart rate in freely flying individuals over several days in their natural habitat is impressive. Overall the use of heart rate as a measure of energy expenditure in small free-ranging mammals is commendable, the study was well constructed and the manuscript well written. The findings will be of interest to physiologists, ecologists, comparative biomechanists and organismal biologists in general.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Overall, we believe that the manuscript needs some careful reorganization to ensure scientific rigor: That the discussion and conclusions are placed within the context of the studies limitations.</p><p>Please discuss how estimates of energy expenditure and energy savings are extrapolations from a small sample of HR and MR under limited conditions and a single activity state. Further, the initial calibrations of HR against MR seem limited in that they were only conducted over a short time frame (3hrs) and at a single high ambient temperature very close to the thermoneutral zone. This gives a likelihood that animals with high HR (around 800bpm may have been exhibiting stress associated with the respirometry procedure, which can impact the derived regression equation as stress response alters blood pressure and cardiac output and is not indicative of true resting conditions.</p><p>While we agree that these short bouts of bradycardia are unlikely to be representative of torpor. We note that even small reductions in Tb can be reflected in reductions in HR and energy savings. Especially, because at rest many tropical and subtropical bats can reduce their body temperature by up to 6 degrees.</p><p>We appreciate the authors may make inferences of the costs of flight based on their resting calibration, however, these extrapolations may be inaccurate and this should be discussed appropriately. Alternatively, the paragraph in the discussion about flight costs (in the Discussion section) could simply be removed altogether without detracting from the findings improving the overall rigor of the manuscript.</p><p>To assist the reader please clarify how the regression calculations were conducted. How long were the HR values averaged with VO2? What time of day were the animals placed in the respirometry chamber? And were issues of autocorrelation and repeated measures addressed in the calculation of the regression equation?</p><p>Please further clarify the method by which HR was analyzed so the reader does not need to find and read the Cochran and Wikelski, 2005 reference but can simply fully rely on the Materials and methods section of the present manuscript to appreciate both its strengths and limitations.</p><p>Please clarify how many male and female bats were sampled for circulating cortisol, reading the manuscript we were confused by the different statements.</p><p>Title: An explosive metabolism would interfere with survival of the organisms. Another adjective may be more appropriate.</p><p>Bat stress related comments:</p><p>Based on the Introduction we wondered how well the bats function with the backpack after the surgical procedure. This also holds for the discussion in the Introduction and Discussion section &quot;truly evolve&quot; (too strong wording). Both the previous wind tunnel and invasive field experiments performed here are stressful to the animals unless habituation and positive reinforcement training have been implemented with all stressors removed. Only non-invasive non-stress experiments may possibly give this insight.</p><p>Reading the Materials and methods the 23ga needle is rather large, the metabolism of the bats is high, how quickly are they expected to heal up compared to the duration of the experiment? Please discuss this in the Materials and methods.</p><p>The Materials and methods states the backpack weighs 0.8 gram, which seems a high percentage of body weight. Heavy backpacks are a continues stressor of an animal with a high metabolic rate close to starvation. Please give the percentage backpack weight versus body weight and discuss it in the context of bat and bird experiments in which the effect of backpacks on stress, metabolics and general energetics have been studied. Please integrate this in the discussion if the backpack weighs more than 5% (limit for bird studies without recapture) bodyweight, otherwise integration in the Materials and methods section is sufficient.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>; there appears to be a data gap beyond 22:00 hours, please explain and discuss. Panel B also appears to overlap with the data of panel A causing another gap, or there is another gap. Please plot the entire data of panel A without gaps from 0-24hrs if possible, otherwise indicate gaps using a gray area / bar with the explanation of why gaps exist.</p><p>Materials and Methods: What is the body mass and sample size of the bats? Sample sizes also need to be integrated into the Results section. Also include the average mass and std when discussing backpack mass in the Materials and methods and discuss the size of the backpack with respect to the size measure of the bat.</p><p>Table 1: include the mass and a measure of size of the individuals.</p><p>Abstract: Clearly much more than the cardiovascular system is involved here, for example digestion among other functions will be crucial in all this.</p><p>Introduction: Statement on homeostasis. There are other approaches than simply maintaining homeostasis in animal physiology.</p><p>Introduction:. …15-16 times 'of' minimum metabolic rates. Is this in comparison to BMR? If so, state. BTW some small bats at rest and without flight can do 300-400 times of the minimum metabolic rate during torpor.</p><p>Introduction: It is more complex than just lowering heart rate and body temperature and bats can reduce metabolic rate during torpor by up to 99% even when compared to BMR and more when compared to RMR at low ambient temperatures. Rephrase.</p><p>Introduction: There are published data on reduction of metabolism by 50% within the TNZ. Moreover, tropical bats are not always in thermo-neutrality, see the above reference. The sentence also does not make sense as written because they should be able to lower body temperature outside of thermo-neutral conditions. And reductions in heart rates will not only reduce metabolism. Rephrase.</p><p>Introduction: quadratic?</p><p>Introduction: Here it appears that all of the energy comes from food, further down stores of glycogen are needed. See also your results. Rephrase.</p><p>Introduction: By manipulating circulating levels of what?</p><p>Introduction: Define 'central-place forager'</p><p>Introduction: The reference in the Indroduction lists a number of phyllostomids using torpor (some described by McNab from lab studies as homeothermic) and also other nectarivorous/frugivorous bat.</p><p>Introduction: How would not using torpor result in a high metabolic scope -- should it not be the opposite?</p><p>Introduction: Further up it is argued that lab work is no good, now lab work is used. An explanation as to why this needs to be done in the laboratory would help.</p><p>Results: Large range in heart rates.

Further, the initial calibrations of HR against MR seem limited in that they were only conducted over a short time frame (3hrs) and at a single high ambient temperature very close to the thermoneutral zone. This gives a likelihood that animals with high HR (around 800bpm may have been exhibiting stress associated with the respirometry procedure, which can impact the derived regression equation as stress response alters blood pressure and cardiac output and is not indicative of true resting conditions.</p> </disp-quote><p>This is an excellent point, and one we have attempted to circumvent using the allometric relationships based on heart and body mass developed by Bishop &amp; Spivey (2013). Under stress conditions, it is unclear what the relationship between heart rate and oxygen consumption truly is. First, as a semantic distinction it is unclear why the reviewers assume that only high heart rates are indicative of stress. In our experience with frugivorous phyllostomids, such as <italic>Uroderma bilobatum</italic>, the most dangerous and stressful situations are when these animals enter low energy states, reduce T<sub>b</sub> and f<sub>H</sub>. While rare, in these stress-induced states, animals are unlikely to recover. Furthermore, high stress can induce torpor conditions in many, including tropical, bat species (e.g., Molossidae). The physiological adjustments animals make to increase blood pressure, mobilize glucose reserves, and hyperventilate, to name only a few, all could yield contradictory energetic results. Furthermore, increased heart rate in these conditions may not have the full cardiac expansion and contraction of exercising heart rates.</p><p>One point of confusion that we would like to highlight is how we extrapolated field metabolic rates from the heart rate data. There has been quite a bit of discussion in the literature about the applicability and limitations of respirometry-based calibration of f<sub>H</sub> since most animals in these situations are not capable of exercising. Therefore, the calibrations of f<sub>H</sub> that we, and many others have used, fail to include exercise values of animals engaging in their typical modes of locomotion. The allometric equations developed by Bishop and Spivey, (2013) are a breakthrough in overcoming this limitation. Instead of the resting-state calibrations we conducted, we instead apply Bishop and Spivey's relationships using body mass and heart mass of our bats. This was noted in the original submission in subsection “Heart rate telemetry and estimated field energy expenditure”, but it was not made clear that this is the fundamental relationship that defined the energetic expenditure of our field study. This has been applied to studies on bar-headed geese (Bishop et al., 2015, Science doi: 10.1126/science.1258732; Hawkes et al., 2014, PloS one doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0094015), great frigate birds (Wiemerskirch et al., 2016; Science doi: 10.1126/science.aaf4374), and golden-collared manakins (Barske et al., 2014, Proc R Soc B doi: 10.1098/rspb.2013.2482) We have clarified this in the Materials and methods, the Introduction, and in the Results.</p><p>Resting calibrations of animals in respirometry have been widely applied using the heart rate methods, and likely over-estimate energy consumption at the low ends of the calibration values, and more importantly dramatically under-estimate energy consumption at high heart rates. Bishop and Spivey, (2013) highlights the work by Dechmann and colleagues (2011) and the implausibly low field metabolic rates due to underestimates of flying energy consumptions via exercise restricted heart rate / metabolic rate calibrations. Outside of Bishop and Spivey’s particularly thorough work, the quadratic relationship driving this is nicely shown by Ward et al., (2002) and the differences in metabolic rates of geese under their primary and non-primary modes of exercise locomotion. There are few data from flying vertebrates that have captured this so completely.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"> <p>While we agree that these short bouts of bradycardia are unlikely to be representative of torpor. We note that even small reductions in Tb can be reflected in reductions in HR and energy savings. Especially, because at rest many tropical and subtropical bats can reduce their body temperature by up to 6 degrees.</p> </disp-quote><p>The use of torpor and heterothermy by tropical and subtropical bats when ambient temperature drops below 24°C is an important detail and we have noted this in the Discussion section. In other work, we have even found that a free-tailed bat species in Panama is capable of reducing energetic expenditure to values lower than the minimal torpor metabolic rates of many sub-tropical and temperate zone mammals, but at body temperatures greater than 32°C, largely by lowering heart rate independently of lowered body temperatures (O’Mara et al., in review, Proc R Soc B). We also note in this paragraph that at least in previous work with captive animals by McNab, <italic>U. bilobatum</italic> actively defends body temperatures and will not undergo heterothermy. It would have been ideal if we were able to also simultaneously measure body temperature of free-ranging bats, but their roosts would not accommodate the PIT tag antenna.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"> <p>We appreciate the authors may make inferences of the costs of flight based on their resting calibration, however, these extrapolations may be inaccurate and this should be discussed appropriately. Alternatively, the paragraph in the discussion about flight costs (in the Discussion) could simply be removed altogether without detracting from the findings improving the overall rigor of the manuscript.</p> </disp-quote><p>Flight is obviously the most energetically demanding aspect of a bat’s daily life, and with so few data from free-flying animals we feel that discussing this is worthwhile. We have added a qualifying statement of the difficulty of accurately measuring in-flight metabolic rates in subsection “Heart rate telemetry and estimated field energy expenditure”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"> <p>To assist the reader please clarify how the regression calculations were conducted. How long were the HR values averaged with VO2? What time of day were the animals placed in the respirometry chamber? And were issues of autocorrelation and repeated measures addressed in the calculation of the regression equation?</p> <p>We have clarified this in the Materials and methods to show that heart rates were averaged over the one minute preceding the VO2 measure, as well as the time of day when the experiments were conducted (subsection “Metabolic incorporation rates.”). To account for potential confounds of repeated measures we included individual identity as a random effect. We did not attempt to correct for autocorrelation in the heart rate data, but treated the five-minute samples as independent units.</p> <p>Please further clarify the method by which HR was analyzed so the reader does not need to find and read the Cochran and Wikelski, 2005 reference but can simply fully rely on the Materials and methods section of the present manuscript to appreciate both its strengths and limitations.</p> </disp-quote><p>We are unclear to what this comment is referring since the 2005 Cochran &amp; Wikelski chapter focuses on the spatial tracking of thrushes, not physiological sampling. We have added the sampling windows and intervals for how heart rate was previously visually counted in subsection “Metabolic incorporation rates.” so that it is clear how our current method differs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"> <p>Please clarify how many male and female bats were sampled for circulating cortisol, reading the manuscript we were confused by the different statements.</p> </disp-quote><p>This is noted in subsection “Glucocorticoids &amp; energy mobilization” and in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"> <p>Title: An explosive metabolism would interfere with survival of the organisms.

This also holds for the discussion in the Introduction and Discussion sections &quot;truly evolve&quot; (too strong wording). Both the previous wind tunnel and invasive field experiments performed here are stressful to the animals unless habituation and positive reinforcement training have been implemented with all stressors removed. Only non-invasive non-stress experiments may possibly give this insight.</p> </disp-quote><p>The impact of tag placement on an animal’s behavior is always of concern, and it is unlikely that any tag attachment, no matter how small or streamlined will have no impact on an animal. The best we can do is to minimize this impact on the limited number of animals that we study. The 0.8 g tag we used represents 4-5% of body mass (4.5 ± 0.04%). We have included this summary of body mass and tag mass as a percent of body mass in the Discussion section. We have also revised the wording for the statements. For all studies conducted in wind tunnels extensive habituation and positive reinforcement are needed to get animals to fly in these environments. Animals must be trained to use these devices. We therefore need to acknowledge that the results of these wind tunnel experiments represent normal unstressed states for animals under those conditions. As we note throughout the manuscript, however, the more we learn from free-ranging animals, even those wearing any biologging device, the more we understand that there is great behavioral, mechanical, and physiological flexibility that we have underestimated in these study species.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"> <p>Reading the Materials and methods the 23ga needle is rather large, the metabolism of the bats is high, how quickly are they expected to heal up compared to the duration of the experiment?

Furthermore, cannulae used to inject PIT tags that are commonly used on small mice and bats including <italic>Uroderma</italic> in our study populations are 12ga ((⌀ = 2.769) and no negative impact has been observed.
