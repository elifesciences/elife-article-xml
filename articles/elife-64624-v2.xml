a ciliopathy G-protein which regulates the ciliary trafficking of several lipid-modified proteins. ARL3 is activated by its guanine exchange factor (GEF) ARL13B via an unresolved mechanism. BART is described as an ARL3 effector which has also been implicated in ciliopathies, although the role of its ARL3 interaction is unknown. Here, we show that, at physiological GTP:GDP levels, human ARL3GDP is weakly activated by ARL13B. However, BART interacts with nucleotide-free ARL3 and, in concert with ARL13B, efficiently activates ARL3. In addition, BART binds ARL3GTP and inhibits GTP dissociation, thereby stabilising the active G-protein; the binding of ARL3 effectors then releases BART. Finally, using live cell imaging, we show that BART accesses the primary cilium and colocalises with ARL13B. We propose a model wherein BART functions as a bona fide co-GEF for ARL3 and maintains the active ARL3GTP, until it is recycled by ARL3 effectors.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>primary cilia</kwd><kwd>small GTPases</kwd><kwd>arf like proteins</kwd><kwd>GEFs</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000289</institution-id><institution>Cancer Research UK</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>A17196</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ismail</surname><given-names>Shehab</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>BART is a co-GEF for ARL3 and maintains the active ARL3-GTP until it is recycled by ARL3 effectors.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Several ADP-ribosylation factor-like (ARF-like) proteins, such as ARL3 and ARL6, have been found to play important roles in ciliary biogenesis and homeostasis. Defects in these proteins can therefore result in various ciliopathies as ciliary formation and/or composition becomes compromised (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alkanderi et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>ARL3, and its homologue ARL2, bind the phosphodiesterase six subunit δ (PDEδ) and the uncoordinated paralogues UNC119A and UNC119B. PDEδ and the UNC119 paralogues bind to and are involved in the trafficking of prenylated and myristoylated proteins, respectively. Due to their functional and structural similarities to RHO GDP-dissociation inhibitors (GDIs), they have been named GDI-like solubilising factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chandra et al., 2012</xref>). ARL3 acts as a release factor for these proteins, and is therefore crucial for the trafficking of their lipid-modified cargo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ismail, 2017</xref>). In addition, the binder of ARL2 (BART) has been previously identified as an effector of ARL2 and ARL3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Sharer and Kahn, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Veltel et al., 2008</xref>). Although its functions remain unclear, BART has been implicated in the ciliopathic disorder retinitis pigmentosa, indicating a role in primary cilia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Davidson et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>As with other GTPases, the activity of ARL proteins is fine-tuned by the action of guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) and GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs); these accelerate nucleotide exchange and GTP hydrolysis, respectively, thereby modulating G-protein activity. The regulation of ARL3 is critical for ciliary function, as both its reported GEF, ARL13B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alkanderi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gotthardt et al., 2015</xref>), and GAP, RP2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Schwahn et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Veltel et al., 2008</xref>), have been implicated in ciliopathies. However, the ARL13B mechanism of action is not fully understood. While it fits the profile of the ARL3GEF owing to its ciliary localisation, and in vitro GEF activity, the reported ARL3-ARL13B complex structure has not elucidated the interactions between the GEF and the ARL3 nucleotide-binding site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gotthardt et al., 2015</xref>), necessary for nucleotide exchange.</p><p>Here, we report and describe the human ARL3GEF as a two-component factor comprising ARL13B and BART, both proteins being able to bind nucleotide-free ARL3 and co-localise to the primary cilium. Although the individual proteins failed to efficiently exchange ARL3GDP to ARL3GTP, together, BART and ARL13B were able to completely exchange ARL3 at an accelerated rate of over 500-fold compared to the intrinsic exchange rate. In addition to binding to the nucleotide-free ARL3, BART binds to ARL3GTP and inhibits GTP dissociation. We show that ARL3 effectors displace BART from the BART-ARL3 complex. Thus, we propose a model in which: BART functions as a co-GEF activating ARL3 together with ARL13B; BART then maintains ARL3 in the GTP-bound active form, thereby circumventing the ARL3 preference for GDP, until it is displaced and recycled by ARL3 effectors.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>ARL3 is weakly activated by ARL13B under physiological GTP:GDP levels</title><p>GEFs generally reduce the binding affinities of small G-proteins to nucleotides, thereby allowing the fast replacement of the bound GDP with GTP, which is more abundant in cells. GEFs are known not to favour the binding to, and hence dissociation of, one nucleotide-bound form of their cognate GTPase over another (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Goody, 2014</xref>). The physiological concentration of GTP is approximately 10 times that of GDP, although this ratio can vary depending on the cell type and status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Traut, 1994</xref>). For a G-protein with similar binding affinities to GDP and GTP, a 10-fold excess of GTP should result in 90% loading of GTP at equilibrium, assuming no GTP hydrolysis. However, in the case of ARL3, it is reported that the ARL3-binding affinity for GDP is 50 times that of the GTP analogue GppNHp (0.06 nM and 3 nM, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Veltel et al., 2008</xref>]). This difference in affinity would nullify the 10-fold excess in GTP and would result in a majority of GDP-loaded ARL3 at equilibrium even in the presence of GEFs. ARL13B has been previously identified as a GEF for ARL3, although the mechanism has not been fully elucidated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gotthardt et al., 2015</xref>). We hence set out to investigate the GEF activity of ARL13B using GDP and GTP nucleotides.</p><p>To investigate the binding of ARL3 to GTP versus GDP in the presence of ARL13B and at physiological GDP:GTP concentrations, we incubated GDP-loaded ARL3 with recombinant ARL13B<sup>18-278</sup>, the minimum active ARL13B construct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gotthardt et al., 2015</xref>) and nucleotide mixtures of fluorescently-labelled GDP (mantGDP) and 10-fold excess unlabelled GDP, GTP, or GppNHp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The binding of mantGDP to ARL3 was monitored using fluorescence polarisation measurements. As expected, excess unlabelled GDP was able to compete with mantGDP and the binding of mantGDP was almost fully inhibited. However, even in the presence of ARL13B and physiological ratios of unlabelled GTP or GppNHp to GDP, the majority of ARL3 was bound to GDP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We conclude that, in the presence of ARL13B and under physiological relative concentrations of GTP:GDP, ARL3 is weakly activated at equilibrium and the majority of ARL3 (&gt;50%) is loaded with GDP.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>ARL3GDP guanine nucleotide exchange is poorly catalysed by ARL13B.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) 2 μM mantGDP was mixed with 2 μM ARL3GDP, 2 μM ARL13B<sup>18-278</sup>, and 40 μM unlabelled nucleotide (GDP, GTP, or GppNHp, as indicated). Fluorescence polarisation was measured following the addition of mantGDP to monitor the formation of ARL3mantGDP over time until the stabilisation of the measurements. The experiment was repeated three times and the average maximum polarisation obtained for each nucleotide is shown relative to that obtained with no excess unlabelled nucleotides added to the reaction. (<bold>B</bold>) Fluorescence polarisation measurements were used to monitor the nucleotide exchange of 2 μM ARL3mantGDP in the presence of 150 μM GppNHp (turquoise squares). The exchange was also observed with the addition of 10 μM ARL13B<sup>18-278</sup> in the presence of 150 μM GDP (blue squares) and 150 μM GppNHp (black crosses). Excess unlabelled nucleotides were added to initiate the reaction and the measurements immediately started. The data was fitted using GraFit, and the corresponding exchange rates are listed to the left of the key.</p><p> <supplementary-material id="fig1sdata1"><label>Figure 1—source data 1.</label><caption><title>Source data for Figure 1a.</title></caption><media mime-subtype="xlsx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-64624-fig1-data1-v2.xlsx"/></supplementary-material> </p><p> <supplementary-material id="fig1sdata2"><label>Figure 1—source data 2.</label><caption><title>Source data for Figure 1b.</title></caption><media mime-subtype="xlsx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-64624-fig1-data2-v2.xlsx"/></supplementary-material> </p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-64624-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><p>The fraction of ARL3 bound to mantGDP is in line with the lower affinity of ARL3 to GTP or GppNHp compared to GDP. The binding of mantGDP in the presence of GTP (53% compared to that in absence of unlabelled nucleotides) is relatively less than that in the presence of GppNHp (83.7% compared to that in absence of unlabelled nucleotides) which reflects a mildly higher affinity of GTP toward ARL3 compared to its analogue GppNHp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). However, this difference in affinity between GTP and GppNHp may be due to the hydrolysis of GTP or the contamination of the GTP solution with GDP, which is common in commercial GTP preparations. Therefore, to further investigate the rate and extent of dissociation of GDP, we used excess unlabelled GDP or GppNHp in ARL3mantGDP exchange (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Under the conditions used, ARL13B was able to accelerate the dissociation of GDP approximately 8.5-times in the presence of unlabelled GDP and 25-times in the presence of GppNHp compared to the intrinsic rate with GDP alone. This is consistent with the higher activity of ARL13B in the presence of GTP compared to GDP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gotthardt et al., 2015</xref>). GppNHp, as expected, was not able to completely displace GDP despite being in 75-fold excess (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).</p><p>We therefore conclude that, under physiological GTP:GDP concentrations and our experimental settings, ARL3 is weakly activated by ARL13B.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Lipid membranes do not release the ARL3 hasp</title><p>ARF subfamily proteins are characterised by the presence of an interswitch toggle and an N- terminal extension, usually an amphipathic helix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Pasqualato et al., 2002</xref>). The interswitch toggle is located between switch I and switch II and undergoes a nucleotide-dependent movement, which, in the GDP-bound state, allows the retraction of the N-terminal extension on the surface of the protein. In the presence of membranes and upon binding to GTP, the interswitch toggle displaces the retracted N-terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Antonny et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Goldberg, 1998</xref>). However, the displacement of the amphipathic helix is not possible in the absence of membranes; the helix therefore acts as a hasp, locking ARFs in the GDP-bound form. In line with this, ARFGEFs are not functional in the absence of membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Béraud-Dufour et al., 1999</xref>). Comparing the structures of GTP- and GDP-bound ARL3 shows that it undergoes similar conformational changes as in ARF proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). We thus wanted to investigate if the ARL3 amphipathic helix acts as a hasp to slow down GDP dissociation, and if this effect can be counteracted by the presence of membranes.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Inhibition of ARL3 guanine nucleotide exchange exerted by the N-terminal helix is not released in the presence of liposomes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Structure superimposition of the N-terminal helices and the interswitch regions of ARL3GTP (green, PDB: 4ZI2) and ARL3GDP (grey, PDB: 1FZQ) shown in cartoon form.

In contrast to the full-length protein, ARL3<sup>ΔN</sup> undergoes significant nucleotide exchange upon the addition of ARL13B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). This supports the notion of the ARL3 amphipathic helix acting as a hasp, which inhibits ARL13B-mediated nucleotide exchange.</p><p>ARL3 differs from ARF proteins in the reported lack of myristoylation of its N-terminus, which implies weak affinity to membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fansa and Wittinghofer, 2016</xref>). Attempts to carry out in vitro N-myristoyl transferase 1 (NMT1)-catalysed myristoylation of ARL3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Stephen et al., 2018</xref>) also did not result in any detected myristoylated N-terminal ARL3 fragments as analysed by mass spectrometry. We thus tested the binding of ARL3 to liposomes previously shown to interact with ARL3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kapoor et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lokaj et al., 2015</xref>). Both GDP- and GppNHp-bound ARL3 show weak binding, with ARL3GppNHp being stronger (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), which is most likely due to the better availability of the N-terminal helix in the GTP-bound conformation. While our experiments show that the ARL3 N-terminal helix cannot drive stable lipid binding, the lipid environment may induce conformational changes in the former, allowing the nucleotide exchange to occur.</p><p>We therefore tested whether the presence of liposomes can release the N-terminal helix and so affect the rate of ARL3 nucleotide exchange. The dissociation of mantGDP from ARL3 was monitored in the presence of 1 mM and 3 mM liposomes in the absence and presence of ARL13B<sup>18-278</sup>. Under the experimental conditions used, however, nucleotide exchange was not enhanced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D and E</xref>).</p><p>ARL13B itself is palmitoylated in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cevik et al., 2010</xref>), and its interaction with lipid membranes as well as ARL3 may result in an increased local concentration of the latter on the membrane surface, driving ARL3 N-terminal interaction with lipids and enhancing the dissociation of bound GDP. Palmitoylated ARL13B is difficult to obtain due to its insolubility in aqueous solutions, and the chemical lability of the palmitoyl thioester linkage.

Overall, under our experimental settings, ARL3 nucleotide exchange in all liposome reactions was much less compared to that of ARL3<sup>ΔN</sup>(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), indicating that the liposomes used failed to release the N-terminal helix.</p><p>ARL13B-mediated nucleotide exchange of the full-length ARL3 may therefore require another non-lipid component to the reaction, which is likely to involve the release of the ARL3 N-terminus.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>BART is a co-GEF for ARL13B-mediated ARL3 nucleotide exchange</title><p>We reasoned that the release of the ARL3 amphipathic helix may be carried out by one of its interactors.

These changes must be mediated by the GEF for ARL3 activation to occur. In the reported ARL13B-ARL3 crystal structure, ARL13B does not interact with the ARL3 N-terminal helix or the interswitch region. A comparison of the reported crystal structures of ARL3 in complex with its identified interactors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hillig et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ismail et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hanzal-Bayer, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gotthardt et al., 2015</xref>) shows that BART is the only ARL3 interactor that can interact with both the N-terminal helix and switches including the interswitch region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Furthermore, BART shows stronger binding to the GTP-loaded and nucleotide-free ARL3 compared to the GDP-bound form (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).

To test the involvement of the BART interactions with the switches and the interswitch regions, BART was added to ARL13B-mediated nucleotide exchange of ARL3<sup>ΔN</sup>mantGDP. Despite the absence of the helix, BART is still able to accelerate the exchange, although a similar amount of ARL3<sup>ΔN</sup> is exchanged compared with ARL13B alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>).

This enhancement of the exchange was only observed when all three proteins, GEF, co-GEF, and effector, were added, confirming that UNC119A displaces BART from the ARL3-BART complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).</p><p>BART interacts with ARL3 via the switches and the N-terminal helix simultaneously (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>).

This raises the possibility of an avidity effect of the two binding sites. In this case, the inhibition of one binding/interacting site should increase the dissociation rate of BART from ARL3 due to loss of avidity. Since effectors should only compete for the switches, we wanted to test if their binding can accelerate the release, and therefore the recycling, of BART. We investigated the displacement of ARL3GppNHp from immobilised BART using surface plasmon resonance (SPR); as UNC119A exhibited unspecific binding to the used chip, the homologue PDEδ was used instead. Surprisingly, ARL3 was displaced twofold faster with the addition of the ARL3 effector PDEδ supporting the possibility that, ARL3 effectors not only displace BART from ARL3-BART but also accelerate its recycling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>BART accesses the primary cilium and co-localises with ARL13B</title><p>BART has been reported to localise to the connecting cilia of mouse photoreceptors and has been implicated in ciliopathic disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Davidson et al., 2013</xref>).

Here we show that, for ARL3 where the binding affinities for GTP and GDP differ significantly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Veltel et al., 2008</xref>), ARL13B is not able to efficiently activate it. Our study underscores the importance of taking into consideration the binding affinities of small G-proteins to GTP and GDP while investigating their mechanism of activation.

In the primary cilium, the binding of BART and ARL13B (anchored to the membrane via palmitoyl moieties, blue solid lines) facilitates the formation of nucleotide-free ARL3 (grey box); the conformational changes in the N-terminal helix and interswitch regions are stabilised by their interactions with BART. The binding of GTP to ARL3 (dark green box) is favoured in the BART-ARL3 complex due to the masking of the exposed N-terminal helix and the stabilisation of the interswitch β-hairpin GTP conformation (dark green solid lines).

Indeed, in the structure of ARL3-UNC119A, the N-terminal helix is not exposed to the solution and instead is found retracted on the surface of the protein. All these observations call into question the interaction of ARL3-GTP with cellular membranes.

Arl3 exists in an inactive-GDP loaded form and an active GTP-loaded form. It was previously shown that Arl13B, a ciliary membrane associated protein, is the GEF for Arl3 required for its activation. The authors provide important insights into Arl3 activation by showing that the protein BART acts as a co-GEF that together with Arl13B mediates the efficient activation of Arl3. This represents a significant advance in our understanding of the cycle of Arl3-mediated ciliary delivery of lipid-modified cargo proteins.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;ARL3 activation requires the co-GEF BART and effector-mediated turnover&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Suzanne Pfeffer as the Senior and Reviewing Editor. The reviewers (in alphabetical order) were: Christopher Fromme, Aymelt Itzen and Esben Lorentzen.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As the editors have judged that your manuscript is of interest, but as described below that additional experiments are required before it is published, we would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Small GTPases are general regulators of intracellular signaling. The small GTPase Arl3 is thought to regulate signaling processes in cilia. Like other small GTPases, Arl3 is inactive when bound to GDP and active when binding to GTP. Guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) are required to exchange the tightly bound GDP for GTP. In this work, the authors aim to characterize the role of the protein BART in the nucleotide exchange reaction. Based on fluorescence polarization experiments that monitor the release of fluorescently labeled GDP from a complex with Arl3, the activity of BART is characterized. The authors find that full GEF-activity is achieved only in the presence of the previously reported Arl3-GEF Arl13B. The authors conclude that BART acts as a co-GEF operating in concert with Arl13B.</p><p>The reviewers are experts and suggested a number of experiments to improve the quality of the story as follows.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>As described in detail below, the authors should provide more quantitation: they should determine reaction rates and also provide statistics for replicates. Important will be to use a single nucleotide for the measurements as chemically distinct nucleotides will have different affinities (see below).</p><p>They should improve Figure 1 by providing more experiments, including GDP/GDP exchange and also the EDTA exchange reactions.</p><p>They should improve Figure 3 by also testing reduced concentration of Arl13.</p><p>They should improve the Discussion.</p><p>Here are more Specific comments to guide your next steps:</p><p>1) The authors often make (semi)quantitative statements based on their fluorescence curves and nucleotide release assays, yet they do not provide definite numbers that could be obtained from fitting the results (e.g. Figure 1A and B). This should be performed in order to make the effects of the experiments comparable to each other. In fact, I am not sure that there is an actual difference in nucleotide release rates in Figure 1A and B: The degree of exchange is certainly different for mantGDP and mantGppNHp and this can be explained by the different affinities since GDP binds ~50x more tightly to Arl3 than GppNHp. However, looking at the time it takes for the reactions to reach a plateau, they appear to do so at similar rates. A quantification and the use of equivalent nucleotides would be important to reliably estimate the effects.</p><p>2) The Discussion should include a section describing the mechanism of action of other small GTPase GEFs with respect to the dependence on co-GEFs. In particular, the authors should discriminate between the definition of GEFs composed of several subunits and co-GEFs. What is the definition of a co-GEF? Is BART the first example of a co-GEF?</p><p>3) If they authors are trying to reproduce physiological GTP/GDP ratios, they should make sure that also unlabeled GDP is available in the buffer at its approximate physiological concentration.</p><p>4) I am concerned about the use of non-equivalent nucleotides in the nucleotide-release assays. E.g., in Figure 1A the authors displace mant-GDP with GppNHp. Given that the affinities for GDP and GTP/GppNHp differ by a factor of ~50, equivalent nucleotides should be used for the displacement (e.g. displacing mant-GDP with GDP). Otherwise, the degree of exchange may be dependent on the relative affinities of GDP and GTP for the GTPase. Furthermore, full exchange/displacement should be indicated for every experiment (e.g. by adding EDTA and thus accelerating exchange).</p><p>5) Introduction: Describe lipidation of Arl. Explain what the physiological function of GDI is.</p><p>6) Introduction: &quot;In addition, the binder of ARL2 (BART) has been previously identified as an effector of ARL2 and ARL3&quot;: Please provide reference for this claim.</p><p>7) Results: &quot;The addition of recombinant ARL13B18-278…&quot;: Please explain why this construct has been used for the experiments. It is mentioned here for the first time. Provide reference to this construct if applicable.</p><p>8) Results &quot;GEFs are known not to favour the binding to, and hence dissociation of, one nucleotide-bound form of their cognate GTPase over another.&quot; Please provide reference for this claim.</p><p>9) Results: &quot;Palmitoylated ARL13B is difficult to obtain due to its instability&quot;: Please explain in which sense Arl13B is unstable.</p><p>10) Results: &quot;The addition of recombinant ARL13B18-278 to GDP-loaded ARL3 in the presence of up to 250-fold…&quot; Please indicate properly when mant-nucleotides have been used for monitoring exchange reactions. In this instance, the use of mant-nucleotides is not indicated explicitly.</p><p>11) Figure 2A: The quality of the depiction should be improved. In particular, the mix in ribbon (zig-zag loops) and cartoon representation is difficult to grasp. Also, light green and green depictions do not sufficiently discriminate the structures from each other.</p><p>12) Figure 2C: Statistical errors and test of statistical significance should be included.</p><p>13) Figure 3A: The input should be shown in order to evaluate potential changes of the proteins in the course of the experiment. It appears as if Arl3 is not pure, is this true? Furthermore, there is an additional band in the sample GDP+Alk. Phosphatase with GST-BART that disappears in the other lanes. Why is this? I also think that bar diagrams from such experiments should contain error bars. From the Coomassie-stained gel, there appears to be almost no difference in the intensities of Arl3 (if Arl3 is the band with lowest Mw), yet there are large differences in the WB. How can the authors explain this observation?</p><p>14) Figure 3B: There appears to be a discrepancy with the figure legend since the figure mentions GppNHp but the text refers to GDP.</p><p>15) Figure 3C-H: Why have the experiments been conducted at differing BART and Arl13B concentrations?

This should be performed in order to make the effects of the experiments comparable to each other. In fact, I am not sure that there is an actual difference in nucleotide release rates in Figure 1A and B: The degree of exchange is certainly different for mantGDP and mantGppNHp and this can be explained by the different affinities since GDP binds ~50x more tightly to Arl3 than GppNHp. However, looking at the time it takes for the reactions to reach a plateau, they appear to do so at similar rates. A quantification and the use of equivalent nucleotides would be important to reliably estimate the effects.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now performed new experiments and replaced Figure 1A and B as follows: Figure 1A we show the equilibrium effect where we incubated ARL3GDP with different mixtures of nucleotides in the presence of ARL13B and reported the levels of exchange. This experiment shows that at equilibrium the extent of exchange is markedly affected by the difference in affinities between GDP and GTP and opens the question of how the cell overcomes this preference towards GDP. Figure 1B: We recorded the dissociation data using excess equivalent nucleotides (GDP/GDP) and non-equivalent nucleotides (to highlight the equilibrium preference towards GDP). We recorded the data over longer period of times, until completion, and report the rates to show the effect of ARL13B on accelerating the rates.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2)The Discussion should include a section describing the mechanism of action of other small GTPase GEFs with respect to the dependence on co-GEFs. In particular, the authors should discriminate between the definition of GEFs composed of several subunits and co-GEFs. What is the definition of a co-GEF? Is BART the first example of a co-GEF?</p></disp-quote><p>We have now provided this information in the Discussion and highlighted the difference between our proposed term of co-GEF and the known multimeric GEFs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) If they authors are trying to reproduce physiological GTP/GDP ratios, they should make sure that also unlabeled GDP is available in the buffer at its approximate physiological concentration.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now provided this in Figure 1A.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) I am concerned about the use of non-equivalent nucleotides in the nucleotide-release assays. E.g., in Figure 1A the authors displace mant-GDP with GppNHp. Given that the affinities for GDP and GTP/GppNHp differ by a factor of ~50, equivalent nucleotides should be used for the displacement (e.g. displacing mant-GDP with GDP). Otherwise, the degree of exchange may be dependent on the relative affinities of GDP and GTP for the GTPase. Furthermore, full exchange/displacement should be indicated for every experiment (e.g. by adding EDTA and thus accelerating exchange).</p></disp-quote><p>We want to highlight the kinetic effect as well as the extent of exchange. We have clarified this now by providing a new figure, Figure 1A, which is focused on the degree of exchange at physiological GDP/GTP ratios and at equilibrium. We have also provided data for equivalent nucleotides (GDP for GDP) in Figures 1B and 3B). Finally we have now provided full reactions by recording the data over longer period of times when needed, as EDTA does not accelerate the exchange of bound GDP in case of ARL3, (Figures 1B, 3B and F).

It appears as if Arl3 is not pure, is this true? Furthermore, there is an additional band in the sample GDP+Alk. Phosphatase with GST-BART that disappears in the other lanes. Why is this? I also think that bar diagrams from such experiments should contain error bars. From the Coomassie-stained gel, there appears to be almost no difference in the intensities of Arl3 (if Arl3 is the band with lowest Mw), yet there are large differences in the WB. How can the authors explain this observation?</p></disp-quote><p>A panel showing input samples has been added to the figure. ARL3 is pure, the background bands arise from the GST-UNC119A preparation which cannot be further purified; this is more evident in the input lanes. The additional band in the AP reactions running just above ARL3 is GST; this is now clearly labelled. The quantification averages of three experiments are shown in the bar graph with their corresponding error bars. Comparing ARL3 band intensities on the Coomassie gel can be made difficult due to the presence of background bands, which are eliminated in the Western blots.
