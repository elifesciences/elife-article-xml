networks to combat host-induced stresses. With the help of RNA sequencing performed under various stress conditions, we identified that genes belonging to <italic>Mtb</italic> sulfur metabolism pathways are significantly upregulated during oxidative stress. Using an integrated approach of microbial genetics, transcriptomics, metabolomics, animal experiments, chemical inhibition, and rescue studies, we investigated the biological role of non-canonical <sc>L</sc>-cysteine synthases, CysM and CysK2. While transcriptome signatures of <italic>RvΔcysM</italic> and <italic>RvΔcysK2</italic> appear similar under regular growth conditions, we observed unique transcriptional signatures when subjected to oxidative stress. We followed pool size and labelling (<sup>34</sup>S) of key downstream metabolites, viz. mycothiol and ergothioneine, to monitor L-cysteine biosynthesis and utilization. This revealed the significant role of distinct L-cysteine biosynthetic routes on redox stress and homeostasis. CysM and CysK2 independently facilitate <italic>Mtb</italic> survival by alleviating host-induced redox stress, suggesting they are not fully redundant during infection. With the help of genetic mutants and chemical inhibitors, we show that CysM and CysK2 serve as unique, attractive targets for adjunct therapy to combat mycobacterial infection.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>tuberculosis</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>Mycobacterium</italic></kwd><kwd>cysteine</kwd><kwd>synthases</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001843</institution-id><institution>Science and Engineering Research Board</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CRG/2018/001294</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Khan</surname><given-names>Mehak Zahoor</given-names></name><name><surname>Nandicoori</surname><given-names>Vinay Kumar</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001843</institution-id><institution>Science and Engineering Research Board</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>JCB/2019/000015</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nandicoori</surname><given-names>Vinay Kumar</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001407</institution-id><institution>Department of Biotechnology, Ministry of Science and Technology, India</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BT/PR13522/COE/34/27/2015</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nandicoori</surname><given-names>Vinay Kumar</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000289</institution-id><institution>Cancer Research UK</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FC001060</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>de Carvalho</surname><given-names>Luiz Pedro S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100007155</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FC001060</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>de Carvalho</surname><given-names>Luiz Pedro S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FC001060</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>de Carvalho</surname><given-names>Luiz Pedro S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.

The aggravating situation is despite the clinical use of over 20 antibiotics and a century-old vaccine, BCG. The gradual rise in the emergence of increasingly drug-resistant strains and HIV-TB (Human Immunodeficiency Virus-Tuberculosis) co-infection further highlights the urgency to identify newer attractive drug targets. Throughout the course of infection, <italic>Mtb</italic> is exposed to a continuum of dynamic host-induced stresses such as severe nutrient deprivation, acidified compartments, and toxic reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) produced by its resident phagosomes. In turn, <italic>Mtb</italic> produces copious amounts of actinomycetes-specific mycothiol, the major antioxidant in actinomycetes that act as the functional equivalent of glutathione, to combat ROS and RNS. In addition to mycothiol, <italic>Mtb</italic> also produces ergothioneine, a low molecular weight thiol, and several enzymes that act concertedly to subvert host-induced redox stress. The redox-active group of both mycothiol and ergothioneine is derived from L-cysteine. Hence, genes involved in the biosynthesis of L-cysteine are upregulated in the host and in vitro upon oxidative and nutritional stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hampshire et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Manganelli et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Pinto et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Schnappinger et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Khan et al., 2021</xref>). Notably, an increased expression of these genes is functionally crucial, as suggested by the attenuated survival of transposon mutants of many sulfur and L-cysteine biosynthesis genes within the host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rengarajan et al., 2005</xref>). In mycobacteria, sulfur assimilation begins with the import of sulfate through a sulfate transporter composed of SufI.CysT.W.A. Intracellular sulfate is a substrate for APS synthase CysD.N.C, which adenylates and phosphorylates sulfate to form adenosine 5′-phosphosulfate (APS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wooff et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">McAdam et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Urbanek et al., 1990</xref>). APS sits at a metabolic branch point; it can either be converted into sulfolipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mougous et al., 2002</xref>) by consequent actions of multiple Stfs enzymes or reduced via SirA and SirH to sulfide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). This pathway encompasses sulfide formation from sulfate, called the sulfur assimilation pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Schnell et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Pinto et al., 2007</xref>) <italic>Mtb</italic> genome encodes three L-cysteine synthases – the canonical CysK1 and non-canonical CysM and CysK2 enzymes. Interestingly, humans do not possess L-cysteine synthases, raising the possibility of developing antibiotics without a homologous target in the host. CysK1 utilizes sulfide produced via the sulfur assimilation pathway and <italic>O</italic>-acetyl-L-serine produced from glycolytic intermediate 3-phosphoglycerate to produce L-cysteine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Qiu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Schnell et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Agren et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">O’Leary et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jurgenson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Burns et al., 2005</xref>) CysM, on the other hand, uses <italic>O</italic>-phospho-L-serine and a small sulfur carrier protein CysO as substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Agren et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Burns et al., 2005</xref>). Like CysK1, CysK2 utilizes <italic>O</italic>-phospho-L-serine and sulfide as substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Steiner et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Nakamura et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). In addition, <italic>Mtb</italic> can also synthesize L-cysteine through a reverse transsulfuration pathway from <sc>L</sc>-methionine. This example of convergent metabolic redundancy raises several interesting questions: (1) Why would <italic>Mtb</italic> rely on multiple enzymes and pathways to produce the same biomolecule? (2) Are these ‘functionally redundant’ enzymes dispensable, or are they required at a distinct cellular space, time, and condition? (3) Is the L-cysteine pool produced through a particular pathway functionally compartmentalized? That is, is it metabolized into a specific kind of downstream thiol?</p><p>To define these unsolved aspects of <italic>Mtb</italic> L-cysteine metabolism, we sought to investigate the interplay of non-canonical L-cysteine synthases of <italic>Mtb</italic> and elucidate their roles in abetting virulence. We aimed to decipher the relative contribution of CysM and CysK2 enzymes in alleviating host-induced stresses and promoting the survival of <italic>Mtb</italic> within the host. We also investigated their role in secondary metabolism, synthesizing low molecular weight thiols, such as mycothiol and ergothioneine, and understanding the consequential effects of their deletion on the global transcriptome of <italic>Mtb</italic>. Lastly, with the help of specific inhibitors, we evaluated their potential to serve as attractive drug targets for adjunct antibiotic therapy.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Non-canonical L-cysteine synthases facilitate Mtb in combating host-induced stresses</title><p><italic>Mtb</italic> is a generalist, a prototroph organism that can produce all 20 proteinogenic amino acids. In agreement with this notion, numerous microarray studies depict the upregulation of multiple amino acid pathways within the host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Pinto et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Schnappinger et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Pinto et al., 2007</xref>), indicating a higher dependency of <italic>Mtb</italic> survival and virulence on amino acid biosynthesis and regulation. In response to infection, host immune responses often try to contain the bacillary growth by depriving the amino acid levels in intracellular environment. As a counter mechanism, <italic>Mtb</italic> has been shown to upregulate biosynthesis of amino acids such as tryptophan, lysine, and histidine to facilitate mycobacterial survival within the host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dwivedy et al., 2021</xref>). We sought to identify distinct host stresses that result in the transcriptional modulation of specific amino acid biosynthetic pathways with the help of RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). We compared the transcriptional profile of <italic>H37Rv</italic> (<italic>Rv</italic>) grown in 7H9-ADC with the profiles obtained when bacilli were subjected to oxidative, nitrosative, starvation, and acidic stresses (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). The volcano plot illustrates differentially expressed genes (DEGs) that were significantly upregulated (blue) and downregulated (red) under indicated stress conditions (absolute log<sub>2</sub> Fold change &gt;1 and p<sub>adj</sub> &lt;0.05) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2a–e</xref>). Exposure to starvation conditions resulted in drastic transcription modulation compared with other stresses, suggesting that nutrient deficiency is the primary driver of transcriptome remodelling. In contrast, we observed the lowest number of DEGs when the bacteria were subjected to mildly acidic conditions (pH 5.5). Heat maps of normalized DEGs depict that DEG changes were comparable across biological replicates within each sample set (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2f–j</xref>). To better understand the RNA-seq results, we plotted the fold change of DEGs due to different stress conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). This allowed us to understand the expression profile of genes in all the stress conditions simultaneously, regardless of whether they were identified as differentially expressed. It is apparent from the data that a specific cluster of genes is up- and downregulated in oxidative, sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), and starvation conditions. In comparison, the differences observed in the pH 5.5 and nitrosative conditions were limited (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>).</p><p>To further refine our understanding of the DEGs, we grouped them into various functional categories and found that genes belonging to intermediary metabolism and respiration remained the most affected in all conditions highlighting their role of metabolic rewiring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4a</xref>). Pathway enrichment analysis of the most enriched Gene Ontology (GO) further revealed that, while, expectedly, metabolic pathways were found to be downregulated during starvation, we observed enrichment of nitrogen metabolism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). SDS stress resulted in the upregulation of branched-chain amino acids/keto acids degradation pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4c</xref>), and nitrosative stress ensued upregulation of fatty acid and lipid biosynthetic processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4d</xref>). There were no changes observed in mildly acidic conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4e</xref>). Importantly, oxidative stress resulted in significant upregulation of genes involved in sulfur metabolism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4f</xref>). We further analyzed the DEGs involved in sulfur and L-cysteine metabolism across sample sets and discerned an overlap of the genes affected under two or more conditions. Interestingly, we observed upregulation of sulfate transporters genes (<italic>subI</italic>, <italic>cysT</italic>, <italic>cysW</italic>, and <italic>cysA1</italic>) across multiple stresses and sulfur assimilation (<italic>cysH</italic>, <italic>cysA2</italic>, <italic>cysD</italic>, and <italic>cysNC</italic>) during starvation, oxidative and SDS stress. <italic>CysK2</italic>, a non-canonical L-cysteine synthase, was found to be upregulated during all stresses except SDS stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Non-canonical L-cysteine synthases facilitate mycobacterial survival upon host-like induced stresses in vitro.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Five-way Venn diagram highlighting differentially expressed genes (DEGs) belonging to sulfur metabolism pathway under indicated stress conditions (absolute log<sub>2</sub> Fold change &gt;0.5 and p<sub>adj</sub> value &lt;0.05).

Given the importance of sulphur metabolism genes in in vivo survival of <italic>Mtb</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hatzios and Bertozzi, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Senaratne et al., 2006</xref>) it is not surprising that diverse environment cues dynamically regulate these genes. Microarray studies have shown upregulation of genes encoding sulphate transporter upon exposure to hydrogen peroxide and nutrient starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hampshire et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Schnappinger et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Betts et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Voskuil et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Voskuil et al., 2004</xref>). Similarly, ATP sulfurylase and APS kinase are induced during macrophage infection and by nutrient depletion. Induction of these genes that coordinate the first few steps of the sulfur assimilation pathway indicates a probable increase in biosynthesis of sulfate-containing metabolites that may be crucial against host-inflicted stresses. Furthermore, genes involved in synthesis of reduced sulfur moieties (<italic>cysH</italic>, <italic>sirA</italic>, and <italic>cysM</italic>) are also induced by hydrogen peroxide and nutrient starvation. Sulfur metabolism has been postulated to be important in transition to latency. This hypothesis is based on transcriptional upregulation of <italic>cysD</italic>, <italic>cysNC</italic>, <italic>cysK2</italic>, and <italic>cysM</italic> upon exposure to hypoxia. Multiple transcriptional profiling studies have reported upregulation of <italic>moeZ</italic>, <italic>mec</italic>, <italic>cysO</italic>, and <italic>cysM</italic> genes when cells were subjected to oxidative and hypoxic stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Manganelli et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Burns et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hatzios and Bertozzi, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Voskuil et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Voskuil et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brunner et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Manganelli et al., 2001</xref>) further suggesting an increase in the biosynthesis of reduced metabolites such as cysteine and methionine and sulfur containing cell wall glycolipids upon exposure to oxidative stress. To address the functional relevance of this observation, we deleted two non-canonical L-cysteine synthases-CysM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Khan et al., 2021</xref>) and CysK2, from the <italic>Mtb</italic> chromosome. CysK2 mutant, <italic>RvΔcysK2</italic>, was generated using the recombineering method, and the recombination at the native loci was confirmed with the help of multiple PCRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). While deletion of <italic>cysM</italic> or <italic>cysK2</italic> did not affect mycobacterial growth under in vitro nutrient-rich 7H9-ADC or 7H9-ADS, it significantly compromised <italic>Mtb</italic> growth in defined Sauton’s media (~2 log<sub>10</sub>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>), suggesting the importance of <italic>cysM-</italic> and <italic>cysK2-</italic>derived L-cysteine.

Unlike 7H9, wherein glucose, glycerol, glutamate, and ammonia act as carbon and nitrogen sources, Sauton’s media contains glycerol and asparagine as the sole carbon and nitrogen sources, suggesting metabolic reprogramming aided by CysM and CysK2 enable <italic>Mtb</italic> to grow optimally in a limited nutritional environment. This observation was further recapitulated under nutrient starvation (PBS), wherein the survival of <italic>RvΔcysM</italic> and <italic>RvΔcysK2</italic> was lower than parental <italic>Rv</italic> or <italic>RvΔcysM::M</italic> or <italic>RvΔcysK2::K2</italic> strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>).

The highest attenuation of <italic>RvΔcysM</italic> and <italic>RvΔcysK2</italic> was observed upon the addition of cumene hydroperoxide (CHP), an organic hydroperoxide that, upon decomposition, generates free radicals. The relative survival of <italic>RvΔcysM</italic> and <italic>RvΔcysK2</italic> was ~2.04 and ~1.31 log<sub>10</sub> lower, respectively, compared to <italic>Rv</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>).

Intriguingly, while <italic>RvΔcysM</italic> and <italic>RvΔcysK2</italic> were closely located on a PCA (Principal Component Analysis) plot in the absence of any stress, oxidative stress resulted in a significant divergence between the two groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). Deletion of <italic>cysM</italic> resulted in differential expression of 322 genes (159 downregulated and 163 upregulated) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1a, b</xref>), while deletion of <italic>cysK2</italic> impacted 278 genes (155 downregulated and 123 upregulated) under regular growth conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1c, d</xref>) (absolute log<sub>2</sub> Fold change &gt;1 and p<sub>adj</sub> &lt;0.05).

To understand the individual contribution of CysM and CysK2 in combating oxidative stress, we compared the DEGs of <italic>RvΔcysK2</italic> to <italic>RvΔcysM</italic> under regular growth and oxidative stress conditions. While DEGs between <italic>RvΔcysK2</italic> and <italic>RvΔcysM</italic> were limited to 13 in untreated conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>), CHP treatment resulted in differential expression of 1372 genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1e</xref>), highlighting unique transcriptional signatures associated with each L-cysteine synthase under oxidative stress. Subsequently, we compared the DEGs of <italic>Rv</italic>, <italic>RvΔcysM</italic>, and <italic>RvΔcysK2</italic> obtained under oxidative stress with the help of a Venn diagram. This analysis revealed that CysM and CysK2 influence a shared repertoire of 1023 genes (529 upregulated and 494 downregulated) compared to <italic>Rv</italic> upon CHP treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f</xref>). Importantly, CysM and CysK2 distinctively modulate 324 and 1104 genes, respectively, during oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f, g</xref>). In addition to being directly regulated by the synthases, it is highly that the changes in the expression of these genes is because of distinct downstream consequences. Assortment of DEGs into functional classes revealed intermediary metabolism and respiration and cell wall pathways among the most impacted categories (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2h</xref>).

To further validate that CysM and CysK2 support <italic>Mtb</italic> survival by detoxifying peroxides generated by the host, we compared the survival of strains in the peritoneal macrophages extracted from wild-type C57BL/6 (WT) mice that are proficient in eliciting oxidative and nitrosative stress or murine strains that are deficient in their ability to produce hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) (phox<sup>−/−</sup>) or both oxidative and nitrosative stress (IFNγ<sup>−/−</sup>).

Brunner et al. screened a compound library to identify inhibitors of mycobacterial L-cysteine synthases – CysK1, CysK2, and CysM. We selected three compounds – Compound 1 (C1) (named compound 2 in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brunner et al., 2017</xref>), which inhibits all three synthases; Compound 2 (C2) (compound 6 in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brunner et al., 2017</xref>), which inhibits both non-canonical L-cysteine synthases and Compound 3 (C3) (compound 31 in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brunner et al., 2017</xref>), which selectively inhibits CysK1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a, b</xref>). To examine the therapeutic potential of these inhibitors, we first tested their effect on the survival of <italic>Rv</italic> within host peritoneal macrophages. Treatment with C1 resulted in ~1 log<sub>10</sub> attenuation compared with the untreated cells. Killing mediated by C2 or C3 was marginally lower compared with C1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c</xref>). Next, we examined the ability of these drugs to enhance the bactericidal activity of INH (isoniazid), a drug whose activity depends on redox state of the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Vilchèze et al., 2005</xref>), and therefore could be affected by disruption of L-cysteine downstream pathways. Towards this goal, we first measured the MICs (Minimal Inhibitory Concentration) of INH (isoniazid) (0.06 µg/ml) and C1 (0.6 mg/ml), C2 (0.6 mg/ml), and C3 (0.15 mg/ml) independently. As expected, all the compounds were ineffective in killing <italic>Mtb</italic> because of redundant roles and relatively less requirement of L-cysteine synthases during regular growth conditions. To examine the combinatorial effect, we selected sub-MIC values of INH (0.03 µg/ml, encircled orange) and increasingly twofold diluted concentrations of C1, C2, or C3, all below MIC values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6d–f</xref>; blue encircled denotes the starting concentration) and assessed bacterial survival upon combinatorial treatment with INH and the three L-cysteine synthase inhibitors.

Understanding the dynamic metabolic interactions between the pathogen and its host is imperative to identify its weaknesses which can be exploited to design new-age chemotherapy.

This observation has been consistently reported by multiple studies demonstrating the upregulation of sulfur assimilation and L-cysteine biosynthetic genes in response to oxidative stress, nutrient deprivation, and macrophage infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hampshire et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Manganelli et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Pinto et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Schnappinger et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Khan et al., 2021</xref>). Besides being involved in protein synthesis, L-cysteine is also important for the biosynthesis of L-methionine, <italic>S</italic>-adenosyl methionine, coenzyme A, and iron–sulfur clusters. As a thiol-containing molecule, L-cysteine contributes to the intracellular redox state directly and through the production of major antioxidants like mycothiol and ergothioneine.

Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which encounters stresses associated with immune cell interactions. In this <bold>valuable</bold> manuscript, the authors provide <bold>solid</bold> evidence that the genes encoding cysteine biosynthetic enzymes (cysM and cysK2) are required to maintain full viability of M. tuberculosis under in vitro stress conditions, macrophage infections, and within the lung tissues of mice. The manuscript presents transcriptomic and metabolomic evidence to support the hypothesis that CysM and CysK2 play distinct roles in maintaining cysteine-derived metabolite pools under stress conditions. The work will be of interest to microbiologists in general.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.91970.3.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Summary:</p><p>Khan et. al., investigated the functional redundancy of the non-canonical L-cysteine synthases of M. tuberculosis, CysM and CysK2, focussing on their role in mitigating the effects of host-derived stress.

Furthermore, while several of the genes in sulfur assimilation and L-cysteine biosynthetic pathway genes are upregulated by more than one stress condition, the data does not support the statement that it is the &quot;most commonly upregulated pathway in Mtb exposed to multiple host-like stresses&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>We have made changes in the manuscript in line with reviewer’s suggestion.</p><p>“Thus RNA-Seq data suggest that genes involved in sulfur assimilation and L-cysteine biosynthetic pathway are upregulated during various host-like stresses in Mtb (Figure S2). Given the importance of sulphur metabolism genes in in vivo survival of Mtb [1, 2], it is not surprising that these genes are dynamically regulated by diverse environment cues. Microarray studies have shown upregulation of genes encoding sulphate transporter upon exposure to hydrogen peroxide and nutrient starvation [3-7] Similarly, ATP sulfurlyase and APS kinase is induced during macrophage infection and by nutrient depletion. Induction of these genes that coordinate first few steps of sulphur assimilation pathway indicate that probable increase in biosynthesis of sulphate containing metabolites that may be crucial against host inflicted stresses. Furthermore, genes involved in synthesis of reduced sulphur moieties (cysH, sirA and cysM) are also induced by hydrogen peroxide and nutrient starvation. Sulfur metabolism has been postulated to be important in transition to latency. This hypothesis is based on transcriptional upregulation of cysD, cysNC, cysK2, and cysM upon exposure to hypoxia. Multiple transcriptional profiling studies have reported upregulation of moeZ, mec, cysO and cysM genes when cells were subjected to oxidative and hypoxic stress [1, 6-11] further suggesting an increase in the biosynthesis of reduced metabolites such as cysteine and methionine and sulfur containing cell wall glycolipids upon exposure to oxidative stress [12]. We have modified the sentence to “significantly upregulated pathway in Mtb exposed to multiple host-like stresses”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) For the quantification of the metabolites, it isn't clear how the abundance was calculated (e.g., were standards for each metabolite used? How was abundance normalised between samples?), and this information should be included to strengthen the data.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for picking up this. We have extended our description of metabolomics methods. It now reads: “Due to the tendency of M. tuberculosis to form clamps, which significantly skews any cell number estimation we normalized samples to protein/peptide concentration using the BCA assay kit (Thermo). Therefore, our LC-MS data is expressed as ion counts/mg protein or ratios of that for the same metabolite. This is a standard way to express ion abundance data as it was done previously [13, 14].</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Furthermore, labelling with L-methionine was performed to determine the rate of synthesis of the L-cysteine-derived metabolites. L-cysteine is produced from L-methionine via the transsulfuration pathway, which is independent of CysM and CysK2. It is therefore difficult to interpret this experiment, as the impact of deleting CysM and CysK2 on the transsulfuration pathway is likely indirect.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer may have misunderstood the experiment and the results presented. Labelling was not performed with L-methionine. We use 34S derived from SO42-, to monitor reductive assimilation of sulfur and its transit from S2- until L-methionine, passing through cysteine. We specified in material and methods that we have used sodium sulfate-34S (Merck 718882), as our label source of sulfur. This method was first employed in M. tuberculosis by the Bertozzi group to identify sulfolipids in mycobacteria. Therefore, we are not measuring transsulfuration, but instead direct synthesis of L-methionine via cysteine, and consequently we are indeed assessing the importance of cysK2 and cysM in this process. We have now added to the results section (page 9) that we employed (Na34SO4) for labeling, to make sure other readers will not think we are measuring transulfuration.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) The ability of L-cysteine to rescue the survival defect of the Rv∆cysM and Rv∆cysK2 mutants in macrophages is interpreted as exogenous L-cysteine being able to compensate for reduced intracellular levels. However, there is no evidence that L-cysteine is being taken up by the mutants and an alternate explanation is that L-cysteine functions as an antioxidant within cells i.e., it reduces intracellular ROS.</p></disp-quote><p>The concentration of L-cysteine used for peritoneal macrophage survival rescue experiments was titrated to have no minimum survival advantage in case of wild-type Rv. Thus, at the given concentration, we believe that the contribution of cysteine in reducing intracellular ROS within cells does not have a major role since there is no significant difference in the survival of wild-type Rv strain. Had cysteine reduced intracellular ROS, we would expect increased bacterial survival of Rv due to diminished oxidative stress.</p><p>Furthermore, L-cysteine addition also mitigates CHP induced survival defect in vitro [15] and nullifies observed effect of Cysteine inhibitors in vitro [16] suggesting that cysteine or cystine can be transported into Mtb. This has also been previously shown in case of AosR mutant strain [15], CysH [2] and over 70% uptake of exogenously added [35S] cysteine to a growing culture of Mtb [17].</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors sought to investigate the functional redundancy of the non-canonical L-cysteine synthases CysM and CysK2.

The authors have preliminary data showing that Mycobacterium tuberculosis has two unique pathways to synthesize cysteine. The data showing new compounds that act synergistically with INH is very interesting.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>RNAseq data is interesting and important.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The paper would be strengthened if the authors were to add further detail to their genetic manipulations.</p><p>The authors provide evidence that they have successfully made a cysK2 mutant by recombineering. This data looks promising, but I do not see evidence for the cysM deletion. It is also important to state what sort of complementation was done (multicopy plasmid, integration proficient vector, or repair of the deletion). Since these mutants are the basis for most of the additional studies, these details are essential. It is important to include complementation in mouse studies as unexpected loss of PDIM could have occurred.</p></disp-quote><p>The details of CysM knockout generation have been previously published ([15]; Appendix Figure S4), and complementation strain details are provided in the methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>In this work, the authors conduct transcriptional profiling experiments with Mtb under various different stress conditions (oxidative, nitrosative, low pH, starvation, and SDS). The Mtb transcriptional responses to these stress conditions are not particularly new, having been reported extensively in the literature over the past ~20 years in various forms. A common theme from the current work is that L-cysteine synthesis genes are seemingly up-regulated by many stresses. Thus, the authors focused on deleting two of the three L-cysteine synthesis genes (cysM and cysK2) in Mtb to better understand the roles of these genes in Mtb physiology.</p><p>The cysM and cysK2 mutants display fitness defects in various media (Sautons media, starvation, oxidative and nitrosative stress) noted by CFU reductions. Transcriptional profiling studies with the cysM and cysK2 mutants revealed that divergent gene signatures are generated in each of these strains under oxidative stress, suggesting that cysM and cysK2 have non-redundant roles in Mtb's oxidative stress response which likely reflects the different substrates used by these enzymes, CysO-L-cysteine and O-phospho-L-serine, respectively. Note that these studies lack genetic complementation and are thus not rigorously controlled for the engineered deletion mutations.</p><p>The authors quantify the levels of sulfur-containing metabolites (methionine, ergothioneine, mycothiol, mycothionine) produced by the mutants following exposure to oxidative stress. Both the cysM or cysK2 mutants produce more methionine, ergothioneine, and mycothionine relative to WT under oxidative stress. Both mutants produce less mycothiol relative to WT under the same condition. These studies lack genetic complementation and thus, do not rigorously control for the engineered mutations.</p><p>Next, the mutants were evaluated in infection models to reveal fitness defects associated with oxidative and nitrosative stress in the cysM or cysK2 mutants. In LPS/IFNg activated peritoneal macrophages, the cysM or cysK2 mutants display marked fitness defects which can be rescued with exogenous cysteine added to the cell culture media. Peritoneal macrophages lacking the NADPH oxidase (Phox) or IFNg fail to produce fitness phenotypes in the cysM or cysK2 mutants suggesting that oxidative stress is responsible for the phenotypes. Similarly, chemical inhibition of iNOS partly abrogated the fitness defect of the cysM or cysK2 mutants. Similar studies were conducted in mice lacking IFNg and Phox establishing that cysM or cysK2 mutants have fitness defects in vivo that are dependent on oxidative and nitrosative stress.</p><p>Lastly, the authors use small molecule compounds to inhibit cysteine synthases. It is demonstrated that the compounds display inhibition of Mtb growth in 7H9 ADC media. No evidence is provided to demonstrate that these compounds are specifically inhibiting the cysteine synthases via &quot;ontarget inhibition&quot; in the whole Mtb cells. Additionally, it is wrongly stated in the discussion that &quot;combinations of L-cys synthase inhibitors with front-line TB drugs like INH, significantly reduced the bacterial load inside the host&quot;. This statement suggests that the INH + cysteine synthase inhibitor combinations reduce Mtb loads within a host in an infection assay. No data is presented to support this statement.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that the experiments do not conclusively prove that these compounds specifically inhibit the cysteine synthases via &quot;on-target inhibition&quot; in the whole Mtb cells. However, the inhibitors used in this study have been previously profiled in vitro (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0960894X17308405?via%3Dihub">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0960894X17308405?via%3Dihub</ext-link>).

The normalized count for the differentially expressed genes are plotted. To better understand the RNA-seq results, we plotted the fold change of differentially expressed genes due to different stress conditions (New figure &amp; table- Figure S3 &amp; Table S2). This allowed us to understand the expression profile of genes in all the stress conditions simultaneously, regardless of whether they were identified as differentially expressed. The data revealed that specific clusters of genes are up- and downregulated in oxidative, SDS, and starvation conditions. In comparison, the differences observed in the pH 5.5 and nitrosative conditions were limited (Figure S3 &amp; Table S2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) In Figure S3 it would be more informative to show fold-enrichment than gene counts in (b) to (f).</p></disp-quote><p>In our opinion, gene counts are more informative when plotting GO enrichments, as the number of genes in each GO category can vary drastically.

It is unclear how a MIC can be determined with these compounds in 7H9 ADC when deletion mutants grow just fine in this media. Is this because the compounds inhibit multiple cysteine synthesis enzymes and/or enzymatic targets in other pathways? To me, the data suggests that the compounds are hitting multiple enzymes in whole Mtb cells. Does cysteine supplementation reverse the inhibitory profiles with the compounds in Figure 6?</p></disp-quote><p>As mentioned in the text, all the compounds were ineffective in killing Mtb, likely because Lcysteine synthases are not essential during regular growth conditions. Hence, the MIC for cysteine inhibitors was very high - C1 (0.6 mg/ml), C2 (0.6 mg/ml), and C3 (0.15 mg/ml) opposed to the standard drug, isoniazid with MIC of 0.06 ug/ml. We agree with the reviewer that the experiments do not conclusively prove that these compounds specifically inhibit the cysteine synthases via &quot;on-target inhibition&quot; in Mtb cells. The inhibitors used in this study have been previously profiled in vitro [8]. However, one cannot rule out the hypothesis that these compounds might also have some off-target effects.</p></body></sub-article></article>
