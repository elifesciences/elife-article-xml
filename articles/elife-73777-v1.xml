catabolism of nondigestible starches, can act in a hormone-like fashion via specific G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). The primary GPCR targets for these SCFAs are FFA2 and FFA3. Using transgenic mice in which FFA2 was replaced by an altered form called a Designer Receptor Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (FFA2-DREADD), but in which FFA3 is unaltered, and a newly identified FFA2-DREADD agonist 4-methoxy-3-methyl-benzoic acid (MOMBA), we demonstrate how specific functions of FFA2 and FFA3 define a SCFA–gut–brain axis. Activation of both FFA2/3 in the lumen of the gut stimulates spinal cord activity and activation of gut FFA3 directly regulates sensory afferent neuronal firing. Moreover, we demonstrate that FFA2 and FFA3 are both functionally expressed in dorsal root- and nodose ganglia where they signal through different G proteins and mechanisms to regulate cellular calcium levels. We conclude that FFA2 and FFA3, acting at distinct levels, provide an axis by which SCFAs originating from the gut microbiota can regulate central activity.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Designer Receptor Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs</kwd><kwd>short-chain fatty acids</kwd><kwd>gut–brain axis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/L027887/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Milligan</surname><given-names>Graeme</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/S000453/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tobin</surname><given-names>Andrew</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The G protein-coupled receptors FFA2 and FFA3, activated by short-chain fatty acids, are mediators of a gut–brain axis.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The gut–brain axis allows bidirectional communication between the enteric and central nervous systems. Growing evidence highlights the role that the intestinal microbiota may play in such interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bienenstock et al., 2015</xref>) and in the development of disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Luca et al., 2019</xref>). The microbiota produces a wide array of metabolites that can modulate host cells and their functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Nicolas and Chang, 2019</xref>). Among these short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), particularly acetate (C2) and propionate (C3), are generated in prodigious amounts by fermentation of fiber and other nondigestible carbohydrates in the lower gut. SCFAs play central roles in homeostasis at the interface between metabolism and immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alvarez-Curto and Milligan, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Tan et al., 2014</xref>) and within the gut–brain axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">van de Wouw et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dalile et al., 2019</xref>). Although a range of their key effects are believed to be produced by activation of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), both locally in the lower gut and following uptake into the systemic circulation, which of these roles are generated directly by individual receptors and via which signaling pathways and circuits remains undefined.</p><p>Over the course of evolution genes encoding many ancestral forms of GPCRs have multiplied and diversified to provide enhanced flexibility of signaling and integration of responses to either the same or closely related ligands. An example of this is within the family of receptors, FFA1, FFA2, and FFA3 that are activated by the binding of free fatty acids. Whilst FFA1 is activated by saturated and unsaturated fatty acids of chain length C10 and above both FFA2 and FFA3 are activated instead by SCFAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Stoddart et al., 2008b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bolognini et al., 2016b</xref>). Defining the functions of FFA2 and FFA3 is challenging due to each of overlapping potency of SCFAs at these receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hudson et al., 2012b</xref>), a paucity of highly selective pharmacological tool compounds for FFA2 and FFA3 individually (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Milligan et al., 2017b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Milligan et al., 2017a</xref>) and multiple non-GPCR-mediated effects of SCFAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Stoddart et al., 2008b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bolognini et al., 2016b</xref>).</p><p>To overcome these issues, and to define unambiguously specific roles of FFA2 and FFA3 in the actions of SCFAs within the gut–brain axis herein we have applied an integrated chemogenetic approach. Firstly, in addition to the use of selective FFA2 and FFA3 knockout mouse lines we have extended the use of a transgenic knockin mouse line in which we expressed a Designer Receptor Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADD) derived from human (h) FFA2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hudson et al., 2012a</xref>) in place of endogenous mouse FFA2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bolognini et al., 2019</xref>). This variant form does not respond to the SCFAs C2 or C3 and, therefore, both in vivo and in cells and tissues derived from these mice responses to C2 or C3 cannot reflect activation of hFFA2-DREADD. Importantly, expression of FFA3 is unaffected in these animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bolognini et al., 2019</xref>) and, therefore, effects of the SCFAs may instead be mediated by FFA3. In previous studies, we identified that 4-hexadienoic acid (sorbic acid) acts as an agonist at hFFA2-DREADD but is without activity at various wild-type orthologs of FFA2 and of FFA3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hudson et al., 2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bolognini et al., 2019</xref>). As such, effects of sorbic acid in the transgenic mice are potentially mediated by hFFA2-DREADD but not by FFA3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bolognini et al., 2019</xref>). The availability of distinct activators of any receptor is beneficial in studies to explore receptor function. Although we are unaware of any noted off-target effects of sorbic acid it has modest potency at hFFA2-DREADD and although it has extremely low toxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Walker, 1990</xref>), it is widely used as a food preservative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kaczmarek et al., 2019</xref>). We wished therefore to identify additional, chemically distinct, hFFA2-DREADD agonist ligands. Here by screening libraries of small molecules with similarity to sorbic acid we identified a series of 4-methoxy-benzoic acid derivatives that also act as highly selective, and somewhat more potent activators of hFFA2-DREADD. From these we selected 4-methoxy-3-methyl-benzoic acid (MOMBA) for the studies reported herein.</p><p>Using the unique hFFA2-DREADD transgenic mice and combinations of MOMBA and C3, supported by a novel FFA3 selective activator (TUG-1907) we recently identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ulven et al., 2020</xref>), we have dissected the contributions of FFA2 and FFA3 to functions of SCFAs at levels ranging from gut transit to the activation of nodose- and dorsal root ganglion cells and communication from the colon to the spinal cord. We show that combinations of these two receptors transduce different effects of SCFAs within these pathways and via different G-protein-mediated pathways and, by so doing, integrate signals to control the microbiota–gut–brain axis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Identification of 4-methoxy-benzoic acid derivatives as novel hFFA2-DREADD agonists</title><p>We have previously shown that sorbic acid is a moderately potent, selective and effective agonist of hFFA2-DREADD that lacks agonist action at each of human and mouse FFA2 and both human and mouse FFA3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hudson et al., 2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bolognini et al., 2019</xref>). However, for pharmacological studies, particularly when exploring native cells and tissues, use of more than a single receptor-activating ligand is important to help define with certainty ‘on-target’ and functionally relevant responses. We, therefore, conducted a screen for novel agonists at hFFA2-DREADD using initially a receptor–β-arrestin-2 interaction assay. Here, following transient transfection of HEK293T cells to express both hFFA2-DREADD tagged at the intracellular C-terminal tail with enhanced Yellow Fluorescent Protein (hFFA2-DREADD-eYFP) and β-arrestin-2-<italic>Renilla</italic>-luciferase, induced proximity of eYFP and <italic>Renilla</italic>-luciferase allows bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) that reflects agonist-promoted interactions between the hFFA2-DREADD receptor and the arrestin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bolognini et al., 2019</xref>). Using sorbic acid as a positive control, BRET signal was enhanced in a concentration-dependent manner with pEC<sub>50</sub> = 3.89 ± 0.04 (<italic>n</italic> = 3, mean ± standard deviation [SD], <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We initially screened, at 100 µM, more than 1200 small molecules selected to have some structural similarity with sorbic acid and designed/collected to have good physicochemical properties and a lack of known chemical liabilities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). This provided a robust 96-well microtitre plate-based assay with calculated <italic>Z</italic>′ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Zhang et al., 1999</xref>) routinely &gt;0.6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>) and greater than fivefold signal to background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Reconfirmation screens of potential hits, also conducted at 100 µM, provided positives, including compounds 565 and 1184 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Deconvolution indicated that compound 1184 was, in fact, sorbic acid, confirming the capacity of the screen to identify effectively a previously characterized active, whilst compound 565 was MOMBA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Potential activity of a further 320 distinct compounds, selected now on relatedness to the hits from the initial screen, was again assessed initially at a single concentration (100 µM) in 96-well format (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). This resulted in the identification of further compounds including a number closely related to MOMBA, such as 4-methoxy-3-chloro-benzoic acid (compound 132) and 4-methoxy-3-hydroxy-benzoic acid (compound 235) as actives (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). A number of these were at least as potent as sorbic acid with the best displaying some three- to fivefold higher potency in this assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Based on the common 4-methoxy-3-X-benzoic acid scaffold of MOMBA and compounds 132 and 235 that provided a defined pharmacophore, MOMBA was selected for more detailed studies and purchase of MOMBA from a separate source confirmed activity of this chemical.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Screening for novel agonists of hFFA2-DREADD identifies 4-methoxy-3-methyl-benzoic acid (MOMBA) (A).</title><p>HEK293 cells were transiently transfected to express both hFFA2-DREADD-eYFP and β-arrestin-2-<italic>Renilla</italic>-luciferase.

The effect of an EC<sub>80</sub> concentration of MOMBA to stimulate [<sup>35</sup>S]GTPγS binding was fully inhibited by increasing concentrations of both of the structurally distinct, human FFA2 ortholog specific, antagonists 4-[[[(2<italic>R</italic>)-1-(benzo[<italic>b</italic>]thien-3-ylcarbonyl)–2-methyl-2-azetidinyl]carbonyl][(3-chlorophenyl)methyl]amino]butanoic acid (GLPG0974) (pIC<sub>50</sub> = 7.58 ± 0.07, mean ± standard error of the mean [SEM], <italic>n</italic> = 3) and ((<italic>S</italic>)-3-(2-(3-chlorophenyl)acetamido)-4-(4-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)butanoic acid) (CATPB) (pIC<sub>50</sub> = 7.63 ± 0.08, mean ± SEM, <italic>n</italic> = 3) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3D</xref>).

Further evidence that MOMBA acts as an orthosteric agonist at hFFA2-DREADD was obtained using a previously described mutation of FFA2 where Arg<sup>180</sup>, an amino acid that co-ordinates with carboxylate-containing orthosteric agonists of FFA2, is replaced by alanine therefore eliminating orthosteric ligand function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Stoddart et al., 2008a</xref>). Whilst both MOMBA- and sorbic acid-stimulated hFFA2-DREADD activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3E</xref>), MOMBA, as well as sorbic acid, lacked activity at the Arg<sup>180</sup>Ala mutant of hFFA2-DREADD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3F</xref>).

These experiments established MOMBA as a useful in vitro hFFA2-DREADD-specific orthosteric agonist, but with no activity at FFA3, suggesting that MOMBA might be a favorable tool to investigate physiological roles of FFA2.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Expression of FFA2 and FFA3 by enteric neurons of the myenteric plexus</title><p>Myenteric plexus is located between circular and longitudinal muscle and is involved in regulating smooth muscle motility.

Upstream of the start codon we engineered a LOX-stop-LOX cassette allowing for conditional expression.

Consistent with these studies, and to further define the suitability of MOMBA for subsequent ex vivo studies, we show here that MOMBA also promoted a concentration-dependent release of GLP-1 from colonic crypts prepared from hFFA2-DREADD-HA mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Moreover, at 100 µM MOMBA was as effective as 1 mM sorbic acid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>), consistent with the higher potency of MOMBA measured in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). These studies also indicated that MOMBA was at least as efficacious as sorbic acid in native cells and tissues.

To examine the role of FFA2 in GLP-1 release further the colons from hFFA2-DREADD-HA mice were dissected and mounted in the chamber of an organ bath in which ligands could be perfused through the tissue. In this preparation MOMBA caused a rapid and sustained increase in the release of GLP-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>) in a manner that was completely inhibited by the hFFA2-specific antagonist CATPB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bolognini et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Sergeev et al., 2016</xref>) a ligand that also antagonizes the hFFA2-DREADD (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bolognini et al., 2019</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3D</xref>).

Single-cell Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging indicated that a proportion of these cells (37.2 ± 8.4% [mean ± SEM]) responded to addition of MOMBA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>) whereas a markedly larger (p &lt; 0.001) proportion (86.9 ± 6.5%, mean± SEM) responded to C3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). The effect of MOMBA clearly reflected activation of hFFA2-DREADD-HA because, once more, this was fully blocked by coaddition of the hFFA2-specific antagonist CATPB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Moreover, in equivalent cells isolated from wild-type mice no response to MOMBA was recorded (1.6 ± 1.0%, mean ± SEM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>), whilst a similar proportion of the cells (85.0 ± 5.5%, mean ± SEM) of the cells responded to C3. These data indicate that functional hFFA2-DREADD-HA and FFA3 receptors are both present on cells of NDG but do not assess directly to what degree they may be coexpressed nor on which of the complex and diverse makeup of cells that comprise the NDG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kupari et al., 2019</xref>) are these receptors expressed.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Dorsal root ganglia express both FFA2 and FFA3</title><p>Whilst expression of FFA2 in cells of the NDG suggests a role in nutrient sensing, in addition to that uncovered previously for FFA3 in sympathetic ganglia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kimura et al., 2011</xref>), we wished to also define possible functional expression and coexpression of receptors for SCFAs in other sensory ganglia. We therefore turned to dorsal root ganglia (DRG). The expression of FFA3 in DRG of mouse has previously been noted by using a FFA3-Red Fluorescent Protein (RFP) reporter mouse line in which expression of RFP, instead of the FFA3 receptor, is driven by <italic>Ffar3</italic> gene promoter sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Nohr et al., 2015</xref>). Limited information on potential expression of FFA2 in such ganglia is available. We examined this in colonic innervating DRGs that had been isolated from the T9-L2 region of the spinal cord of hFFA2-DREADD-HA-expressing mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Anti-HA staining was specific for hFFA2-DREADD-HA expression because no such staining was observed in wild-type mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) whereas neuronal staining with anti-PGP9.5 was equivalent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). As with NDG, whilst a degree of overlap of anti-HA immunostaining was observed with that for the neuronal marker PGP9.5 (9.3 ± 5.8%, mean ± SEM), which was both widely distributed and detected in tissue from both hFFA2-DREADD-HA-expressing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) and CRE-MINUS mice, the most intense anti-HA staining was in cells that were interspersed between the PGP9.5-positive neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Consistent with HA staining, a similar pattern of expression was also observed with X-gal staining corresponding to FFA2 promoter function in tissue from FFA2-KO-βGAL mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, left panel). Furthermore, promoter function and hence expression of FFA3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, middle panel) was also identified in DRGs by X-gal staining in tissue from FFA3-KO-βGAL mice.

Addition of MOMBA produced a rapid and partially sustained increase in intracellular [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>) in a substantial proportion (41.4 ± 10.0%, mean ± SEM) of the cells tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).

Initial stimulation by MOMBA did not prevent subsequent elevation of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] in the same cells in response to C3 following washout of MOMBA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>). This indicates both that at least a proportion of these cells coexpress FFA2 and FFA3 and that exposure to MOMBA did not desensitize cells to subsequent exposure to C3. This is consistent with MOMBA and C3 producing elevation of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] via distinct receptors. Once more the effect of MOMBA was clearly an on-target effect of the ligand at hFFA2-DREADD-HA because responses to MOMBA were absent in cells derived from CRE-MINUS control mice and when cells isolated from hFFA2-DREADD-HA mice were preincubated with the hFFA2 receptor-specific antagonist CATPB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).

Together these data support the notion that in DRG cells isolated from hFFA2-DREADD-HA mice MOMBA stimulates Ca<sup>2+</sup> mobilization via FFA2-DREADD-HA and C3 stimulates Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses via FFA3. To further support the conclusion that responses to C3 in DRG-derived cells from hFFA2-DREADD-HA-expressing mice were indeed mediated via FFA3 we again employed the novel FFA3 activator TUG-1907 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ulven et al., 2020</xref>). This ligand produced substantial elevation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> in isolated DRG-derived cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). As this ligand did not produce such effects in DRG-derived cells isolated from FFA3 knockout mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>), this confirmed the presence and functionality of FFA3 in hFFA2-DREADD-HA-expressing mice.</p></sec><sec id="s2-10"><title>Distinct mechanisms of FFA2- and FFA3-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevation in cells of DRG</title><p>With the higher number of cells that could be isolated from DRGs compared to NDG we were able to explore mechanisms underlying the observed elevation of Ca<sup>2+</sup>. The ability of MOMBA to promote elevation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels in DRG-derived cells taken from hFFA2-DREADD-HA mice was blocked by coincubation with the Gα<sub>q</sub>/Gα<sub>11</sub> inhibitor FR900359 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Schrage et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). This is consistent with the cation being released from inositol 1,4,5 trisphosphate (IP<sub>3</sub>)-sensitive internal stores. By contrast effects of MOMBA were unaffected by pretreatment with pertussis toxin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>) which causes ADP-ribosylation of Gα<sub>i</sub> family subunits.

This is also consistent with the effect of C3 being mediated by FFA3 in these cells, as FFA3 is known to selectively activate G<sub>i</sub> G proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brown et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Stoddart et al., 2008a</xref>), and potentially proceeding via release of β/γ complexes from such G<sub>i</sub>α-containing G-protein heterotrimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Smrcka and Fisher, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Senarath et al., 2018</xref>). These results indicate that activation of each of FFA2 and FFA3 results in elevation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> in DRG-derived cells, but that the two receptors engage with different G proteins and use distinct mechanisms to mediate these effects. This is also entirely consistent with the lack of cross-desensitization of the ligands noted earlier.</p></sec><sec id="s2-11"><title>Gut SCFA receptors promote activation of neurons in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord</title><p>DRG afferents innervate the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. As such we also wished to assess whether SCFAs present in the gut might promote central nervous system stimulation and, if so, if this was mediated by FFA2 and/or FFA3. To do so, initially we perfused either saline or C3 via the rectum into the colon of anaesthetized wild-type mice. Following sacrifice 2 hr later activation of neurons in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord was assessed by measuring induction of expression of the early immediate gene c-Fos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Coggeshall, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boyle et al., 2019</xref>).

While many of the 5-HT receptors play a role in gut physiology, the ligand gated 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptor is mainly involved in signaling from sensory vagal afferents. To assess whether 5-HT<sub>3</sub> also plays a role in gut–spinal interaction induced by activation of SCFA receptors, the 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptor antagonist granisetron (1 µM) was administered prior to the administration of either MOMBA or C3.

In this way, we demonstrate a process whereby SCFAs generated in high amounts by gut microbiota-mediated fermentation of fiber can regulate central activity. Our study also begins to address the mechanism(s) by which this axis operates and the individual contributions of the two receptors. Firstly, we determine that gut sensory afferent neuronal firing is selectively enhanced by activation of FFA3 in the gut. Secondly, that functional FFA2 and FFA3 receptors, coupling via G<sub>q</sub> and G<sub>i</sub> G-protein subfamilies, respectively, are expressed by both neuronal and non-neuronal cells in DRG and NDGs and that gut-generated SCFAs can regulate spinal cord activity via both FFA2 and FFA3 receptors present in the gut, and at the level of extraspinal sensory ganglia (e.g., DRG/NDG).</p><p>These conclusions stem from our application and extension of the concept of DREADD receptors. Although most studies apply this technology in the context of the muscarinic acetylcholine family of GPCRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Armbruster et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Urban and Roth, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wess et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bradley et al., 2018</xref>) we have instead used this to engineer a DREADD of the FFA2 receptor. Previously, we demonstrated that by introduction of two amino acid alterations the hFFA2 receptor loses binding and responsiveness to SCFAs, but in parallel gains responsiveness to sorbic acid, thereby creating an FFA2-DREADD with an associated DREADD ligand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hudson et al., 2012a</xref>). By generating a knockin mouse line expressing an epitope-tagged hFFA2-DREADD-HA in place of the wild-type mouse ortholog we engineered a physiological system whereby in both ex vivo and in vivo settings FFA2-mediated responses are activated directly by sorbic acid whilst FFA3 responses are potentially identified as those responding to SCFAs because now FFA3, but not the FFA2-DREADD, still responds to SCFAs. Using these animals we have previously identified unique and specific roles for FFA2 in enteroendocrine hormone release and adipose tissue function, as well as in gut transit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bolognini et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Despite the success of these earlier studies and that sorbic acid is known to have extremely low toxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Walker, 1990</xref>), we wished to identify other, chemically distinct, hFFA2-DREADD agonist ligands. Here, we describe the identification and validation of the alternative FFA2-DREADD agonist MOMBA, which displays improved potency and equivalent efficacy to sorbic acid. In validation studies, we demonstrated that MOMBA mirrored the results previously described for sorbic acid in FFA2-DREADD-HA-expressing animals and therefore MOMBA was taken forward to investigate novel physiological roles for FFA2/FFA3. The first of these new findings established the expression of hFFA2-DREADD-HA in enteroendocrine cells coexpressing the hormone PYY, and that specific activation of the FFA2-DREADD results in PYY release. Whilst benzoic acids and some of their salts are employed in food preservation it is clearly a marked advantage to now have two structurally distinct agonists that act as activators of the hFFA2-DREADD receptor, not least because the probability that they would have the same ‘off-target’ effects is low.</p><p>Through combinations of FFA2 and FFA3 KO β-galactosidase reporter mouse lines alongside immunological identification of the HA epitope tag sequence built into the FFA2-DREADD-HA construct, we have been able to define expression patterns in mouse of FFA2 and FFA3 throughout the gut–brain axis. Moreover, by application of the FFA2-DREADD-HA/MOMBA pairing and our recent development and characterization of the most potent FFA3 selective activators yet described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ulven et al., 2020</xref>), we also here define that NDG and DRG each express functional FFA2 and FFA3. Although, selective activation of either FFA2 or FFA3 results in elevation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> in cells of these ganglia it is remarkable that, whilst both these GPCRs normally are activated by the same group of SCFAs, their effects on intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels are produced by completely different mechanisms. The significance of these different mechanisms in terms of kinetics of response, post-transcriptional modifications and even transcriptional regulation, and hence plasticity of the ganglia and spinal cord neurons, in integration of functions will be topics of future analysis.</p><p>It is well appreciated that FFA3 couples highly selectively to members of the pertussis toxin-sensitive G<sub>i</sub> family of G proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brown et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Stoddart et al., 2008a</xref>). As such, it was anticipated that in cells and tissues from hFFA2-DREADD-HA-expressing mice FFA3-mediated effects should be blocked by pretreatment with pertussis toxin. An established mechanism to allow G<sub>i</sub>-coupled receptors to elevate Ca<sup>2+</sup> is via β/γ complexes released by activation of G<sub>i</sub>α-containing heterotrimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Smrcka and Fisher, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Senarath et al., 2018</xref>). By contrast FFA2, and indeed the hFFA2-DREADD, in transfected cell lines is able to promote activation and downstream signaling via a wide range of G proteins including G<sub>q/11</sub> and G<sub>i</sub> proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hudson et al., 2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bolognini et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brown et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Stoddart et al., 2008a</xref>). However, in DRG, we can conclude that FFA2 couples to Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling solely via G<sub>q/11</sub> because effects of MOMBA were fully attenuated when cells had been pretreated with the highly selective G<sub>q/11</sub> inhibitor FR900359 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Schrage et al., 2015</xref>). Whilst release of the hormone GLP-1 also requires selective activation of G<sub>q/11</sub> family G proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bolognini et al., 2019</xref>), by contrast, our previous studies established that FFA2-mediated regulation of lipolysis is transduced by G<sub>i</sub>-family G proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bolognini et al., 2019</xref>). Hence, in transfected cells although FFA2 shows the capacity to couple to each of G<sub>q/11</sub> and G<sub>i</sub> and other G proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bolognini et al., 2019</xref>), in physiological cell types the receptor appears to couple selectively to either G<sub>i</sub> (adipose tissue) or G<sub>q/11</sub> (DRG and enteroendocrine cells). How FFA2 selects between coexpressed G proteins in physiologically relevant cell types remain unclear but will also be a topic for future analysis.</p><p>Perhaps most intriguing amongst the outcomes reported herein is the capacity for SCFA receptors that are activated by agonists introduced into the colon to cause activation of cells at the level of the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. These observations support a role for gut microbiota-derived SCFAs in directly co-ordinating and controlling responses between the gut and the central nervous system. Given the rapidly emerging evidence that the microbiota and their dysbiosis can be key contributors to a variety of long-term central nervous system deficits and malfunctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ma et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cussotto et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Rieder et al., 2017</xref>), the current studies provide insights into direct chemical links via a SCFA–gut–brain axis. The fact that we can manipulate this axis via synthetic small molecule chemical ligands (e.g. MOMBA and TUG-1907) suggests that pharmacologically targeting FFA2 or FFA3 might provide a therapeutic strategy for the treatment for various CNS disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Silva et al., 2020</xref>). Future studies will therefore also examine this directly.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Compounds</title><p>Compounds for screening were selected in two stages from the AstraZeneca compound collection. First, a larger set of carboxylic acids was assembled to generate an initial list of actives by screening. The first set of compounds aimed to balance (1) similarity to known agonists (including sorbic acid), (2) chemical diversity, and (3) physicochemical properties consistent with favorable ADME (absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion) profiles of molecules. To this end, carboxylic acids were identified by substructure matching, and compounds with either (1) molecular weight &lt;350 Da, (2) calculated octanol–water partition coefficient log p &gt; 3.5, (3) calculated polar surface area &gt;110 Å<sup>2</sup>, or (4) unwanted chemical groups were removed. After clustering, a diverse subset of 1210 compounds was manually selected. The second stage of compound selection involved identifying close analogs to the active molecules in the first screen. Thus, 320 compounds were selected using multiple substructure searches. Subsequent batches of MOMBA were purchased from FLUOROCHEM, Hadfield, UK.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Primary compound screening</title><p>Compounds were assayed in a single point BRET assay at 100 μM containing 1% (vol/vol) Dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO). Basal wells containing assay buffer with 1% DMSO, and positive stimulation wells containing 1 mM sorbic acid were included in all plates. Each plate contained two ‘<italic>Renilla</italic> luciferase’ points containing cells lacking receptor expression. Data from primary screening were analyzed using Microsoft Excel software and activities of the compounds were calculated using the following formula:</p><p>Activity (%) = (mBRET compound − mBRET basal)/(mBRET stim − mBRET basal) × 100, where mBRET compound is the mBRET value obtained from wells treated with the test compound, mBRET basal is the average of the mBRET values obtained from wells treated with assay buffer and mBRET stim is the average of the mBRET values obtained from cells treated with 1 mM sorbic acid. Compounds were considered as possible hits if the activity was higher than the mean + 3 × SD of the overall activity in the whole assay. Hits were considered confirmed if the activity remained over this threshold in a second independent assay. Reliability of the assay was estimated by calculating <italic>Z</italic>′ values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Zhang et al., 1999</xref>) for each plate, using the formula: <italic>Z</italic>′ = 1 - {[(3 × σstim) + (3 × σbasal)]/(µstim − µbasal)} where σstim and σbasal are the SD values of wells containing 1 mM sorbic acid and assay buffer, respectively and μstim and μbasal are the means for wells containing 1 mM sorbate and assay buffer, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Animal maintenance</title><p>The generation and characterization of both transgenic FFA2-DREADD-HA-expressing and CRE-MINUS mouse lines are detailed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bolognini et al., 2019</xref>.

microbiota interact with the short chain fatty acids receptors FFA2 and FFA3 significantly extends previous findings of your group in particular by identifying a new agonist for FFA2 but also because of the techniques you have used to achieve your results. In particular, that this study relies on a state of the art chemogenetics approach allows you to perform a rigorous validation of the receptor agonists you identified. You have also in your revised manuscript addressed the major concerns that were raised by the reviewers in the previous round of reviews and we believe this paper will have a significant impact in the field.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.73777.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Karsenty</surname><given-names>Gérard</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/00hj8s172</institution-id><institution>Columbia University</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: (i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2020.01.11.902726">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.01.11.902726v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; (ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Mone Zaidi as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>As you will see while reviewer 2 is overall positive, reviewer 1 raises a number of issues regarding the manuscript. Those concerns are:</p><p>– The use of of a whole-body Cre mouse which may call into questions the conclusions of the paper.</p><p>– Another concern the lack of Cre-minus controls in various experiments.</p><p>– The reviewer also noted that there is not a strong rationale presented in the manuscript for the focus on the DRG.</p><p>Given the extent of the concerns raised by reviewer 1 I am sorry to say that the paper is not acceptable for publication in its present form. We would however, be happy to consider a revised version of the paper provided it addresses ALL the concerns of reviewer 1 and 2. Those are deemed essential revisions by the editors.</p><p>We hope you will find the reviews constructive.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. Why are wild type C57BL/6 mice used as controls in the BOMBA motility studies of Figure 2? A more appropriate control would be the CRE-MINUS mice that do not express hFFA2-DREADD. For the motility studies, these animals are essentially FFA2 KO, and MOMBA should not activate FFA3. Do these animals show no effect on motility after BOMBA treatment?</p><p>2. There is a similar problem with the DRG studies of Figure 4. On page 13, CRE-MINUS mice are mentioned in reference to Figure 4, but the Figure itself is labeled C57BL/6, and on page 14, wild type littermates are mentioned. For the DRG studies, studying CRE-MINUS mice would provide powerful evidence that expression of the knockin receptor is not leaky, but is it not clear that this was done.</p><p>3. In the c-Fos activation studies of Figure 5, we are provided data with CRE-MINUS mice, but only in the setting of MOMBA. No results are shown for saline or C3. Why this omission?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This is a very solid and convincing study. The manuscript is well written and the data compelling support the authors' notion of a SCFA-gut-brain axis. This will considerably extend understanding of microbiota-produced SCFA actions in the body. Although the manuscript has many strengths, I am puzzled by the need for screens of chemical libraries to identify new agonists for the designer FFA transgene. Possibly some text needs to be added to allow for appreciation of this point.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.73777.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1.

Why this omission?</p></disp-quote><p>To address the reviewers concerns we have added an important control – that of saline in CRE-minus mice this now gives the control for any off-target activity of MOMBA, which not detected (page 32, Figures 5A and 5F).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>This is a very solid and convincing study. The manuscript is well written and the data compelling support the authors' notion of a SCFA-gut-brain axis. This will considerably extend understanding of microbiota-produced SCFA actions in the body. Although the manuscript has many strengths, I am puzzled by the need for screens of chemical libraries to identify new agonists for the designer FFA transgene. Possibly some text needs to be added to allow for appreciation of this point.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their support – we point the reviewer to the answer in the public review regarding the screen.</p></body></sub-article></article>
