antibiotics. The rRNA-modifying enzyme Cfr methylates an adenosine nucleotide within the peptidyl transferase center, resulting in the C-8 methylation of A2503 (m<sup>8</sup>A2503). Acquisition of <italic>cfr</italic> results in resistance to eight classes of ribosome-targeting antibiotics. Despite the prevalence of this resistance mechanism, it is poorly understood whether and how bacteria modulate Cfr methylation to adapt to antibiotic pressure. Moreover, direct evidence for how m<sup>8</sup>A2503 alters antibiotic binding sites within the ribosome is lacking. In this study, we performed directed evolution of Cfr under antibiotic selection to generate Cfr variants that confer increased resistance by enhancing methylation of A2503 in cells. Increased rRNA methylation is achieved by improved expression and stability of Cfr through transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms, which may be exploited by pathogens under antibiotic stress as suggested by natural isolates. Using a variant that achieves near-stoichiometric methylation of rRNA, we determined a 2.2 Å cryo-electron microscopy structure of the Cfr-modified ribosome. Our structure reveals the molecular basis for broad resistance to antibiotics and will inform the design of new antibiotics that overcome resistance mediated by Cfr.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Antibiotics treat or prevent infections by killing bacteria or slowing down their growth. A large proportion of these drugs do this by disrupting an essential piece of cellular machinery called the ribosome which the bacteria need to make proteins. However, over the course of the treatment, some bacteria may gain genetic alterations that allow them to resist the effects of the antibiotic.</p><p>Antibiotic resistance is a major threat to global health, and understanding how it emerges and spreads is an important area of research. Recent studies have discovered populations of resistant bacteria carrying a gene for a protein named chloramphenicol-florfenicol resistance, or Cfr for short. Cfr inserts a small modification in to the ribosome that prevents antibiotics from inhibiting the production of proteins, making them ineffective against the infection. To date, Cfr has been found to cause resistance to eight different classes of antibiotics. Identifying which mutations enhance its activity and protect bacteria is vital for designing strategies that fight antibiotic resistance.</p><p>To investigate how the gene for Cfr could mutate and make bacteria more resistant, Tsai et al. performed a laboratory technique called directed evolution, a cyclic process which mimics natural selection. Genetic changes were randomly introduced in the gene for the Cfr protein and bacteria carrying these mutations were treated with tiamulin, an antibiotic rendered ineffective by the modification Cfr introduces into the ribosome. Bacteria that survived were then selected and had more mutations inserted. By repeating this process several times, Tsai et al. identified ‘super’ variants of the Cfr protein that lead to greater resistance.</p><p>The experiments showed that these variants boosted resistance by increasing the proportion of ribosomes that contained the protective modification. This process was facilitated by mutations that enabled higher levels of Cfr protein to accumulate in the cell. In addition, the current study allowed, for the first time, direct visualization of how the Cfr modification disrupts the effect antibiotics have on the ribosome.</p><p>These findings will make it easier for clinics to look out for bacteria that carry these ‘super’ resistant mutations. They could also help researchers design a new generation of antibiotics that can overcome resistance caused by the Cfr protein.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Cfr</kwd><kwd>directed evolution</kwd><kwd>antibiotic resistance</kwd><kwd>RNA modifications</kwd><kwd>peptidyl transferase center</kwd><kwd>cryoEM</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AI137270</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fujimori</surname><given-names>Danica Galonić</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100008982</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1650113</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tsai</surname><given-names>Kaitlyn</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008069</institution-id><institution>University of California, San Francisco</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tsai</surname><given-names>Kaitlyn</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F32GM133129</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Young</surname><given-names>Iris D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM123159</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fraser</surname><given-names>James S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Sanghvi-Agarwal Innovation Award</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fraser</surname><given-names>James S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Directed evolution of the resistance enzyme Cfr under antibiotic selection identifies increased Cfr expression and stability as strategies to boost resistance and reveals that Cfr modification of the ribosome confers resistance by sterically occluding binding of antibiotics.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>A large portion of clinically relevant antibiotics halt bacterial growth by binding to the ribosome and inhibiting protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Tenson and Mankin, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Wilson, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arenz and Wilson, 2016</xref>). Since antibiotic binding sites are primarily composed of ribosomal RNA (rRNA), rRNA-modifying enzymes that alter antibiotic binding pockets are central to evolved resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Vester and Long, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Wilson, 2014</xref>). The rRNA-methylating enzyme Cfr modifies an adenosine nucleotide located within the peptidyl transferase center (PTC), a region of the ribosome essential for catalyzing peptide bond formation and consequently, a common target for antibiotics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Schwarz et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kehrenberg et al., 2005</xref>). Cfr is a radical SAM enzyme that methylates the C8 carbon of adenosine at position 2,503 (m<sup>8</sup>A2503, <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> numbering) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jensen et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kaminska et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Yan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Yan and Fujimori, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Grove et al., 2011</xref>). Due to the proximal location of A2503 to many antibiotic binding sites, introduction of a single methyl group is sufficient to cause resistance to eight classes of antibiotics simultaneously: <bold>ph</bold>enicols, <bold>l</bold>incosamides, <bold>o</bold>xazolidinones, <bold>p</bold>leuromutilins, <bold>s</bold>treptogramin <bold>A</bold> (PhLOPS<sub>A</sub>), in addition to nucleoside analog A201A, hygromycin A, and 16-membered macrolides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Long et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Smith and Mankin, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Polikanov et al., 2015</xref>). Among rRNA modifying enzymes, this extensive cross-resistance phenotype is unique to Cfr and presents a major clinical problem.</p><p>Cfr emergence in human pathogens appears to be a recent event, with the first case reported in 2007 from a patient-derived <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> isolate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Toh et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arias et al., 2008</xref>). Since then, the <italic>cfr</italic> gene has been identified across the globe in both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Shen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Vester, 2018</xref>) and has been associated with several clinical resistance outbreaks to the oxazolidinone antibiotic, linezolid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Morales et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Locke et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bonilla et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cai et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Layer et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lazaris et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dortet et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Weßels et al., 2018</xref>). The vast spread of Cfr is attributed to its association with mobile genetic elements and relatively low impact on bacterial fitness, suggesting that <italic>cfr</italic> can be rapidly disseminated within bacterial populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">LaMarre et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Schwarz et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Due to the ability of Cfr to confer resistance to several antibiotics simultaneously, it is critical to understand how bacteria may adapt under antibiotic pressure to enhance Cfr activity and bolster protection against ribosome-targeting molecules. Identification of Cfr mutations that improve resistance will also be critical for informing clinical surveillance and designing strategies to counteract resistance. A major limitation in our current understanding of Cfr-mediated resistance is the lack of structural insight into changes in the ribosome as a result of Cfr modification. Steric occlusion of antibiotic binding has been proposed as a model to rationalize altered antibiotic susceptibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Polikanov et al., 2015</xref>). Additionally, the observation that A2503 can adopt both <italic>syn</italic> and <italic>anti</italic>-conformations in previously reported ribosome structures suggests that methylation may regulate conformation of the base, as previously proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Toh et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Schlünzen et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Tu et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Stojković et al., 2020</xref>). However, direct evidence for how m<sup>8</sup>A2053 alters antibiotic binding sites to inform the design of next-generation molecules that can overcome Cfr resistance is lacking.</p><p>In this study, we identified mechanisms that enhance antibiotic resistance by performing directed evolution of a <italic>cfr</italic> found in a clinical MRSA isolate under antibiotic selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barlow and Hall, 2003</xref>). The obtained highly resistant Cfr variants show increased rRNA methylation, driven primarily by robust improvements in Cfr cellular levels, achieved either by higher transcription or increased translation and improved cellular stability. In particular, mutation of the second Cfr amino acid to lysine strongly enhances translation and resistance. Finally, we used an evolved variant which achieves near-stoichiometric rRNA methylation to generate a high-resolution cryo-electron microscopy (EM) structure of the Cfr-modified <italic>E. coli</italic> ribosome. The obtained structural insights provide a rationale for how m<sup>8</sup>A2503 causes resistance to ribosome antibiotics.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Evolved Cfr variants confer enhanced antibiotic resistance</title><p>To perform directed evolution of Cfr, we used error-prone PCR (EP-PCR) to randomly introduce 1–3 mutations into the <italic>cfr</italic> gene obtained from a clinical MRSA isolate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Toh et al., 2007</xref>), herein referred to as CfrWT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>).

After two rounds of evolution, wild-type Cfr was no longer detected, indicating that the introduced mutations provide enhanced survivability in the presence of tiamulin. After five rounds of mutation and selection, we performed two rounds of selection without mutagenesis, and with high tiamulin concentrations, thus leading to fixation of mutations that provide robust resistance.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Evolved variants of Cfr exhibit improved resistance to PhLOPS<sub>A</sub> ribosome antibiotics.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Evolution of Cfr under selection by the PTC-targeting antibiotic tiamulin.

We then evaluated the ability of CfrWT and CfrV4 to methylate a 23S rRNA fragment (2447–2625) in vitro by monitoring the incorporation of radioactivity from [<sup>3</sup>H-methyl] <italic>S-</italic>adenosylmethionine (SAM) into RNA substrate under saturating conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bauerle et al., 2018</xref>).

To monitor Cfr protein levels, we inserted a flexible linker followed by a C-terminal FLAG tag, which does not alter resistance (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Interestingly, immunoblotting against FLAG revealed that in addition to full-length Cfr, N-terminally truncated Cfr proteins are also produced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). The truncations result from translation initiation at internal methionines but do not contribute to resistance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>), indicating that they are non-functional enzymes unable to methylate A2503. The smaller molecular weight truncation is present in higher levels for all Cfr variants compared to CfrfWT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>). Interestingly the larger molecular weight truncation is present only in CfrV1/V4/V6 and is generated by the I26M mutation introduced during directed evolution. Quantification of resistance-causative, full-length Cfr proteins alone revealed that the evolved variants achieve ~20–100-fold higher steady-state protein levels than CfrWT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>).</p><p>We measured transcript levels for all variants to assess the contribution of altered transcription to increased protein levels. For Cfr variants with promoter alterations, enhanced production of the Cfr transcript is a large contributor to Cfr protein expression, as CfrV6 and CfrV7 exhibit ~6-fold and ~10-fold enhancement in Cfr mRNA levels compared to CfrWT, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>). We also observe a ~2–3-fold increase in mRNA levels for CfrV1-5.

Despite the observed increase in mRNA levels for CfrV1-5, this alone cannot explain the multi-fold improvement in protein expression and indicates that these variants also boost protein levels through a post-transcriptional process. This is further supported by the expression profiles for CfrV1-5, which are dominated by the full-length protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>). Interestingly, enhanced production of Cfr protein correlates with larger fitness defects in <italic>E. coli</italic>, with an increase in doubling time of ~4 min for CfrV7 compared to empty vector in the absence of antibiotics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Promoter and second position mutations drive Cfr resistance</title><p>Given that the evolved variants achieve robust enhancement in Cfr expression we sought to elucidate the mechanism(s) by which this occurs.

In <italic>E. coli</italic>, the tRNA molecules that decode K(AAA) and I(AUU) are slightly more abundant than the wild-type N(AAU), accounting for 3.0% and 5.4% of the tRNA pool compared to 1.9%, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dong et al., 1996</xref>). To test if tRNA abundance and codon sequence contribute to enhanced translation, we evaluated the impact of synonymous codons on protein expression. Lysine codons AAA and AAG are decoded by the same tRNA<sup>Lys</sup> in <italic>E. coli</italic>. Interestingly, mutating CfrN2K from AAA to AAG, which increases G/C content, did not significantly impact expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>).

While CfrWT is rapidly degraded with a half-life of ~20 min, CfrN2K/I exhibit increased half-lives of ~60 min. These results suggest that mutation of the second amino acid to lysine or isoleucine contributes to improved steady-state expression both by enhancing translation and stability of Cfr in the cell. CfrS39G also exhibits an increased half-life of ~60 min. The half-life increase is the most pronounced for the I26M single point mutant and similar to that of the triple-mutant, CfrV3 (&gt;100 min for both proteins).

Investigation of the densities at these two sites confirmed that the shape of the density dropoff curve for A2503 more closely matched the methylated reference curve while that of A556 more closely matched the unmethylated reference curve, and that the latter site was identified as a strong candidate primarily due to the strong density at all atoms. qPTxM identified no cytosines where the map supported 2′O methylation (<bold>g</bold>).

Given recent synthetic advances that enable more extensive modification of the pleuromutilin scaffold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Murphy et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Farney et al., 2018</xref>), the structural insights we obtained will inform the design of next-generation antibiotics that can overcome Cfr-mediated resistance.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>By relying on directed evolution under antibiotic selection, we identified strategies that increase the ability of a multi-antibiotic resistance determinant Cfr to cause resistance. Enhanced resistance is associated with improved in vivo methylation of rRNA at the C8 position of A2503. The positive correlation between extent of rRNA modification and resistance aligns with previous studies that investigated linezolid resistance caused by mutation of rRNA, where the severity of linezolid resistance was proportional to the number of 23S rRNA alleles harboring the resistance mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Besier et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ebihara et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lobritz et al., 2003</xref>). While alteration of the antibiotic binding site through mutations and enzymatic modification of 23S rRNA are functionally distinct, dependence on the extent of rRNA modification provides parallels between the two mechanisms. Although Cfr-mediated methylation is an enzymatic process, the ability of Cfr to confer resistance is restricted by ribosome assembly. Since the A2503 is only accessible to Cfr prior to incorporation of 23S rRNA into the large ribosomal subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Yan et al., 2010</xref>), the extent of resistance correlates with the ability of the enzyme to methylate 23S rRNA prior to its incorporation into the 50S subunit. The results of our evolution experiment indicate that increasing the intracellular concentrations of Cfr, rather than improving catalysis of an enzyme with a complex radical mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Yan and Fujimori, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">McCusker et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Grove et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bauerle et al., 2018</xref>) is the preferred strategy to increase the proportion of ribosomes with the protective m<sup>8</sup>A2503 modification.</p><p>Investigations into expression levels of CfrWT and its respective mutants revealed that, in addition to full-length protein, a smaller Cfr isoform of ~30 kDa is also produced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3a</xref>). The truncated product is observed when the expression is driven by both the non-native P<sub>tet</sub> and native P<sub>cfr</sub> promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). The smaller product likely results from translation initiation at an internal start codon, as mutation of Met at position 95 abolishes its production. The sequence upstream of M95 is A-rich, which has been demonstrated to promote translation initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Saito et al., 2020</xref>). However, why an internal region of the Cfr ORF would be recognized as an initiation signal is unclear. Truncation of the first 38 residues of Cfr would eliminate a significant portion of the protein, including the N-terminal accessory domain which is likely involved in substrate recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Boal et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Schwalm et al., 2016</xref>). Elimination of this domain provides rationale for why the smaller Cfr isoform does not contribute to resistance, as the protein would likely exhibit perturbed binding to rRNA. Thus, while the truncated product does not contribute to resistance, the potential function of the smaller protein remains elusive and requires further study.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Start codon selection as a proposed mechanism of Cfr inducibility.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Sequence upstream of <italic>cfr</italic> from pSCFS1 (Accession: AJ579365) resistance plasmid from an animal-derived <italic>Staphylococcus sciuri</italic> isolate.

Improved Cfr expression for CfrV6/7 is driven by increased transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>) due to alterations to the P<sub>tet</sub> promoter likely introduced by primer slippage during the EP-PCR step of directed evolution. CfrV6 contains a full duplication of P<sub>tet</sub>, providing two sites for transcription initiation, likely responsible for enhanced <italic>cfr</italic> transcript levels.

Of the tested mutations, I26M provides the largest improvement in stability. Of note, the N-terminally truncated Cfr derived from translation initiation at I26M is rapidly degraded, as no detectable protein is observed after 60 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4e</xref>). However, these results indicate that the costly production and clearance of this nonfunctional protein is offset by the improved cellular stability of the full-length Cfr carrying the I26M mutation. We also observe modest improvements in protein stability with N2K/I mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4e</xref>). In bacteria, the identity of N-terminal residues are important determinants of degradation through N-degron pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dougan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Tobias et al., 1991</xref>). During protein synthesis, the N-terminus is co-translationally processed by two enzymes, peptide deformylase to remove the formyl group from Met (fM) and methionine aminopeptidase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Koubek, 2021</xref>). Based on previous biochemical work, it is unlikely that CfrWT and CfrN2K/I would have different N-terminal processing, since fMN… and fMK/I… are likely to be efficiently de-formylated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Ragusa et al., 1999</xref>) and resistant to methionine excision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hirel et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Frottin et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Xiao et al., 2010</xref>). Although the precise mechanism by which N2K/I improves Cfr stability remains elusive, these mutations may alter recognition by other enzymes important for degradation, such as endopeptidases or L/F-tRNA-protein transferase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Izert et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Ottofuelling et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Of the mutations investigated, N2K is the largest contributor to enhanced Cfr expression and resistance. Although N2K contributes to cellular stability, our results suggest that improved Cfr translation is the dominant role of this mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>). The effect of N-terminal residues (and thus codons near the start site) on early stages of translation has been well documented. Previous work has demonstrated that minimal secondary structure near the start codon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kudla et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Goodman et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bentele et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Boël et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bhattacharyya et al., 2018</xref>) and presence of A/U-rich elements downstream of the translation start site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cifuentes-Goches et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Saito et al., 2020</xref>) are important factors for efficient translation initiation. RNA secondary structure predictions of the region proximal to the start codon suggest that the N2K mutation (AAU to AAA) could disrupt base pairing between the N2 (AAU) codon and the downstream T7 (ACA) codon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>). However, the base pair between the second and seventh codon is predicted to be retained when N2K is encoded by the AAG isocodon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>), which was also able to increase Cfr protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>) and suggests that alternative mechanisms may be responsible for improved translation. While initiation is a major rate-limiting step in protein synthesis, rates of elongation have also been demonstrated to impact translation efficiency, with several proposed models on how the interconnected factors of codon bias, mRNA structure/sequence, and interactions between the ribosome and nascent chain are involved in modulating protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Rodnina, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Choi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Samatova et al., 2020</xref>). For example, recent work investigating the role of codons 3–5 identified that both mRNA sequence and amino acid composition are key determinants of proper elongation at the N-terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Verma et al., 2019</xref>). Although the mechanism is poorly understood, previous studies have discovered that presence of an AAA lysine codon after the start site is associated with improved translation efficiency in certain contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Looman et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Stenström et al., 2001a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Stenström et al., 2001b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Stenström and Isaksson, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Sato et al., 2001</xref>). Our results indicate that the effect of N2K on early steps of translation elongation may be mediated, at least in part, by tRNA abundance, but the exact impact of Lys2 on translation requires further study. Interestingly, the observed internal translation start sites (I26M and M95) that are responsible for producing Cfr truncations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>) contain a lysine immediately after methionine, further highlighting the putative role for lysine codons in early steps of translation.</p><p>To date, only a few <italic>S. aureus</italic> Cfr variants have been reported and no mutations matching those obtained from directed evolution have been found in clinical isolates. However, enhanced expression through positioning of Lys as the second amino acid of Cfr can be recapitulated by accessing an upstream translational start site found in a native sequence context of <italic>cfr</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). In the specific case of the pSCFS1 resistance plasmid, the sequence upstream of the annotated start codon, which we validated as the start site under the experimental conditions tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>), contains regulatory elements that have been proposed to modulate Cfr expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Schwarz et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kehrenberg et al., 2007</xref>). It is plausible that in response to antibiotics, the upstream start codon is used to add three amino acids (MKE) to the N-terminus of Cfr and thus placement of a lysine (K) at position 2 of the newly expressed protein, analogous to the N2K mutation. Although start codon selection requires further investigation, N-terminal addition of MKE to Cfr expressed under non-native P<sub>tet</sub> promoter phenocopies the N2K directed evolution mutation, resulting in increased expression and resistance compared to CfrWT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Since our assessment of the evolved variants indicates that an increase in Cfr expression is accompanied by a decrease in fitness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>), start site selection in response to antibiotic pressure would mitigate detrimental impact on fitness while enabling higher resistance when acutely needed.</p><p>Interestingly, mutations obtained through directed evolution have been observed in Cfr homologs that share less than 80% sequence identity with Cfr. Methionine (M) at position 26 is observed for the functionally characterized Cfr homologs Cfr(B) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Deshpande et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Marín et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hansen and Vester, 2015</xref>) and Cfr(D) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Pang et al., 2020</xref>), which have been recovered from human-derived isolates and share 74% and 64% amino acid identity with Cfr, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Schwarz et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">Figure 4—figure supplement 5</xref>). We also observe lysine (K) at position 2, methionine (M) at position 26, and glycine (G) at position 39, akin to N2K, I26M, and S39G mutations, for a number of Cfr homologs that clade with functional Cfr or Cfr-like genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Stojković et al., 2019</xref>). While the precise roles of these residues within less well-characterized and more distantly related Cfr proteins requires further study, these observations indicate that directed evolution accessed sequence space that is already being exploited by proteins that are, or are hypothesized to be, functional Cfr resistance enzymes.</p><p>In addition to identifying mechanisms that increase Cfr-mediated resistance, directed evolution of Cfr also provided an indispensable reagent that enabled structural determination of the Cfr-modified ribosome. The high-resolution cryo-EM structure revealed that broad resistance is due to steric effects of the judiciously positioned methyl group within the shared binding site of PTC-targeting antibiotics. Lack of notable changes in position or orientation of A2503 or surrounding PTC nucleotides upon Cfr methylation suggests that the resulting modification does not obstruct the translation capabilities of the ribosome. This absence of PTC disruption is consistent with the observation that the fitness cost of Cfr acquisition is not due to ribosome modification, but rather results from expression of the exogenous protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">LaMarre et al., 2011</xref>). Importantly, overlay with existing structures containing PTC-targeting antibiotics provides direct visualization of chemical moieties that are sterically impacted by m<sup>8</sup>A2503 and will inform the design of antibiotic derivatives that can overcome resistance mediated by Cfr.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>E. coli</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">ER2267</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Tawfik lab stock</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>E. coli</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">BW25113</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Keio collection</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>E. coli</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">BW25113 <italic>acrB::Kan</italic></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Keio collection</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>E. coli</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Rosetta2 BL21(DE3) pLysS</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Novagen</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>E. coli</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">MRE600</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">ATCC</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Gene(<italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>cfr</italic> gene</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">Accession: EF450709.1</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Gene(<italic>Staphylococcus sciuri</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Sequence upstream <italic>cfr</italic> gene</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Genscript</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Accession: AJ579365</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">pZA (plasmid)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Wellner et al., 2013</xref>;

In brief, reactions of 20 µl volume were prepared by combining 4 µl 5× iScript buffer, 1 µl iScript RNase H + MMLV reverse transcriptase, 5 µl nuclease-free water, and 10 µl of DNase-treated RNA. Reactions were incubated for 5  min at 25°C, followed by 20  min at 42°C and 1  min at 95°C. SsoAdvanced Universal SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad) was used for 10  μl qPCR reactions in a 96-well plate as described above. Each reaction contained 5 µl of 2× Supermix, 0.3 µM of each forward and reverse primer, and 4 µl of tenfold diluted cDNA. Reactions containing cfr, recA, and luc primers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>) were performed for each fraction, including a no template control and no reverse transcription control for each primer set on each plate.

In brief, the relative abundance of each target mRNA normalized to luciferase RNA spike-in. The percentage of target mRNA found across gradient fractions was calculated by dividing the amount of target mRNA detected in one fraction by the sum of the target mRNA detected in all fractions.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Protein degradation assay</title><sec id="s4-13-1"><title>Bacterial growth and rifampicin treatment</title><p><italic>E. coli</italic> expressing CfrWT or Cfr mutants were grown at 37°C with shaking by diluting an overnight culture 1:100 into 25 ml of LB media containing ampicillin (100 µg/ml) an AHT inducer (30 ng/ml). When cells reached an OD<sub>600</sub> ~0.4–0.5, rifampicin (Sigma-Aldrich) was subsequently added to a final concentration of 100 µg/ml, and cultures were allowed continued incubation at 37°C with shaking.

Sample concentration was determined by NanoDrop UV spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific), where A<sub>260</sub>=1 corresponds to 24 pmol of 70S ribosome. Tight-coupled 70S ribosomes were purified as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Khusainov et al., 2017</xref>). In brief, 70S ribosomes were purified on a 15–30% w/v sucrose gradient in Buffer A. Sucrose gradients were generated using a Bio-Comp Gradient Master. 300–400 pmol of 70S ribosomes were loaded on each sucrose gradient. Ultracentrifugation was performed using a SW Ti41 rotor (Beckman Coulter) for 75,416<italic>×g</italic> for 16 hr at 4°C.

Data were collected using serialEM on the in-house Titan Krios X-FEG instrument (Thermo Fisher Scientific) operating at an acceleration voltage of 300 kV and a nominal underfocus of Δz=0.2–1.5 μm at a nominal magnification of 29,000 (calibrated physical pixel size of 0.822 Å). We recorded 2055 movies using a K2 direct electron detector camera in super-resolution mode with dose fractionation (80 individual frames were collected, starting from the first one). Total exposure time was 8 s, with a total dose of 80 e- (or 1 e-/Å2/frame). Images in the stack were aligned using the whole-image motion correction and patch motion correction (5×5 patches) methods in MotionCor2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Zheng et al., 2017</xref>). Before image processing, all micrographs were checked for quality and 1531 best were selected for the next step of image processing. The contrast transfer function of each image was determined using GCTF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Zhang, 2016</xref>) as a standalone program. For particle selection, we have used Relion 3.0 autopicking procedure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Scheres, 2012</xref>). For the first steps of image processing, we used data binned by a factor of 8 (C8 images). During the first round of 2D classification, we removed only images with ice or other contaminants. Subsequently, the initial structure was generated using the ab initio procedure in CryoSPARC v2.0. Following this step, we performed Relion 3D classification with bin by four data (C4) in order to exclude bad particles. The resulting 141,549 particle images of ribosomes were used for subsequent classification and refinement procedures. For the initial refinement, we used a spherical mask, which was followed by further refinement using a mask around the stable part of 50S (excluding L1 stalk, L7/L12 region). A further improved cryo-EM map was obtained by using CTF-refinement procedure from Relion 3.0. The post-processing procedure implemented in Relion 3.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Scheres, 2012</xref>) was applied to the final maps with appropriate masking, B-factor sharpening (automatic B-factor estimation was –55.86) and resolution estimation to avoid over-fitting (final resolution after post-processing with 50S mask applied was 2.7 Å). Subsequently, the stack of CTF-refined particles was processed in a new version of CryoSPARC v2.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Punjani et al., 2017</xref>). After homogeneous refinement, the same stack of particles was additionally refined in cisTEM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Grant et al., 2018</xref>). After Auto-Refine (with automasking within cisTEM), we performed local refinement using 50S mask (the same one used for refinement in Relion) and also applied per particle CTF refinement as implemented in cisTEM software. After such refinement, the resolution was improved to 2.2 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Final atomic model comprised of ∼92,736 atoms (excluding hydrogens) across the 3015 nucleotides and 3222 amino acids of 28 ribosomal proteins. Proteins L7, L10, L11, and L31 were not modeled in.

Of a total of 39 sites with density suggesting possible modifications, 2 were C8-methyl adenosines, A556 and A2503. None of the identified sites were 2′O-methyl cytosines. To calculate expected density dropoff curves for methylated and unmethylated nucleotides, the <italic>phenix.fmodel</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams et al., 2010</xref>) tool was used to generate noise-free maps from models of a single nucleotide in each state, and scripts modified from qPTxM were used to collect measurements of the density at 0.1 Å intervals along the vector of the proposed methylation. Means and standard deviations were calculated for densities at the four positions tested by qPTxM on each nucleotide, from which Z-scores were then calculated for selected nucleotides. To measure densities for both the best tested rotamer of m(2′O)C 2498 and the modeled rotamer, densities along the 2′O-methyl bond were compared between the files generated by qPTxM run two times as described above, once with prune=True (removing the modeled methyl group and placing the rotameric methyl with the strongest density) and once with prune=False (leaving the modeled methyl group

by a RNA-modifying enzyme Cfr, a protein that confers resistance to multiple ribosome-targeting antibiotics due to methylation of the rRNA residue A2503 on the large ribosomal subunit. Tsai et al. identify the mutational hotspots that increase Cfr activity and show how a single methyl group on A2503 can hamper the antibiotic binding. The paper is an important contribution to our understanding of antibiotic resistance and is of broad interest to readers in the field of antibiotic resistance, biochemistry, structural biology, and medicinal chemistry.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.70017.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Rodnina</surname><given-names>Marina V</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution>Max Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry</institution><country>Germany</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="box1"><p>In the interests of transparency, eLife publishes the most substantive revision requests and the accompanying author responses.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Directed evolution of the rRNA methylating enzyme Cfr reveals molecular basis of antibiotic resistance&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Michael Marletta as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The referees agreed that the experiments were carefully performed and interpreted. The primary experimental revision (point 1) relates to providing a suitable control that tRNA abundance determines the higher translational efficiency of the mutant Cfr constructs. There are also suggestions for further experiments that would strengthen the paper (points 2, 4, 5), but we feel this is optional and could be viewed as beyond the scope of this particular study. I therefore leave it to you whether you perform these additional experiments (which might well be interesting).</p><p>1. Directed evolution yielded protein isoforms that are better expressed and are more stable. The authors show that mutant mRNAs are shifted towards heavier polysomes and suggest that this may be due to the tRNA abundance effect (Figure 4 – supplement 1).

This would widen the scope of the paper by generalizing the conclusions for gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.

The authors superimposed the complex structure of an archeal ribosome and linezolid and tiamulin for explaining the resistance mechanism. However, this resistance mechanism was not found in archaea and thus these ribosomes are less relevant for clinical aspects. More appropriate models to be used are of bacterial ribosomes in complex with these antibiotics, i.e. D. radiodurans ribosome in complex with tiamulin (PDBID 1XBP) and the pathogen <italic>S. aureus</italic> ribosome in complex with linezolid (PDBID 4WFA).</p><p>8. The paper would benefit from an analysis of the natural variability of the evolved sites. It is mentioned that clinical isolates do not have these exact substitutions, but a supplemental multiple sequence alignment of homologues with these positions marked would anyway be interesting. For example, an N2K variant appears in the results of a quick blastp search in a Bacillus Cfr.</p><p>9. Another remaining question is how the novel variants affects susceptibilities to ribosome-targeting antibiotics in other structural classes, including nucleoside analogues and macrolides. In the introduction the authors mention that in addition to PhLOPSA antibiotics, Cfr can confer resistance to nucleoside analog A201A, hygromycin A, and 16-membered macrolides. However, this is not returned to in the paper. MIC experiments with an expanded selection of antibiotics would be really nice to see if possible. Similarly, does the structure explain the previously observed cross-resistance that goes beyond PhLOPS(A)?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The paper by Tsai et al. describes the antibiotic resistance mechanism caused by an RNA-modifying enzyme Cfr. The paper is important, as Cfr confers resistance to eight classes of antibiotics (collectively known as PhLOPSA). The strength of the manuscript is in the combination of different experimental techniques. These include directed evolution of Cfr; mass spectrometry analysis of the modification site in the 23S rRNA; mutational studies with quantitative analysis of their effect on the mRNA and protein levels of Cfr in the cell and its link to resistance; and finally, a high-resolution of cryo-EM of the ribosome with the fully modified m2m8A2503, the product of Cfr activity. Using directed evolution, the authors identified two mutational hotspots that increased resistance, one due to a more active promotor and another due to a mutation of residue N2 in Cfr. They demonstrate that Cfr methylates C8 of m2A2503 and that Cfr mutants are more efficient in installing the m8 modification. However, the catalytic activity of the mutants is not affected. Rather, the cellular concentration of Cfr is increased due to higher translation efficiency and higher Cfr protein stability. Finally, the cryo-EM structure clearly shows the modified nucleotide, which provides explanations as to how a single methyl group causes resistance to so many antibiotics.</p><p>The work is elegantly designed, and the experiments are of high technical quality.

In this mechanism, the enzyme Cfr methylates the rRNA nucleotide 2503, which is part of the typical binding pocket of these antibiotics. By modifying the binding pocket architecture, binding of the drug is inhibited, and resistance to bacterial antibiotics is achieved. The authors aimed to decipher the resistance mechanism by structural studies, but the moderate Cfr enzyme activity of <italic>S. aureus</italic> hampered the ability to study such methylated ribosomes.</p><p>The authors decipher how antibiotic resistance can be increased by introducing mutations into the modifier enzyme Cfr by using a directed evolution approach. Using this approach, a high percentage of mutated ribosomes suitable for structural study were achieved. They discover that the mutated Cfr enzyme is not more efficient in methylation, but rather that the mutations alter active intercellular protein levels, and therefore higher methylation ratio is achieved. In addition, they found that the introduced mutations in Cfr enhance its translation efficiency as it is shown to be part of well-translated mRNAs, and this is the leading cause for higher methylation levels of the mutated Cfr. For some of their Cfr mutants, it is demonstrated that the increase in the expression of mutated Cfr is due to an improved translation that is mediated by tRNA abundance. The Cfr mutants show increased half-life, due to enhanced translation and decreased degradation. This part of the paper is the major technical advance.</p><p>The cryo-EM 2.2 A structure of an <italic>E. coli</italic> ribosome with a C8-modified 2503 rRNA nucleotide was obtained by using the mutated stable Cfr, which enables ~90% of 2503 methylation. Furthermore, by superimposing few published available antibiotics-ribosome complex structures on the current new mutated ribosome structure, the authors provide a valid explanation of the resistance mechanism. They demonstrate how the addition of a methyl group at the C8 position of A2503 will cause a steric clash with a bound drug and preclude its binding. This single structural change in the ribosome upon methylation may indeed be used for drug design for overcoming antibiotic resistance.</p><p>1. It should be mentioned that the cfr mutations gained using directed evolution are located in sites of the proteins which are distant from its active site. The most effective mutation (in residue 2) is in a separate domain from the active site. Actually, all the mutations are mainly at the surface of the Cfr. This is clear from Figure 1b and should be added.</p><p>2.

The evolved sites of Cfr are not very interesting in respect to protein function per se, as their effect seems mostly about increasing expression levels rather than altering enzymatic activity. However, these variants were clearly invaluable for enabling the authors to fulfil their aim of generating a high-resolution structure.

To address it, we have carried out an in-depth investigation. To perform tRNA overexpression experiments, we cloned the tRNA<sup>Asn</sup> gene, which decodes the WT AAU codon, into a pBSTNAV vector.

Additionally, if there did exist an increased level of charged Asn-tRNA<sup>Asn</sup> in our overexpression system, previous work suggests that disrupting the balance of the charged tRNA pool competing for the ribosomal A-site negatively impacts the fidelity of protein synthesis (Kramer and Farabaugh, 2007). Together, these results indicate that while in theory overexpression of tRNA<sup>Asn</sup> would allow additional testing of our model, the fitness defects associated with this experimental setup makes interpretation of results challenging.</p><p>However, we would like to point out that while we were unable to increase WT expression by boosting levels of tRNA<sup>Asn</sup>, we have demonstrated that mutating the N2I directed evolution codon (AUU) to the Ile codon decoded by a rare tRNA<sup>Ile</sup> (AUA) does diminish protein levels by ~2-fold (Figure 4 —figure supplement 2). This result suggests that tRNA abundance of the second codon may be a contributor to improved Cfr expression, and we state this in the text as follows:</p><p>“The isoleucine AUA codon is decoded by the low-abundant tRNA<sup>Ile2</sup> (Del Tito et al. 1995; Nakamura, Gojobori, and Ikemura 2000).

For Cfr variants containing N2 mutations (CfrV1-5), we observe higher levels of the M95 truncation compared to CfrWT (~2-15 fold, new Figure 2 —figure supplement 4). However, higher expression of the truncation is likely explained by the increased transcript levels for these variants (~1.5-3 fold, Figure 2c). It is well documented that improved translation often results in improved mRNA stability due to increased ribosome occupancy and shielding of the transcript from degradation machinery (Braun et al., 1998; Deana and Belasco, 2005; Edri and Tuller, 2014). In our work, for example, the ~3 fold increase in the CfrV4 transcript level (Figure 2c) is likely explained by its dramatically improved translation observed in polysome analysis (Figure 4d, Figure 4 —figure supplement 1c).</p><p>For the N2 mutations alone, we observe higher levels of the M95 truncation for N2K mutants (encoded by AAA or AAG, ~2.5 and ~5 fold respectively, new Figure 3 —figure supplement 1, new Figure 4 —figure supplement 2). Analogous to the Cfr variants, higher expression of the truncation is likely explained by the increased transcript levels of N2K caused by improved translation (Figure 4c). Given that N2I (encoded by AUU or AUA) is not as robustly expressed, and likely not as well translated, the transcriptional impact would be less pronounced, resulting in truncation levels similar to CfrWT (new Figure 3 —figure supplement 1, new Figure 4 —figure supplement 2).</p><p>We have edited the text accordingly to incorporate these observations in the Results section:</p><p>“The truncations result from translation initiation at internal methionines but do not contribute to resistance (Figure 2 —figure supplement 3), indicating that they are non-functional enzymes unable to methylate A2503.

Similarly, nascent peptides with isoleucine (I) at position 2 are also likely to be efficiency deformylated and resistance to Met excision (Frottin et al., 2006; Hirel et al., 1989; Xiao et al., 2010).</p><fig id="sa2fig5" position="float"><label>Author response image 5.</label><caption><title>MS/MS peptide coverage for CfrWT.</title></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-70017-sa2-fig5-v1.tif"/></fig><fig id="sa2fig6" position="float"><label>Author response image 6.</label><caption><title>MS/MS peptide coverage for CfrV4.</title></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-70017-sa2-fig6-v1.tif"/></fig><p>Although we cannot completely rule out its involvement in stability, these preliminary results and existing biochemical evidence suggest that differential co-translational processing of the N-terminus, which would invoke ”classic” N-end rule or fMet/N-degron pathways (Izert et al., 2021), is likely not responsible for the observed improved stability of N2K/I mutants.</p><p>Although the precise mechanism by which N2K/I improve Cfr stability remains elusive, these mutants could alter recognition by other enzymes that may be important in regulating degradation, such as endopeptidases or L/F-tRNA-protein transferase (LFTR). For example, it was discovered that LFTR can add primary destabilizing residues to Nt Met, creating an N-degron (Dougan et al., 2012), but its efficiency can depend on the identity of the second amino acid (Ottofuelling et al., 2021).</p><p>We have modified the text to include discussion on how N2K/I may be involved in protein stability, which now reads as follows.</p><p>“We also observe modest improvements in protein stability with N2K/I mutants (Figure 4e). In bacteria, the identity of N-terminal residues are important determinants of degradation through N-degron pathways (Dougan, Micevski, and Truscott 2012; Tobias et al. 1991). During protein synthesis, the N-terminus is co-translationally processed by two enzymes, peptide deformylase to remove the formyl group from Met (fM) and methionine aminopeptidase (Koubek et al. 2021). Based on previous biochemical work, it is unlikely that CfrWT and CfrN2K/I would have different N-terminal processing, since fMN… and fMK/I… are likely to be efficiently de-formylated (Ragusa et al. 1999) and resistant to methionine excision (Hirel et al. 1989; Frottin et al. 2006; Xiao et al. 2010). Although the precise mechanism by which N2K/I improves Cfr stability remains elusive, these mutations may alter recognition by other enzymes important for degradation, such as endopeptidases or L/F-tRNA-protein transferase (Izert, Klimecka, and Górna 2021; Ottofuelling et al. 2021).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Cfr methylates C8 of A2503. Mass spectra clearly distinguish the peaks of m2m8A2503 and m2A2503. However, this appears to rely on the assumption that A2503 is completely m2-modified. Has this been checked? What would be the mass of the unmodified fragment and was it identified in the spectra? Can the authors exclude the appearance of m8A2503 species?

This would widen the scope of the paper by generalizing the conclusions for gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.

The authors superimposed the complex structure of an archeal ribosome and linezolid and tiamulin for explaining the resistance mechanism. However, this resistance mechanism was not found in archaea and thus these ribosomes are less relevant for clinical aspects. More appropriate models to be used are of bacterial ribosomes in complex with these antibiotics, i.e. D. radiodurans ribosome in complex with tiamulin (PDBID 1XBP) and the pathogen <italic>S. aureus</italic> ribosome in complex with linezolid (PDBID 4WFA).</p></disp-quote><p>Previous SAR work has demonstrated that the C5 group of linezolid is likely responsible for steric collision with m<sup>8</sup>A2503.

For the remaining structures (PDB: 3CPW in yellow and PDB: 3DLL in pink), while both modeled C5 conformations would sterically clash with m<sup>8</sup>A2503, 3CPW exhibits superior density for the C5 moiety.

The paper would benefit from an analysis of the natural variability of the evolved sites.

We have added a supplementary figure and a section to the discussion which reads as follows:</p><p>“Interestingly, mutations obtained through directed evolution have been observed in Cfr homologues that share less than 80% sequence identity with Cfr. Specifically, methionine (M) at position 26 is observed for the functionally characterized Cfr homologues Cfr(B) (Deshpande et al. 2015; Marín et al. 2015; Hansen and Vester 2015) and Cfr(D) (Pang et al. 2020), which have been recovered from human-derived isolates and share 74% and 64% amino acid identity with Cfr, respectively (Schwarz et al. 2021) (Figure 4 —figure supplement 5). We also observe lysine (K) at position 2, methionine (M) at position 26, and glycine (G) at position 39, akin to N2K, I26M, and S39G mutations, for a number of Cfr homologues that clade with functional Cfr or Cfr-like genes (Stojković et al. 2019). While the precise roles of these residues within less-well characterized and more distantly related Cfr proteins requires further study, these observations indicate that directed evolution accessed sequence space that is already being exploited by proteins that are, or are hypothesized to be, functional Cfr resistance enzymes.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9. Another remaining question is how the novel variants affects susceptibilities to ribosome-targeting antibiotics in other structural classes, including nucleoside analogues and macrolides. In the introduction the authors mention that in addition to PhLOPSA antibiotics, Cfr can confer resistance to nucleoside analog A201A, hygromycin A, and 16-membered macrolides. However, this is not returned to in the paper. MIC experiments with an expanded selection of antibiotics would be really nice to see if possible.
