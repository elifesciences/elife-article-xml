Despite the suspected importance of predation on microbial ecology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mu et al., 2020</xref>), a limited number of bacterial species are currently reported as predatory. Amongst them, obligate intracellular predators collectively known as BALOs (e.g. <italic>Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mu et al., 2020</xref>), penetrate the bacterial prey cell wall and multiply in the periplasm, escaping and killing the host bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Laloux, 2019</xref>). Quite differently, facultative predators (meaning that they can be cultured in absence of prey if nutrient media are provided, that is<italic> Myxococcus, Lysobacter,</italic> and <italic>Herpetosiphon,</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mu et al., 2020</xref>) attack their preys extracellularly, presumably by secreting antimicrobial substances and digesting the resulting products. Among these organisms and studied here, <italic>Myxococcus xanthus</italic>, a delta-proteobacterium, is of particular interest because it uses large-scale collective movements to attack prey bacteria in a so-called ‘wolf-pack’ mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Thiery and Kaimer, 2020</xref>).</p><p>A tremendous body of work describes how <italic>Myxococcus</italic> cells move and respond to signals in pure culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Herrou and Mignot, 2020</xref>). In contrast, mechanistic studies of the predatory cycle have been limited. Currently, it is considered that coordinated group movements allow <italic>Myxococcus</italic> cells to invade prey colonies and consume them via the secretion of a number of diffusible factors, extracellular enzymes, antibiotics, and outer membrane vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Thiery and Kaimer, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pérez et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Xiao et al., 2011</xref>). While each of these processes could contribute to predation, evidence for their requirement is still missing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Thiery and Kaimer, 2020</xref>). In addition, <italic>Myxococcus</italic> cells have also been observed to kill prey cells upon contact, an intriguing process during which single motile <italic>Myxococcus</italic> cells were observed to stop and induce <italic>E. coli</italic> plasmolysis within a few minutes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhang et al., 2020b</xref>). <italic>Myxococcus</italic> pauses were more frequent with live <italic>E. coli</italic> cells implying prey detection but the mechanism at work and the exact relevance of prey-contact killing for predation remain unclear. Potential contact-dependent mechanisms have been described in <italic>Myxococcus</italic>, including Type VI secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Troselj et al., 2018</xref>) and Outer Membrane Exchange (OME, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sah and Wall, 2020</xref>). However, while these processes have been implicated in Kin recognition and homeostatic regulations within <italic>Myxococcus</italic> colonies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Troselj et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sah and Wall, 2020</xref>), they remain to be clearly implicated in predation. In this study, we analyzed the importance of motility and contact-dependent killing in the <italic>Myxococcus</italic> predation cycle.</p><p>To explore these central questions, we first developed a sufficiently resolved imaging assay where the <italic>Myxococcus</italic> predation cycle can be imaged stably at the single-cell level over periods of time encompassing several hours with a temporal resolution of seconds. The exact methodology underlying this technique is described in a dedicated manuscript (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Panigrahi, 2020</xref>); briefly, the system relates predatory patterns observed at the mesoscale with single-cell resolution, obtained by zooming in and out on the same microscopy specimen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Here, we employed it to study how <italic>Myxococcus</italic> cells invade and grow over <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> prey cells during the initial invasion stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>A-motility is required for invasion of prey colonies.</title><p>Colony plate assays showing invasion of an <italic>E. coli</italic> prey colony (dotted line) 48 hr after plating by WT (<bold>a</bold>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>), A<sup>+</sup>S<sup>-</sup> (<bold>b</bold>) and A<sup>-</sup>S<sup>+</sup> (<bold>c</bold>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref>) strains.

Social (S)-motility is a form of bacterial ‘twitching’ motility that uses so-called Type IV pili (TFP) acting at the bacterial pole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mercier et al., 2020</xref>). In this process, polymerized TFPs act like ‘grappling hooks’ that retract and pull the cell forward. S-motility promotes the coordinated movements of <italic>Myxococcus</italic> cells within large cell groups due to interaction with a self-secreted extracellular matrix formed of Exo-Polysaccharide (EPS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Li et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Islam et al., 2020</xref>). A(Adventurous)-motility promotes the movement of <italic>Myxococcus</italic> single cells at the colony edges. A-motility is driven by a mobile cell-envelope motor complex (named Agl-Glt) that traffics in helical trajectories along the cell axis, driving rotational propulsion of the cell when it becomes tethered to the underlying surface at so-called bacterial Focal Adhesions (bFAs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Faure et al., 2016</xref>). We tested the relative contribution of each motility system to prey invasion by comparing the relative predatory performances of WT, A<sup>+</sup>S<sup>-</sup> (∆<italic>pilA,</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sun et al., 2011</xref>) and A<sup>-</sup>S<sup>+</sup> (∆<italic>aglQ,</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sun et al., 2011</xref>) strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Interestingly, although A<sup>+</sup>S<sup>-</sup> cells were defective in the late developmental steps (fruiting body formation), they were still proficient at prey invasion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). On the contrary, the A<sup>-</sup>S<sup>+</sup> strain was very defective at prey colony invasion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). Zooming at the prey colony border, it was apparent that the A<sup>-</sup>S<sup>+</sup> cells were able to expand and contact the prey colony, but they were unable to penetrate it efficiently, suggesting that Type IV pili on their own are not sufficient for invasion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref>). Conversely, A-motile cells were observed to penetrate the tightly-knitted <italic>E. coli</italic> colony with single <italic>Myxococcus</italic> cells moving into the prey colony, followed by larger cell groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). Similar motility requirements were also observed in a predatory assay where predatory and prey cells are pre-mixed before they are spotted on an agar surface (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).

First, we localized a bFA marker, the AglZ protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mignot et al., 2007</xref>) fused to Neon-Green (AglZ-NG) in <italic>Myxococcus</italic> cells as they penetrate the prey colony. AglZ-NG binds to the cytoplasmic face of the Agl-Glt complex and has long been used as a bFA localization marker; it generally forms fixed fluorescent clusters on the ventral side of the cell that retain fixed positions in gliding cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mignot et al., 2007</xref>). As <italic>Myxococcus</italic> cells invaded prey colonies, they often formed ‘arrow-shaped’ cell groups, in which the cells within the arrow assembled focal adhesions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">Video 3</xref>). <italic>E. coli</italic> cells lysed in the vicinity of the <italic>Myxococcus</italic> cells, suggesting that a contact-dependent killing mechanism (as reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhang et al., 2020b</xref>) occurs during prey colony invasion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). To observe this activity directly, we set up a <italic>Myxococcus - E. coli</italic> interaction microscopy assay where predator – prey interactions can be easily studied, isolated from a larger multicellular context (see Materials and methods). In this system, A-motile <italic>Myxococcus</italic> cells were observed to mark a pause and disassemble bFAs when contacting <italic>E. coli</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video4">Video 4</xref>, further quantified below); this pause was invariably followed by the rapid death of <italic>E. coli,</italic> as detected by the instantaneous dispersal of a cytosolic fluorescent protein (mCherry or GFP, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b–c</xref>, observed in n=20 cells). This observation suggests that the killing occurs by plasmolysis, a process which is likely to be the same as that described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhang et al., 2020b</xref>. To demonstrate this, we mixed <italic>Myxococcus</italic> cells with <italic>E. coli</italic> cells in which peptidoglycan (PG) had been labeled by fluorescent D-amino Acids (TADA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Faure et al., 2016</xref>). TADA is covalently incorporated into the PG pentapeptide backbone and it does not diffuse laterally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kuru et al., 2012</xref>). We first observed contraction of the <italic>E. coli</italic> cytosolic dense region at the pole by phase contrast (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>), which was followed by the appearance of a dark area in the PG TADA staining exactly at the predator-prey contact site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>). It is unlikely that this dark area forms due to the new incorporation of unlabeled prey PG, because it was detected immediately upon prey cell death and propagated bi-directionally afterwards (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d–e</xref>). Thus, these observations suggest that, upon contact, <italic>Myxococcus</italic> induces degradation of the <italic>E. coli</italic> PG, which provokes cell lysis due to loss of turgor pressure and hyper osmotic shock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhang et al., 2020b</xref>). The bi-directional propagation of PG hydrolysis (as detected by loss of TADA signal) suggests that PG hydrolysis could be driven by the activity of PG hydrolase(s) disseminating from the predator-prey contact site.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>A-motile cells kill prey cells by contact.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Prey (<italic>E. coli</italic>) colony invasion by an ‘arrowhead formation’.

In this system, the lysis of <italic>E. coli</italic> cells can be directly monitored when intracellular β-galactosidase is released in buffer containing ChloroPhenol Red-β-D-Galactopyranoside (CPRG), which acts as a substrate for the enzyme and generates a dark red hydrolysis reaction product (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Paradis-Bleau et al., 2014</xref>). Indeed, while <italic>Myxococcus</italic> or <italic>E. coli</italic> cells incubated alone did not produce color during a 120 hr incubation, their mixing produced red color indicative of <italic>E. coli</italic> lysis after 24 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">Figure 2—figure supplement 6</xref>). In this assay, a <italic>t6SS</italic> mutant was still able to lyse <italic>E. coli</italic> cells, demonstrating that predation is not T6SS-dependent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">Figure 2—figure supplements 6</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s7">7</xref>).

In this liquid assay, the <italic>Myxococcus - E. coli</italic> contacts are very distinct from contacts on solid surfaces and thus, the genetic requirements are likely quite distinct. Indeed, in the liquid CPRG assay, we observed that TFPs are essential for killing while the Agl/Glt system is dispensable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s7">Figure 2—figure supplement 7</xref>). In this condition, TFPs promote a prey-induced aggregation of cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s8">Figure 2—figure supplement 8</xref>) and thus probably mediate the necessary tight contacts between <italic>Myxococcus</italic> and <italic>E. coli</italic> cells. As shown below, the killing process itself is the same in liquid as the one observed on surfaces and it is not directly mediated by the TFPs.</p><p>Given the probable indirect effect of TFPs, we next searched additional systems involved in CPRG contact-dependent killing. Using a targeted approach, we tested the effect of mutations in genome annotated cell-envelope complexes on contact-dependent killing in liquid cultures. Doing so, we identified two critical genetic regions, the MXAN_3102–3108 and the MXAN_4648–4661 regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Functional annotations indicate that both genetic regions carry a complementary set of genes encoding proteins that assemble a so-called <bold>T</bold>ight <bold>ad</bold>herence (Tad) pilus. Bacterial Tad pili are members of the type IV filament superfamily (also including Type IV pili, a and b types, and Type II secretion systems) and extrude polymeric pilin filaments assembled via inner membrane associated motors through an OM secretin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Denise et al., 2019</xref>). Tad pili have been generally involved in bacterial adhesion and more recently, in contact-dependent regulation of adhesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ellison et al., 2017</xref>). The MXAN_3102–3108 cluster genes with annotated functions encode a predicted pre-pilin peptidase (CpaA and renamed KilA), a secretin homolog (CpaC/KilC) and a cytoplasmic hexameric ATPase (CpaF/KilF) (following the <italic>Caulobacter crescentus</italic> Tad pilus encoding <italic>cpa</italic> genes nomenclature, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).

All the predicted core genes, IM platform, OM secretin and associated CpaB homolog are essential for prey lysis, with the exception of the putative pre-pilin peptidase, KilA. Deletion of the genes encoding predicted pseudo-pilins KilL and M did not affect <italic>E. coli</italic> killing; in these conditions, pilin fibers are only partially required because deletion of KilK, the major pilin subunit, reduces the lytic activity significantly but not fully (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). Given that the genes are organized into potential operon structures, we confirmed that the CPRG-killing phenotypes of predicted cluster 1 and cluster 2 core genes were not caused by potential polar effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). In liquid, predicted core gene mutants had the same propensity as wild-type to form biofilms in presence of the prey suggesting that they act downstream in the interaction process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s8">Figure 2—figure supplement 8</xref>).</p><p>We next tested whether liquid killing and contact-dependent killing on surfaces reflected the same process. For this, we analyzed selected <italic>kil</italic> mutants: the predicted secretin (KilC), the IM platform proteins (KilH and KilG), the OM-CpaB homolog (KilB), and the pilin and pseudopilins (KilK, L, M) in contact-dependent killing at the single cell level. Prey recognition is first revealed by the induction of a motility pause upon prey cell contact (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). This recognition was severely impaired although not fully in secretin (∆<italic>kilC</italic>), IM platform protein (∆<italic>kilG</italic>) and triple pilin (∆<italic>kilKMN</italic>) mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>, ~8% of the contacts led to motility pauses vs ~30% for the WT). In contrast, recognition was not impaired to significant levels in IM platform protein (∆<italic>kilH</italic>), CpaB-homolog (∆<italic>kilB</italic>) and pilin (∆<italic>kilK</italic>) mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>). The potential basis of this differential impact is further analyzed in the discussion. On the contrary, prey cell plasmolysis was dramatically impacted in all predicted core components (~2% of the contacts led to prey lysis vs ~26% for the WT), the only exception being the single pilin (∆<italic>kilK</italic>) mutant in which prey cell lysis was reduced but still present (~13%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>). Deletion of all three genes encoding pilin-like proteins were nevertheless affected in prey cell killing to levels observed in core component mutants. This is not observed to such extent in the CPRG assay, which could be explained by different cell-cell interaction requirements perhaps compensated by TFPs in liquid cultures. Given the prominent role of the pilins at the single cell level, the predicted pre-pilin peptidase KilA would have been expected to be essential. However, expression of the <italic>kilA</italic> gene is very low under all tested conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). Prepilin peptidases are known to be promiscuous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berry and Pelicic, 2015</xref>) and thus another peptidase (i.e. PilD, the Type IV pilus peptidase, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Friedrich et al., 2014</xref>) could also process the Kil-associated pilins. This hypothesis could, however, not be tested because PilD appears essential for reasons that remain to be determined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Friedrich et al., 2014</xref>). Altogether, the data supports that the proteins from the two clusters function in starvation conditions and that they could make up a Tad-like core structure, for prey cell recognition, regulating motility in contact with prey cells, and prey killing, allowing contact-dependent plasmolysis.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Kil proteins assemble at contact sites and mediate motility regulation and killing</title><p>We next determined if the Kil proteins indeed form a single Tad-like system in contact with prey cells. To do so, the predicted ATPase (KilF) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>) was N-terminally fused to the Neon Green (NG) and expressed from the native chromosomal locus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>). The corresponding fusion appeared fully functional (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). In absence of prey cells, NG-KilF was diffuse in the cytoplasm. Remarkably, when <italic>Myxoccocus</italic> cells established contact with prey cells, NG-KilF rapidly formed a fluorescent-bright cluster at the prey contact site. Cluster formation was invariably followed by a motility pause and cell lysis. Observed clusters did not localize to any specific cellular site but they formed where <italic>Myxococcus</italic> cells touched the prey cells. Cluster formation was correlated to motility arrest and their dispersal coincided with motility resumption (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video5">Video 5</xref>).

A NG-KilD fusion was fully functional, also forming a fluorescent-bright cluster at a prey contact site, followed by motility arrest and prey cell lysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video7">Video 7</xref>). As this protein is the most downstream component of the cluster 1 region, which facilitates further genetic manipulations (see below), we used it as a reporter for Kil system-associated functions.

For this, NG-KilD was stably expressed from the native chromosomal locus in different genetic backgrounds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>). In WT cells, NG-KilD clusters only formed in the presence of prey cells and ~30% contacts were productive for cluster formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4e</xref>). In <italic>kil</italic> mutants, NG-KilD clusters still formed upon prey cell contact with a minor reduction (up to twofold in ∆<italic>kilC</italic> and ∆<italic>kilK</italic>), suggesting that the Tad-like apparatus is not directly responsible for initial prey cell sensing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4e</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video8">Video 8</xref>). Nevertheless, cluster assembly was highly correlated to motility pauses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4f</xref>); which was impaired (up to 60%) in the <italic>kil</italic> mutants (except in the pilin, ∆<italic>kilK</italic> ) and most strongly in the ∆<italic>kilC</italic> (secretin), ∆<italic>kilG</italic> (IM platform) and triple pilin (∆<italic>kilKLM)</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4f</xref>).

Altogether, these results indicate the Tad-like Kil system is dispensable for immediate prey recognition, but functions downstream to induce a motility pause and critically, provoke prey cell lysis.</p><media id="video8" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-72409-video8.mp4"><label>Video 8.</label><caption><title>NG-KilD clusters form in a ∆<italic>kilC</italic> mutant but no motility pauses and prey cell lysis can be observed.</title><p>Shown is an overlay of the fluorescence and phase contrast images of a motile <italic>Myxococcus</italic> cell in predatory contact <italic>E. coli</italic> cells.

This question is especially relevant because a number of mechanisms have been proposed to contribute to <italic>Myxococcus</italic> predation and all involve the extracellular secretion of toxic cargos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sah and Wall, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mercier et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hu et al., 2016</xref>). In pure cultures, deletion of the <italic>kil</italic> genes is not linked to detectable motility and growth phenotypes, suggesting that the Tad-like Kil system mostly operates in predatory context (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">2</xref>). Critically, core <italic>kil</italic> mutants where unable to predate colonies on plate, which could be fully complemented when the corresponding <italic>kil</italic> genes were expressed ectopically (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>). When observed by time lapse, a <italic>kil</italic> mutant (here ∆<italic>kilACF</italic>) can invade a prey colony, but no prey killing is observed, showing that the prey killing phenotype is indeed due to the loss of contact-dependent killing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video9">Video 9</xref>). To measure the impact of this defect quantitatively, we developed a flow cytometry assay that directly measures the relative proportion of <italic>Myxococcus</italic> cells and <italic>E. coli</italic> cells in the prey colony across time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>, see methods).

Phylogenetic analysis indicates that the ATPase (KilF), IM platform proteins (KilH and KilG) and CpaB protein (KilB) share similar evolutionary trajectories, allowing the construction of a well-supported phylogenetic tree based on a supermatrix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, see Materials and methods). This analysis reveals that Kil-like systems are indeed related to Tad systems (i.e. Tad systems from alpha-proteobacteria, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) but their distribution appears to be restricted to the delta-proteobacteria, specifically in <italic>Myxococcales</italic>, in <italic>Bdellovibrionales</italic> and in the recently discovered <italic>Bradymonadales</italic>. Remarkably, these bacteria are all predatory and thus, given that their predicted Kil machineries are very similar to the <italic>Myxococcus</italic> Kil system, they could perform similar functions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). This is possible because <italic>Bradymonadales</italic> are also thought to predate by surface motility and extracellular prey attack (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mu et al., 2020</xref>). In addition, while at first glance it may seem that <italic>Bdellovibrio</italic> species have a distinct predatory cycle, penetrating the prey cell to actively replicate in their periplasmic space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Laloux, 2019</xref>); this cycle involves a number of processes that are similar to Myxobacteria: <italic>Bdellovibrio</italic> cells also attack prey cells using gliding motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lambert et al., 2011</xref>) and attach to them using Type IV pili and a number of common regulatory proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Milner et al., 2014</xref>). Prey cell penetration follows from the ability of the predatory cell to drill a hole into the prey PG at the attachment site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kuru et al., 2017</xref>). Although this remains to be proven directly, genetic evidence has shown that the <italic>Bdellovibrio</italic> Kil homologs are important for prey invasion and attachment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Avidan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Duncan et al., 2019</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>The Kil system is conserved in predatory delta-proteobacteria.</title><p>Phylogenetic tree of the Type-IV filamentous system that gave rise to the <italic>M. xanthus</italic> Kil system.

While a contribution of these processes is not to be ruled out, they are most likely involved in prey cell digestion (for example by degradative enzymes) rather than killing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Thiery and Kaimer, 2020</xref>), and we show here that contact-dependent killing is the major prey killing mechanism. In <italic>Myxococcus</italic>, contact-dependent killing can be mediated by several processes, now including T6SS, OME (Outer Membrane Exchange) and Kil. We exclude a function for the T6SS, for which a role in <italic>Myxococcus</italic> interspecies interactions has yet to be demonstrated. Rather, it appears that together with OME, Type-VI secretion controls a phenomenon called social compatibility, in which the exchange of toxins between <italic>Myxococcus</italic> cells prevents immune cells from mixing with non-immune cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Vassallo et al., 2020</xref>). We have not tested a possible function of OME in prey killing because OME allows transfer of OM protein and lipids between <italic>Myxococcus</italic> cells when contact is established between identical outer membrane receptors, TraA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sah and Wall, 2020</xref>). OME is therefore a process that only occurs between Myxococcus strains to mediate social compatibility when SitA lipoprotein toxins are delivered to non-immune TraA-carrying <italic>Myxococcus</italic> target cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Vassallo et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>The Kil system is both required for contact-dependent killing in liquid and on surfaces. Remarkably, proteins belonging to each motility systems show distinct requirements in liquid or on solid media. In liquid, Type-IV pili mediate prey-induced biofilm formation, which likely brings <italic>Myxococcus</italic> in close contact with the prey cells. This intriguing process likely requires EPS (since <italic>pilA</italic> mutants also lack EPS, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Black et al., 2006</xref>), which deserves further exploration. On surfaces, likely a more biologically relevant context, contact-dependent killing is coupled to A-motility to penetrate prey colonies and interact with individual prey cells. The prey recognition mechanism is especially intriguing because dynamic assembly of a Tad-like system at the prey contact site is a novel observation; in general, these machineries and other Type-IV filamentous systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Denise et al., 2019</xref>), such as TFPs tend to assemble at fixed cellular sites, often a cell pole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mercier et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ellison et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Koch et al., 2021</xref>). NG-KilD clusters do not require a functional Tad-like system to form in contact with prey cells, suggesting that prey contact induces Tad assembly via an upstream signaling cascade. Such sensory system could be encoded within the clusters 1 and 2, which contain a large number of conserved genes with unknown predicted functions (up to 11 proteins of unknown functions just considering cluster 1 and 2, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). In particular, the large number of predicted proteins with FHA type domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Almawi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>) suggests a function in a potential signaling cascade. In <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>, FHA domain-proteins act downstream from a phosphorylation cascade triggered by contact, allowing <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> to fire its T6SS upon contact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Basler et al., 2013</xref>). This mechanism is triggered by general perturbation of the <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ho et al., 2013</xref>), which could also be the case for the Kil system. Kil assembly is provoked both by monoderm and diderm bacteria, which suggests that prey-specific determinants are unlikely. Recognition is nevertheless non-universal and does not occur in contact with <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> or <italic>Myxococcus</italic> itself. Therefore, evasion mechanisms must exist, perhaps in the form of genetic determinants that shield cells from recognition.</p><p>The Kil Tad-like system itself is required to pause A-motility and for prey cell killing. Motility regulation could be indirect because differential effects are observed depending on <italic>kil</italic> gene deletions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>), suggesting that assembly of a functional Tad apparatus is not strictly required for regulation. In contrast, prey killing requires a functional Tad apparatus. In particular, the pilin proteins are required during prey invasion but they are dispensable (partially) in liquid cultures showing that they do not promote toxicity. In liquid, direct contacts may be enforced by TFPs in the biofilm, perhaps rendering the Tad pilins partially redundant. Tad pilin function nevertheless becomes essential on surfaces when A-motility is active. How the pilins organize to form polymers and whether they do, remains to be determined; the lack of the major pilin (KilK) is compensated by the remaining pseudo-pilins KilL and M, which is somewhat surprising given that pseudopilins are generally considered to prime assembly of major pilin polymers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Denise et al., 2019</xref>). It is currently unclear if the Kil system is also a toxin-secretion device; for example, if it also functions as a Type II secretion system. Alternatively, the Kil complex might recruit a toxin delivery system at the prey contact site. This latter hypothesis is in fact suggested by the remaining low (but still detectable) contact-dependent toxicity of the <italic>kil</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>). Given that <italic>Myxococcus</italic> induces prey PG degradation locally, we hypothesize that a secreted cell wall hydrolase becomes active at the prey contact site. This is not unprecedented: <italic>Bdellovibrio</italic> cells secrete a sophisticated set of PG modifying enzymes, D,D-endopeptidases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lerner et al., 2012</xref>), L,D transpeptidases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kuru et al., 2017</xref>) and Lysozyme-like enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Harding et al., 2020</xref>) to penetrate prey cells, carve them into bdelloplasts and escape. In <italic>Myxococcus</italic>, deleting potential D,D-endopeptidases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zhang et al., 2020a</xref>) (∆<italic>dacB</italic>) did not affect predation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>) which might not be surprising given that <italic>Myxococcus</italic> simply lyses its preys while <italic>Bdellovibrio</italic> needs to penetrate them while avoiding their lysis to support its intracellular cycle. The <italic>Myxococcus</italic> toxin remains to be discovered, bearing in mind, that similar to synergistic toxic T6SS effectors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">LaCourse et al., 2018</xref>), several toxic effectors could be injected, perhaps explaining how <italic>Myxococcus</italic> is able to kill both monoderm and diderm preys.</p><p>The Myxobacteria are potential keystone taxa in the soil microbial food web (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Petters et al., 2021</xref>), meaning that Kil-dependent mechanisms could have a major impact in shaping soil eco-systems. While the Kil proteins are most similar to proteins from Tad systems, there are a number of key differences that suggest profound diversification: (i), the Kil system involves a single ATPase and other Tad proteins such as assembly proteins TadG, RcpB, and pilotin TadD are missing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Denise et al., 2019</xref>; (ii), several Kil proteins have unique signatures, the large number of associated genes of unknown function; in particular, the over-representation of associated FHA domain proteins, including the central hexameric ATPase KilF itself fused to an N-terminal FHA domain. The KilC secretin is also uniquely short and lacks the N0 domain, canonically found in secretin proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tosi et al., 2014</xref>), which could be linked to increased propensity for dynamic recruitment at prey contact sites. Future studies of the Kil machinery could therefore reveal how the contact-dependent properties of Tad pili were adapted to prey cell interaction and intoxication, likely a key evolutionary process in predatory bacteria.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Bacterial strains, growth conditions, motility plates, genetic constructs, and western blotting</title><p>See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary files 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">5</xref> corresponding to Table 3: strains, Table 4: plasmids and Table 5: primers. <italic>E. coli</italic> cells were grown under standard laboratory conditions in Luria-Bertani (LB) broth supplemented with antibiotics, if necessary. <italic>M. xanthus</italic> strains were grown at 32°C in CYE (Casitone Yeast Extract) rich media as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zhang et al., 2020a</xref>). <italic>S. enterica</italic> Typhimurium, <italic>B. subtilis,</italic> and <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> were grown overnight at 37°C in LB. <italic>C. crescentus</italic> strain NA1000 was grown overnight at 30°C in liquid PYE (Peptone Yeast Extract).

The plates were then incubated at 32°C with shaking and pictures were taken after 24 and 48 hr of incubation. To test the contact-dependance, a two-chamber assay was carried out in a Corning 24 well-plates containing a 0.4 µm pore polycarbonate membrane insert (Corning Transwell 3413).

GFP and mCherry signals were collected using, respectively, the emission filters FL1 (525/30 nm) and FL3 (615/25 nm) and a compensation was applied on the mCherry signal. Samples were run using the low-pressure mode (~10,000 particles/s). The density plots obtained (small angle scattering FSC versus wide angle scattering SSC signal) were first gated on the overlapped populations of <italic>M. xanthus</italic> and <italic>E. coli</italic>, then filtered to remove the multiple events and finally gated for high FL1 signal (<italic>M. xanthus</italic>-GFP) and high FL3 signal (<italic>E. coli</italic>-mCherry).</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Bioinformatics analyses</title><sec id="s4-11-1"><title>Homology search strategy</title><p>We used several search strategies to identify all potential homologous proteins of the Kil system: we first used BLAST (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Camacho et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Altschul et al., 1997</xref>) to search for reciprocal best hits (RBH) between the <italic>M. xanthus</italic> and the <italic>B. bacteriovorus</italic> and <italic>B.

bacteria, but precisely how it kills other bacteria has not been well characterized. It has often been assumed that this involves secreted, diffusible factors like antibiotics. This paper presents a fascinating set of observations that reveal a pilus/secretion system in Myxococcus that is necessary for a contact-dependent predation of other bacteria. The work presented lays the foundation for future studies of this contact-dependent predation.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>[Editors’ note: the authors submitted for reconsideration following the decision after peer review. What follows is the decision letter after the first round of review.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;A Tad-like apparatus is required for contact-dependent prey killing in predatory social bacteria&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Lotte Sogaard-Andersen (Reviewer #1); Alain Filloux (Reviewer #2); John Kirby (Reviewer #3).</p><p>We are sorry to say that, after consultation with the reviewers, we have decided that your work, as it stands now, cannot be considered further for publication by <italic>eLife</italic>. The reviewers all appreciated the potential novelty of the findings, but also highlighted several key shortcomings. Some of these issues were raised in the initial reviews conducted by Nature Microbiology and transferred to <italic>eLife</italic>. Importantly, some of the reviewers this time were in common with those from the first round and they did not feel that the issues raised had been adequately addressed. In particular, the reviewers agreed that the paper does not convincingly provide (i) a clear demonstration that a Tad-like pilus is produced by Myxococcus, and (ii) evidence that the pilus assembles concomitantly and spatially coincident with the KilD clusters. Data addressing these concerns were deemed critical as the paper also does not address whether the pilus is driving toxin delivery or is simply involved in promoting proximity to prey. The reviewers unanimously agreed that a highly revised paper that fully addressed these issues could warrant reconsideration. However, because these important points had not been addressed in this revision after they were raised in the first round of reviews, there was a sense that you may not want to or may not be experimentally able to address them, hence the final decision to reject.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>In this manuscript, the authors explore mechanisms involved in the predation of other bacteria by Myxococcus xanthus. The major findings are (1) M. xanthus cells depend on gliding motility to efficiently invade an <italic>E. coli</italic> prey colony. (2) <italic>E. coli</italic> prey cells are lysed in a contact-dependent manner. (3) When M. xanthus cells make prey contact, they sometimes pause and then kill the prey cell. (4) Using a genetic screen, two gene clusters (referred to as the kil gene clusters) are identified that encode proteins, some of which have homology to those of Tad pili. Some of the Kil proteins are important for pausing of cells and killing of prey. (5) One of the suggested Kil proteins assemble to form clusters upon prey contact; however, assembly of these clusters is independent of other Kil proteins On the basis of these findings the authors suggest that the Kil proteins assemble to form a Tad pilus system and are important for pausing and prey killing. Overall, this is an interesting manuscript; however, it remains unclear what the actual function of the identified Kil proteins are.</p><p>Weaknesses include</p><p>(1) The lack of genetic complementation experiments. Thus, it is unclear precisely which of the Kil proteins are important for predation.</p><p>(2) The Kil proteins are encoded in two gene clusters. The evidence that these proteins make up a Tad pilus system is based on homology and that mutations in both clusters result in reduced predation. No evidence is presented that proteins encoded by these two clusters interact to form a Tad pilus machine.</p><p>(3) The authors localize the Kil system using an NG-KilD fusion; however, there is no evidence that KilD, which is a FHA domain-containing protein, associates with the Tad pilus machinery. In fact, KilD makes clusters independently of all other Kil proteins tested suggesting that these clusters may not report on Kil assembly and activity. An equally plausible scenario is that Myxococcus/<italic>E. coli</italic> contacts result in activation of KilD leading to the formation of foci. These foci then signal assembly of the Kil system somewhere in a cell (or maybe not). Therefore, it is not clear where and if this machinery localizes during prey contact.</p><p>(4) I did not find a description of how the mutagenesis was done. Please include a description of how the mutagenesis was done, how many mutants were screened, and in which loci the mutations (transposon insertions?) occurred. Was the screen saturated?</p><p>(5) Throughout the manuscript, the authors need to tone down their conclusions and stick to what they actually show. It is also important that the authors present their results in the context of what is already known about contact-dependent killing in M. xanthus.</p><p>(6) Line 20: delete &quot;perhaps&quot;. It is well established from the work in ref. 7 that killing can occur in a contact-dependent manner.</p><p>(7) Line 22-23: There is no evidence in the manuscript that killing is driven by the Kil system. The evidence presented shows that the Kil system is important for killing.</p><p>(8) Line 24: Strictly speaking the authors have shown that one Kil protein assembles at the contact site.</p><p>(9) Line 66 and 69: It has been known for more than 20 years that type IV pili and exopolysaccharide are important for S-motility. Please include the relevant references.</p><p>(10) Line 90-91 and Figure 2A: It is difficult/impossible to see the lysed cells in the upper panel in Figure 2A. Would it be possible to label the individual prey cells with a number or in different colors to be able to follow cells over time?</p><p>(11) Line 91: Delete &quot;remarkably&quot; because this has been seen in ref. 7.</p><p>(12) Line 103-105: This detailed description fits to the &quot;lower&quot; <italic>E. coli</italic> cell but not to the &quot;upper&quot; <italic>E. coli</italic> cell in Figure 2D. Is that important? How many cells were analyzed? Is the cell in Figure 2E representative?</p><p>(13) Line 124: Because the killing mechanism is not identified, I suggest to rewrite to emphasize that you looked for genes important for killing.</p><p>(14) Line 124-131: As described, my understanding is that M. xanthus and <italic>E. coli</italic> cells are mixed in suspension culture and with shaking. From the data in Figure 1 and 2, one gets the impression that predator and prey have to be in close contact for several minutes before the <italic>E. coli</italic> prey lyses. How would this happen in suspension culture with shaking?</p><p>(15) Figure 4A, B: What precisely is shown in these two figures? And how are the figures different?</p><p>(16) Line 204-205: How do the experiments described lead to the conclusion that the &quot;…unambiguously that cluster formation reflects contact-dependent killing&quot;? Is it not more correct to say that your data support that cluster formation correlates with killing?</p><p>(17) Figure 4C and accompanying text: In how many cells was the reported pattern observed?</p><p>(18) Line 213: There is not a 2-reduction is foci formation according to figure 4D.</p><p>(19) Figure 5D: What do the red and green lines indicate?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This works has clear novelty and describes aspects on how Myxococcus xanthus can kill other bacterial cells.</p><p>It starts by demonstrating that A-motility (Agl-Glt system) is needed to invade adjacent colony. These A-motile cells are able to kill a prey (<italic>E. coli</italic>) likely by making holes in the peptidoglycan layer, but the killing does not directly involve the A-motility system.</p><p>Based on this, the authors did use an elegant approach to identify mutants that can invade but cannot kill. Reported hits lie within two gene clusters encoding Tad proteins, which in other bacteria such as <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> are involved in the assembly of a Tad pilus which promotes bacterial attachment. The cluster 1 encodes the prepilin peptidase, the secretin and the ATPase, while cluster 2 encodes the inner membrane platform, major and minor pilins. Both clusters encode additional genes of unknown function. It is then shown that this Tad-like system, called Kil system, can trigger target cell lysis probably via the recruitment of other systems allowing delivery of toxic elements into prey cells. Despite not having data supporting what could contribute to the toxicity, it is shown that the Kil system is actually assembling at the site of contact with the prey cell. Finally, the authors also showed that the Myxococcus Kil system allows killing of a wide range of bacteria which are not necessarily phylogenetically-related.</p><p>In conclusion, this work brought novel and original concepts, some of which would definitively deserve further investigation in subsequent studies.</p><p>This is a paper that I previously reviewed for another journal.</p><p>Most of the queries I had have been addressed experimentally or discussed in the text. This includes further repeats on a number of experiments which are now providing statistically significant data supporting solid conclusions, including revisiting the killing of Bacillus.</p><p>There are still pending questions such as what is the effective mechanism which leads to killing upon Tad-dependent contact, is there a Tad-like pilus assembled or why is the KilA prepilin peptidase not essential for killing. I would agree that these are likely beyond the scope of the present study. Now writing &quot;mysterious mechanism&quot; in the abstract (line 20) might give the feeling that the story is incomplete, which should be avoided.</p><p>Another yet intriguing question would be whether some of the genes of unknown function encoded within each of the tad-like clusters are involved in killing.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The authors set out to identify factors involved in bacterial predation and have identified a set of genes that are homologous to secretion systems. The study focuses on M. xanthus as the predator with <italic>E. coli</italic> as the prey source. The authors demonstrate that M. xanthus A-Motility (focal adhesion mediated motility) is required for efficient penetration of <italic>E. coli</italic> under the conditions of their assays. The authors identified two genes that encode proteins thought to assemble into a type IV filament-like machine, designated &quot;Kil&quot;. This system inhibits motility of prey cells and stimulates lysis of those cells. They show that the Kil apparatus assembles near contact sites between predator and prey cells using protein-fusion constructs. However, there are limitations based on experimental design that diminish support for the stated conclusions. The assay used to identify genes of interest was conducted in aqueous media where the motility system of interest is not required. Furthermore, the microscopic techniques used here do not allow for the visualization of pores or precise localization of machinery thought to be involved in the mechanism for delivery of toxins from predator to prey cells.</p><p>I enjoyed reading this story but have several points that I would like to see addressed in a modified manuscript.</p><p>Results</p><p>Line 72-82.</p><p>The authors explore prey invasion by M. xanthus wild type, pilA and aglQ mutants. The aglQ strain did not efficiently penetrate the prey while the pilA did. However, Figure 1 shows the wild type and the aglQ strain. I would like to see the pilA strain for comparison. Similarly, the Figure legends for Video 1 and 2 are the same; it is not clear which cells were labeled with mCherry.</p><p>Line 91/92.</p><p>Similar results have been reported widely in the field, most recently by Zhang et al., 2020, and those efforts should be acknowledged. The statement that A-motile cells carry a prey toxic activity suggests that cells utilizing different motility systems might utilize different toxins for predation. Is that correct?</p><p>In Video 3 many prey cells are in contact with the predator, yet just only a small set of prey cells seemed to be lysed. This should be discussed by the authors.</p><p>Figure 2d and Line 538: &quot;Holes in the PG-labelling are observed at the contact site&quot; seems to be too strong. The figure I have here does not provide enough high resolution to conclude that &quot;holes&quot; are visible.</p><p>Line 124-134.</p><p>The authors use a liquid predation assay to monitor lysis of <italic>E. coli</italic>. Upon lysis β-galactosidase is released into the media that contains CPRG substrate that is converted into a dark red substance. This is an effective assay. However, A-motility as reported to date requires a solid surface that is not present in this type of assay. Thus, the results as reported are done in an A-motility independent manner, while is suggested otherwise throughout the manuscript. Also the data for all strains tested in parallel should be shown (WT vs aglQ vs pilA). Importantly, by definition, predation includes consumption and growth of prey. Thus, colony forming units should be reported in the presence and absence of each predator strain and for the prey.</p><p>Line 134/135.</p><p>The authors use the liquid assay to screen for mutations in the predicted cell-envelope complexes, in which contact-dependent killing is abolished. However, I could not find an adequate description in the Results or the Materials and methods on how this screen was conducted. Additionally, the two location of the two mutations identified should be stated.</p><p>Figure 3A shows the predicted model of the Tad-like apparatus. It is not clear that this apparatus is actually made.</p><p>Figure 6a, Line 620-622.</p><p>The authors state that the ∆kilACF cells move over the top of the <italic>B. subtilis</italic> and S. typhimurium colonies without lysis. It appears to me that lysis is occuring. Again, predation (killing, consumption and growth) should be quantified by colony forming units.</p><p>Line 317/318.</p><p>Epistasis analysis is typically required to establish genetic elements within a pathway. Additional biochemical evidence could be used to support the order of events and protein interactions.

I look forward to seeing this manuscript published.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In this study, the authors provide further evidence that predation by Myxococcus xanthus likely occurs primarily via a contact-dependent mechanism and identify one key player. They show that the motility/adhesion requirements for killing are dependent on the environment: type IV pili-mediated twitching group motility in liquid medium vs. solitary adventurous (A-type) propulsion on solid surfaces. By testing mutants in a short list of candidates (putative envelope-associated complexes), the authors identify two loci necessary for contact-dependent predation in both liquid and solid media. Primarily based on time-lapse microscopy of selected mutants, the manuscript presents sufficient evidence to support the central hypothesis that both loci are likely part of the same Tad-like pilus system (kil), and that this kil locus is involved in attachment and killing of prey cells. The exact role of kil in the process remains to be determined and it is likely that other yet unidentified factors are also necessary.</p><p>The authors are for the most part cautious to not draw conclusions beyond what is supported by the data and acknowledge the remaining gaps in knowledge. However, most of the conclusions of the study hinge on the analysis of fluorescent protein foci in time-lapse videos. While the authors provide quantification of several fields, most of the figures and videos only show one or maximum two cells displaying the behavior under study. Moreover, there is no &quot;negative control&quot; for the videos of KilD/F/G and AglZ (A-motility) contacts, to rule out that it's not just random transient aggregation by these labelled proteins (or that contact with other cells causes temporary physical changes in those membrane regions creating some sort of artefactual foci).</p><p>Another weakness is that I don't think the Tad phylogeny in Figure 7 supports the strong claim that &quot;the kil genes evolved in predatory bacteria&quot; (l. 298) or that the Tad homologs in predatory bacteria (Myxococcales, Bdellovibrionales and Bradymonadales) are a uniquely distinct clade of kil genes relative to the more distant tad homologs in other bacteria (my interpretation of l. 303-306). The Myxococcales, Bdellovibrionales and Bradymonadales tad clades are not monophyletic (as a group) as the authors seem to imply, so &quot;suggesting a similar function&quot; (l. 306) that's unique to these classes seems too speculative. Also, since the predatory bacteria are all δ-proteobacteria (and hence more closely related amongst them than the other clades on the phylogeny), wouldn't it be expected that their pili genes would be more similar, regardless or function? I therefore think these conclusions should be toned down. It would also be interesting for the authors to discuss if there are any predatory bacteria (or non-predatory δ-proteobacteria) where kil/tad homologues are absent.</p><p>– Timestamps in the videos would be extremely helpful.</p><p>– For a reader unfamiliar with the field, the introduction does not provide enough context to understand the nuances about what predation is and how it distinguishes from other types of antagonism. One short explanatory sentence at the beginning would be very helpful. In particular, the findings from reference 7 should be explained a little bit more.</p><p>– At the beginning of the discussion (l. 322-325), the authors should acknowledge contact-dependent plasmolysis has been previously described (ref. 7).</p><p>– I think it is very important to show videos of many fields/cells instead of just one representative cell, to show that the videos were not cherry-picked. Moreover, for the videos of KilD/F/G and AglZ (A-motility) contacts, I think it is important to show a negative control. Since the authors mention that a deletion in other kil components does not preclude foci formation (and therefore the mutant is not a control), maybe a good control are the <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> videos?</p><p>– I understand that it may be technically complex to do time-lapse imaging of differently labeled kil components (e.g. KilF-GPF and KilG-mCherry). However, I think showing co-localization of the foci for the two components in a single time point (which would allow longer exposure times and large numbers of cells analyzed simultaneously) would provide more compelling evidence that both proteins are part of the same complex. Similarly, it would be interesting to see if KilD/F foci colocalize with AglZ.</p><p>– Do any of the other genes in the two loci have sequence signatures of toxins?

Addressing this point was challenging because it required to either demonstrate direct interactions between KilD and Tad structural components or show that predicted Tad core components also localize dynamically upon contact with the prey. This later possibility nevertheless required to obtain functional fluorescent protein fusions, which are typically difficult to obtain for membrane proteins.

In this cluster, we have chosen to only delete the genes annotated as Tad-like proteins, namely the two IM platform proteins CpaA and CpaG, the outer membrane accessory protein CpaB and three predicted pilin homologs. We did not attempt complementing the pili deletions given that they all show at best intermediate phenotypes when individually deleted and that a triple deletion is needed to obtain a kil-null phenotype. This strongly argues against polar effects in the pilin deletion mutants. However, we agree that it was important to show that the mutation in the Cpa homologs were not polar, demonstrating the critical function of these genes. In this version for coherence, we chose to complement core Tad components encoded in cluster 1 and 2, the secretin (cluster 1), the ATPase (cluster 1) and the two IM platform proteins (cluster 2). These complementations are now provided as proof that these genes are all essential for predation in a new Figure 5a and S4b.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The Kil proteins are encoded in two gene clusters.

We now present data showing that both KilF (The ATPase encoded by cluster 1) and KilG (the CpaG homolog) both form clusters at the prey contact site similar to KilD.

We also performed a crystal violet assay, which revealed that aggregation of predatory and prey cells is induced by prey cells in liquid, likely a TFP and EPS dependent effect. Thus, the A-motility and S-motility complexes are differentially required depending on the conditions, solid or liquid, but none of them are absolutely required for killing. The Kil system is on the contrary required in both conditions, and thus the functions of the A- and S-motility complexes are indirect.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>15) Figure 4A, B: What precisely is shown in these two figures?

These A-motile cells are able to kill a prey (<italic>E. coli</italic>) likely by making holes in the peptidoglycan layer, but the killing does not directly involve the A-motility system.</p><p>Based on this, the authors did use an elegant approach to identify mutants that can invade but cannot kill. Reported hits lie within two gene clusters encoding Tad proteins, which in other bacteria such as <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> are involved in the assembly of a Tad pilus which promotes bacterial attachment. The cluster 1 encodes the prepilin peptidase, the secretin and the ATPase, while cluster 2 encodes the inner membrane platform, major and minor pilins. Both clusters encode additional genes of unknown function. It is then shown that this Tad-like system, called Kil system, can trigger target cell lysis probably via the recruitment of other systems allowing delivery of toxic elements into prey cells. Despite not having data supporting what could contribute to the toxicity, it is shown that the Kil system is actually assembling at the site of contact with the prey cell. Finally, the authors also showed that the Myxococcus Kil system allows killing of a wide range of bacteria which are not necessarily phylogenetically-related.</p><p>In conclusion, this work brought novel and original concepts, some of which would definitively deserve further investigation in subsequent studies.</p><p>This is a paper that I previously reviewed for another journal.</p><p>Most of the queries I had have been addressed experimentally or discussed in the text. This includes further repeats on a number of experiments which are now providing statistically significant data supporting solid conclusions, including revisiting the killing of Bacillus.</p><p>There are still pending questions such as what is the effective mechanism which leads to killing upon Tad-dependent contact, is there a Tad-like pilus assembled or why is the KilA prepilin peptidase not essential for killing. I would agree that these are likely beyond the scope of the present study.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the positive assessment.</p><p>In this revised manuscript, we now provide data that we believe strongly reinforce the view that a Tad machinery assembled form the cluster 1 and 2 genes is indeed assembled at the contact sites.</p><p>As discussed in the text, it is likely that the prepilin peptidase is dispensable due to the action of another one, these enzymes being known as promiscuous. We could unfortunately not test this hypothesis because the obvious candidate the Tfp prepilin peptidase PilD seems to be essential in <italic>Myxococcus.</italic> (We recently confirmed this observation in an as yet unpublished TnSeq study observing that the <italic>pilD</italic> gene is the only <italic>pil</italic> gene where no Tn insertion is recovered).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Now writing &quot;mysterious mechanism&quot; in the abstract (line 20) might give the feeling that the story is incomplete, which should be avoided.</p><p>Another yet intriguing question would be whether some of the genes of unknown function encoded within each of the tad-like clusters are involved in killing.</p></disp-quote><p>This is indeed a crucial question and we are now testing this possibility by making systematic gene deletions in all cluster 2 genes.

The study focuses on M. xanthus as the predator with <italic>E. coli</italic> as the prey source. The authors demonstrate that M. xanthus A-Motility (focal adhesion mediated motility) is required for efficient penetration of <italic>E. col</italic>i under the conditions of their assays. The authors identified two genes that encode proteins thought to assemble into a type IV filament-like machine, designated &quot;Kil&quot;. This system inhibits motility of prey cells and stimulates lysis of those cells. They show that the Kil apparatus assembles near contact sites between predator and prey cells using protein-fusion constructs. However, there are limitations based on experimental design that diminish support for the stated conclusions. The assay used to identify genes of interest was conducted in aqueous media where the motility system of interest is not required. Furthermore, the microscopic techniques used here do not allow for the visualization of pores or precise localization of machinery thought to be involved in the mechanism for delivery of toxins from predator to prey cells.</p><p>I enjoyed reading this story but have several points that I would like to see addressed in a modified manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this enthusiastic response.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Results</p><p>Line 72-82.</p><p>The authors explore prey invasion by M. xanthus wild type, pilA and aglQ mutants.

Upon lysis β-galactosidase is released into the media that contains CPRG substrate that is converted into a dark red substance. This is an effective assay. However, A-motility as reported to date requires a solid surface that is not present in this type of assay. Thus, the results as reported are done in an A-motility independent manner, while is suggested otherwise throughout the manuscript. Also the data for all strains tested in parallel should be shown (WT vs aglQ vs pilA). Importantly, by definition, predation includes consumption and growth of prey.

They show that the motility/adhesion requirements for killing are dependent on the environment: type IV pili-mediated twitching group motility in liquid medium vs. solitary adventurous (A-type) propulsion on solid surfaces. By testing mutants in a short list of candidates (putative envelope-associated complexes), the authors identify two loci necessary for contact-dependent predation in both liquid and solid media. Primarily based on time-lapse microscopy of selected mutants, the manuscript presents sufficient evidence to support the central hypothesis that both loci are likely part of the same Tad-like pilus system (kil), and that this kil locus is involved in attachment and killing of prey cells. The exact role of kil in the process remains to be determined and it is likely that other yet unidentified factors are also necessary.</p><p>The authors are for the most part cautious to not draw conclusions beyond what is supported by the data and acknowledge the remaining gaps in knowledge. However, most of the conclusions of the study hinge on the analysis of fluorescent protein foci in time-lapse videos. While the authors provide quantification of several fields, most of the figures and videos only show one or maximum two cells displaying the behavior under study. Moreover, there is no &quot;negative control&quot; for the videos of KilD/F/G and AglZ (A-motility) contacts, to rule out that it's not just random transient aggregation by these labelled proteins (or that contact with other cells causes temporary physical changes in those membrane regions creating some sort of artefactual foci).</p></disp-quote><p>We understand the comment but it is difficult to show more than one cell in the figures and show the clusters and their dynamics properly. Showing a field of cells would require to blow up of the panels, to introduce many arrow-heads pointing at clusters in various cells at distinct time points. Because the supplemental Videos are meant to show the entire time sequence corresponding to the selected cells in the figures, it would therefore not be practical to provide supplemental Videos that cover larger fields.</p><p>Additional Videos covering bigger fields could also be added (in fact, we have tried) but for killing events to be seen sufficiently well resolved, we still have to zoom on cells of interest. Thus, these Videos still show a limited number of events.</p><p>In fact, the figures showing cells should be considered as striking examples, but in-depth statistics are already provided in counts and we have thoroughly quantified the dynamics of the Neon-Green KilD fusion clusters, showing how they assemble upon contact, correlate with pauses and lysis over hundreds of cells in up to five independent replicates. This, we believe, is the real rigorous part of the analysis and it allows us to conclude that the clusters only form in contact with prey cells, their formation correlates with cells pausing and lysis. Last, the clusters localizes where PG degradation is observed. Taken together these arguments rule out unspecific aggregation and artefactual foci.</p><p>Nevertheless, the reviewer suggested that <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> could be an interesting control as the <italic>Myxococcus</italic> cells do not appear to pause and kill <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> cells by contact. Indeed, analyzing 150 cell contacts from two independent experiments, we could not observe cluster formation upon <italic>Myxococcus-Pseudomonas</italic> contacts, we have added this observation to reinforce our conclusions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Another weakness is that I don't think the Tad phylogeny in Figure 7 supports the strong claim that &quot;the kil genes evolved in predatory bacteria&quot; (l. 298) or that the Tad homologs in predatory bacteria (Myxococcales, Bdellovibrionales and Bradymonadales) are a uniquely distinct clade of kil genes relative to the more distant tad homologs in other bacteria (my interpretation of l. 303-306). The Myxococcales, Bdellovibrionales and Bradymonadales tad clades are not monophyletic (as a group) as the authors seem to imply, so &quot;suggesting a similar function&quot; (l. 306) that's unique to these classes seems too speculative. Also, since the predatory bacteria are all δ-proteobacteria (and hence more closely related amongst them than the other clades on the phylogeny), wouldn't it be expected that their pili genes would be more similar, regardless or function? I therefore think these conclusions should be toned down. It would also be interesting for the authors to discuss if there are any predatory bacteria (or non-predatory δ-proteobacteria) where kil/tad homologues are absent.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with this comment and toned down our conclusions.</p><p>The last point is interesting but only a handful of bacteria have been described as predatory, in the δ proteobacteria, but also outside of the δ branch. In addition, some bacteria are sometimes described as predatory (ie <italic>Streptomyces</italic>) because they kill other bacteria but they may not in fact use them as food source. In the δ proteobacteria, arguably where most predation studies have been performed, it is also not clear which are predatory and which are not. Thus, we unfortunately cannot make simple correlations between the presence of kil/Tad homologs and bacterial predation more broadly.</p><p>This section now reads:</p><p>“The kil genes are present in other predatory δ-proteobacteria.

Similarly, it would be interesting to see if KilD/F foci colocalize with AglZ.</p></disp-quote><p>Co-localization studies could be interesting, but they are technically challenging to set up because it is frequent that combining dual fusions lead to loss of fusion due to the combination. We are now attempting to develop these tools, but they require further work to be used robustly and statistically. Dual fusions would be interesting to test a possible hierarchy in recruitment and timing, but it would not be more decisive than single fusions to show that the proteins are part of a complex. FRET studies could show this, but they are well beyond the scope of this paper. The fact that each tested protein accumulates at the prey contact site prior to lysis and that they are all required for lysis and predation is already strong indication that they function together.</p><p>It is difficult to observe both AglZ and KilD/F foci in the same cells for the same reasons (even more so, given the difficulty in tracking focal adhesion complexes).
