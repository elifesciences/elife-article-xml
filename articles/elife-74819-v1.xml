Establishing the dynamics that led to contemporary patterns of MGEs in bacterial genomes is central to predicting the emergence and evolution of novel and resistant pathogens. Methicillin-resistant <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (MRSA) clonal-complex (CC) 398 is the dominant MRSA in European livestock and a growing cause of human infections. Previous studies have identified three categories of MGEs whose presence or absence distinguishes livestock-associated CC398 from a closely related and less antibiotic-resistant human-associated population. Here, we fully characterise the evolutionary dynamics of these MGEs using a collection of 1180 CC398 genomes, sampled from livestock and humans, over 27 years. We find that the emergence of livestock-associated CC398 coincided with the acquisition of a Tn<italic>916</italic> transposon carrying a tetracycline resistance gene, which has been stably inherited for 57 years. This was followed by the acquisition of a type V SCC<italic>mec</italic> that carries methicillin, tetracycline, and heavy metal resistance genes, which has been maintained for 35 years, with occasional truncations and replacements with type IV SCC<italic>mec</italic>. In contrast, a class of prophages that carry a human immune evasion gene cluster and that are largely absent from livestock-associated CC398 have been repeatedly gained and lost in both human- and livestock-associated CC398. These contrasting dynamics mean that when livestock-associated MRSA is transmitted to humans, adaptation to the human host outpaces loss of antibiotic resistance. In addition, the stable inheritance of resistance-associated MGEs suggests that the impact of ongoing reductions in antibiotic and zinc oxide use in European farms on livestock-associated MRSA will be slow to be realised.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Antibiotic-resistant infections are a growing threat to human health. In 2019, these hard-to-treat infections resulted in 4.95 million deaths making them the third leading cause of death that year. Excessive use of antibiotics in humans is likely driving the emergence of drug-resistant bacteria. But there is a concern that use of antibiotics on livestock farms is also contributing. A type of bacteria traced back to livestock is a growing cause of human infections that do not respond to treatment with the antibiotic methicillin in Europe. It is called livestock-associated methicillin-resistant <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (LA-MRSA).</p><p>Bacteria can share genes that make them drug resistant or more deadly. These genes are often carried on mobile genetic elements that promote their movement from one bacterial cell to another. The most common type of LA-MRSA in Europe is clonal-complex 398 (CC398). It has two mobile genetic elements carrying antibiotic-resistance genes, but generally lacks a mobile genetic element that helps the bacterium escape the human immune system. Learning more about how LA-MRSA acquired these genetic changes may help scientists develop better strategies to protect the public.</p><p>Matuszewska, Murray et al. analyzed the genomes of more than 1,000 samples of CC398 collected from humans, pigs and 13 other animal species in 28 countries over 27 years. They used this data to reconstruct the bacteria’s evolutionary history. Matuszewska, Murray et al. show that two mobile elements containing antibiotic resistance genes in CC398 were gained decades ago. One is more than 50 years old and was likely acquired around the time antibiotic use in livestock became common. While most CC398 in livestock do not have a mobile element that helps LA-MRSA evade the human immune system, they often gain it when they infect humans. This leads to highly drug-resistant human MRSA infections.</p><p>The results of this study suggest that LA-MRSA is a serious threat to human health. The resistance of this bacterium has persisted for decades, spreading across different livestock species and different countries. These drug-resistant bacteria in livestock readily infect humans. Current efforts to reduce antibiotic use in farms may take decades to mitigate these risks. Additionally, the ban on zinc-oxide use on livestock in the European Union (coming into force June 2022) may not help reduce LA-MRSA, because the genes conferring resistance to bacteria and zinc treatment are not always linked.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>MRSA</kwd><kwd>mobile genetic elements</kwd><kwd>antibiotic resistance</kwd><kwd>zoonosis</kwd><kwd>host-switching</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>109385/Z/15/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Murray</surname><given-names>Gemma GR</given-names></name><name><surname>Weinert</surname><given-names>Lucy A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Matuszewska</surname><given-names>Marta</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/L018934/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Murray</surname><given-names>Gemma GR</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000663</institution-id><institution>Newnham College, University of Cambridge</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Murray</surname><given-names>Gemma GR</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.

They can move rapidly between bacterial genomes, but can also be vertically inherited through stable integration into a host genome. As MGEs often carry genes associated with virulence and antibiotic resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Frost et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Rankin et al., 2011</xref>), an understanding of the drivers and barriers to their acquisition and maintenance is central to predicting the emergence and evolution of novel and resistant pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brockhurst et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>The emergence and evolution of methicillin-resistant <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (MRSA) across different ecological niches and host species are associated with the horizontal transfer of MGEs. Methicillin resistance is carried by the staphylococcal cassette chromosome element SCC<italic>mec</italic>, and additional MGEs carry resistance to other antibiotics, virulence factors, and host-specific adaptations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hanssen and Ericson Sollid, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jamrozy et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Haag et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Turner et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Matuszewska et al., 2020</xref>). While most MRSA clonal complexes (CCs) show an association with specific MGEs, their dynamics are not widely understood, leading to a gap in our understanding of the adaptive potential of <italic>S. aureus</italic> CCs.</p><p>Intensification combined with high levels of antibiotic use in farming has led to particular concerns about livestock as reservoirs of antibiotic-resistant human infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">World Health Organization, 2015</xref>). CC398 has become the dominant MRSA in European livestock. Its rise has been particularly evident in Danish pig farms where the proportion of MRSA-positive herds has increased from &lt;5% in 2008 to 90% in 2018 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sieber et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">DANMAP, 2019</xref>), but it has also been observed in other European countries, and other livestock species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lekkerkerk et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Islam et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anjum et al., 2019</xref>). Livestock-associated (LA) MRSA CC398 has been associated with increasing numbers of human infections, in both people with and without direct contact with livestock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Larsen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">van Alen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sieber et al., 2019</xref>). Understanding the emergence and success of CC398 in European livestock and its capacity to infect the human host is integral to managing the risk that it, and other livestock-associated pathogens, pose to public health.</p><p>Previous studies have used genome sequences to reconstruct the evolutionary history of CC398 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Price et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Ward et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gonçalves da Silva et al., 2017</xref>). They identified a largely methicillin-resistant and livestock-associated clade of CC398, that falls as either sister to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Ward et al., 2014</xref> or within (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Price et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gonçalves da Silva et al., 2017</xref>) a largely methicillin-sensitive and human-associated clade. Through comparing the genomes of isolates from livestock- and human-associated CC398, these studies concluded that the emergence of CC398 in livestock was associated with both the acquisition of antibiotic resistance genes and the loss of genes associated with human immune evasion. While these genes are known to be carried on three categories of MGEs (Tn<italic>916</italic> conjugative transposons, SCC<italic>mec</italic>, and φSa3 prophages), little is known about the dynamics of these MGEs within CC398. Here, we undertake a comprehensive reconstruction of the evolutionary dynamics of these MGEs. We find that while their patterns of presence/absence all show a strong association with the transition to livestock, this is the result of contrasting dynamics. These dynamics can inform predictions about the risk posed by LA-MRSA spillover infections in humans, and the resilience of antibiotic resistance in LA-MRSA to ongoing changes in antibiotic use in farming.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Livestock-associated CC398 emerged between 1957 and 1970</title><p>We collected and assembled publicly available whole-genome sequence data from CC398, and sequenced five isolates recently sampled from pig farms in the United Kingdom.

In 42/70 of our phylogenetically independent groups, the only non-human species was a pig, and none of the pig isolates from these groups carried an φSa3 prophage (while 14% of the human isolates did). In the remaining 28 groups (that included isolates from cows, horses, and poultry), φSa3 prophages were observed in non-human hosts in 17% of groups, but still at a higher frequency in humans (39% of groups) (McNemar’s chi-squared test: p = 0.04).</p><p>In contrast, we found no evidence that the spillover of livestock-associated CC398 into humans is associated with the loss (or gain) of individual antibiotic resistance genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). This contrasts with the conclusions of a previous study that suggested that the resistance genes carried by livestock-associated CC398 are likely to be lost in human hosts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sieber et al., 2019</xref>). We find that no resistance gene was significantly more or less common in humans than in livestock species (McNemar’s chi-squared tests: p &gt; 0.1), nor was there a consistent shift in the overall number of resistance genes (there were more resistance genes in isolates from human hosts in 22/70 pairs and more in livestock hosts in 34/70 pairs).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We have characterised the evolutionary dynamics of the three classes of MGEs that show the greatest changes in frequency across human- and livestock-associated CC398: the Tn<italic>916</italic> transposon and the SCC<italic>mec</italic> element, which are both common in livestock-associated CC398, and the φSa3 prophage, which is common in human-associated CC398. Despite a consistency in the relative frequencies of these elements across CC398, leading to their strong association with the transition to livestock, these three elements show a broad spectrum of dynamics. The Tn<italic>916</italic> transposon carrying <italic>tetM</italic> shows evidence of stable and consistent vertical transmission in livestock-associated CC398 and absence from human-associated CC398. The type Vc SCC<italic>mec</italic>, carrying not only <italic>mecA</italic>, but also <italic>tetK</italic> and <italic>czrC</italic>, has also been stably maintained by several lineages of livestock-associated CC398, but by a combination of vertical and horizontal transmission, and with occasional replacement with type IV elements. While type V SCC<italic>mec</italic> elements are also present in human-associated CC398, there is little evidence of their longer-term maintenance. Finally, while φSa3 prophages carrying a human immune evasion gene cluster are rare in livestock-associated CC398 and common in human-associated CC398, there have been frequent gains and losses in both groups. These contrasting dynamics may reflect variation in the selective benefits and costs of the carriage of these MGEs by CC398, their availability in the environments encountered by CC398, and their mechanisms of transfer.</p><p>The three classes of MGEs whose dynamics we describe all employ different mechanisms of horizontal transfer, and this may both influence their intrinsic stability in the CC398 genome and their availability for acquisition from outside of CC398. Experimental studies have found that different types of MGEs vary in their rates of transfer between bacterial cells. In particular, <italic>in vitro</italic> rates of transfer of phage have been found to be several orders of magnitude higher than of transposons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Humphrey et al., 2021</xref>). A 16-day <italic>in vivo</italic> study of MGE dynamics for two strains of CC398 also observed variation in the mobility of MGEs: the Tn<italic>916</italic> transposon, the type V SCC<italic>mec</italic> and an φSa3 prophage were all stably maintained and not horizontally transferred, while other prophages and plasmids were both gained and lost by daughter cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">McCarthy et al., 2014</xref>). While variation in the intrinsic stability of MGEs in their host will influence their long-term dynamics, other factors may dominate. For instance, the long-term stability of Tn<italic>916</italic> within CC398 could emerge from a broad spectrum of short-term dynamics. It could result from a very low rate of loss, or frequent loss combined with a high selective cost of loss and a low probability of reacquisition from sources other than very closely related cells. Therefore, the long-term dynamics we describe provide a unique insight into the relationship between these MGEs and CC398.</p><p>We find that a Tn<italic>916</italic> transposon that carries <italic>tetM</italic> was acquired once by CC398 and this coincided with its origin in European livestock in 1964 (95% CI: 1957–1970). Our observation of the loss of Tn<italic>916</italic> on terminal branches of the phylogeny suggests that while losses do occur, lineages that lose Tn<italic>916</italic> are either rapidly outcompeted by those that have maintained it, or they rapidly reacquire it from close relatives. Antibiotics, including tetracyclines, were first licensed for use as growth promoters in livestock in European countries in the 1950s, and were in common use by the end of that decade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lowbury, 1958</xref>). While the use of antibiotics as growth promoters was banned by the European Union in 2006, tetracyclines remain the most commonly used antimicrobial class in livestock farming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">World Health Organization, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">DANMAP, 2019</xref>). Carriage of Tn<italic>916</italic> is therefore likely to have been associated with a strong selective benefit for livestock-associated CC398 ever since its emergence. However, as CC398’s exposure to tetracyclines will be intermittent, the long-term stability of Tn<italic>916</italic> is also likely to reflect a low selective cost in the absence of treatment or a barrier to reacquisition following loss. Tn<italic>916</italic>-like elements are found across several bacterial genera (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Clewell et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Roberts and Mullany, 2009</xref>), including other opportunistic pathogens in the respiratory microbiome of pigs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Holden et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hoa et al., 2011</xref>) and other <italic>S. aureus</italic> CCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">de Vries et al., 2009</xref>). This suggests that the stability of Tn<italic>916</italic> in CC398 is not due to the rarity of the element in the environments encountered by CC398, however it may be due to other barriers to successful transfer.</p><p>Previous studies have found evidence that the regulatory system of Tn<italic>916</italic> promotes its maintenance in a host through ensuring both that excision only occurs in the presence of tetracycline (or other transcription-limiting cell stress) and that any selective burden in the absence of treatment is minimised (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Roberts and Mullany, 2009</xref>). Nevertheless, Tn<italic>916</italic> has been found to have a much more dynamic association with lineages of other bacterial species (e.g. <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">D’Aeth et al., 2021</xref>]). The fitness costs of MGEs can be host (and even insertion locus) specific and can also be mitigated over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Starikova et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Durão et al., 2018</xref>), and therefore the stability of Tn<italic>916</italic> in livestock-associated CC398 might reflect a low cost that is specific to this lineage. A combination of high selective benefit, low selective cost and inaccessibility for reacquisition following loss could explain the remarkable stability of Tn<italic>916</italic> in livestock-associated CC398, and may in part explain the success of this lineage in livestock.</p><p>Our results indicate that the acquisition of an SCC<italic>mec</italic> occurred later in the expansion of livestock-associated CC398. The most common SCC<italic>mec</italic> in livestock-associated CC398, type Vc, carries <italic>tetK</italic> and <italic>czrC</italic> in addition to <italic>mecA</italic>. These additional resistance genes might be highly advantageous in livestock, and particularly in pigs. While all livestock-associated CC398 carry <italic>tetM</italic>, there is evidence that carrying <italic>tetK</italic> in addition to <italic>tetM</italic> is associated with increased fitness during exposure to sublethal concentrations of tetracycline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Larsen et al., 2016a</xref>). <italic>czrC</italic> is associated with heavy metal resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cavaco et al., 2010</xref>), which is likely to be beneficial in the context of the common supplementation of animal feed with zinc oxide, which in pigs is commonly used to prevent diarrhoea in weaners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Nielsen et al., 2021</xref>). Additionally, <italic>mecA</italic> is likely to be beneficial because of the common use of β-lactams in livestock farming, including third generation cephalosporins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sjölund et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lekagul et al., 2019</xref>). The size of the type Vc element, combined with the replacements and truncations we observe suggests that it may come with a selective cost. In addition, SCC<italic>mec</italic> type Vc appears to be rare (at least in <italic>S. aureus</italic>). The element has been found in other staphylococci (<italic>S. cohhii</italic> in Vervet Monkeys [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hoefer et al., 2021</xref>]), but has not been reported in other <italic>S. aureus</italic> CCs.</p><p>Loss of the type Vc SCC<italic>mec</italic> on internal branches within livestock-associated CC398 is associated with replacement with a type IV SCC<italic>mec</italic> that only carries <italic>mecA</italic>. While we find evidence of only a single acquisition of the type Vc SCC<italic>mec</italic> by livestock-associated CC398, we find evidence of at least four acquisitions of type IV SCC<italic>mec</italic>. The more recent dates of acquisition, and an apparent association with livestock species other than pigs, might reflect a difference in selective pressures across different livestock species, or a loss of the type Vc element during transmission between livestock populations. The long-term maintenance of the type Vc SCC<italic>mec</italic> is consistent with a high selective benefit (particularly in pigs where this element is most common). However, its repeated loss and replacement with type IV elements are consistent with a low cost of this replacement, at least in certain contexts (perhaps in other livestock hosts), and might also reflect the rarity of the type V element relative to the type IV.</p><p>While the loss of the φSa3 prophage that carries a human immune-evasion gene cluster is associated with the transition to livestock, neither the loss nor the gain of these elements is likely to be a substantial hurdle for the adaptation of CC398 to human or non-human hosts. Their ubiquity in human-associated CC398 and frequent acquisition following transmission of livestock-associated CC398 to humans (consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sieber et al., 2019</xref>), is consistent with a strong benefit in the human host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rohmer and Wolz, 2021</xref>). On the other hand, as we find that these elements are frequently lost and generally absent in other host species, these elements may carry a selective burden outside of the human host. The diversity of φSa3 prophages in CC398 suggests they form a large pool of elements within human hosts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">van Alen et al., 2018</xref>), likely reflecting their ubiquity in human carriage populations of <italic>S. aureus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rohmer and Wolz, 2021</xref>) and capacity to transfer between <italic>S. aureus</italic> lineages.</p><p>We observe one clear exception to the pattern of recent acquisitions of φSa3 in livestock-associated CC398 in response to spillover events: the acquisition of an φSa3 prophage at the base of a poultry-associated subclade of livestock-associated CC398 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Price et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Larsen et al., 2016b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pérez-Moreno et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Tang et al., 2017</xref>). This clade was first described as a hybrid LA-MRSA CC9/CC398 lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Price et al., 2012</xref>), and was subsequently investigated as a lineage associated with human disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Larsen et al., 2016b</xref>). The maintenance of an φSa3 in this lineage may reflect more frequent transmission via a human host, or an adaptation to poultry (a recent study suggested that φSa3 prophages might aid immune evasion in species other than humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jung et al., 2017</xref>]). Either way, this might make this lineage a greater immediate threat to public health.</p><p>While livestock-associated CC398 is found across a broad range of livestock species, it is most commonly associated with pigs. The dynamics of the SCC<italic>mec</italic> and φSa3 prophages that we have identified are both consistent with livestock-associated CC398 originating in pig farms and later spreading to other livestock species. The lower frequency of the type Vc SCC<italic>mec</italic> in species other than pigs could reflect random loss during transmission bottlenecks, or a reduced benefit of either <italic>tetK</italic> or <italic>czrC</italic> in these species. Similarly, the higher frequency of φSa3 prophages in other species might reflect an increased benefit or reduced cost, or more recent transmission via human hosts.</p><p>Our results reveal that LA-MRSA CC398 is a stably antibiotic-resistant pathogen that is capable of dynamic readaptation to humans. We find that Tn<italic>916</italic> and SCC<italic>mec</italic> are both stably maintained in livestock-associated CC398, across different livestock species and countries, and that neither of these MGEs (or other antibiotic resistance genes) tend to be lost when livestock-associated CC398 is transmitted to humans. This suggests that these MGEs are associated with a low selective cost in both livestock and human hosts, and therefore across variable levels and types of antibiotic exposure. The stability of these two MGEs, combined with the capacity of livestock-associated CC398 to rapidly acquire the φSa3 prophage, underlines the threat posed by LA-MRSA to public health. While SCC<italic>mec</italic> is less stably maintained than Tn<italic>916</italic>, our identification of several independent acquisitions of type IV SCC<italic>mec</italic> suggests both a strong selective benefit, not contingent on the carriage of <italic>tetK</italic> and <italic>czrC</italic>, and an availability of type IV elements. These dynamics predict that the impact of gradual reductions in antibiotic consumption on LA-MRSA is likely to be slow to be realised and that the forthcoming EU ban on medical zinc supplementation in pig feed may have a limited impact on LA-MRSA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">European Medicines Agency, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">European Medicines Agency, 2020</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">DANMAP, 2019</xref>).

Trees are visualised and annotated using <italic>ITOL</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Letunic and Bork, 2021</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Comparative analyses of MGEs</title><p>Genes associated with the transition to livestock were identified through comparing frequencies of homologous genes identified with <italic>Roary</italic> across human- and livestock-associated CC398. We investigated the association between these genes and MGEs through analysis of (1) physical locations within our <italic>de novo</italic> assemblies and the reference genomes, (2) correlations in their presence/absence across our collection, and (3) comparison with descriptions in the literature and in online databases of particular MGEs.</p><p>We confirmed the identity of the Tn<italic>916</italic> transposon by comparison with published descriptions and publicly available annotated sequences. SCC<italic>mec</italic> elements were initially categorised into types using a <italic>BLASTn</italic> search of all representative SCC<italic>mec</italic> types from the <italic>SCCmecFinder</italic> database in our <italic>de novo</italic> assemblies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hanssen and Ericson Sollid, 2006</xref>). φSa3 prophages were initially identified and categorised through identification of functional genes associated with the human immune evasion gene cluster. To further characterise diversity within these elements we identified genes associated with each element across our collection. We constructed alignments of genes within MGEs using <italic>Clustal Omega</italic> v1.2.3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sievers and Higgins, 2018</xref>) and checked for misalignment by eye.</p><p>We analysed variation in both gene content and nucleotide diversity within shared genes for each MGE. We estimated pairwise nucleotide distances in concatenated alignments of shared genes for each type of element using the <italic>ape</italic> package in <italic>R</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Paradis et al., 2004</xref>), and constructed maximum likelihood trees using <italic>RaxML</italic> and minimum-spanning trees using <italic>GrapeTree</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Zhou et al., 2018</xref>) to investigate co-phylogeny. We generated confidence intervals for our estimates of mean pairwise nucleotide distances within MGEs by re-estimating the mean distance from 1000 bootstrapped samples of sites. We compared this to sites in the core genome by sampling the same number of sites as were in the MGE alignment from a concatenated alignment of core genes (generated by <italic>Roary</italic>). For SCC<italic>mec</italic> we used ancestral state reconstruction in <italic>BEAST</italic> to infer the evolutionary dynamics of these elements and date their origins within CC398. This involved fitting a discrete traits model to the posterior distributions of trees, with each state representing a version of the element that had been independently acquired by CC398. We used a strict clock model that allowed for asymmetric rates of transitions between states, but we found that the results were robust to use of a symmetric model or a relaxed clock.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Phylogenetically independent groups</title><p>To test the association between spillover into the human host and the presence of φSa3 prophages and antibiotic-resistance genes, we identified 70 phylogenetically independent clades of isolates that were sampled from both human and non-human hosts in the livestock-associated clade. We classed a gene as present in a host if it was observed in any of the isolates from that host in that clade.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Supervision, Visualization, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Resources, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Resources</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Conceptualization, Funding acquisition, Supervision, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Conceptualization, Funding acquisition, Supervision, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>Strain names, country of origin, source (host species), year, accession numbers, and references for all isolates.</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-74819-supp1-v1.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="xlsx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp2"><label>Supplementary file 2.</label><caption><title>Genes that most strongly distinguish human- and livestock-associated CC398, and their association with mobile genetic elements.</title><p>Our gene identifiers and the gene locations and locus tags in published reference genomes are provided.</p></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="xls" xlink:href="elife-74819-supp2-v1.xls"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp3"><label>Supplementary file 3.</label><caption><title>Description of the presence of mobile genetic elements (MGEs) and annotation of MGE types and clades.</title><p>The presence/absence of genes and MGEs is described by 1/0, and types and clades that are presented in the text are described.</p></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="xls" xlink:href="elife-74819-supp3-v1.xls"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp4"><label>Supplementary file 4.</label><caption><title>Description of the genes in the Tn<italic>916</italic> element.</title><p>The genes in the Tn<italic>916</italic> element used in our analyses are described in the reference genome 1_1439.</p></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="xls" xlink:href="elife-74819-supp4-v1.xls"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp5"><label>Supplementary file 5.</label><caption><title>Reference SCC<italic>mec</italic> elements used in BLAST typing.</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="xls" xlink:href="elife-74819-supp5-v1.xls"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp6"><label>Supplementary file 6.</label><caption><title>Description of the genes in the type V SCC<italic>mec</italic> element.</title><p>The genes in the SCC<italic>mec</italic> type Vc element used in our analyses are described in the reference genome 12_LA_293.</p></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="xls" xlink:href="elife-74819-supp6-v1.xls"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp7"><label>Supplementary file 7.</label><caption><title>AMR genes identified by PathogenWatch.</title><p>Gene presence/absence is described by 1/0.</p></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="xls" xlink:href="elife-74819-supp7-v1.xls"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="transrepform"><label>Transparent reporting form</label><media xlink:href="elife-74819-transrepform1-v1.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>The Illumina sequences generated in this study have been deposited in the NCBI short read archive under the accession numbers ERR3524650, ERR3524328, ERR3524354, ERR3524446, and ERR3524562.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Daniel J Wilson as Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Gisela Storz as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers were all impressed by the excellent quality of these comprehensive analyses of an important pathogen strain. Please read the summary below in conjunction with the detailed reviews.</p><p>1) Our first main reservation was that the text should distinguish better what is new vs what is known throughout the paper. As an example, line 28-29 of the abstract is particularly ambiguous.</p><p>2) The second main reservation was the headline conclusion in the title -- that human re-adaptation (acquisition of human immune evasion genes by livestock-associated CC398s) outpaces loss of antibiotic resistance -- can be argued on first principles. From that perspective, it would appear to lack novelty.</p><p>3) A third point of discussion was an apples-and-oranges argument about comparing different MGE types. We felt that since they are fundamentally different and known to come and go at different rates, that this should be acknowledged with references. That is not to say there is no value to empirically quantifying those differences on timescales relevant to the evolution of CC398, and to discussing the implications for the turnover of the different AMR genes they carry.</p><p>My inclination is that the new analyses of MGE dynamics (how often known CC398-associated MGEs have come and gone, and the dates of these events) probably add sufficient novelty to warrant publication in <italic>eLife</italic>, but as currently presented that is not certain. I would welcome a revision that focuses on addressing this point.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I find that the comparison made in the title potentially a false equivalence between the evolutionary mechanisms driving gain/loss of pathogenicity genes, and gain/loss of resistance, for a few reasons. One, loss of resistance genes first requires that the 'mutation' leading to loss of resistance occurs, then lineages with that loss are selectively favoured. In contrast, (re)acquisition of the pathogenicity genes, which are already present in the wider population/community of bacteria, is much more likely to occur and then be selectively favoured. It is thus hard to envision a scenario where adaptive evolution for pathogenicity would ever be expected to outpace adaptive loss of resistance, unless the fitness costs of resistance are extremely high. I think the analysis and data stand on their own without having to force this comparison</p><p>Two, for an expectation that a 'thing' might be lost, its carriage should be associated with a fitness cost. While this is touched on, I would like to see more discussion about whether Tn916 is likely to carry a cost, otherwise its stable maintenance is the rule rather than the exception. Also, are there estimates about how easily Tn916 can be lost? Does it not drive its own reacquisition if an excision event is to occur?</p><p>Three, prophages, plasmids and transposons likely have different rates of gain/loss. This has been experimentally demonstrated by an excellent study from the group of Prof Jodi Lindsey (McCarthy et al., 2014, Genome Biology and Evolution, doi: 10.1093/gbe/evu214). Transfer of some MGEs was observed within 4 hours, whereas transfer of Tn916 was not observed within 16 days. I think it may lead to misleading comparisons to lump different types of MGEs together, as their gain/loss dynamics can differ significantly.</p><p>I would thus like to see an expanded discussion (i.e. more than just supposition) about estimated costs of SCCmec and phiSa3, or estimated benefits of (re-)acquiring these when selectively advantageous, and also what might be driving the replacement of Type V with other types. Also on relative rates of gain/loss events for the different categories of MGEs here. I would also recommend altering the title, as I do not find the comparison made there compelling, but that might be excessive.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>In general, this manuscript is very well done and as mentioned in the public review, of high quality for the reader. It is in my eyes very close to be ready for publication if accepted, and I only have a few comments. Important, however, is the fact that the novelty in the manuscript is very limited because most results have been published earlier in the studies on the original datasets which are used here.</p><p>I only have a few comments:</p><p>General comments:</p><p>– Do you have any hypothesis on why ΦSa3 phages frequently are re-introduced and where from, as compared to other elements?</p><p>Specific comments:</p><p>– Line 62 and Table S1: Sieber et al., 2019 should be Sieber et al., 2018, mBio.</p><p>– Line 110: space missing before &quot;(Ward et al., 2014)”.</p><p>– Line 275: “that integrate into the hlb gene of <italic>S. aureus</italic>”: There is strong evidence that the ΦSa3 phages integrate at other positions in LA-MRSA CC398.

While our study represents the largest comparative genomic study of CC398 isolates to date, allowing for more accurate characterisation of MGE carriage and dating of transitions, the greatest novelty of our study lies in our reconstruction of the evolutionary dynamics of the MGEs associated with the transition to livestock. We have now amended the manuscript in several places (including the abstract) to make this clearer through better referencing of previous work on CC398 and these MGEs (lines 26-30, 100-105, 199-201, 448-453, 482-500, 515-518, 522-533, 598-601).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The second main reservation was the headline conclusion in the title -- that human re-adaptation (acquisition of human immune evasion genes by livestock-associated CC398s) outpaces loss of antibiotic resistance -- can be argued on first principles. From that perspective, it would appear to lack novelty.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that our interpretation of our results could have been more nuanced and have included more consideration of the mechanisms and selective pressures that may have led to the dynamics we identify. However, we don’t agree that our finding that adaptation to the human host occurs more rapidly than the loss of resistance can be argued from first principles.</p><p>In particular, MGEs carrying resistance genes often have fitness costs (e.g. Starikova et al., 2013 DOI:10.1093/jac/dkt270) (now noted in lines 527-529). Accurate predictions of the costs of MGEs are also difficult. This is in part because most studies of their impact on fitness are based on experimental (and often in vitro) assays, and these cannot fully replicate the selective pressures experienced by natural populations. Fitness costs can also vary across different bacterial hosts. In particular, the fitness costs of MGEs may be mitigated over time (lines 527-529), and therefore our finding that Tn<italic>916</italic> and SCC<italic>mec</italic> types V and IV have been maintained by livestock-associated CC398 over long periods may suggest that CC398 has evolved to mitigate costs associated with carriage of these MGEs.</p><p>A recent smaller-scale study (that didn’t fully correct for the impact of phylogenetic structure on their comparisons) came to the opposite conclusion to ours (Sieber et al., 2019; DOI:10.1038/s41598-019-55086-x) (lines 448-450). They concluded that transmission from pigs to humans is both associated with the loss of antibiotic resistance genes and the acquisition of human immune evasion genes. In reference to resistance genes, the authors concluded that ‘the genes are likely lost because they do not provide a fitness advantage in absence of the corresponding antimicrobial compounds in the human hosts’. The fact that this conclusion was drawn by authors who are experts in this field suggests that our findings are indeed novel.</p><p>In addition, the degree of selective benefit obtained from acquisition of the Sa3 prophage is not entirely clear. While these prophages are common in human <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> strains and are associated with increased virulence, they are not essential for human nasal colonisation (Verkaik et al., 2011 DOI:10.1111/j.1469-0691.2010.03227.x).</p><p>Despite this, we agree that our title unnecessarily implied an equivalence in the evolutionary trajectories of the MGEs we are describing. We have therefore modified our title and added substantially to our discussion and interpretation of the dynamics we identify.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) A third point of discussion was an apples-and-oranges argument about comparing different MGE types. We felt that since they are fundamentally different and known to come and go at different rates, that this should be acknowledged with references. That is not to say there is no value to empirically quantifying those differences on timescales relevant to the evolution of CC398, and to discussing the implications for the turnover of the different AMR genes they carry.</p><p>My inclination is that the new analyses of MGE dynamics (how often known CC398-associated MGEs have come and gone, and the dates of these events) probably add sufficient novelty to warrant publication in eLife, but as currently presented that is not certain. I would welcome a revision that focuses on addressing this point.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that our interpretation of our results should have included discussion of the different types of MGEs, as type influences short-term rates of acquisition and loss. As suggested, we have now added a paragraph to our discussion that directly addresses this point (lines 482-500), and greater context to our discussion of the dynamics of individual MGEs.</p><p>Nevertheless, we consider that there is considerable value in quantifying the long-term dynamics of these MGEs within CC398, independently of their type. Differences between these short-term and our long-term dynamics will reflect MGEs selective benefits/costs/availability. The long-term dynamics are important for understanding and predicting the evolution of the traits associated with the carriage of these MGEs. It is long-term dynamics that can inform predictions of how these traits are likely to be influenced by changes in the environment of CC398, such as host jumps or changes in the use of antibiotics in farming. Our current understanding of the long-term dynamics of MGEs, are how they are gained and lost in natural populations is extremely limited and we think our study develops a creative approach to uncovering these dynamics. Our amended discussion reflects on this point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>I find that the comparison made in the title potentially a false equivalence between the evolutionary mechanisms driving gain/loss of pathogenicity genes, and gain/loss of resistance, for a few reasons.

I think the analysis and data stand on their own without having to force this comparison</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that our title could be interpreted as suggesting an equivalence in the processes and/or drivers of gain of pathogenicity genes and loss of resistance genes. As the reviewer notes, there are several factors that will influence the dynamics of these MGEs along a bacterial lineage, including those that influence the chance of random gain/loss of the MGE and the selective benefit/cost of this.</p><p>While we may expect (based on experiments, theory and observations of nature) that the selective benefit of losing MGEs carrying resistance genes in the absence of treatment is less than the benefit of acquiring MGEs carrying human-adaptive genes when moving into the human host, our results reveal how these predictions relate to the actual dynamics of these MGEs within CC398 as it moves between different host groups.</p><p>MGEs carrying resistance genes are often associated with fitness costs, and these costs can be host (and even insertion locus) specific (e.g. Starikova et al., 2013 DOI:10.1093/jac/dkt270) (now noted in lines 527-530). Accurate predictions of the costs of MGEs are made more difficult because most studies of their fitness costs are based on experimental (and often in vitro) assays, and these cannot fully replicate the selective pressures experienced by natural populations. It has also been suggested that the fitness costs of MGEs are likely to be mitigated over time (lines 527-530), and therefore our finding that particular MGEs have been maintained by livestock-associated CC398 over long periods may be informative because they predict that CC398 has evolved to mitigate the costs associated with carriage of these MGEs. Nevertheless, this cost could still vary across host species. For instance, it could be the case that CC398 experiences greater competition with resident populations of <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> in a human host, and therefore that the cost carriage of MGEs carrying resistance genes may be greater in humans than in livestock.</p><p>Sieber <italic>et al.,</italic> (2019; DOI:10.1038/s41598-019-55086-x) compared the genomes of livestock-associated CC398 isolates sampled from human and pigs, and they concluded that transmission from pigs to humans is both associated with the loss of antibiotic resistance genes and the acquisition of human immune evasion genes. In reference to resistance genes, the authors concluded that ‘the genes are likely lost because they do not provide a fitness advantage in absence of the corresponding antimicrobial compounds in the human hosts’. This study had a smaller sample size (256 isolates) than ours, only included human and pig isolates, and compared human and pig isolates using a method that did not fully correct for phylogenetic structure. While our results are therefore not entirely comparable, we consider our results to be more robust than those of this previous study. However, the fact that this conclusion was drawn by authors who are experts in this field suggests that our findings are not entirely anticipated. We have added a reference to the results of this previous study to our manuscript (lines 448-450).</p><p>Nevertheless, we agree with the reviewer that the selection for loss of the MGEs carrying resistance genes in the absence of treatment is unlikely to be as strong as selection for acquisition of the MGEs carrying host-adaptive genes, and we have therefore modified our title so that we don’t imply a potentially false equivalence regarding the selective pressures on their carriage.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Two, for an expectation that a 'thing' might be lost, its carriage should be associated with a fitness cost. While this is touched on, I would like to see more discussion about whether Tn916 is likely to carry a cost, otherwise its stable maintenance is the rule rather than the exception. Also, are there estimates about how easily Tn916 can be lost? Does it not drive its own reacquisition if an excision event is to occur?</p></disp-quote><p>We have substantially expanded our discussion of the Tn<italic>916</italic> element (lines 502-533). In particular, we have added discussion about how its regulation may both mitigate its cost and promote its maintenance. While this may predict the stability of Tn<italic>916</italic>, this prediction does not hold for all bacterial species (such as <italic>Streptococcus pnuemoniae</italic>; D’Aeth et al., 2021) and therefore these mechanisms alone cannot explain or predict the maintenance of Tn<italic>916</italic> in CC398. We also discuss the likelihood that this element provides a strong selective benefit for CC398 in livestock due to the high levels of usage of tetracyclines, and how this element is observed across a wide range of bacterial species, including other opportunistic pathogens in the respiratory tract of pigs, and other <italic>S. aureus</italic> CCs. The latter suggests that the stability is not a consequence of the rarity of the element, as the element is likely to be present in other bacteria in the environment of CC398. Although it could instead reflect the rarity of successful interspecies transfers.</p><p>We have also added a section that describes the results of experimental studies of the dynamics of the Tn<italic>916</italic> transposon (and other MGEs) (lines 482-500). We report how these studies have found that transposons are more stably maintained (and less frequently transferred) than other types of MGEs. In particular, one study found that the Tn<italic>916</italic> in CC398 was stably inherited (and not transferred to other cells) over the course of a 16-day in vitro experiment. Nevertheless, the SCC<italic>mec</italic> and the φSa3 prophage were also stably maintained over the course of this experiment (while other prophages and plasmids were more dynamically gained and lost) (McCarthy et al., 2014). Therefore, while these short-term dynamics will likely influence the long-term dynamics we describe, other factors will also be important, and the long-term dynamics within a particular bacterial lineage cannot be predicted solely by transmission mechanism.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Three, prophages, plasmids and transposons likely have different rates of gain/loss. This has been experimentally demonstrated by an excellent study from the group of Prof Jodi Lindsey (McCarthy et al., 2014, Genome Biology and Evolution, doi: 10.1093/gbe/evu214). Transfer of some MGEs was observed within 4 hours, whereas transfer of Tn916 was not observed within 16 days. I think it may lead to misleading comparisons to lump different types of MGEs together, as their gain/loss dynamics can differ significantly.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that in addition to differences in their selective benefit/cost different types of mobile genetic elements may differ in their dynamics due to differences in their mechanism of transfer. Nevertheless, our understanding of how these differences translate into long-term dynamics in natural populations is lacking in most cases, and studies such as ours can shed light on this. In the study undertaken by McCarthy et al., (2014), the Tn<italic>916</italic> element was not transferred during the 16 day experiment, but neither was the type V SCC<italic>mec</italic> or the Sa3 prophage. This suggests that all three of these elements are more intrinsically stable than other MGEs carried by CC398 isolates. This may, in part, explain the stability of all three of these elements in CC398 compared to other MGEs.</p><p>Other studies have, however, found that transposons tend to be more stable and less frequently transferred than prophages, and this difference could influence the long-term dynamics of these MGEs in CC398. These dynamics cannot, however, predict the long-term dynamics we identify. These long-term dynamics in a real population will be strongly influenced by both natural selection (both costs and benefits) and the availability of MGEs for acquisition by CC398. Therefore, despite what is known about short-term transmission dynamics of these MGEs, our study provides a unique insight into the longer-term dynamics these MGEs within CC398.</p><p>We agree with the reviewer that we ought to have related our results more to what is known of the dynamics of these elements over shorter time periods, and in laboratory conditions. We have therefore substantially expanded our discussion through the addition of a paragraph addressing this point (lines 482-500), and additions to our discussions of individual MGEs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I would thus like to see an expanded discussion (i.e. more than just supposition) about estimated costs of SCCmec and phiSa3, or estimated benefits of (re-)acquiring these when selectively advantageous, and also what might be driving the replacement of Type V with other types. Also on relative rates of gain/loss events for the different categories of MGEs here. I would also recommend altering the title, as I do not find the comparison made there compelling, but that might be excessive.</p></disp-quote><p>We have provided a significantly expanded discussion which we hope addresses your concerns. We have tried to select the most relevant aspects of the literature on these three categories of elements to put our results in context, as there is a lot to discuss about each of these three elements. We have also amended our title, as you have suggested, so that we don’t suggest an equivalence between the drivers of the dynamics of these MGEs. We hope that we have satisfied you that the dynamics we describe are both interesting and important.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>In general, this manuscript is very well done and as mentioned in the public review, of high quality for the reader. It is in my eyes very close to be ready for publication if accepted, and I only have a few comments. Important, however, is the fact that the novelty in the manuscript is very limited because most results have been published earlier in the studies on the original datasets which are used here.</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to thank the reviewer for their positive assessment of our study and for their useful suggestions. We have provided a point-by-point response to their comments below. Page and line numbers refer to the word document with tracked changes.</p><p>We appreciate that we could have made it clearer which aspects of our results are novel. As our study is the largest comparative genomic analysis of CC398 isolates to date, it has allowed us to confirm previous described associations between MGEs and the transition of CC398 to livestock and allowed for more accurate dating of the emergence of CC398 in livestock. Nevertheless, the novelty of our study lies in our reconstruction of the evolutionary dynamics of the MGEs associated with the transition to livestock, which has never been done before. We have amended the manuscript in several places to make this clearer through better referencing of previous work on CC398 and these MGEs (lines 26-30, 100-105, 199-201, 448-453, 482-500, 515-518, 522-533, 598-601).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I only have a few comments:</p><p>General comments:</p><p>– Do you have any hypothesis on why ΦSa3 phages frequently are re-introduced and where from, as compared to other elements?</p></disp-quote><p>ΦSa3 prophages are common in human-associated <italic>S. aureus</italic> populations, and therefore it seems likely that when livestock-associated CC398 isolates are transmitted to humans they acquire them from other <italic>S. aureus</italic> CCs within the human host. The loss and reacquisition within human-associated CC398 could also result from occasional transmission between lineages that carry different ΦSa3 prophages when they co-colonise the same host. What is known about these elements suggests that they are only associated with <italic>S. aureus</italic>, and so their diversity and dynamics may reflect the large and diverse population of <italic>S. aureus</italic> that colonises human hosts (lines 598-601).</p><p>There is evidence that SCC<italic>mec</italic> has a larger host range, as it has been found more widely across staphylococci species. It is therefore possible that SCC<italic>mec</italic> acquisitions may originate from either other <italic>S. aureus</italic> lineages or from other staphylococci species. SCC<italic>mec</italic> type IV is associated with human community-associated <italic>S. aureus</italic> populations, and therefore might be acquired by livestock-associated CC398 when it moves through the human population (lines 571-578).</p><p>Tn<italic>916</italic> has an even larger host range. It has been found across several bacterial genera (lines 515-518). This makes it very difficult to determine where CC398 acquired its Tn<italic>916</italic> element from.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Specific comments:</p><p>– Line 62 and Table S1: Sieber et al., 2019 should be Sieber et al., 2018, mBio.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for observing this error.

Can you discuss this?</p></disp-quote><p>We have now mentioned this difference in our manuscript (lines 448-450). Our analysis differs from the one undertaken by Sieber et al., as it includes a larger number of isolates, isolates from livestock species other than pigs, and isolates from across a wider geographic range. In addition, due to the larger number of isolates in our collection, we were able to use an approach that better corrects for phylogenetic structure (comparing 70 phylogenetically independent pairs of isolates from human and livestock species). This means that our results are likely to be more robust than those of Sieber et al., 2019. While Sieber et al., 2019 considered patterns across three lineages (plus the remainder), they did not always observe consistent patterns of the loss of resistance genes across these independent lineages, and even when a consistent pattern was observed, the small number of independent comparisons means that these patterns may have arisen by chance.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Lines 416-418: This should be explained more precisely. Why are these dynamics consistent with these traits?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this statement was unclear. We’ve now expanded on this statement, hopefully answering the reviewer’s question (lines 575-580). In short, the fact that the type V SCC<italic>mec</italic> has been replaced several times with type IV SCC<italic>mec</italic>, and that lineages carrying type IV SCC<italic>mec</italic> have persisted over several years (in parallel with those carrying type V), suggest that this replacement is not associated with a significant reduction in fitness. Multiple acquisitions of the type IV element and only a single acquisition of the type V element also suggests that the type IV element might be more common in the environments encountered by CC398.</p></body></sub-article></article>
