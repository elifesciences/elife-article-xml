We found that the functional loss of an evolutionarily conserved E3 ubiquitin ligase, UBR-1, leads to IVM resistance in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>. Multiple IVM-inhibiting activities, including viability, body size, pharyngeal pumping, and locomotion, were significantly ameliorated in various <italic>ubr-1</italic> mutants. Interestingly, exogenous application of glutamate induces IVM resistance in wild-type animals. The sensitivity of all IVM-affected phenotypes of <italic>ubr-1</italic> is restored by eliminating proteins associated with glutamate metabolism or signaling: GOT-1, a transaminase that converts aspartate to glutamate, and EAT-4, a vesicular glutamate transporter. We demonstrated that IVM-targeted GluCls (glutamate-gated chloride channels) are downregulated and that the IVM-mediated inhibition of serotonin-activated pharynx Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity is diminished in <italic>ubr-1</italic>. Additionally, enhancing glutamate uptake in <italic>ubr-1</italic> mutants through ceftriaxone completely restored their IVM sensitivity. Therefore, UBR-1 deficiency-mediated aberrant glutamate signaling leads to ivermectin resistance in <italic>C. elegans</italic>.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Anthelmintic resistance</kwd><kwd>Ivermectin</kwd><kwd>UBR-1 deficiency</kwd><kwd>glutamate metabolism</kwd><kwd>GluCls</kwd><kwd>Ceftriaxone</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100010904</institution-id><institution>Major International Joint Research Programme</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>32020103007</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gao</surname><given-names>Shangbang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>32371189</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gao</surname><given-names>Shangbang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Key Research and Development Program of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2022YFA1206000</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gao</surname><given-names>Shangbang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Behavioral and functional analyses revealed that UBR-1 deficiency in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> disrupts glutamate signaling and confers ivermectin resistance.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Anthelmintic resistance (AR) to broad-spectrum antiparasitic macrocyclic lactones (MLs), which include ivermectin (IVM), avermectin (AVM), and doramectin (DOM), has emerged as a critical global concern in veterinary parasites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wolstenholme and Kaplan, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fissiha and Kinde, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kaplan and Vidyashankar, 2012</xref>). The rise of anthelmintic-resistant nematodes poses a pressing issue, impacting not only livestock production but also animal welfare and human health. Overcoming this challenge requires a comprehensive understanding of the molecular mechanisms driving nematode resistance, which, in turn, will facilitate the development of innovative and effective parasite prevention strategies.</p><p>The nematode <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> (<italic>C. elegans</italic>), owing to its sensitivity to a majority of anthelmintic drugs and conservation of functional genes, serves as a crucial model organism for identifying genes related to IVM resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Geary and Thompson, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Holden-Dye and Walker, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Burns et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Martin et al., 2021</xref>). Mutations in three <italic>C. elegans</italic> glutamate-gated chloride channel (GluCl) <italic>genes—avr-15</italic>, <italic>avr-14</italic>, and <italic>glc-</italic>1—have collectively demonstrated strong resistance to IVM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dent et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ghosh et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wolstenholme and Rogers, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dent et al., 2000</xref>). Exogenous expression and crystallization X-ray structural analysis support the premise that these GluCls act as the primary targets of IVM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cully et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hibbs and Gouaux, 2011</xref>). Further identification of IVM resistance-related genes, including P-glycoprotein transporters (<italic>pgp-1</italic>, <italic>pgp-3</italic>, <italic>pgp-6</italic>, <italic>pgp-9</italic>, <italic>pgp-13</italic>, and <italic>mrp-6</italic>), cytochrome oxidases (<italic>cyp-14, cyp-34/35</italic>), and glutathione S-transferases (<italic>gst-4</italic>, <italic>gst-10</italic>). (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lespine et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ardelli and Prichard, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gerhard et al., 2020</xref>), has revealed their role in enhancing IVM excretion or metabolism. These detoxification genes are thought to be regulated by the ubiquitous transcription factor NHR-8, which encodes a nuclear hormone receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ménez et al., 2019</xref>). While these studies have revealed a polygenic mechanism underlying IVM resistance, increasing reports of unknown causes of IVM resistance continue to emerge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dube et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dube et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Robert et al., 2021</xref>), suggesting that previously unrecognized or additional mechanisms regulating GluCls expression may await for further investigation.</p><p>UBR1, an E3 ubiquitin ligase and a pivotal component of the ubiquitin‒proteasome system, facilitates protein degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bachmair et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gardner et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Varshavsky, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hershko et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Haglund and Dikic, 2005</xref>). UBR1 is implicated in substrate-specific recognition and metabolism, primarily through the N-end rule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sriram et al., 2011</xref>). In humans, loss-of-function mutations in UBR1 result in Johanson-Blizzard syndrome (JBS), a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by a spectrum of developmental and neurological symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Johanson and Blizzard, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Daentl et al., 1979</xref>). In the nematode <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, a single UBR-1 homolog retains all major conserved functional domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chitturi et al., 2018</xref>). LIN-28 is the sole identified substrate of <italic>C. elegans</italic> UBR-1, acting as an RNA-binding pluripotency factor crucial for seam cell patterning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Weaver et al., 2017</xref>). However, the absence of LIN-28 neither replicates nor ameliorates the movement defects observed in <italic>ubr-1</italic> mutants-stiff body bending during backward movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chitturi et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Our recent research has consistently shown that UBR-1 regulates neural outputs through glutamate homeostasis mechanisms. Loss of UBR-1 leads to elevated glutamate levels in animals, disrupting coordinated motor patterns, likely due to a compensatory decrease in the expression of excitatory glutamate receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chitturi et al., 2018</xref>). Furthermore, <italic>ubr-1</italic> mutations disturb inherent asymmetric neural activity by activating inhibitory GluCls (GLC-3 and GLC-2/4), which in turn impairs rhythmic defecation motor programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Li et al., 2023</xref>). These observations suggest that aberrant glutamate metabolism resulting from UBR-1 deficiency has a widespread effect on glutamatergic signaling pathways. This leads to the question of whether <italic>ubr-1</italic> mutants cause comprehensive changes in IVM-targeted GluCls, thereby contributing to IVM resistance.</p><p>To investigate this possibility, we assessed the IVM sensitivity of wild-type and <italic>ubr-1</italic> mutant animals. We found that, in contrast to wild-type N2 animals, loss-of-function <italic>ubr-1</italic> mutants present a range of IVM-resistant phenotypes. N2 animals exhibit high fatality rates, abnormal development and motor defects, such as pharyngeal pumping or locomotion disabilities, upon exposure to IVM. In contrast, <italic>ubr-1</italic> mutants were almost insensitive to IVM. The elimination of the glutamate synthetase GOT-1 and the glutamate transporter EAT-4 completely reversed the IVM sensitivity of <italic>ubr-1</italic> mutants, highlighting the critical role of the glutamatergic signaling pathway. Using translational reporters, we found that IVM resistance in <italic>ubr-1</italic> mutants is caused by the functional downregulation of IVM-targeted GluCls, including AVR-15, AVR-14, and GLC-1. These receptors are activated by glutamate to facilitate chloride ion influx into pharyngeal muscle cells, thereby inhibiting muscle contractions and suppressing food intake in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. This downregulation of GluCls is presumably triggered by the aberrantly elevated glutamate-induced compensatory decrease, as the application of exogenous glutamate in wild-type animals partially replicated the IVM resistance observed in <italic>ubr-1</italic> mutants. GluCls downregulation is functionally validated, as evidenced by the diminished IVM-mediated inhibition of serotonin-activated pharyngeal Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity in <italic>ubr-1</italic> mutants. Moreover, pharmacologically reducing glutamate levels via the use of ceftriaxone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lee et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rothstein et al., 2005</xref>) successfully restored IVM sensitivity in <italic>ubr-1</italic> mutants. Thus, our study presents multiple lines of evidence for a novel IVM resistance mechanism linked to the deficiency of the ubiquitin ligase UBR-1 via a glutamate metabolism pathway.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Dose- and time-dependence of IVM resistance in <italic>ubr-1</italic> mutants</title><p>To further elucidate the mechanisms of AR, we employed a simplified assay derived from prior research (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, UBR-1 ensures functional glutamate homeostasis by inhibiting the activity of transaminase GOT-1 through a pathway that has yet to be resolved. A deficiency in UBR-1 leads to uncontrolled production of excess glutamate by GOT-1, which is then packed into synaptic vesicles for release via the vesicular glutamate transporter VGLUT/EAT-4. This excess glutamate results in the downregulation of glutamate receptors, including the IVM-targeted GluCls AVR-15, AVR-14, and GLC-1. The consequent reduction in these receptors diminishes the inhibitory effect of IVM on 5-HT-evoked pharynx Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity, highlighting the notable IVM resistance in <italic>ubr-1</italic> mutants. Furthermore, the exogenous application of glutamate induces IVM resistance in wild-type animals, whereas the pharmacological enhancement of glutamate transporter activity via ceftriaxone mitigates resistance in <italic>ubr-1</italic> mutants.

Ceftriaxone and eat-4 mutants reduce extracellular/synaptic glutamate concentrations by sequestering available glutamate in neurons, suggesting that it is extracellular glutamate that is important. But then why does rescuing ubr-1 specifically in the pharyngeal muscle have such a strong effect on ivermectin sensitivity? Is glutamate leaking out of the pharyngeal muscle into the extracellular space/synapse? Is it possible that UBR-1 acts directly on the avr-15 subunit, both of which are expressed in the muscle, perhaps as part of a glutamate sensing/homeostasis mechanism?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your insightful feedback and thought-provoking questions. These are excellent points that have prompted us to critically reconsider our findings and the proposed mechanism.</p><p>Several potential explanations could be considered, although we currently lack direct evidence to support this hypothesis: (1) The pharynx likely plays a dominant role in ivermectin resistance, as previously reported (Dent et al., 1997; Dent et al., 2000), and overexpression of UBR-1 in the pharyngeal muscle may exhibit a strong effect on ivermectin sensitivity. (2) It is also possible that pharyngeal muscle cells have the capacity to release glutamate into the extracellular space, which could contribute to the observed effect. (3) Alternatively, UBR-1 expression in the pharyngeal muscle may regulate other indirect pathways affecting extracellular or synaptic glutamate concentrations.</p><p>We also appreciate your suggestion that UBR-1 may act directly on AVR-15 in the pharynx. While this is an interesting possibility, UBR-1 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase, and if AVR-15 were a direct target, we would expect UBR-1 to ubiquitinate AVR-15 and promote its degradation. In this case, loss of UBR-1 should inhibit AVR-15 ubiquitination, reduce its degradation, and lead to increased AVR-15 protein levels in the pharynx. However, our experimental data show a reduction, rather than an increase, in AVR-15::GFP levels in <italic>ubr-1</italic> mutants (Figure 4A). This observation suggests that AVR-15 is less likely to be a direct target of UBR-1. To definitively address this hypothesis, a direct assessment of AVR-15 ubiquitination levels in wild-type and <italic>ubr-1</italic> mutant backgrounds would be needed. We agree that this is an important avenue for future investigation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The use of single ivermectin dose assays can be misleading. A response change at a single dose shows that the dose-response curve has shifted, but the response is not linear with dose, so the degree of that shift may be difficult to discern and may result from a change in slope but not EC50. Similarly, in Figure 3C, the reader is meant to understand that eat-4 mutant is epistatic to ubr-1 because the double mutant has a wild-type response to ivermectin. But eat-4 alone is more sensitive, so (eyeballing it and interpolating) the shift in EC50 caused by the ubr-1 mutant in a wild type background appears to be the same as in an eat-4 background, so arguably you are seeing an additive effect, not epistasis. For the above reasons, it would be desirable to have results for rescuing constructs in a wild-type background, in addition to the mutant background.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your detailed feedback and observations.</p><p>The potential additive effect you noted in Figure 3C appears to be specific to the body length analysis. In our other three ivermectin resistance assays (viability, pumping rate, and locomotion velocity), this additive effect was not observed. A possible explanation for this is that <italic>eat-4</italic> and <italic>got-1</italic> single mutants inherently exhibit reduced body length compared to wild-type worms (Mörck and Pilon 2006; Greer <italic>et al.</italic> 2008; Chitturi <italic>et al.</italic> 2018), which may give the appearance of an additive effect in this particular assay.</p><p>Regarding the use of rescuing constructs, we performed these experiments in the <italic>ubr-1;got-1</italic> and <italic>ubr-1;eat-4</italic> double mutant backgrounds. This was designed to test whether the suppression of <italic>ubr-1</italic>-mediated ivermectin resistance by <italic>got-1</italic> or <italic>eat-4</italic> mutations is indeed due to the functional activity of GOT-1 and EAT-4, respectively. The choice of this setup was to ensure that the double mutant phenotype was fully addressed. In contrast, rescuing constructs of GOT-1 and/or EAT-4 in a wild-type background might not sufficiently reveal the relationship between GOT-1, EAT-4, and UBR-1. However, we are open to further testing your suggestion in the future.</p><p>To aid in the interpretation and clarify the apparent effects, we have revised Figure 3 annotation to clearly represent the data and the comparisons being made. We hope this adjustment makes the results more straightforward and easier for readers to understand.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The added value of the pumping data in Figure 5 (using calcium imaging) over the pump counts (from video) in Figure 1G, Figure 2E, F, K, &amp; Figure 3D, H is not clearly explained. It may have to do with the use of &quot;dissected&quot; pharynxes, the nature/advantage of which is not sufficiently documented in the Methods/Results.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing this out. The behavioral pumping data in Figure 1G, Figure 2E, F, K, &amp; Figure 3D and calcium imaging data in Figure 5 were obtained under different experimental conditions. Specifically, the behavioral assays (pumping rate) were conducted on standard culture plates with freely moving worms, whereas the calcium imaging experiments were performed in a liquid environment with immobilized worms. In the calcium imaging setup, the dissection refers to gently puncturing the epidermis behind head of the worm with a glass electrode to relieve internal pressure, which aids in stabilizing the calcium imaging process and ensures better visualization of pharyngeal muscle activity.</p><p>We compared the pharyngeal muscle activity of worms that were not subjected to puncturing the epidermis and found no significant difference when activated by 20 mM serotonin. Therefore, we speculate that there is no direct interaction between the bath solution and the pharynx or head neurons. To avoid confusion, we have removed the term &quot;dissected&quot; from the manuscript and added additional experimental details in the Methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>(1) The authors propose that ubr-1 mutants are resistant to ivermectin due to persistent elevation of glutamate that leads to a compensatory reduction in GluCl levels and thus resistance to Ivermectin. This model would be strengthened by experiments more directly connecting glutamate, GluCls and Ivermectin sensitivity. For example, does overexpression of a relevant GluCl such as AVR-15 restore Ivermectin sensitivity to ubr-1 mutants? Does Ceftriaxone treatment affect the Ivermectin resistance of worms lacking the relevant GluCls (i.e., avr-15, avr-14 and glc-1)? - The model suggests that Ceftriaxone treatment would have no effect in the latter case.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your valuable suggestion. Based on your recommendation, we have performed two additional experiments to strengthen our model. First, we conducted an overexpression experiment of AVR-15 and found that it significantly, though partially, restored ivermectin sensitivity in <italic>ubr-1</italic> mutants (p &lt; 0.01, Supplemental Figure S5D). Second, we tested the effect of Ceftriaxone treatment on the IVM resistance of <italic>avr-15; avr-14; glc-1</italic> triple mutants, which encode the most critical glutamate receptors involved in IVM sensitivity. As expected, we found that Ceftriaxone treatment did not alter the IVM resistance in these triple mutants (Supplemental Figure S5E), supporting the idea that these specific GluCls are key to the observed resistance.</p><p>These two experiments provide further support for our proposed model. We have integrated the results into the manuscript, updating the Results section and Supplemental Figure S5D, E, as well as the corresponding Figure Legends.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Line 211 - Ceftriaxone is known to upregulate EAAT2 expression in mammals. Do the authors know if the drug also increases EAAT expression in <italic>C. elegans</italic>?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for raising this point. To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate the antagonistic effect of ceftriaxone on ivermectin resistance in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, particularly in the context of <italic>ubr-1</italic>-mediated resistance. Ceftriaxone enhances glutamate uptake by increasing the expression of excitatory amino acid transporter-2 (EAAT2) in mammals (Rothstein et al., 2005, Lee et al., 2008). <italic>C. elegans</italic> has six glutamate transporters encoded by <italic>glt-1</italic> and <italic>glt-3–7</italic> (Mano <italic>et al.</italic> 2007).</p><p>Compared to testing whether ceftriaxone increases the expression of these EAATs in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, identifying which specific <italic>glt</italic> gene targeted by ceftriaxone may better reveal its mechanism of action. To investigate this, we performed a genetic analysis. In the <italic>ubr-1</italic> mutant, we individually deleted the six <italic>glt</italic> genes and found that ceftriaxone’s ability to restore ivermectin sensitivity was specifically suppressed in the <italic>ubr-1; glt-1</italic> and <italic>ubr-1; glt-5</italic> double mutants (Author response image 1A). This suggests that <italic>glt-1</italic> and <italic>glt-5</italic> may be the targets of ceftriaxone in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. In contrast, ivermectin sensitivity was unaffected in the individual <italic>glt</italic> mutants (Author response image 1B), indicating that a single <italic>glt</italic> deletion may not be sufficient to alter glutamate level or induce GluRs downregulation. Further studies are needed to determine whether ceftriaxone directly increases GLT-1 and GLT-5 expression in <italic>C. elegans</italic> and to explore the underlying mechanisms.</p><fig id="sa4fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Glutamate transporter removal inhibits ceftriaxone-mediated restoration of ivermectin sensitivity in <italic>ubr-1</italic>.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Compared to the <italic>ubr-1</italic> mutants, the <italic>ubr-1; glt-1</italic> and <italic>ubr-1; glt-5</italic> double mutants show enhanced ivermectin resistance under ceftriaxone treatment.

We first directly tested the Dyf phenotype of <italic>ubr-1</italic> using standard DIO dye staining (Author response image 2A) and found that <italic>ubr-1</italic> clearly show a &quot;dye filling defective&quot; phenotype (Author response image 2B). This raises an interesting question: Could the IVM resistance observed in <italic>ubr-1</italic> be due to its Dyf defect? To address this, we further performed experiment by using Ceftriaxone to test <italic>ubr-1</italic>’s Dyf phenotype. Ceftriaxone can fully rescue the sensitivity of <italic>ubr-1</italic> to IVM (Figure 2). If IVM resistance observed in <italic>ubr-1</italic> is due to its Dyf defect, we should observe same rescued Dyf defect. After treating <italic>ubr-1</italic> mutants with Ceftriaxone (50 μg/mL) until L4 stage, we again performed DIO dye staining and found that while Ceftriaxone fully rescued IVM resistance in <italic>ubr-1</italic>, it did not rescue the Dyf defect (Author response image 2C). These results suggest that while <italic>ubr-1</italic> has a Dyf defect, it is unlikely the primary cause of the IVM resistance in <italic>ubr-1</italic> mutant.</p><fig id="sa4fig2" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title><italic>ubr-1</italic> mutant is not <italic>dyf.</italic></title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Depiction of the DIO dye-staining assays.
