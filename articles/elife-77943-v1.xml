We found that several biomarkers for immunological outcomes are shared between individuals receiving BNT162b2 (Pfizer–BioNTech) vaccine and COVID-19 patients.

However, some patients with initially mild infections progress to more severe disease requiring hospitalization and/or prolonged symptoms leading to sustained disability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wu and McGoogan, 2020</xref>). Early identification of these patients would help guide treatment decisions, including the use of monoclonal antibodies and novel antivirals that can prevent disease progression. Moreover, mild infections are an important contributor to ongoing viral transmission, and there is substantial heterogeneity in the degree of the SARS-CoV-2-specific memory immune response following infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dan et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wheatley et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zuo et al., 2021</xref>). An improved understanding of host determinants of clinical, virological, and immunological outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infection can help spur the development of novel therapeutic and vaccination strategies.</p><p>The early host response to acute SARS-CoV-2 infection likely plays a critical role in determining disease outcome and generation of virus-specific memory immune responses. Nucleic acid pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) mediate the early detection and host response to viral infections, with RNA virus recognition thought to occur mainly in the endosomal and/or cytosolic compartment by two different PRRs: toll-like receptors (TLRs) and RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs). Viral recognition by TLRs and RLRs typically triggers a signaling cascade leading to induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines and type I and type III IFNs, which provide both a cell-intrinsic state of viral resistance and help coordinate the generation of adaptive immune responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Park and Iwasaki, 2020</xref>). Most studies evaluating the early host response have been cross-sectional and/or performed in patients already with severe disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arunachalam et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wilk et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abers et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Liu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lucas et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Schulte-Schrepping et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wilk et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Stephenson et al., 2021</xref>); longitudinal studies among those presenting earlier in disease, with prospective clinical outcomes, are lacking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Talla et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Following initial infection, SARS-CoV-2-specific memory immune responses result in protection from reinfection, likely mediated in part by SARS-CoV-2-specific memory T cell and both binding and neutralizing antibody responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Rodda et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Crawford et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chakraborty et al., 2022</xref>).

We leveraged longitudinal samples collected from outpatients enrolled in a randomized controlled trial of a type III IFN, Peginterferon lambda-1a (Lambda, NCT04331899) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jagannathan et al., 2021</xref>). In this trial, outpatients with initially mild to moderate COVID-19 were recruited within 72 hr of diagnosis and followed through 7 months post-infection. We observed sequential activation of immune modules in initially mild to moderate COVID-19 patients within the first 2 weeks of symptom onset, including IFN responses, T cell activation, and B cell responses. We identified variations in plasma proteins, early IFN signaling, and downstream cytokines (MCP1, MCP-2, and MCP-3) that were associated with multiple patient outcomes, including disease progression, viral load, memory T cell activity, and S protein-binding IgG levels measured up to 7 months after enrollment. We also compared the immune response in COVID-19 patients to the response following COVID-19 mRNA vaccination and identified biomarkers for immunological outcomes, including CXCL10, MCP-1, and IFN gamma, that are shared between individuals receiving BNT162b2 (Pfizer–BioNTech) vaccine and COVID-19 patients. Finally, we demonstrate that a machine-learning model using 2–7 plasma protein markers is able to accurately predict disease progression and the magnitude of the SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ T cell response and antibody response in a second, independent cohort.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Transcriptomic and proteomic profiles correlate with the time to symptom onset in COVID-19 patients</title><p>We recruited 108 participants with initially asymptomatic to moderate COVID-19 at diagnosis into this study.

Furthermore, Peginterferon lambda treatment did not significantly affect the change of these 20 proteins between day 0 and day 5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4</xref>). Interestingly, higher plasma levels of RIG-I (gene symbol DDX58) were significantly associated with all examined clinical, virological, and immunological outcomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>), including disease progression, lower oropharyngeal viral load, increased SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell responses, and increased levels of S protein-binding IgG to SARS-CoV-2. Since RIG-I is a cytosolic PRR that, upon recognition of short viral dsRNA during a viral infection, leads to upregulation of IFN signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Matsumiya and Stafforini, 2010</xref>), we explored associations between plasma RIG-I levels and related immune measurements, including the mRNA-level and protein-level expression of RIG-I and IFNs, as well as RIG-I and IFN-related modules. We found that the plasma RIG-I levels were only modestly correlated with mRNA-level expression of RIG-I (correlation = 0.23, p value=0.004, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>), as well as RIG-I signaling and IFN-related modules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). In contrast, we found a strong correlation between plasma levels of RIG-I and plasma levels of DNA Fragmentation Factor Subunit Alpha (DFFA), an intracellular protein known to be involved in apoptosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Thomas et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zhang and Xu, 2000</xref>). In addition, many of the other plasma proteins correlated with plasma RIG-I levels were intracellular proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>), suggesting that plasma RIG-I levels may be driven by both increased intracellular RIG-I expression, as well as a cell death process that releases intracellular protein into the plasma. Analysis of RNA-sequencing data also identified associations between RIG-I, IFN signaling, and cell death-related modules and clinical and immunological outcomes of patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>). As plasma levels of RIG-I were not significantly associated with time since symptom onset (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>), these data suggest that plasma RIG-I levels might serve as a powerful and stable biomarker for predicting several clinical, virological, and immunological outcomes in patients with COVID-19.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Similar trajectories of immune responses induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 mRNA vaccine</title><p>The BNT162b2 (Pfizer–BioNTech) vaccine has been widely used throughout the world and is highly effective in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection, as well as protecting patients from severe symptoms after infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Skowronski and De Serres, 2021</xref>). We leveraged a recently published dataset from a BNT162b2 vaccine study to compare the immune response induced by COVID-19 vaccine and SARS-CoV-2 infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arunachalam et al., 2021</xref>). Comparison of the datasets reveals that the immune response after the first dose of vaccination (day 0 to day 21) largely mirrors the trajectory of immune response after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Early proteins and BTMs in the SARS-CoV-2 infection dataset, including IFNγ, MCP1, CXCL11, MCP2, CXCL10, and IFN-related transcriptional modules, are upregulated within the first 7 days of the vaccination. Late immune markers in the SARS-CoV-2 infection dataset, including SLAMF1, TNFRSF9, CCL3, CCL4, TGFα, TNFSF14, and B cell-related transcriptional modules, are upregulated much later and show highest levels 21 days after the vaccination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and B</xref>). In contrast, the response after the second dose of vaccine (day 22 to day 28) is characterized by fast upregulation of both early and late immune measurements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A–B</xref>). Interestingly, three proteins that are significantly upregulated in SARS-CoV-2 patients were not induced after the second dose of vaccine, including TRAIL, CXCL1, and CXCL6.

Similar to participants in the Lambda trial, participants in the Favipiravir trial were recruited if they presented with initially mild to moderate COVID-19 at diagnosis, and the median duration of symptoms prior to randomization was 5 days, (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>). Among study participants, 7 of 54 (13%) later developed progressive and more severe symptoms and presented to the emergency department or were hospitalized (median 4 days to progression, range 2–10 days).

With transcriptomic and proteomic profiling, we reveal a sequential activation of IFN signaling, T cells, and B cells within 2 weeks of symptom onset. We also identified associations between early immune profiles and later clinical, virological, and immunological outcomes. In particular, plasma RIG-I levels, early IFN signaling, and related cytokines (CXCL10, MCP1, MCP-2, and MCP-3) were associated with multiple patient outcomes, including disease progression, viral shedding, and the SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell and antibody response measured up to 7 months after enrollment. We observed that the immune response after the first dose of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination largely recapitulates the trajectory of immune response after SARS-CoV-2 infection, and associations between early proteomic signatures and adaptive immune responses were similar following natural infection and vaccination. Finally, we demonstrate that machine-learning models using 7–10 plasma protein markers are able to accurately predict disease progression, SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell magnitude, and the SARS-CoV-2 antibody response in independent datasets.</p><p>We found that variations in the early immune response following natural infection shape the long-term outcome of COVID-19 outpatients. In particular, early transcriptomic signatures of type I IFN and RIG-I signaling, as well as elevated levels of downstream, IFN-induced chemokines (CXCL10 and CXCL11), were associated with an increased risk of subsequent disease progression. These results are consistent with some previously reported studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lucas et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yang et al., 2020</xref>), but not others, which found that severe disease is associated with a defective IFN response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arunachalam et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>). Some of these differences may be related to the timing of the assessment. Samples in our study were obtained in outpatients, prior to disease progression and hospitalization; in most other studies, patient samples were obtained at the time of hospitalization and/or when patients already had evidence of severe disease. This suggests a complex, non-monotonic relationship between the IFN response and disease severity.</p><p>Importantly, plasma levels of RIG-I, a protein not associated with time since symptom onset, were associated with all measured patient outcomes, including disease progression, oropharyngeal viral load, and SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell and antibody responses. RIG-I has been shown to be critically important in the response to several RNA viruses, including influenza virus, typically via interactions with the adapter protein mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS) and downstream type I and type III IFN upregulation. RIG-I was recently shown to play an important role in both sensing SARS-CoV-2 RNA and inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 replication in human lung cells but not via downstream MAVS induction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yamada et al., 2021</xref>). Rather, interactions between the RIG-I helicase domain and SARS-CoV-2 RNA induced an inhibitory effect on viral replication, independent of downstream IFN upregulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yamada et al., 2021</xref>). Our data showing an inverse association between plasma RIG-I levels and viral load are consistent with RIG-I having an important role in restricting early virus replication. As RIG-I is an intracellular RNA sensor, we sought to better understand why levels of RIG-I were elevated in the plasma by assessing associations with other transcriptomic modules and plasma proteins. Plasma RIG-I levels were modestly correlated with mRNA-level expression of RIG-I and RIG-I signaling modules and strongly correlated with plasma levels of several intracellular proteins, including DFFA, an intracellular protein known to be involved in cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zhang and Xu, 2000</xref>), suggesting that plasma RIG-I levels may reflect both increased gene expression and increased cellular apoptosis. This hypothesis is consistent with a recent report which observed significant associations between gene expression signatures of apoptosis in plasmacytoid dendritic cells with increased disease severity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Liu et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>We also observed that higher expression of three chemotactic receptor (CCR2) ligands MCP1, MCP2, and MPC3 were associated with disease progression. Higher plasma MCP3 levels have previously been shown to be elevated in SARS-CoV-2-infected patients with severe disease in comparison with those without (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yang et al., 2020</xref>), and transcriptome-wide association in lung tissue has found that higher expression of monocyte-macrophage CCR2, the receptor for MCP1 and MCP3, is associated with severe COVID-19 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Pairo-Castineira et al., 2021</xref>). However, we also observed that these CCR2 ligands are associated with positive virological and immunological outcomes, including reduced oropharyngeal viral load, and increased SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells and S protein-binding IgG levels. Consistent with a potential beneficial role, murine studies have found that CCR2 is essential for the survival of mice after pathogen challenge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Pamer, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lim et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kurihara et al., 1997</xref>). Taken together, these results demonstrated the complex role of CCR2 signaling in regulating immune responses. While essential for an effective immune response, overexpression may lead to severe symptoms and tissue damage. Therapeutic strategies to balance the positive and negative effects of CCR2 signaling may benefit the management of COVID-19 patients.</p><p>Our study design allowed us to compare immune responses following Peginterferon lambda treatment. Although there is literature that suggests IFN lambda-1a (IL-29) may impact immune function in vitro and in animal models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Syedbasha and Egli, 2017</xref>), the impact of therapeutic administration on immune function in humans remains unclear. In this study, we found that administration of Peginterferon lambda had no significant effect on the immunological profiles of participants. Specifically, we observed no significant impact of Peginterferon lambda on whole blood transcriptomic profiles 5 days post-administration or in SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell and antibody responses 28 days post-administration. Although we identified two plasma proteins elevated in Peginterferon lambda-treated individuals, these proteins were not associated with downstream patient outcomes. There are several possible reasons for these findings. First, the dosing used in this trial may not have achieved therapeutic levels in the upper respiratory epithelia, where its impact on immune cells might be expected to occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jagannathan et al., 2021</xref>). Second, the median symptom duration was 5 days at the time of randomization, and 40% of participants were already SARS-CoV-2 IgG positive at enrollment. It is possible that earlier administration, or prophylactic administration prior to established infection, may have had a different impact on immune outcomes. Arguing against this, in sensitivity analyses, we observed no difference in the treatment effect on immune profiles among individuals who were SARS-CoV-2 seronegative at enrollment.</p><p>Although naturally acquired SARS-CoV-2 infection results in protective antibody and T cell immune responses, reinfections can occur, and the precise determinants driving susceptibility to reinfection remain unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">To et al., 2021</xref>). The BNT162b2 (Pfizer–BioNTech) vaccine has been shown to be highly effective in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Skowronski and De Serres, 2021</xref>), although breakthrough cases have been increasingly reported since its approval (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">CDC COVID-19 Vaccine Breakthrough Case Investigations Team, 2021</xref>). Comparing the vaccine response with the immune response of natural infection may shed light on determinants of protective immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and potential ways to improve COVID-19 vaccines. Our analysis reveals that the proteomic response of the BNT162b2 vaccine mirrors in many ways the proteomic response after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Furthermore, several associations between early protein markers and protective immunity (T cell and antibody responses) were shared between COVID-19 patients and individuals who received the BNT162b2 vaccine. These results suggest that plasma biomarkers might be useful to identify individuals at risk of SARS-CoV2 reinfection as well as breakthrough infection after vaccination.</p><p>Our study has some limitations. First, while we identified multiple associations between early immune measures and the outcome of COVID-19 patients, we did not establish causal relationships between them. Future studies are needed to perturb key immune modules in the early immune response and test their effect on the patient outcomes. Second, our study measured the immune response during the first 2 weeks after symptom onset in COVID-19 patients. Earlier immune responses between the initial infection and symptom onset have not been characterized. This is due to the difficulty to detect pre-symptomatic COVID-19 infection. Routine SARS-COV-2 monitoring in a select cohort will be required to acquire samples prior to and immediately after the infection in order to assess whether pre-infection signatures predict outcomes in COVID-19 patients. In addition, our trajectory analysis is based on the population-level data with only two time points sampled per patient. Further studies with more frequent sampling will be needed to confirm the immune trajectory at the individual level. Individuals in the lambda and favipiravir study were enrolled prior to the emergence and dominance of SARS-CoV-2 B.1.617 (Delta) and B.1.1.529 (Omicron) variants in the United States. Further validation studies are needed to test if the findings may be able to be generalized to infection with other variants. Finally, we used median values as cutoffs to identify individuals with high or low T cell and antibody responses when training the machine-learning model. However, the use of median cutoff is not ideal, as it does not reflect the minimal threshold of protective immunity. Further studies are needed to identify clinically relevant thresholds and to test the machine-learning models for predicting protection against reinfection.</p><p>Identification of patients at high risk of disease progression remains a critical need in management of patients with COVID-19. Several novel therapeutics have recently been issued emergency use authorization by the Federal Drug Administration, including monoclonal antibodies (e.g. casirivimab and imdevimab, sotrovimab), nucleoside inhibitors (molnupiravir), and protease inhibitors (nirmaltrevir/ritonavir). These therapeutics have been shown to be effective in reducing the risk of hospitalization or death among patients with high risk of disease progression in outpatient studies, but their supplies remain limited. Our data suggest that measurement of plasma proteins at the time of diagnosis could be a powerful adjunct to identify those patients who would most benefit from therapeutic interventions aimed at preventing progressive disease and hospitalization. Furthermore, our models can potentially be used to predict the degree of immune memory variation following natural infection and vaccination.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Peginterferon lambda study design</title><p>Data and samples were obtained from a phase 2, single-blind, randomized placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of lambda in reducing the duration of viral shedding in outpatients.

The PEA is a dual-recognition immunoassay, where two-matched antibodies labeled with unique DNA oligonucleotides simultaneously bind to a target protein in solution. This brings the two antibodies into proximity, allowing their DNA oligonucleotides to hybridize, serving as a template for a DNA polymerase-dependent extension step. This creates a dsDNA ‘barcode’ unique for the specific antigen and quantitatively proportional to the initial concentration of target protein. The hybridization and extension are immediately followed by PCR amplification, and the amplicon is then finally quantified by microfluidic qPCR.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>T cell assays</title><p>SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell peptide pools were purchased from Miltenyi Biotec (PepTivator SARS-CoV-2 Prot_S, Prot_S1, Prot N, and Prot M) and resuspended in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). These PepTivator reagents are pools of lyophilized peptides of 15 amino acid length with 11 amino acid overlap, covering immunodominant sequence domains of the S (S and S1) (aa sequence 1–1273), nucleocapsid (N), or membrane (M) proteins of SARS-CoV-2.</p><p>Antigen-specific T cell responses were measured using an intracellular cytokine staining assay. Briefly, cryopreserved PBMCs were thawed, counted, and resuspended in complete RPMI (RPMI [Corning] supplemented with 10% Fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Gibco), 100 IU penicillin [Corning], 100 µg/ml streptomycin [Corning], 1 mM Hepes [Corning], and 2 mM L-glutamine [Corning]). The cells were plated in 96-well U bottom plates at 1x10e6 PBMCs per well and then rested overnight at 37°C in a CO2 incubator. The following morning, cells were cultured in presence of either SARS-CoV-2 peptides (1 μg/ml), Phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) (300 ng/ml), and Ionomycin (1.5 μg/ml) as positive control or media as a negative control for 6 hr at 37°C. All conditions were in the presence of brefeldin A (BD Pharmingen), monensin (BD Pharmingen), and CD107a. After a 6 hr incubation, cells were washed and surface stained for CCR7 for 15 min at 37°C, followed by the remaining surface stain for 30 min at room temperature (RT) in the dark. Thereafter, cells were washed twice with PBS containing 0.5% BSA and 2 mM EDTA, then fixed/permeabilized (FIX &amp; PERM Cell Permeabilization Kit, Invitrogen) and stained with intracellular antibodies for 20 min at RT in the dark. A complete list of antibodies is listed in supplementary methods. All samples were analyzed on an Attune NXT flow cytometer and analyzed with FlowJo X (Tree Star) software.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Antibody assays</title><p>IgG antibody titers against the SARS-CoV-2 full-length S protein were assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chakraborty et al., 2022</xref>). Briefly, 96-well half-area microplates (Corning [Millipore Sigma]) plates were coated with antigens at 2 μg/ml in PBS for 1 hr at RT. Next, the plates were blocked for an hour with 3% non-fat milk in PBS with 0.1% Tween 20 (PBST). Plasma was diluted fivefold starting at 1:50 in 1% non-fat milk in PBST. 25 μl of the diluted plasma was added to each well and incubated for 2 hr at RT. Following primary incubation, 25 μl of 1:5000 diluted horse radish peroxidase conjugated anti-human IgG secondary antibodies (Southern Biotech) were added and incubated for 1 hr at RT. The plates were developed by adding 25 μl/well of the chromogenic substrate 3,3’,5,5’-tetramethylbenzidine solution (Millipore Sigma). The reaction was stopped with 0.2 N sulphuric acid (Sigma), and absorbance was measured at 450 nm (iD5 SPECTRAmax, Molecular Devices). The plates were washed five times with PBST between each step, and an additional wash with PBS was done before developing the plates. All data were normalized between the same positive and negative controls, and the binding AUC were calculated using GraphPad PRISM (Version 9).</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Analysis of Olink data from the vaccine study</title><p>The Olink data from the mRNA vaccine study was previously obtained and published (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Goyal et al., 2020</xref>). We tested if the level of the proteins are significantly altered after vaccination using ANOVA (expression ~time), where time is treated as a categorical variable to account for non-linear behavior of the proteins. p Values from the ANOVA models are adjusted using the FDR method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995</xref>). To visualize the trajectory of the proteins, we imputed the protein level in each day using linear interpolation with the ‘approx’ function in R.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Favipiravir validation study</title><p>As a validation study, we utilized samples collected from participants enrolled in a similarly designed, phase 2, double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial of favipiravir in mildly symptomatic or asymptomatic adults with a positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR assays within 72 hr of enrollment. The trial was conducted within the Stanford Health Care System, and participants were enrolled between July 8, 2020 and March 23, 2021. Informed consent was obtained from all participants prior to enrollment in the study per IRB guidelines. Clinical outcomes assessed include incident emergency room (ER) visits and hospitalizations (prespecific secondary outcomes in primary study). Only samples from placebo participants were included in this analysis. Peripheral blood was collected at enrollment and day 28 post-randomization and processed for plasma and peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Day 0 plasma proteomics by Olink and day 28 T cell assays were performed as described above. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 serology was performed using a virus plaque reduction neutralization assay (Viroclinics Biosciences, Rotterdam, The Netherlands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Holubar et al., 2022</xref>]). The study was performed as an investigator-initiated clinical trial (NCT 04346628) and approved by the Institutional Review Board of Stanford University including approval for collection of biospecimens as per the study protocol (IRB 56032). Analysis of deidentified patient samples was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Stanford University (IRB 57230) and UCSF (Stanford IRB reliance).</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>In the parent clinical trial from which samples were obtained, sample size was estimated based on the primary outcome measured in that study – oropharyngeal viral load shedding cessation. Assuming 1:1 randomization and the use of a two-sided log rank test at the alpha = 0.04999 level of significance for the final analysis, we anticipated the occurrence of 79 shedding cessation events, which provided 80% power to detect a hazard ratio of 2.03. We additionally assumed median time to shedding cessation of 14 days in the control arm and 7 days in the treatment arm, a 2-month accrual period, a 2-week follow-up period after randomization of the last patient, and 10% drop out in the control arm. This enabled an interim analysis conducted at alpha = 0·00001 to assess overwhelming efficacy after 50% of participants completed 24 hr of follow-up. We estimated that the total sample size required to achieve 79 events was 120 (60 participants per arm). For this secondary analysis of transcriptomic and proteomic data, all subjects with available data for analysis were included.</p><p>PCA was conducted by applying the prcomp function in base R to the whole Olink dataset or the top 500 genes with the highest variance. To access the association between the PCs and clinical data, we fitted regression models (PC ~clinical variable). The percent of variances explained by the clinical variable is used to measure the association.</p><p>We accessed the association between the expression of immune modules or protein markers with time using the regression model (expression ~treatment + time + time<sup>2</sup>). Because the treatment only affects samples collected at day 5 but not day 0, we assigned the treatment variable as 1 to day 5 sample from the treatment arm and as 0 to other samples in the regression analysis. Goodness of fit analysis using Bayesian information criterion (BIC) shows that polynomial terms with orders higher than two do not improve the model. It should be noted that our study contains repeated measures of the same individuals in two time points (0 and 5 days after enrollment). While including subjects as random effects in the regression model allows the model to adjust for individual differences, it resulted in near-singular fits of the data for many of the immune measurements. To avoid model over-fitting, we decided to only include the fixed effects (time) in our model. To find significant associations, we compared the model with the base model (expression ~1) and used the F test to calculate the p value. We adjusted the p value using the FDR method. We performed a parallel analysis using mixed-effect models (expression ~treatment time + time<sup>2</sup>+subject ID [random effect]) to fit the data and found that all significant (FDR &lt;0.05) variables identified using the fixed effect model were also significant in the mixed-effect model (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>).</p><p>We estimated the enrichment score of the major immune cell types using the xCell package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aran et al., 2017</xref>). The association between the xCell scores and time was tested using the same regression method described above.</p><p>We tested the association between immune measurements and disease progression using regression models (measurements ~symptom severity +treatment + time + time<sup>2</sup>) and the lm function in R. Because the treatment only affects samples collected at day 5 but not day 0, we assigned the treatment variable as ‘1’ in day 5 samples from the treatment arm and as ‘0’ in other samples in the regression analysis. The p value of the symptom severity term is adjusted using the FDR method. Similar regression models were used to test the association between immune measurements and other outcomes, including the oropharyngeal viral load, the memory CD4+ T cell activity and S protein-binding IgG levels. To test between immune measurements and symptom severity without adjusting the time to symptom onset, we performed a one-way anova analysis using the lm function in R (measurements ~symptom severity).</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Predictive modeling</title><p>We used the protein measurements (measured by Olink assays) to predict the clinical, virological, and memory T cell activity and IgG antibodies. Since the outcomes are a mixture of categorical (symptom severity) and continuous (viral load, T cell, and antibody responses) variables, we framed all prediction tasks as classification problems by dichotomizing the continuous variables using median as cutoffs. To ensure Olink data were measured before clinical progression, we excluded Olink data that were collected at day 5. To prevent overfitting, we selected 30 proteins with the highest variance as input data, as the highly variable proteins best capture the inter-subject difference across the COVID-19 patients. We further select features using random forest and leave-one-out validation. In step 1, we train a random forest model using data from all samples but one left out sample. In step 2, we rank the feature importance of the 30 protein markers based on the gini index reported by the random forest model. In step 3, we train reduced random forest models with 1–29 most important proteins. In step 4, we predict the outcomes using the data from the left-out sample. We repeat steps 1–4 until we predict the outcome of all samples. We calculate the model performance using the AUROC curve (AUC). The variable combinations that give rise to the highest AUC are selected as the optimal model. The optimal model for predicting symptom severity was tested using Olink data from two independent studies.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Data availability</title><p>The RNA-sequencing data is available in GEO under the accession number GSE178967.

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Miles Davenport as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>One concern is that the two groups in a clinical trial with an immunomodulatory drug were combined in this analysis. The authors take for granted that the administration of Peg-IFN λ does not modify the course of the disease and therefore that treated and untreated individuals can be analyzed together. This is at odds with other randomized studies, that have shown antiviral and clinical effect of IFN-based therapy. In particular, Peg-λ accelerated viral decline in outpatients and prevented clinical deterioration in a study performed in a similar setting using the same dose than here (Feld et al., Lancet Resp Med 2021). Other positive results in early patients were found with IFN-β (Monk et al., Lancet Resp Med 2020). Even if the administration of IFN in this study had no clinical or virological benefits, it could nonetheless alter the kinetics of ISG. The authors claim it is not the case, but it is difficult to assess it based on the figures shown, using PCA.</p><p>Although PegIFN was not associated with significant changes in clinical outcomes, the lack of overall clinical responses was likely due to a mix of responders and non-responders. Were there variables at baseline identified by computational analysis which could predict responses to IFN? Given these difficulties, we would encourage the authors to do a separate analysis, which is a revision.</p><p>If the authors decide to continue with this revision we would also encourage them to address the following comments:</p><p>1. Add essential information on the clinical trial should be included in the manuscript to suggest whether research findings mostly apply to the β, δ or omicron era. All in all, since this study focuses on the host, findings should be generalizable irrespective of the pathogen.</p><p>2. It is questionable whether a strong claim can be made on disease progression, since only 8 patients were hospitalized in this study. In addition, it should be clarified when these patients progressed. Page 10, it is said that the median time to progression is 2 days, so in fact, the data collected at day 0 and 5 are very close, or even perhaps posterior to hospitalization in some cases, making it difficult to claim that it can be used for prediction. More generally data used are up to 14 days post symptom onset, while the median time to hospitalization in these populations is roughly ~8 days. This makes it here as well difficult to really argue that the model has a &quot;predictive&quot; value to anticipate disease progression.</p><p>3. If data used in the study are close to hospitalization, then this really diminishes the novelty of the findings, as many studies have already reported an association between these markers and disease severity (see also Young et al., Viral Dynamics and Immune Correlates of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Severity, CID 2021).</p><p>4. The definition of disease progression seems to differ from the original study &quot;Overall, 17 participants had evidence of disease progression, defined as hospitalization, presentation to the emergency department, or worsening cough or shortness of breath defined as an increase in severity of two points or more on a five-point scale&quot;? Please clarify what is your endpoint and why, if relevant, it differs from the original study.</p><p>5. Can you clarify how viral shedding was analyzed? The fact that viral load is analyzed with a different metrics than other proteins when looking at predictors of disease progression is puzzling. Figure S5 does not seem to be convincing, which relies on AUC of viral load calculated in patients with high heterogeneity in their symptom onset. Please use the same approach for viral load than what was used for IP-10 in order to demonstrate that IP-10 is a better predictor of disease progression than viral load.</p><p>6. Regarding prediction, it is really unclear how the model using demographics was built. It is obvious than many other factors than age and sex are highly predictive of disease progression.</p><p>7. If you want these results to be useful for the clinical community then the model used in figure 7 should be explicitly given so that anyone can use these results to build score on its own population.</p><p>8. Improve discussion on IFN-λ and propose better graphs to justify the absence of effect of treatment. It would be more helpful to provide simple graphs, such as boxplots of the changes in the 7-10 relevant markers between day 0 and day 5 in treated and untreated individuals (along with p-values), so that the lack of difference can be easily visualized.</p><p>9. To build a better model of demographics, consider exploring more covariates. For instance, evaluate models including covariates that are significant in univariate analysis and that have a &gt;10% prevalence (hypertension, diabetes, age&gt;55…).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.77943.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>One concern is that the two groups in a clinical trial with an immunomodulatory drug were combined in this analysis.

We have addressed this concern in several additional ways in the revised manuscript.</p><p>First, in our revised manuscript, we fitted the trajectory of the immune measures using data from each individual arm and from both arms together (Figure 3A). We found that immune trajectories were similar between the two individual arms, suggesting that Peginterferon Λ treatment did not significantly affect early immune trajectories after COVID-19 infection.</p><p>Second, we reorganized out manuscript to highlight detailed analyses that we previously performed to compare responses between groups. We tested the effect of Peginterferon Λ on individual immune measures measured at day 5 post-treatment. Blood transcriptomic profiles were similar between the two groups, and only two proteins were significantly different between the Peginterferon Λ and placebo treatment arm (LAMP3 and HSD11B1, previously in supplemental, now moved to Figure 2I). However, neither LAMP3 nor HSD11B1 were associated with patient outcomes (hospitalization, viral load, T cell response, and antibody levels) in our later analysis using combined data or control-only data (Supplementary File 3).</p><p>Third, we have now included ‘treatment’ as a variable in our multi-variable regression analysis to reflect the two-arm design of the study and to control for potential differences between the two arms. See the method section for more details. Adding the treatment variable resulted in small changes to our results, but the most significant proteins associated with clinical outcomes remained the same. We have updated the results in the manuscript (Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5, Supplementary file 2 and Supplementary file 3).</p><p>Finally, we have included a new supplemental figure (Figure 5 —figure supplement 4) to compare the change of 20 most relevant (the same set of proteins as shown in Figure 5B) markers between day 0 and day 5 in placebo and Peginterferon Λ-treated individuals. This analysis revealed no significant change in these 20 plasma markers between day 0 and day 5 after multiple comparison correction.</p><p>Importantly, we previously characterized the association between immune measures and clinical outcomes (disease progression, viral load, T cell response, and antibody levels) using data from participants in the placebo arm only. We found that the results were consistent when compared with the analysis that included all participants (Figure 5 —figure supplement 3). We also validated associations and predictive models between early plasma proteins and patient outcomes using samples collected from placebo arm participants enrolled in a separate clinical trial of Favipiravir. We show that results from the Peginterferon Λ trial were consistent with the result from the Favipiravir trial (Figure 7 —figure supplement 1) and that early plasma proteins were highly predictive in this second dataset, which only includes placebo-treated individuals.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>If the authors decide to continue with this revision we would also encourage them to address the following comments:</p><p>1.

Indeed, it is critical to examine if our model can predict disease progression before it occurs. In the revised manuscript, we updated our machine learning analysis to only use data from day 0 of the Peginterferon Λ trial. At day 0, all patients recruited had mild to moderate symptoms, and none of the patients displayed severe symptoms. We show that our machine learning model was able to accurately predict disease progression before it occurs (Figure 7).</p><p>The model was also able to predict disease progression of COVID-19 patients in a validation dataset (Favipiravir trial), where samples were similarly collected at Day 0. The median time to progression is 4 days (with a range of 2 to 10 days) in the Favipiravir trial, demonstrating that the model is able to predict disease progression beyond 2 days. We have included the time to progression information of the Favipiravir trial in our revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The definition of disease progression seems to differ from the original study &quot;Overall, 17 participants had evidence of disease progression, defined as hospitalization, presentation to the emergency department, or worsening cough or shortness of breath defined as an increase in severity of two points or more on a five-point scale&quot;? Please clarify what is your endpoint and why, if relevant, it differs from the original study.</p></disp-quote><p>In the original study, the incidence of hospitalizations and ER visits was a prespecified secondary analysis (see Statistical analysis plan published at: https://exhibits.stanford.edu/data/catalog/hc972ys6733). The outcome of disease progression noted by the reviewer that included worsening cough or shortness of breath was an exploratory analysis (also pre-specified in the statistical analysis plan). We chose the more standard outcome definition of disease progression to include incident hospitalization and ER visits in this analysis, and, importantly, this was also the same secondary clinical outcome as used in the Favipiravir study (the alternative outcome was not used in the Favipiravir study). This has been clarified in the methods, and additional details regarding the Favipiravir validation study have now been provided in the methods.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5.

We identified the cycle threshold (Ct) value using the fluorescence vs cycle data reported from RT-PCR scanner. We subtract the Ct value from the detect limit (Ct=41) to quantify the viral shedding in each OP swab. We plotted the viral shedding in each visit versus time and calculated the area under the curve using numerical integration based on the trapezoid rule.</p><p>To illustrate the necessity of using AUC rather than individual readouts of the Ct value for quantifying viral shedding, we have plotted the Ct trajectories in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>. Because of the sparse nature of the measurement, the Ct value from any single sample are not reliable to quantify the viral shedding of the patients. We decided to use the area under the curve because it captures both the intensity and the length of the viral shedding, both of which contribute to the spread of the COVID-19. In addition, we have included the symptom onset time as a variable in our regression analysis, which allows us to control for the heterogeneity in symptom onset of patients.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-77943-sa2-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6.
