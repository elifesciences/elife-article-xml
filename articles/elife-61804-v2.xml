Research from a variety of model organisms indicates that Hedgehog (Hh) signaling may be a useful target to drive regeneration. However, the mechanisms of Hh signaling-mediated tissue regeneration remain unclear. Here, we examined Hh signaling during post-amputation tail regeneration in <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> larvae. We found that while Smoothened (Smo) activity is essential for proper spinal cord and skeletal muscle regeneration, transcriptional activity of the canonical Hh effector Gli is repressed immediately following amputation, and inhibition of Gli1/2 expression or transcriptional activity has minimal effects on regeneration. In contrast, we demonstrate that protein kinase A is necessary for regeneration of both muscle and spinal cord, in concert with and independent of Smo, respectively, and that its downstream effector CREB is activated in spinal cord following amputation in a Smo-dependent manner. Our findings indicate that non-canonical mechanisms of Hh signaling are necessary for spinal cord and muscle regeneration.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>spinal cord injury</kwd><kwd>skeletal muscle regeneration</kwd><kwd>PKA</kwd><kwd>non-canonical hedgehog signaling</kwd><kwd>CREB</kwd><kwd>Gli transcriptional activity</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>Xenopus</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1120796</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Borodinsky</surname><given-names>Laura N</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01NS073055</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Borodinsky</surname><given-names>Laura N</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100011781</institution-id><institution>Shriners Hospitals for Children</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>86700-NCA</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Borodinsky</surname><given-names>Laura N</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100011781</institution-id><institution>Shriners Hospitals for Children</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>84303-NCA</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hamilton</surname><given-names>Andrew M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1754340</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Borodinsky</surname><given-names>Laura N</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01NS105886</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Borodinsky</surname><given-names>Laura N</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01NS113859</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Borodinsky</surname><given-names>Laura N</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Unlike in early embryonic development, injured spinal cord and muscle in <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> larvae recruit non-canonical Hedgehog signaling essential for their regeneration, while repressing Gli transcriptional activity.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Injury in low regenerative capacity tissues such as spinal cord represents a persistent challenge in modern medicine, with millions of cases of spinal cord-related disability worldwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lee et al., 2014</xref>).

Although diverse cellular processes are involved in neural regeneration, one pathway that has consistently proven to be pro-regenerative is Hedgehog (Hh) signaling. Treatment with Sonic hedgehog (Shh) or with agonists of its main effector, Smoothened (Smo), enhances neurological recovery to nerve damage in rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bambakidis et al., 2012</xref>) possibly by enhancing neural cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bambakidis et al., 2009</xref>), while loss of Shh in zebrafish impairs retinal regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sherpa et al., 2014</xref>). Hh signaling is also essential for injury response in a wide variety of tissues, including cardiac muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kawagishi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Singh et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sugimoto et al., 2017</xref>), liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Grzelak et al., 2014</xref>), limb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Singh et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yakushiji et al., 2009</xref>), and tail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Romero et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Singh et al., 2018b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Taniguchi et al., 2014</xref>), making this pathway an attractive therapeutic target.</p><p>The Hh pathway is classically known as a primary regulator of organogenesis and tissue homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Briscoe and Thérond, 2013</xref>). Hh binding represses its receptor Patched (Ptch), thereby de-repressing the G-protein coupled receptor Smo. Canonically, Smo activates the transcription factor Gli2, which drives transcription of both Ptch and the positive feedback regulator Gli1, as well as a wide variety of genes controlling cell migration, differentiation, and especially proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Briscoe and Thérond, 2013</xref>). In addition to the canonical, Gli-dependent cascade, a number of non-canonical, Gli-independent pathways exist, operating via Src family kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sloan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yam et al., 2009</xref>), the small GTPases Rac1 and RhoA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ho Wei et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Polizio et al., 2011</xref>), NF-ĸB activation via PKC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Qu et al., 2013</xref>), and the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-Ampk axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Teperino et al., 2012</xref>), as well as other non-canonical signaling cascades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Belgacem et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Teperino et al., 2014</xref>). Our own work has shown that Shh drives spontaneous Ca<sup>2+</sup> spike activity in immature neurons, regulating neuronal differentiation during spinal cord development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Belgacem and Borodinsky, 2011</xref>). Moreover, neural tube formation in mouse and frog is associated with a deactivation of canonical Shh signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Balaskas et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Belgacem and Borodinsky, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lee et al., 1997</xref>), and a concomitant switch to a non-canonical, PKA and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent pathway, which itself contributes to the repression of the canonical, Gli-dependent cascade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Belgacem and Borodinsky, 2015</xref>).</p><p>To better understand its role in tissue repair, we examined the Hh signaling pathway during tail regeneration in <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> larvae. We found that Hh signaling is necessary for the regeneration of the spinal cord and skeletal muscle, primarily through Gli-independent pathways, and our results implicate PKA/CREB as an interacting signaling cascade. These findings offer the possibility of enhancing regeneration by differentially targeting canonical and non-canonical Hh pathways.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Hedgehog signaling regulates regeneration of muscle and spinal cord</title><p><italic>Xenopus</italic> larvae exhibit remarkable regenerative capacity to replenish all the tissues of the tail when amputated. This ability to regenerate the tail’s spinal cord, muscle, notochord, and skin is present throughout larval stages (stages 39– 46) and before metamorphosis (stages 49–54), with a refractory period during stages 47–48, during which regeneration is blocked (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aztekin et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aztekin et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Beck, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ferreira et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kakebeen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Love et al., 2013</xref>). Both regenerative periods are considered as such, rather than merely developmental growth phases, because during both periods tail amputation leaves a stump containing tissues that have already matured in the larva, unlike the growing tip of the tail that is removed by amputation. Hence, rather than a recapitulation of tail growth, this represents a true regenerative process that requires reactivating mature tissues to replace the missing tail structures.</p><p>Our previous studies have shown that electrical activity is important for spinal cord and muscle regeneration in tail-amputated stage 39–41 <italic>X. laevis</italic> larvae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tu and Borodinsky, 2014</xref>). In addition, Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent activity is necessary for neuronal and muscle cell differentiation during embryonic skeletal muscle and spinal cord development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Borodinsky et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ferrari et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ferrari and Spitzer, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gu and Spitzer, 1995</xref>). This activity interacts with non-canonical, Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent Shh signaling during spinal cord neuron differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Belgacem and Borodinsky, 2011</xref>), positioning non-canonical Hh signaling as an excellent candidate for regulating regeneration in muscle and neural tissues. Furthermore, Hh isoforms are expressed during these larval stages in several tissues, including somites, floor plate, and notochord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ekker et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Howell et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Koide et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Yin et al., 2010</xref>) and transcripts for Hh ligands are detected through single-cell RNA seq in notochord, floor plate, and various subsets of spinal cord cells in stumps and regenerating tails of stage 40 larvae from 0 through 3 days post amputation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aztekin et al., 2019</xref>). We also find Hh protein during these stages in the axial musculature and spinal cord, and the protein level increases after 24 h post amputation (hpa) in the regenerating tail (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Inhibition of Smo for 72 hpa with cyclopamine reduces muscle outgrowth into the regenerating tail (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) and total regenerated muscle volume (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Cyclopamine also impairs spinal cord outgrowth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>) and reduces the total number of NSCs in the newly regenerated spinal cord (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>), resulting in spinal cord with a lower NSC density than in control larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>), which suggests that inhibiting Smo interferes with activation/proliferation of NSCs. Furthermore, treatment of amputated larvae with vismodegib, a structurally distinct Smo antagonist that binds to a different domain than cyclopamine, results in very similar reductions in regeneration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>In contrast, enhancing Smo activity with SAG has no effect on total muscle regeneration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), and even shows a modest inhibitory effect on muscle outgrowth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). In addition, SAG treatment universally results in abnormal muscle regeneration consisting in muscle cells that do not follow a longitudinal alignment parallel to the anteroposterior axis and ectopic outgrowth of new muscle fibers dorsally and ventrally from intact axial musculature in the tail stump and regenerated tail, in contrast to all other groups where this phenotype was not observed (26 out of 26 SAG-treated samples; 0 out of 41 controls; 0 out of 31 cyclopamine-treated samples; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), indicating dysregulated muscle morphogenesis. SAG also reduces the outgrowth of the spinal cord (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>) without altering the total number of new NSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>), resulting in a truncated, wide spinal cord with higher NSC density than in control larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C, H</xref>). Similarly, overall mitotic activity at 72 hpa is not affected by SAG but is reduced by cyclopamine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>). These results argue that Smo activity is essential for NSC proliferation, and that ectopically elevated Smo signaling interferes with the normal progression from NSC proliferation to spinal cord outgrowth. Altogether these results suggest that Smo-mediated signaling is necessary for muscle and spinal cord regeneration.</p><p>In addition, we examined the interval during which Hh signaling is necessary for regeneration by comparing 72 h exposure with treatment for only the first 24 h of 72 h total (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; 24 h vs. 72 h). We found that the effects of 24 h exposure to SAG were comparable to the full 72 h treatment for all metrics of both muscle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D, E</xref>) and spinal cord (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F–H</xref>) regeneration, as well as overall cell proliferation in the regenerate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>), and gave the same abnormal muscle regeneration phenotype with ectopic dorsoventral muscle outgrowth and shortened spinal cord in all samples, in contrast to all other groups where this phenotype was not observed (27 of 27 SAG-treated samples; 0 out of 41 controls; 0 out of 35 cyclopamine-treated samples; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Cyclopamine treatment for only 24 hr, however, showed weaker effects than the full 72 hr; the number and density of NSCs in the newly formed spinal cord, as well as the number of mitotic cells in the regenerate, are unchanged by 24 h cyclopamine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G–I</xref>), while reductions in muscle outgrowth and volume are smaller than with 72 h cyclopamine incubation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D, E</xref>).

Under control conditions, we observe a close correlation between muscle and spinal cord outgrowth when examined on a per-sample basis. This correlation is decoupled by enhancing Smo signaling, which allows muscle outgrowth in the absence of normal spinal cord outgrowth, and by inhibiting it, which blocks muscle regeneration almost entirely, despite substantial spinal cord outgrowth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). In contrast, PKA inhibition reduces all regeneration metrics without altering the interrelationship between the extent of regeneration of both tissues. Inhibiting Gli1/2 also has no discernible effect on correlated outgrowth between the two tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>).

These findings are in keeping with previous discoveries showing Hh signaling involvement in the regeneration of a variety of tissues including liver, heart, and limb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Grzelak et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Singh et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Singh et al., 2018b</xref>), in addition to <italic>Xenopus</italic> larval tail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Taniguchi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Taniguchi et al., 2014</xref>), as well as the fact that Hh pathway activation is enhanced at the site of tail amputation in <italic>X. laevis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Taniguchi et al., 2014</xref>) and zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Romero et al., 2018</xref>). Recent studies have also shown that Smo and Ptch1 experience a transient increase in transcriptional availability immediately after tail amputation in <italic>Xenopus tropicalis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kakebeen et al., 2020</xref>), and shh transcript level increases in 1 dpa <italic>X. laevis</italic> larvae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aztekin et al., 2019</xref>), further emphasizing the importance of this pathway during regeneration.</p><p>The regenerated spinal cord under Smo inhibition exhibits around half of the number of NSCs at 72 hpa compared to control animals. This suggests that with regards to spinal cord regeneration Hh-Smo signaling is particularly important for NSC proliferation. Moreover, pharmacological enhancement of Smo signaling leads to simultaneous NSC proliferation and blockade of spinal cord morphogenesis, further supporting the model of Smo signaling acting predominantly on NSC activation and proliferation upon injury (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>).</p><p>Smo signaling is also essential for muscle regeneration, and arguably for the initial stages of muscle stem cell activation and proliferation since inhibiting Smo signaling during the first 24 hpa is enough to strongly decrease the replenishing of skeletal muscle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). Moreover, it appears that the first 24 h post injury are a critical period for Smo-dependent muscle stem cell activation, unlike NSCs, which seem to be able to be activated and proliferate even after an initial 24 h of Smo inhibition. It remains to be determined whether Smo-dependent muscle regeneration is acting directly on muscle stem cells or indirectly through signals from the spinal cord. Nevertheless, the evidence that in the presence of overactive Smo both the spinal cord and muscle exhibit aberrant outgrowth, along with published work from others demonstrating the necessity of the spinal cord for proper tail regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Taniguchi et al., 2008</xref>), supports a potential interaction between Smo-mediated spinal cord and muscle regeneration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>).</p><p>Additionally, we demonstrate that canonical, Gli-dependent Hh signaling is endogenously downregulated after tail amputation, and further inhibiting this pathway either pharmacologically or genetically only marginally affects muscle and spinal cord regeneration, suggesting that Hh-Smo is acting primarily through a Gli-independent pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). In contrast, CREB activity is recruited immediately after injury, at the amputation site and within the regenerating spinal cord, and fades within the first 24 h of spinal cord regeneration. Moreover, PKA activity, unlike Gli, is necessary for efficient regeneration of both muscle and spinal cord, and CREB is activated upon injury in amputation-proximal and regenerating neural tissue in a Smo-dependent manner. This distinct recruitment of a non-canonical Hh signaling pathway resembles the switch in Hh signaling observed during embryonic stages of early spinal cord development, when canonical, Gli-activating Shh signaling is restricted to the early neural plate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Balaskas et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Belgacem and Borodinsky, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lee et al., 1997</xref>), but is later repressed through a Shh-Ca<sup>2+</sup>-PKA-CREB signaling axis that mediates Shh-dependent spinal cord neuron differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Belgacem and Borodinsky, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Belgacem and Borodinsky, 2015</xref>).</p><p>PKA recruitment is not the only potential mediator of Hh non-canonical, Smo-dependent regeneration. The effects of inhibiting PKA on muscle regeneration are lower in magnitude compared with Smo inhibition, with the latter resulting in almost complete blockade of muscle replenishment in the regenerated tail. This may be the reason for apparent epistasis when simultaneously inhibiting Smo and PKA pathways in regulating muscle regeneration. Alternatively, PKA may be one of multiple non-canonical Hh signaling pathways downstream of Smo acting on muscle regeneration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). It should also be noted that KT5720 has been demonstrated to effectively inhibit other kinases in purified, cell-free preparations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Davies et al., 2000</xref>); among these is GSK3β, which is known to regulate Hh signaling through both Gli2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Riobó et al., 2006</xref>) and its inhibitor SUFU (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chen et al., 2011</xref>). The involvement of non-canonical Hh signaling and CREB supports the involvement of PKA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Belgacem and Borodinsky, 2015</xref>), but further experiments would be necessary to rule out or include contributions by other kinases.</p><p>The link between Smo and regeneration must lie in downstream transcription factors other than Gli, such as NFĸB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Qu et al., 2013</xref>), MycN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mani et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Singh et al., 2018b</xref>), CREB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Belgacem and Borodinsky, 2015</xref>), or JAK/STAT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tian et al., 2015</xref>), which has previously been shown to regulate regeneration in <italic>X. laevis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Tapia et al., 2017</xref>). If specific signaling pathways downstream of Hh-dependent regeneration can be targeted, it may help limit the pleiotropic effects observed with direct manipulation of Smo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wu et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Finally, PKA activity in spinal cord regeneration does not appear to be linearly downstream to Smo-dependent signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>) since we observed additive effects when simultaneously inhibiting Smo and PKA. The exact mechanisms by which PKA modulates regeneration, however, remain unclear. PKA may act as an inhibitor of Gli, which would be in keeping with both our data showing Gli downregulation following amputation and its developmental role as a repressor of canonical Hh signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hammerschmidt et al., 1996</xref>), as well as PKA participation in the non-canonical, Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity and CREB-dependent repression of Gli during <italic>X. laevis</italic> spinal cord development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Belgacem and Borodinsky, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). Since we have also found that Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity is necessary for <italic>Xenopus larva</italic> tail regeneration following amputation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tu and Borodinsky, 2014</xref>), our results showing an early reduction in Gli activity and activation of CREB, as well as the dependence of spinal cord and muscle regeneration on PKA activity, suggest that the aforementioned non-canonical pathway may be at least partially responsible for tissue regeneration.</p><p>Manipulation of Hh signaling has already shown great promise in treating a variety of conditions, including cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ruat et al., 2014</xref>), neural injury and stroke (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bambakidis and Onwuzulike, 2012</xref>), cardiac ischemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dunaeva and Waltenberger, 2017</xref>), appendage regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Singh et al., 2015</xref>), and even osteoporosis and obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hadden, 2014</xref>). Based on the results from this study, we predict that selectively enhancing regeneration-specific, non-canonical Hh signaling in spinal cord and muscle during a critical period following injury might promote the repair and replenishment of functional tissues.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) <break/>or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source <break/>or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">5E1 <break/>(mouse monoclonal)</td><td valign="top">Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_528466">AB_528466</ext-link></td><td valign="top">Shh;

P-CREB+ cell counts are presented as the ratio of numbers of P-CREB+ cells per total number of Sox2+ nuclei for each 100 μm bin along the spinal cord posterior and anterior to the amputation plane for controls (data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>), and as raw P-CREB count values for conditions treated with vehicle, SAG, or cyclopamine (data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8-2"><title>In sections</title><p>Larvae were amputated, incubated for 4 h with DMSO (control), 10 μM cyclopamine or 1 μM SAG, then fixed in 4% PFA for 1 h at room temperature. Samples were then processed for paraffin embedding and sectioned longitudinally in 10-μm-thick sections. Slides were processed for immunostaining by incubating overnight with the primary antibodies Sox2 (1:300), P-CREB (1:800) at 4°C and for 2 h at room temperature with AlexaFluor conjugated secondary antibodies (1:300) in 1% BSA, 0.1% Tween in PBS. Immunostained samples were mounted and imaged in an epifluorescence microscope. Number of P-CREB and Sox2 immunopositive cells was quantified by thresholding the signal to twice the background and normalized per 100 μm extension of the spinal cord, determined by the length of Sox2-labeled tissue. Data was collected considering as 0 μm the tip of the tail in 4-hpa larvae.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Live and fixed sample imaging</title><p>Live larvae anesthetized with 0.02% TMS in 10% MMR were imaged under a Nikon swept-field confocal microscope using 488 nm (EGFP) and 647 nm (iRFP670) lasers.

Data were first analyzed for normality, followed by parametric (normally distributed) or non-parametric tests (not normally distributed). When normally distributed and SDs were equal among groups, unpaired two-tail t-test or ordinary one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s multiple comparisons test was used, when two or more groups were compared, respectively. When normally distributed and SDs were not equal among groups, Welch’s t-test or Brown–Forsythe and Welch ANOVA followed by Dunnett’s T3 multiple comparisons test was used, when two or more groups were compared, respectively. When data were not normally distributed, Mann–Whitney test or Kruskal–Wallis followed by Dunn’s multiple comparisons test was used, when two or more groups were compared, respectively. Graphed values are presented as a normalized percent of the experiment-matched control treatment, pooled across experiments.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Marianne Bronner as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Henry Roehl (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As the editors have judged that your manuscript is of interest, but as described below that additional experiments are required before it is published, we would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Hh signalling contributes to the generation of a number of tissues. The present manuscript investigates how this signalling contributes to the regeneration of the <italic>Xenopus</italic> to spinal cord and muscle, after tail amputation at larva stages. The manuscript suggests that a non-canonical branch of the pathway involving PKA and CREB underlies this process.</p><p>The manuscript is well written and easy to follow. However the finding that distinguishes this manuscript from previous related reports -namely the involvement of non-canonical signalling in Hh-mediated regeneration- is poorly supported by the current data and needs to be strengthened by further experimentation.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. The authors need to provide the rationale for using st 39-40 larvae instead older stages, commonly accepted as regenerative stages (i.e. st 49 to 54). This should be included in the method/results, further discussing the potential advantages/ disadvantages. More information on the timing of full regeneration at used stages should also be provided.</p><p>2. The authors should address the question of whether the activation of the non canonical pathway is ligand dependent or independent, among other by analysing whether HH ligands are in the initial 24 hr of regeneration.</p><p>3. The chemical inhibitors used in the study are not fully specific and therefore additional approaches should be used to validate the findings. One possibility is to use Photo-MO for Smoothened and CREB. Additional methods to support the involvement of PKA are also needed.</p><p>4. A direct link between pCREB and non-canonical HH signalling is needed. This could be provided by testing pCREB reduced after Smoothened inhibition during regeneration.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This manuscript shows that spinal cord and muscle regeneration in the <italic>Xenopus</italic> larvae is mediated by non-canonical Hh signaling through the activity of PKA. This conclusion is based on a series of pharmacological treatments and a careful analysis of a number of quantified parameters.</p><p>The study adds to the idea that Hh signaling is important for tissue regeneration, with the additional interesting idea that the process is mediated, at least at early stages, by non-canonical signaling. The enthusiasm for these results is however undermined by a series of concerns:</p><p>According to the literature, st 49 to 54 are considered as the regenerative stages in <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> (Edwards-Faret et al. 2017 Nat Protocols). Why have the authors used larvae at st 39-40? Can these earlier stages entail a contribution from developmental related aspects? How long does it take to reach full regeneration in these larvae? This information is missing and needs to be provided for non-specialists. This is important also because Figure 2 shows that Gli transcriptional activity begins to recover at 28 hr. When does it get back to normal levels? Is it before than 72 hrs (time used for most of the analysis)? Can Gli activity account for the differences observed between KT5720 and KT5720+ cyclop treatments?</p><p>On the same line: does treatment with GANT61 beginning 48hr (or so) after amputation has any effect on regeneration parameters?</p><p>The experiments reported in Figure 6 do not really prove that P-CREB mediates regeneration. Can the authors attempt to down-modulate its activity?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In this manuscript the authors examine how Hh signalling is involved in spinal cord and muscle regeneration in the <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic>. The important finding is that a non-canonical branch of the Hedgehog pathway involving Protein Kinase A and CREB is acting early during <italic>Xenopus</italic> larval tail regeneration. The paper is well-written and the findings are very interesting, but further work is needed to warrant publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. We feel that these experiments fall within the authors expertise and could be accomplished within a reasonable timeframe.</p><p>1. Using the same regeneration model, Taniguchi et al. (2014) showed that all HH ligands become expressed in the notochord about 24 hours after injury. The analysis presented here is focused before this time. Is the hypothesis that non-canonical HH signalling is ligand independent? If so the Authors should confirm that HH ligands are not expressed during the period of their analysis (i.e. between 0 and 24 hours after injury).</p><p>2. The paper relies very heavily on chemical inhibitors which may not be entirely specific (see also point 3). The authors should consider using Photo-MO for Smothened to confirm some key results. This would be especially convincing when compared to the Gli MO (which did not have a strong effect).</p><p>3. KT5720 is used as an inhibitor of PKA. There are reports of potential off target effects including inhibiting MAPK (Pharmacological PKA Inhibition: All May Not Be What It Seems, Andrew J. Murray, 2008). MAPK can act upstream of CREB too and is known to be activated immediately after wounding (Christen and Slack, 1999). Could another method be used to strengthen the PKA hypothesis?</p><p>4. The Authors use pCREB as a read-out for non-canonical HH signalling in Figure 6. They need to show that pCREB is reduced by Smoothened inhibition during regeneration.

The first relates to the question of whether Hh ligand expression is activated upon amputation at stage 40. Staining of Hh ligands needs to be analyzed and included in the manuscript.

The method section related to how regeneration is measured in Figure 1—figure supplement should be expanded and include an explanation on what is the difference between the data presentation of Figure 1 and figure supplement 1.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The manuscript has been revised addressing the comments raise during the first round of review. The manuscript will add new information of the role of Hh signalling in regeneration</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The responses to the reviewers' comments are on the whole satisfactory, except around the question of whether there is evidence that Hedgehog ligand expression is activated by excision at stage 40.</p><p>The authors state that &quot;Taniguchi et al. reported an upregulation in shh expression upon amputation in the regenerating tail, but they do not argue that Hh is not expressed prior to amputation or during the first 24 hours, nor do their findings support this position.&quot; This is not accurate. Figure 1A of Taniguchi et al. analyses expression of shh and bhh over time. At 0hrs post amputation expression of shh is barely detectable, and bhh is not detected. At 24hrs post amputation there is no expression of either ligand. Starting at 48 hours post amputation, shh is induced strongly and bhh to a lesser degree. This expression is stated as being exclusively in the notochord. This has led to the model that Hedgehog signalling becomes slowly activated peaking four to five days after amputation. The authors should familiarise themselves with the literature on the role of Hedgehog signalling during tail regeneration. The comparison with other published analysis of tail regeneration is important even if it is at a different stage.</p><p>The authors show a staining of Hedgehog ligands in their rebuttal but do not present analysis of this data and have not added the data to their manuscript. It appears to show that Hedgehog ligands are strongly upregulated within 4 hours after amputation, and that this activation is primarily in the neural tube (not notochord?). This finding would be consistent with the author's model that Hedgehog signalling is activated by wounding and stimulates muscle and neural tube regeneration (Figure 9). Importantly this data would indicate that Hedgehog expression becomes active much earlier than has been previously described for stage 49. This data should be properly analysed and presented in the manuscript. It would provide important support for their model. This is not a labour intensive request.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The revised manuscript added new data from additional experiment, explained the reasoning of using stage 39-40 tadpoles for tail amputation experiment, and replaced the western blot images showing the efficiency of <italic>Gli2</italic>-mo. The revision adequately addressed my concerns.</p><p>However, I find it confusing in understanding the graph presentations, especially with the new data. Error bars for controls are not treated consistently. For example, in Figure 1D-I, there are no error bars shown for the control groups, but in Figure 1—figure supplement 1 B-G, there are error bars shown for the control. Yet, the means for the controls in Figure 1—figure supplement 1 B-G are all 100. Could you please explain a bit more in the method section, how the regeneration is measured in Figure 1—figure supplement? What is the difference between the data presentation of Figure 1 and figure supplement 1?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.61804.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1.

Thus the stages of tadpoles used for tail amputation is an important concern when performing regeneration analysis.</p></disp-quote><p>A review of the literature on studies using <italic>Xenopus</italic> larvae as a model for tail regeneration results in a total of 63 original research articles, with 37 in which larvae of stages 39-42 are used and 26 in which stages older than 48 are used. Hence, the earlier stages that we used in this study are well accepted in the field as a good model for tail regeneration in this system. The reasoning behind this is that unlike the tip of the tail that is still developing and growing, the tissues of the stump that become exposed after amputation correspond to mature larval tissues, thus the replenishing of these tissues represents a regenerative process and not the mere developmental progression of tissue growth.</p><p>Nevertheless, this is an important point that we are thankful the reviewers brought to our attention so that we can better introduce the readers to this model system. We revised the Results section accordingly (Page 5, new paragraph 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Second, for Gli activity reporting, the authors injected EGFP:iRFP670 plasmid in the early embryos. This is not ideal, as transgenic tadpoles can be easily generated now.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s suggestion. However, we consider that the mosaic expression of the reporter actually plays to our advantage in allowing us to better assess in sparsely labeled cells Gli activity through live imaging. If reporter expression is extended to all cells as in transgenic larvae, the ability to distinguish between individual cells would have been difficult, if not impossible. Additionally, transgenesis is not an established methodology in the lab and currently we do not have the capability of breeding transgenic animals. Moreover, although transient F0 transgenic larvae would be doable in the lab, the efficiency of transgenesis for big constructs is low and the reporter we developed for this study is 6,378 bp, on the large side of constructs.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript is much improved but there are a couple of key issues that still need to be carefully addressed and included in the manuscript to assure its publication in eLife.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. The first relates to the question of whether Hh ligand expression is activated upon amputation at stage 40. Staining of Hh ligands needs to be analyzed and included in the manuscript. This is an important support for the model presented in Figure 9.</p></disp-quote><p>To assess Hh ligand protein expression upon amputation, we performed Western blot assays from 500 mm-long regions of the tail stump at 0 and 24 h after amputation. We probed membranes with whole-cell lysates from these samples with the Hh 5E1 antibody (DSHB). Results show that Hh ligands are detected before amputation and during early regeneration. Moreover, we find an increase in Hh protein levels in regenerating tail after 24 h post amputation compared to 0 h. We included these additional results in a new Figure 1- supplement 1, along with an image of 4 hours post amputation larvae stained with the 5E1 antibody to illustrate the spatial distribution of Hh ligands during the first hours post amputation.</p><p>We attempted to do a quantitative analysis of 5E1 immunostaining in tissue sections of non-amputated compared to amputated larvae, but we were not satisfied with the reliability of this approach. Due to the pattern of the staining, which mostly localizes to cell membrane, we were not able to count cells or threshold the signal in a consistent manner across samples. Nevertheless, data on the expression of Hh ligand transcripts in the same model system at the same developmental and post amputation times that we used for our study have been recently published using single-cell RNA seq (Aztekin et al., Science 2019). We browsed the data shared (https://marionilab.cruk.cam.ac.uk/XenopusRegeneration/) by the authors and found that Hh ligands are indeed expressed in stage 40 larvae. Transcripts for shh are detected in posterior notochord and floor plate in pre-amputated and in 1 through 3 days post amputation of the regenerating tail, with an increase in levels of shh transcript as early as 1 day post amputation, which is the earliest time point presented by the authors. Transcripts for shh are also expressed in neural tissue, including spinal cord progenitors and subtypes of spinal cord neurons, while dhh is detected in neural tissue and floor plate.</p><p>It should be noted that the pattern of immunohistochemistry that we included in our prior responses to reviewers and in the new Figure 1- supplement 1 may detect not only cells/tissues that express the Hh ligands but also target cells that receive it. Indeed, Aztekin and colleagues reported expression of ptch1 and ptch2 genes in the myotome, neural tissue and floor plate.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

Figure 1A of Taniguchi et al. analyses expression of shh and bhh over time. At 0hrs post amputation expression of shh is barely detectable, and bhh is not detected. At 24hrs post amputation there is no expression of either ligand. Starting at 48 hours post amputation, shh is induced strongly and bhh to a lesser degree. This expression is stated as being exclusively in the notochord. This has led to the model that Hedgehog signalling becomes slowly activated peaking four to five days after amputation. The authors should familiarise themselves with the literature on the role of Hedgehog signalling during tail regeneration. The comparison with other published analysis of tail regeneration is important even if it is at a different stage.</p></disp-quote><p>We have revised the text to include more recent studies that have addressed the expression of Hh ligands during regeneration of the tail at the developmental stages used in this study (Results section, page 5 last sentence and page 6 first paragraph). We browsed the single-cell RNA seq data shared (https://marionilab.cruk.cam.ac.uk/XenopusRegeneration/) by Aztekin et al. (Science 2019), given that they used <italic>X. laevis</italic> larvae at the same developmental and post amputation times that we used for our study, and found that Hh ligands are indeed expressed in stage 40 larvae. Transcripts for shh are detected in posterior notochord and floor plate in pre-amputated and in 1 through 3 days post amputation of the regenerating tail, with an increase in levels of shh transcript as early as 1 day post amputation, which is the earliest time point presented by the authors. Transcripts for shh are also expressed in the neural tissue, including spinal cord progenitors and subtypes of spinal cord neurons, while dhh is detected in neural tissue and floor plate.</p><p>Comparing patterns of expression in the regenerating tail between stage 40 and stage 49 larvae is problematic, and it is not that surprising that there are differences between the findings of Taniguchi et al. in stage 49 larvae and Aztekin et al. in stage 40 animals. It is also important to consider the methodological approaches used to assess expression, which exhibit different sensitivities and spatiotemporal resolution of expression levels. In addition, these studies report on Hh ligand transcript expression; whether transcripts correlate directly with protein levels is doubtful. For instance, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2</xref> shows a representation of shh mRNA and protein from Xenbase, where the developmental changes in transcript and protein levels strikingly diverge. This suggests that reporting on transcript levels of a signaling molecule may not predict the temporal course of activation of a certain signaling pathway.</p><fig id="respfig2"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title><italic>X. laevis</italic> embryonic protein expression.</title><p>This graph shows protein expression in <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic>.

It appears to show that Hedgehog ligands are strongly upregulated within 4 hours after amputation, and that this activation is primarily in the neural tube (not notochord?). This finding would be consistent with the author's model that Hedgehog signalling is activated by wounding and stimulates muscle and neural tube regeneration (Figure 9). Importantly this data would indicate that Hedgehog expression becomes active much earlier than has been previously described for stage 49. This data should be properly analysed and presented in the manuscript. It would provide important support for their model.

Error bars for controls are not treated consistently.

Yet, the means for the controls in Figure 1—figure supplement 1 B-G are all 100.

In contrast, the control bars in Figure 1 and others did not have error bars because some independent experimental sets were combined for presentation: i.e. the cohort-matched controls for each treatment bar were not the same samples. For example, some cyclopamine treatments did not have matched SAG treatments in their cohort, and hence the controls for the SAG and cyclopamine bars were not the same samples. All metrics presented were pooled for analysis as a percent of the average, cohort-paired control values for each parameter in question.</p><p>In the interest of consistency in the presentation of the data and to report on the variability inherent to control groups in all figures, we have added error bars to the controls corresponding to the largest standard error values in the control groups of the different independent experiments that were included in the given bar graph.</p><p>Hence, we revised graphs in Figures 1, 3, 4—figure supplement 1, 5 and 7 to keep a consistent presentation of error bars for control groups.</p><p>We revised the text in the Methods section (page 27, first paragraph) to explain how control groups and error bars were treated for each set of data presented.</p></body></sub-article></article>
