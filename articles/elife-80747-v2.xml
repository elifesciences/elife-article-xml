to be critically involved in the development of drug dependence. Exchange protein directly activated by cAMP (Epac2) is a major cAMP effector abundantly expressed in the brain. However, it remains unknown whether Epac2 contributes to cocaine reinforcement. Here, we report that Epac2 in the mesolimbic dopamine system promotes cocaine reinforcement via enhancement of dopamine release. Conditional knockout of Epac2 from midbrain dopamine neurons (Epac2-cKO) and the selective Epac2 inhibitor ESI-05 decreased cocaine self-administration in mice under both fixed-ratio and progressive-ratio reinforcement schedules and across a broad range of cocaine doses. In addition, Epac2-cKO led to reduced evoked dopamine release, whereas Epac2 agonism robustly enhanced dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens in vitro. This mechanism is central to the behavioral effects of Epac2 disruption, as chemogenetic stimulation of ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopamine neurons via deschloroclozapine (DCZ)-induced activation of Gs-DREADD increased dopamine release and reversed the impairment of cocaine self-administration in Epac2-cKO mice. Conversely, chemogenetic inhibition of VTA dopamine neurons with Gi-DREADD reduced dopamine release and cocaine self-administration in wild-type mice. Epac2-mediated enhancement of dopamine release may therefore represent a novel and powerful mechanism that contributes to cocaine reinforcement.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Epac2</kwd><kwd>dopamine</kwd><kwd>self-administration</kwd><kwd>cocaine</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000026</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Drug Abuse</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01DA035217</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Qing-song</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000026</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Drug Abuse</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01DA047269</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Qing-song</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000025</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F30MH115536</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Vickstrom</surname><given-names>Casey R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000026</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Drug Abuse</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01DA050180</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Baker</surname><given-names>David A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000026</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Drug Abuse</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F31DA054759</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Friedman</surname><given-names>Vladislav</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000025</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MH121454</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Qing-song</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The cAMP sensor and effector Epac2 facilitates dopamine release and promotes cocaine reward.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The rewarding effects of cocaine are primarily mediated by enhanced dopaminergic transmission in the mesolimbic dopamine system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anderson and Pierce, 2005</xref>).

Protein kinase A (PKA) and exchange protein directly activated by cAMP (Epac) are two major intracellular cAMP effectors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">de Rooij et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kawasaki et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tritsch and Sabatini, 2012</xref>) and have numerous downstream signaling targets, thereby transducing changes in cAMP levels to cellular adaptations that can promote behavioral changes. The cAMP-PKA-CREB (cAMP response element-binding protein) signaling pathway has been extensively studied in the context of drug addiction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nestler, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Self, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anderson and Pierce, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nestler, 2016</xref>). However, few studies have addressed how the âotherâ cAMP effector, Epac, regulates the cellular and behavioral effects of drugs of abuse.</p><p>There are two isoforms of Epac, Epac1 and Epac2. <italic>Epac2</italic> is predominately expressed in the brain, whereas <italic>Epac1</italic> expression in the brain is very low (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">de Rooij et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kawasaki et al., 1998</xref>). By making whole-cell recordings in ex vivo slices prepared from Epac1 and Epac2 global knockout mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Yang et al., 2012</xref>), we have shown that Epac2, but not Epac1, regulates adaptations in excitatory and inhibitory synaptic plasticity in VTA dopamine neurons induced by non-contingent cocaine exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Liu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tong et al., 2017</xref>). Drug self-administration provides a measure of the reinforcing efficacy of drugs of abuse and an animalâs motivation to acquire rewarding drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">OâConnor et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hiranita, 2015</xref>). The overall goal of this study was to determine whether Epac2 signaling in midbrain dopamine neurons regulates cocaine self-administration. Epac activators enhance presynaptic glutamate release by increasing the association between the active zone proteins Rab3A, RIM and Munc13, thereby facilitating vesicle docking and exocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ozaki et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ferrero et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fernandes et al., 2015</xref>). Axonal dopamine release in the striatum is mediated by vesicular exocytosis and requires active zone-like site machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Liu and Kaeser, 2019</xref>). Dopamine neuron-specific knockout of RIM abolished action potential-triggered dopamine release in the striatum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Liu et al., 2018a</xref>). However, no previous studies have examined whether Epac2 modulates dopamine release.</p><p>In the present study, we generated dopamine neuron-specific Epac2 conditional knockout (Epac2-cKO) mice and employed the Epac2-selective antagonist ESI-05 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Tsalkova et al., 2012</xref>) to investigate the role of Epac2 signaling in midbrain dopamine neurons in regulating cocaine reinforcement. We examined the effects of ESI-05 and Epac2-cKO on fixed ratio-1 (FR1) and progressive ratio (PR) reinforcement schedules and cocaine dose-response curves. As the reinforcing efficacy of cocaine is primarily mediated by its effect to enhance extracellular dopamine levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anderson and Pierce, 2005</xref>), we tested the hypothesis that Epac2 may contribute to cocaine reinforcement by modulating dopamine release. We first determined how pharmacological and genetic manipulations of Epac2 affect dopamine release in the striatum. Next, we expressed Gs- and Gi-designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADDs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Roth, 2016</xref>) in VTA dopamine neurons and examined whether bidirectional modulation of dopamine release with DREADD activation affected cocaine self-administration in wild-type (WT) and Epac2-cKO mice. Together, our studies provide evidence for a critical role of Epac2 in regulating dopamine release and cocaine reinforcement.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Epac2 inhibition decreased cocaine self-administration across multiple reinforcement schedules and cocaine doses</title><p>We examined the effect of the selective Epac2 inhibitor ESI-05 on cocaine self-administration in roughly equal numbers of male and female mice using an Instech self-administration system that greatly extends the longevity of catheter patency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Slosky et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Slosky et al., 2021</xref>).

In a multiple-dose self-administration paradigm, ESI-05 dose-dependently decreased cocaine infusions and intake at cocaine doses that fall on both the ascending and descending limbs of the inverted U-shaped dose-response curve. Similarly, although Epac2-cKO and WT mice required a similar number of training sessions to reach stable cocaine self-administration, Epac2-cKO mice displayed an overall reduction in self-administration across low and high cocaine unit doses. This depression of the dose-response curve suggests a general decrease in motivation to self-administer cocaine rather than a simple shift in the potency of cocaine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mello and Negus, 1996</xref>). In support of this, Epac2 inhibition or genetic deletion also decreased active nose pokes, cocaine infusions, and breakpoint under PR reinforcement. ESI-05 and Epac2-cKO did not alter inactive nose pokes, nor did they alter oral sucrose self-administration under FR1 or PR reinforcement schedules. Thus, the reduction in cocaine self-administration was unlikely to be caused by a general suppression of operant responding.

It is likely that Epac2 is preferentially activated following chronic cocaine self-administration, which might explain why Epac2 disruption attenuated cocaine self-administration but not sucrose self-administration.</p><p>Epac agonism was shown to facilitate vesicle exocytosis by interacting with the active zone proteins RIM and Munc13 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ozaki et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tengholm and Gylfe, 2017</xref>). RIM is clustered in dopamine axons, and conditional knockout of RIM from midbrain dopamine neurons abolished action potential-triggered dopamine release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Liu and Kaeser, 2019</xref>). We tested the hypothesis that Epac2 modulates axonal dopamine release in the striatum. Using FSCV to record evoked dopamine release in brain slices, we found that an Epac2-selective agonist dose-dependently increased evoked dopamine release in the NAc. This effect was abolished by Epac2 inhibition and <italic>Epac2</italic> genetic deletion but was unaffected by PKA inhibition. Further, Epac2-cKO mice had attenuated evoked dopamine release in vitro across the NAc and dorsal striatum. RIM mediates vesicle tethering and is required for Ca<sup>2+</sup>-channel recruitment to release sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Acuna et al., 2016</xref>). Epac2 may therefore facilitate dopamine exocytosis from midbrain dopamine neurons by interacting with RIM and other active zone proteins and prompting Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent dopamine release.</p><p>There is a possibility that the Epac2 agonist S-220 affected other neurotransmitter systems to indirectly modulate dopamine release. Optogenetic stimulation of cholinergic interneurons in the NAc induced dopamine release via activation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cachope et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Threlfell et al., 2012</xref>). GABA tonically depresses axonal dopamine release in the dorsal striatum via GABA<sub>A</sub> and GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Roberts et al., 2020</xref>). Thus, acetylcholine and GABA have indirect but major impacts on dopamine release. However, the S-220-induced enhancement of dopamine release was abolished by Epac2-cKO from dopamine neurons, suggesting that dopamine axonal terminals are the predominant site for the action of S-220. In future studies, it would be interesting to test whether the S-220-induced enhancement of dopamine release is altered by nAChR and GABA receptor blockers.</p><p>Drugs of abuse including cocaine increase dopamine levels in the NAc, which is thought to underlie their reinforcing effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anderson and Pierce, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Volkow et al., 2006</xref>). As disruption of Epac2 leads to reduced synaptically released dopamine, it is likely that cocaine-mediated DAT inhibition in mice with disrupted Epac2 would cause a lesser increase in extracellular dopamine levels and attenuated dopamine-driven behaviors. To test whether decreased dopamine release contributes to the impairment of cocaine self-administration, we expressed rM3D(Gs) in VTA dopamine neurons in Epac2-cKO mice and found that DCZ increased the frequency dopamine transients by activating PKA and increased cocaine self-administration under FR1 reinforcement. In the multiple-dose self-administration paradigm, rM3D(Gs) activation induced an upward shift of the ascending limb of the cocaine dose-response curve without affecting the descending limb. The increase in operant responding on the ascending limb could be attributable to an increase in the reinforcing efficacy of cocaine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mello and Negus, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Caine et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Roberts et al., 2013</xref>). Since rM3D(Gs) activation increases dopamine release, cocaine infusions at low unit doses likely result in greater dopamine levels, which enhances reinforcement and promotes operant responding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mello and Negus, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Caine et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Roberts et al., 2013</xref>). The DCZ-induced increase in the reinforcing efficacy of cocaine may counter the rate-decreasing effects of higher cocaine unit doses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Zimmer et al., 2011</xref>), which may explain why rM3D(Gs) activation did not significantly shift the descending limb. Together, these experiments demonstrate that the impairment of cocaine self-administration caused by Epac2 disruption is largely reversible with restoration of midbrain dopamine release.</p><p>In contrast, the activation of hM4D(Gi) in WT (<italic>Slc6a3</italic><sup>IRES</sup><italic><sup>cre/+</sup>/Epac2<sup>wt/wt</sup></italic>) mice decreased the frequency of dopamine transients in the NAc in vivo, decreased cocaine self-administration under FR1 reinforcement schedule, and induced an overall downward shift of the cocaine dose-response curve. This phenotype mirrors that of Epac2-cKO mice and indicates a reduction of self-administration across a full range of cocaine unit doses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mello and Negus, 1996</xref>). Similarly, chemogenetic inhibition of VTA dopamine neurons via hM4D(Gi) suppressed heroin self-administration under an FR1 reinforcement schedule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Corre et al., 2018</xref>). Conversely, knockdown of D2 autoreceptors in midbrain dopamine neurons increased dopamine levels due to reduced autoinhibition and caused a general upward shift of the cocaine dose-response curve (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, bidirectional modulation of dopamine release is capable of enhancing or depressing operant responding for cocaine across multiple unit doses and does not result in a simple shift in cocaine potency. Further, Gq-DREADD-mediated stimulation of VTA dopamine neurons potentiated cue and cocaine-priming induced reinstatement, whereas Gi-DREADD reduced reinstatement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mahler et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>We acknowledge the limitations of our DREADD experiments. First, Gs-DREADD stimulation was used to restore dopamine release in Epac2-cKO mice but did not restore Epac2 function. Further studies could determine whether viral expression of <italic>Epac2</italic> in VTA dopamine neurons in Epac2-cKO mice could restore dopamine release and cocaine self-administration to the level of WT mice. Second, our DREADD studies were limited to experiments that were essential to test the central hypothesis that the Epac2-cKO-induced reduction of dopamine release contributes to the deficit in cocaine self-administration. Both mimicry and occlusion can provide insight into whether two biological processes occur by the same mechanism. We have shown that hM4D(Gi) inhibition of VTA dopamine neurons in WT mice mimicked the effects of Epac2-cKO on cocaine self-administration. A complementary experiment would be to determine whether hM4D(Gi) inhibition of dopamine neurons further decreases cocaine self-administration in Epac2-cKO mice or if the effect of hM4D(Gi) inhibition is occluded by Epac-cKO.</p><p>It is likely that Epac2 regulates behavior via mechanisms that extend beyond the facilitation of presynaptic dopamine release. Epac signals downstream via myriad effectors, including Rap, Ras, Rho, phospholipase C, and mitogen-activated protein kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Laurent et al., 2012</xref>). Epac can be activated by both cAMP-dependent and -independent mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Shibasaki et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baameur et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Robichaux and Cheng, 2018</xref>). Repeated cocaine administration induces structural plasticity in the NAc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cahill et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barrientos et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kalivas, 2018</xref>), of which Rap1 GTPase signaling plays a critical role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cahill et al., 2016</xref>). Cocaine self-administration and seeking depend on both dopamine-dependent and -independent mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Schmidt and Pierce, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mereu et al., 2020</xref>). A prominent function of Epac is to regulate synaptic transmission via both presynaptic and postsynaptic mechanisms. Postsynaptically, Epac2 modulates AMPAR trafficking by inducing changes in AMPAR subunit composition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Woolfrey et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Liu et al., 2016</xref>) and enhances open-channel probability of GluA3-AMPARs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gutierrez-Castellanos et al., 2017</xref>). Presynaptically, Epac2 facilitates glutamate release and enables long-term potentiation (LTP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fernandes et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">MartÃ­n et al., 2020</xref>). Genetic deletion of <italic>Epac1/2</italic> or <italic>Epac2</italic> led to the impairment of LTP in the hippocampus, spatial social interaction, and spatial learning and memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Yang et al., 2012</xref>). Addictive drugs such as cocaine induce long-term synaptic plasticity in the reward circuitry of the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wolf, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dong et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Zinsmaier et al., 2022</xref>). We have shown that Epac2, but not Epac1, was required for alterations in excitatory and inhibitory transmission in VTA dopamine neurons induced by non-contingent cocaine exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Liu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tong et al., 2017</xref>). It is likely that Epac2 acts via multifactorial mechanisms that together promote cocaine-induced neuroadaptations and drug reinforcement.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">C57BL/6J mice</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">The Jackson Laboratory</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Stock#: 000664</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Genetic reagent (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Heterozygous <italic>Slc6a3</italic><sup>IRES</sup><italic><sup>cre/+</sup></italic> mice</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">The Jackson Laboratory</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Stock#: 006660</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Maintained on the C57BL/6J background</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>Adeno-associated virus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">AAV9-hSyn-GRAB<sub>DA2m</sub></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">WZ Biosciences</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>Adeno-associated virus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">AAV8-hSyn-mCherry</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Addgene</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Catalog#: 114472-AAV8</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>Adeno-associated virus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">AAV8-hSyn-DIO-rM3D(Gs)-mCherry</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Addgene</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Catalog#: 50458-AAV8</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>Adeno-associated virus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">AAV8-hSyn-DIO-hM4D(Gi)-mCherry</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Addgene</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Catalog#: 44362-AAV8</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>Adeno-associated virus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">AAV8-hSyn-DIO-mCherry</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Addgene</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Catalog#: 50459-AAV8</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Rabbit polyclonal anti-TH</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Santa Cruz Biotechnology</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">SC-14007, Lot: C2707</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">1:300</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Goat anti-rabbit IgG Alexa Fluor-488</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell Signaling</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Stock#: 4412</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">1:300</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Other</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">NeuroTrace 640/660 Deep-Red Fluorescent Nissl Stain</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Thermo Fisher Scientific</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">N-21483</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">1:150</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Software, algorithm</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Origin 2022b</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">OriginLab Corporation</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Software, algorithm</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">RStudio</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">RStudio, PBC</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">DIO Link (Github): <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/xiaojieliu17/Fiber-photometry">GitHub - xiaojieliu17/Fiber-photometry</ext-link></td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>Animal maintenance and use were in accordance with protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Medical College of Wisconsin.

Briefly, a computer-controlled fiber photometry console and low-power LED drivers (LEDD_4) generated excitation light from two LEDs (465 and 560 nm). A lock-in amplifier sinusoidally modulated LED intensities at nonsynchronous frequencies (572.21âand 1017 Hz for 465âand 560 nm, respectively) to filter out potential fluorescence arising from overlapping excitation spectra of the reporters. A fluorescence MiniCube (Doric; FMC6_IE(400-410)_E(460-490)_F(500-550)_ E(555-570)_F(580-680)_S) combined and directed the excitation lights through a low-autofluorescence fiber-optic patch cord (Doric; MFP_200/230/900â0.57_1.0_FCM_ZF1.25_LAF) and rotary joint (Doric; FRJ_200/230/LWMJ-0.57_1m_FCM_0.15_FCM). The patch cord was connected to an implanted fiber-optic cannula via a 1.25 mm mating sleeve (Doric; 1.25 mm with black cover; Sleeve_ZR_1.25-BK). Fluorescence emissions were returned through the same patch cord and MiniCube, separated, and directed to photoreceivers (Model 2151, DC low setting; Newport Corporation, Irvine, CA).</p><p>Before each experiment, the patch cord was photobleached with 465 and 560 nm excitation light to further reduce fiber-optic autofluorescence. The final power output at the tip of the patch cord was adjusted to 20 ÂµW prior to recording. Data acquisition was controlled by Doric Neuroscience Studio software at a rate of 12.0 ksps, decimated by a factor of 100. The resulting signals were demodulated and low-pass filtered at 6 Hz. After attachment of the patch cord, mice were placed into an open-field chamber for at least 15 min to allow environmental habituation before recording commenced. To reduce fluorescent reporter photobleaching, recording was performed using a 6 min 83% duty cycle (5 min on/1 min off). A baseline dopamine signal during open-field locomotion was recorded for 20 min. Then, mice received DCZ injections (100 Âµg/kg, subcutaneous) and were returned to the open-field chamber to record dopamine fluorescence for another 60 min.</p><p>The fiber photometry data were analyzed using custom code written in RStudio (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/xiaojieliu17/Fiber-photometry">GitHub - xiaojieliu17/Fiber-photometry</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Snarrenberg, 2022</xref>). To calculate the ÎF/F time series, a linear fit was applied to the data and the fitted 560 nm signal was aligned and subtracted from the 465 nm signal, and then divided by the fitted 560 nm signal to yield ÎF/F values. For dopamine event frequency analysis, the processed ÎF/F values were transferred into ABF file using Minianalysis (Bluecell Co., Seoul, Korea). Then, the frequency of dopamine transients was analyzed using their Minianalysis software. The onset of an event was defined by a <italic>Z</italic> score value larger than mean plus three times the standard deviation of the <italic>Z</italic> scores of recorded fluorescence during the prior 0.5 s period, and the resultant peak frequency was compared across groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Meng et al., 2018</xref>). After the completion of the experiments, the AAV expression in the VTA and NAc, and the localization of optic fiber implantation in the NAc was verified by immunohistochemistry.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Acute brain slice preparation</title><p>WT and Epac2-cKO mice of either sex were used for FSCV, electrophysiological recordings, and scRT-PCR. Mice were anesthetized by isoflurane inhalation and decapitated. The brain was embedded in low-gelling-point agarose, and coronal striatal slices (200 Î¼m thick) were cut using a vibrating slicer (Leica VT1200s, Nussloch, Germany), as described in our previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Vickstrom et al., 2020</xref>).

All equipment was cleaned with RNase Zap before each use. Glass pipettes were baked at 400Â°C for at least 4 hr to deactivate RNase. Glass pipettes (3â5 MÎ©) were filled with RNase-free internal solution containing (in mM): 140 K-gluconate, 10 KCl, 10 HEPES, 0.2 EGTA, 2 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 4 Mg-ATP, 0.3 Na<sub>2</sub>GTP, 10 Na<sub>2</sub>-phosphocreatine (pH 7.2 with KOH). The internal solution was prepared with RNase-free water, aliquoted and stored at â80Â°C. Before each experiment, 10 Âµl recombinant RNase inhibitor (1 U/Âµl, Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO) was added to 390 Âµl internal solution to increase RNA yield. Whole-cell and cell-attached patch-clamp recordings were made using patch-clamp amplifiers (Multiclamp 700B; Molecular Devices, San Jose, CA) under infrared differential interference contrast microscopy. Data acquisition and analysis were performed using DigiData 1440A and 1550B digitizers and the analysis software pClamp 10 (Molecular Devices). Signals were filtered at 2 kHz and sampled at 10 kHz. Action potential (AP) firing was recorded in the cell-attached configuration in the presence of CNQX (10 ÂµM), D-AP5 (20 ÂµM), and picrotoxin (50 ÂµM) to block excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission, as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Vickstrom et al., 2021</xref>). Junction potentials between the patch pipette and bath ACSF were nullified prior to obtaining a seal. Membrane capacitance was measured by Clampex software (Molecular Devices) using small amplitude hyperpolarizing and depolarizing steps (Â±5 mV). Series resistance (10â20 MÎ©) was monitored throughout all recordings, and data were discarded if the resistance changed by more than 20%. All recordings were performed at 32 Â± 1Â°C by using an automatic temperature controller (Warner Instruments LLC, Hamden, CT).</p><p>Cell contents were aspirated into the glass pipette by applying a gentle negative pressure at the end of each recording. The Gigaohm seal was maintained during the aspiration process to reduce external contamination. After aspiration, the pipette was slowly withdrawn from the cell. The cell contents were then dispensed into an RNase-free microcentrifuge tube with positive pressure. Complementary DNA (cDNA) was synthesized from the cytoplasmic mRNA using iScript Advanced cDNA Synthesis Kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA). Target genes were then amplified with two PCR steps using the following primer pairs. <italic>Gapdh</italic>, forward <named-content content-type="sequence">5â- AGCTTGTCATCAACGGGAAG-3â</named-content>, reverse <named-content content-type="sequence">5â-GTCATGAGCCCTTCCACAAT-3â</named-content>, 331 bp; <italic>Th</italic>, forward<named-content content-type="sequence"> 5â-TGCCAGAGAAGGACAAGGTTC-3â</named-content>, reverse <named-content content-type="sequence">5â-CGATACGCCTGGTCAGAGA-3</named-content>â, 131 bp; <italic>Gad2</italic>, forward <named-content content-type="sequence">5â-GTTCCTTTCCTGGTGAGTGC-3â</named-content>, reverse <named-content content-type="sequence">5â-TGCATCAGTCCCTCCTCTCT-3â,</named-content> 266 bp; <italic>Epac2</italic>, forward <named-content content-type="sequence">5â-TGGAACCAACTGGTATGCTG-3â</named-content>, reverse <named-content content-type="sequence">5â-CCAATTCCCAGAGTGCAGAT-3â</named-content>, 102 bp; <italic>Epac1</italic>, forward <named-content content-type="sequence">5â-GGACAAAGTCCCCTACGACA-3â</named-content>, reverse <named-content content-type="sequence">5â- CTTGGTCCAGTGGTCCTCAT-3â</named-content>, 121 bp; <italic>Slc17a6</italic>, forward <named-content content-type="sequence">5â-CGCTGCTTCTGGTTGTTGGC-3â</named-content>, reverse <named-content content-type="sequence">5â-AAACCATCCCCGACAGCGTG-3â</named-content>, 186 bp.

reward by altering dopamine release properties in the striatum. The study uses a broad range of technical approaches to thoroughly characterize the cellular and behavioral roles of Epac2 in mice. Together, these results provide convincing important insight into Epac2 as a potential presynaptic molecular target through which dopamine signaling and drug taking might be manipulated and is of interest to scientists studying dopamine transmission and substance use disorders.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.80747.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Day</surname><given-names>Jeremy J</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/008s83205</institution-id><institution>University of Alabama at Birmingham</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Calipari</surname><given-names>Erin</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/02vm5rt34</institution-id><institution>Vanderbilt University</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: (i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2022.06.13.495971">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.06.13.495971v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; (ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Kate Wassum as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Erin Calipari (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>As outlined below, the reviewers were very positive about the rigor and potential significance of this manuscript and appreciated the incorporation of many different technical approaches to identify a role for presynaptic Epac2 in dopamine signaling and cocaine reinforcement/motivation. Although the reviewer critiques suggested potential experiments that could help to expand and clarify the mechanistic contributions of Epac2, the overall consensus was that these experiments are not essential for further consideration in <italic>eLife</italic>. However, at a minimum a revised manuscript should include:</p><p>1) Clarification of experimental questions and concerns raised by each reviewer, as well as the incorporation of suggested text changes.</p><p>2) Additional or more thorough discussion of limitations raised by the reviewers and implications of the work, including discussion of potentially non-specific effects of Epac2 manipulation in the NAc (Rev. 1), justification for the focus on the lateral NAc shell, and discussion of differences in Epac2 contributions to sucrose and cocaine reward (Rev. 2), and clarification of the working model presented in Figure 9 (Rev. 3).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. I am confused about how on an FR1 schedule of reinforcement the infusions and lever presses are not the same. If they are different the animal is not actually on an FR1 schedule as every response does not actually result in an infusion of the drug. I would just change this to low effort schedule or something like that - no new experiments would have to be run.</p><p>2. While the experiments in Figure 6 are interesting, it is important to discuss what th`is means in the context of microcircuit work. It is possible that the effects of Epac2 could be having local effects selectively in dopamine terminals independent of somatic effects; however, the design is not able to distinguish between the effects on dopamine terminals and other neurotransmitter systems in the NAc such as GABA, acetylcholine, glutamate, and peptidergic release. If you knock out Epac2 in dopamine neurons, do you still get the effects of the drugs on local slices? The manuscript contains a lot of data, so it is not completely necessary to do these additional experiments, but this should be at the very least discussed in detail in the discussion.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Figures 1 and 3: ip injection of ESI-05 inhibit the global Epsac2. Given the extensive data based on dopamine neuron-specific manipulations, the data in these figures do not carry substantial weight. It might work better if some of the results are moved Suppl section.</p><p>Figures 3 and 4: It is interesting and somewhat surprising that Epac2 manipulations only influenced cocaine self-administration without affecting sucrose-motivated responses, given that dopamine is also needed for sucrose conditioning. Any insights warrant a discussion.</p><p>Figure 5: The lateral shell of the NAc was focused. Functionally, the medial shell is preferentially implicated in motivated behaviors. Some justification for focusing on the lateral shell will help.</p><p>Figures 7 and 8: The wild-type controls might need to be considered. Specifically, in addition to Epac2-cKO mice, will chemogenetic down/upregulation of dopamine release also influences mice without genetic modifications?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. To address point #1 in the Public Review, a potential experiment for the authors to consider is to put back wild-type Epac2 protein to mutant VTA DA neurons (e.g. via viral gene overexpression) followed by measurement of DA release and cocaine SA. Authors may also consider testing if chemogenetic activation of DA neurons promotes sucrose SA, which may provide insights into the nature and significance of the rescue. If some or all of these experiments are not feasible or practical, detailed discussions and/or rationale need to be provided for clarification.</p><p>2. To address point #2 in the Public Review, authors may consider repeating the chemogenetic inhibition experiments in Epac2 cKO mice, and see if Epack2 deletion occluded or blunted effects of DA release inhibition on cocaine SA in mutant mice, or provide more detailed discussions or clarifications.</p><p>3. To address point #3 in the Public Review, authors should present the time course of DA transient changes following DCZ injection, and show more representative DA signal records.</p><p>4.

As a result, the number of nose pokes is slightly higher than the number of cocaine infusions. We have clarified this in the legend of Fig. 1.

The Cre-LoxP approach used here produced a complete knockout of Epac2 from entire midbrain dopamine neurons (soma and axonal terminals). Importantly, this dopamine neuron-specific knockout completely abolished the effect of the Epac2 agonist to increase dopamine release, suggesting that its effects are not mediated by other neurotransmitter systems. We have added the following discussion in the revised manuscript (Pages 16-17, lines 372-381) to further clarify and address this point.</p><p>âThere is a possibility that the Epac2 agonist S-220 affected other neurotransmitter systems to indirectly modulate dopamine release. Optogenetic stimulation of cholinergic interneurons in the NAc induced dopamine release via activation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) (Cachope et al., 2012; Threlfell et al., 2012). GABA tonically depresses axonal dopamine release in the dorsal striatum via GABAA and GABAB receptors (Roberts et al., 2020). Thus, acetylcholine and GABA have indirect but major impacts on dopamine release. However, the S-220-induced enhancement of dopamine release was abolished by Epac2-cKO from dopamine neurons, suggesting that dopamine axonal terminals are the predominant site for the action of S-220. In future studies, it would be interesting to test whether the S-220-induced enhancement of dopamine release is altered by nAChR and GABA receptor blockersâ.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Figures 1 and 3: ip injection of ESI-05 inhibit the global Epsac2.

It was somewhat surprising that ESI-05 and Epac2 attenuated cocaine self-administration but did not significantly alter sucrose self-administration. However, similar differential modulation of cocaine vs. sucrose self-administration by pharmacological agents has been reported (Levy et al., 2007; Romieu et al., 2008; Mu et al., 2021). Although there is significant overlap in the neuronal circuits encoding food and drug rewards (Volkow et al., 2012), the majority of NAc neurons exhibited different firing patterns in response to food and cocaine rewards (Carelli, 2002). As mentioned in the Introduction, repeated cocaine exposure leads to decreased G<sub>Î±i/o</sub> expression in the VTA and an up-regulation of cAMP signaling (Nestler et al., 1990; Striplin and Kalivas, 1992). It is likely that Epac2 is preferentially activated following chronic cocaine self-administration, which might explain why Epac2 disruption attenuated cocaine self-administration but not sucrose self-administration.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 5: The lateral shell of the NAc was focused. Functionally, the medial shell is preferentially implicated in motivated behaviors. Some justification for focusing on the lateral shell will help.</p></disp-quote><p>Our choice of the NAc lateral shell was driven by its denser innervation from VTA dopamine neurons compared to other NAc subregions as indicated by the mouse brain connectivity atlas from Allen Institute (https://connectivity.brain-map.org/) (PMID: 24695228) and our own preliminary studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figures 7 and 8: The wild-type controls might need to be considered.

First, Gs-DREADD stimulation was used to restore dopamine release in Epac2-cKO mice but did not restore Epac2 function. Further studies could determine whether viral expression of Epac2 in VTA dopamine neurons in Epac2-cKO mice could restore dopamine release and cocaine self-administration to the level of WT mice. Second, our DREADD studies were limited to experiments that were essential to test the central hypothesis that the Epac2-cKO-induced reduction of dopamine release contributes to the deficit in cocaine self-administration. Both mimicry and occlusion can provide insight into whether two biological processes occur by the same mechanism. We have shown that hM4D(Gi) inhibition of VTA dopamine neurons in WT mice mimicked the effects of Epac2-cKO on cocaine self-administration. A complementary experiment would be to determine whether hM4D(Gi) inhibition of dopamine neurons further decreases cocaine self-administration in Epac2-cKO mice or if the effect of hM4D(Gi) inhibition is occluded by Epac2-cKO.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1.

It would take considerable time to collaborate with a Vector Core to design, pack and validate Epac2 overexpression in a cell-type specific manner and test its effects on cocaine self-administration in Epac2-cKO mice. Mouse Epac2 (Rapgef4) mRNA contains 3040 bp. Together with regulatory elements and EGFP, it may not be within the capacity of an AAV-mediated delivery system (~4.8 kb maximum), but it may be delivered with a lentiviral system.
