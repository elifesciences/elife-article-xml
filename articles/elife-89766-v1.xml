unconditioned stimulus (US) reinforces drug taking. Meanwhile, drug-associated cues (conditioned stimulus [CS]) also gain incentive salience to promote drug seeking. The basolateral amygdala (BLA) is implicated in both US- and CS-mediated responses. Here, we show that two genetically distinct BLA neuronal types, expressing Rspo2 versus Ppp1r1b, respectively, project to the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and form monosynaptic connections with both dopamine D1 and D2 receptor-expressing neurons. While intra-NAc stimulation of Rspo2 or Ppp1r1b presynaptic terminals establishes intracranial self-stimulation (ICSS), only Ppp1r1b-stimulated mice exhibit cue-induced ICSS seeking. Furthermore, increasing versus decreasing the Ppp1r1b-to-NAc, but not Rspo2-to-NAc, subprojection increases versus decreases cue-induced cocaine seeking after cocaine withdrawal. Thus, while both BLA-to-NAc subprojections contribute to US-mediated responses, the Ppp1r1b subprojection selectively encodes CS-mediated reward and drug reinforcement. Such differential circuit representations may provide insights into precise understanding and manipulation of drug- versus cue-induced drug seeking and relapse.</p></abstract><kwd-group

the drug as an unconditioned stimulus (US) with its primary rewarding effects drives drug taking and seeking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Venniro et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Nader, 2016</xref>). Meanwhile, drug use is often associated with conditioned stimuli (CS), such as environmental cues, which also acquire incentive salience to promote drug seeking and relapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Venniro et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Nader, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Volkow et al., 2017</xref>). For anti-relapse treatment, an effective strategy would be to coordinatively intervene the US- and CS-reinforced drug responses. However, the cellular and circuit underpinnings that differentiate the US versus CS processing are not well understood, preventing the precise and targeted manipulations.</p><p>The nucleus accumbens (NAc) is a key brain region where medium spiny neurons (MSNs) process both US and CS inputs for behavioral outputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Meredith et al., 2008</xref>). Using region-specific lesion, pharmacological inhibition, and optogenetic manipulation, extensive previous studies demonstrate that the basolateral amygdala (BLA) provides both US- and CS-associated input to the NAc during drug taking and seeking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cardinal et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wright and Dong, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zinsmaier et al., 2022</xref>). BLA pyramidal neurons heterogeneously respond to US, CS, as well as stimuli with appetitive or aversive valence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Janak and Tye, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">O’Neill et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gründemann et al., 2019</xref>). These BLA neurons are genetically separable into two populations, R-spondin2-positive (Rspo2) magnocellular neurons and protein phosphatase 1 regulatory subunit 1B-positive (Ppp1r1b, also known as DARPP-32) parvocellular neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kim et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kim et al., 2017</xref>). Here, we explored whether Rspo2 and Ppp1r1b neurons project to the NAc to form two distinct BLA-to-NAc subprojections that differentially contribute to US- versus CS-reinforced drug responses.</p><p>Our results show that optogenetic stimulation of either Rspo2 or Ppp1r1b presynaptic terminals in the NAc established intracranial self-stimulation (ICSS), indicating that both subprojections contribute to US-mediated responses. However, after establishment of the subprojection-specific ICSS, only Ppp1r1b mice exhibited cue-induced ICSS seeking, suggesting that the Ppp1r1b-to-NAc subprojection selectively encodes CS-mediated reinforcement. Furthermore, chemogenetically increasing versus decreasing the transmission efficacy of Ppp1r1b-to-NAc, but not Rspo2-to-NAc, subprojection increased versus decreased cue-induced cocaine seeking after withdrawal from cocaine self-administration (SA). These results characterize the differential behavioral roles of two major BLA-to-NAc subprojections and provide a circuit mechanism through which US- versus CS-reinforced reward and drug seeking can be selectively manipulated.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>BLA Rspo2 and Ppp1r1b subprojections to the NAc</title><p>To selectively examine the Rspo2-to-NAc subprojection, we crossed the Rspo2-Cre and D1-tdTomato mice.

In behaving animals, BLA neurons tend to be activated in a population-specific manner in response to US versus CS as well as stimuli with different valences, suggesting the functional and populational heterogeneity of BLA neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">O’Neill et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Paton et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Tye and Janak, 2007</xref>). Based on morphological and anatomical properties, BLA pyramidal neurons can be divided into two populations, magnocellular versus parvocellular neurons that are preferentially located in the anterior versus posterior BLA, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Swanson and Petrovich, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">McDonald, 1982</xref>). Genetic profiling reveals that these two neuronal types correspond to Rspo2- and Ppp1r1b-expressing neurons, which are differentially implicated in appetitive versus aversive affective responding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kim et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kim et al., 2017</xref>). Our current results show that both Rspo2 and Ppp1r1b BLA neurons project to the NAc, forming monosynaptic connections with both D1 and D2 MSNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). In our experiments, stimulation of Rspo2- or Ppp1r1b-to-NAc presynaptic fibers evokes EPSCs in randomly sampled MSNs, suggesting co-innervation of individual MSNs by both BLA subprojections. However, the low-throughput feature of electrophysiology did not allow to generate large sample sizes and, thus, did not rule out other possible innervation patterns. Nonetheless, if co-innervation is true, each MSN may function as a basic NAc unit to integrate Rspo2 and Ppp1r1b inputs. Potentially through different downstream targets, D1 and D2 NAc MSNs play differential and, on many occasions, opposing roles in cue-conditioned responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zinsmaier et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Smith et al., 2013</xref>). In conditioned responses, the driving force and inhibitory control are the two essential components that cooperate to ensure a smooth behavioral output. We speculate that the co-innervation of D1 and D2 MSNs by Rspo2 or Ppp1r1b provides a circuit basis on which the dynamic balance between the drive and inhibition can be achieved.</p><p>A prominent functional difference between the Rspo2- and Ppp1r1b-to-NAc synapses is their different PPRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Because both subprojections are assessed by stimulation of ChR2-expressing presynaptic terminals with the same set of parameters, potential systemic errors are normalized. These results suggest that the presynaptic Pr of Ppp1r1b synapses is higher than Rspo2 synapses. In response to CS, BLA neurons fire action potentials with heterogenous patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ambroggi et al., 2008</xref>). With these synaptic features, the Rspo2- versus Ppp1r1b-to-NAc transmissions are expected to be more effective in activating NAc MSNs upon bursting versus tonic activations, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>ICSS</title><p>Optogenetic stimulation of either Rspo2 or Ppp1r1b presynaptic terminals within the NAc establishes ICSS, revealing the reinforcing capacity of these two subprojections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). However, recent results show that Rspo2 and Ppp1r1b BLA neurons may encode opposite valence such that they selectively express activity biomarkers in response to aversive versus appetitive stimuli, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kim et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kim et al., 2017</xref>). Despite the different experimental approaches, these seemingly discrepant results may reveal the projection-specific functions of Rspo2 neurons. Specifically, results from the retrograde tracing show that, compared with the NAc, a larger portion of Rspo2 neurons send much denser projections to the central nucleus of amygdala (CeA), a brain region associated with negative behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kim et al., 2016</xref>). BLA neurons that project to the CeA versus NAc are preferentially activated by aversion- versus reward-predictive cues, and activation of BLA-to-CeA versus BLA-to-NAc promotes aversive versus appetitive behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kim et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beyeler et al., 2016</xref>). We speculate that Rspo2 BLA neurons projecting to the CeA versus NAc are largely nonoverlapping, mediating distinct behavioral responses.</p><p>Without differentiating Rspo2- or Ppp1r1b-to-NAc subprojections, previous studies show that mice establish instrumental responding for self-stimulation of the BLA-to-NAc projection as a whole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Stuber et al., 2011</xref>). Taken together with our current results, activation of each of the BLA-to-NAc subprojections may function as an unconditioned reinforcer to drive the instrumental responding. However, an interpretational caveat should be considered. Specifically, low-frequency (i.e., 5 or 10 Hz over ~5 s) stimulations of BLA neurons do not establish ICSS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Servonnet et al., 2020</xref>). Similarly in our experiments, relatively low-frequency (i.e., 20 Hz) optogenetic stimulation of either of the subprojections does not establish ICSS; ICSS is established only when the stimulation frequency is increased to 40 Hz (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Through potential backpropagation, such high-frequency stimulations of presynaptic terminals can strongly activate the soma of BLA neurons, which, in turn, activate other BLA-projected brain regions that are involved in US-mediated reinforcement. Indeed, direct or indirect BLA projections are detected to innervate neurons in the ventral tegmental area, prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, and lateral hypothalamus, all implicated in behavioral reinforcement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Janak and Tye, 2015</xref>). Thus, in addition to BLA-to-NAc subprojections, other divergent projections from the BLA may also be activated to substantiate the US-mediated reinforcement during ICSS training.</p><p>It has long been known that the BLA-to-NAc projection is essential for cue-conditioned incentive processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Robinson and Berridge, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Keefer et al., 2021</xref>). Our results show that stimulation of Ppp1r1b-, but not Rspo2-to-NAc, subprojection, induced a prolonged cue-conditioned responding, highlighting the Ppp1r1b subprojection in cue conditioning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). These results are consistent with the topographic features of the BLA-to-NAc projection. Specifically, compared to the anterior BLA, the posterior BLA is more enriched in Ppp1r1b neurons and send projections to both the NAc shell and core (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kim et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kita and Kitai, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Russchen and Price, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brog et al., 1993</xref>). Disconnecting the BLA and NAc shell impairs outcome-specific Pavlovian-to-instrumental transfer and the maintenance of cue-conditioned responding in the absence of reward (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Simmons and Neill, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Shiflett and Balleine, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Corbit and Balleine, 2011</xref>).

Albeit nonessential, our ICSS results suggest that activation of the Ppp1r1b subprojection is sufficient to establish cue conditioning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).

Among the heterogenous BLA-to-NAc projections, we speculate that the Ppp1r1b subprojection is the primary bearer of cocaine-induced adaptations that promote cue-induced cocaine seeking.</p><p>By manipulating somatic activities or projections to the CeA, previous studies demonstrate opposite roles of Rspo2 and Ppp1r1b BLA neurons in appetitive versus aversive reinforcement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kim et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kim et al., 2017</xref>). Our chemogenetic manipulation above was confined to the NAc presynaptic terminals of Rspo2 BLA neurons. As such, a lack of behavioral effects in our results may suggest that the established behavioral correlates of Rspo2 BLA neurons are mediated by the projections of Rspo2 BLA to other brain regions.</p><p>Taken together, our current study pinpoints the differential roles of two major BLA-to-NAc subprojections in regulating US- versus CS-mediated reinforcement. These results may provide a circuit basis through which drug- and drug-conditioned cues invigorate drug craving and seeking.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Subjects and reagents</title><p>Both Rspo2-Cre and Cartpt-Cre mice with the C57BL/6J background were obtained from the Tonegawa lab (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kim et al., 2016</xref>).

Clampex software 9.2 (Molecular Devices, San Jose, CA, USA) was used for triggering laser stimulation and data acquisition.

Data were analyzed and plotted using Clampfit 9.2.</p><p>To assess whether the postsynaptic currents recorded in D1 and D2 MSNs are mediated by BLA-to-NAc glutamatergic transmission, recordings were performed at –70 mV, with stimulation of a single laser pulse (duration &lt;1 ms) every 7 s for 30 times. Subsequently, a cocktail of NBQX (10 µM) and D-AP5 (50 µM) was bath-applied to confirm if the responses were mediated by AMPARs and NMDARs. To assess the presynaptic release probability, optogenetically evoked EPSCs were measured by paired-pulse stimulations with interpulse intervals of 25, 50, 100, or 200 ms, repeatedly delivered every 10 s.

The light power at the tip of the fiber was measured with a power meter (PM20CH, Thorlabs, Inc, Newton, NJ, USA) prior to experiments to adjust the power at ~10 mW. Before behavioral testing, the ferrule implants on the top of the animals were coupled to splitter branching fiber-optic patch cords (Doric Lenses, Québec, Canada) with ceramic ferrule sleeves (Thorlabs, Inc, Newton, NJ, USA). Immediately after receiving a single train of laser pulses (50 ms/pulse × 10 pulses at 10 Hz), the mice were placed into the chambers for operant training.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Optogenetic intracranial self-stimulation</title><p>Mice with intra-BLA injection of AAV-DIO-ChR2 or AAV-DIO-EYFP (control) were trained for oICSS in operant chambers (ENV-307W-CT, Med Associates Inc, St Albans, VT, USA), each equipped with two retractable levers on the wall. A fiber-optic rotary joint (FRJ_1x1_FC, Doric Lenses, Québec, Canada) mounted on the top of the exterior box was used to connect the splitter branching fiber-optic patch cords and the input patch cable attached to the laser system, allowing the cable-tethered mice to move freely during operant responding. To minimize the interference of laser flash with animals’ behavior, ceramic sleeves connecting the ferrules and patch cord were covered with similarly sized black tubing. Scheduling of experimental events and data collection were accomplished using MED-PC IV software from Med-Associates Inc. The experiment consisted of the following sequential phases:</p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Initial conditioning: During a 1 hr session (fixed ratio 1 schedule), mice were allowed to move freely within the operant chambers. A single press on the active lever triggered the bilateral delivery of a train of laser pulses into the NAc, concurrent with the cue light illuminating above the active lever over the duration of laser stimulation (0.25 or 0.75 s). There was no timeout period during the training session. Pressing the inactive lever had no consequence. The criterion of ICSS was set to be a minimum of 100 active lever presses with the ratio of active/inactive lever presses ≥2:1 over the 1 hr session. The mice were first trained for three sessions with a weak ICSS protocol (20 Hz, 30 times, pulse duration of 5 ms). During following sessions, the stimulation frequency was increased to 40 Hz with reduced pulse duration (1 ms; 10 mW; 10 times).</p></list-item><list-item><p><italic>Extinction</italic>: After the cue-conditioned ICSS was established, mice were placed back into the operant chambers, where pressing the active lever only resulted in the presentation of cue without stimulation.

Briefly, an incision was made in the neck to expose the right external jugular vein and an incision on the back for implanting a vascular access button (Instech Laboratories, Inc, Plymouth Meeting, PA, USA), which was connected to a silicone catheter (Dow Corning, 0.3 mm ID × 0.64 mm OD). Catheter placement was done by tunneling subcutaneously from the back incision and inserting the tubing into the jugular vein at the length of 1.1 cm. After the incisional areas and the button were secured by suturing, mice were singly housed in their home cages for recovery. The patency of the intravenous catheter was maintained by daily flush with heparinized saline (30 USP units/mL).</p><p>After ~7 days of recovery, catheterized mice were trained for cocaine SA in mouse modular operant chambers (ENV-307W-CT, Med Associates Inc, St Albans, VT, USA) under a fixed ratio 1 schedule. The chamber contained two retractable levers on one side of the wall and an LED cue light is located above the active lever. A 3 mL syringe containing 1.5 mg/mL cocaine solution was loaded to an infusion pump (PHM-200, Med Associate Inc) before each 2 hr SA session. Each session started by extending the two levers into the chamber and illuminating the house light (continuously on throughout each session). Intravenous injection was triggered by a single active lever press, enabling the mice to receive cocaine solution at a dose of 0.75 mg/kg/infusion and in a volume of 0.5 µL/g/infusion over ~2 s, depending on the bodyweight of the subject. The infusion was accompanied by a cue light illumination over the course of infusion. To prevent cocaine overdose, there was a 10 s timeout period between two consecutive infusions, during which pressing the active lever was recorded but did not result in cocaine infusion. Pressing the inactive lever had no programmed consequence.</p><p>For the test of cocaine seeking, mice underwent withdrawal after the 10-day cocaine SA procedure and were re-exposed to drug-associated cues in the same operant chambers on withdrawal days 7, 21, and 45. In the 1 hr cue-induced cocaine-seeking session, both the active and inactive levers were extended. Pressing the active lever resulted in the presentation of light cues without cocaine infusion, while pressing the inactive lever resulted in nothing. The number of active lever presses was used to assess cue-induced cocaine seeking.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Chemogenetic manipulations of BLA-to-NAc pathways</title><p>The CNO solution was freshly prepared by dissolving the compound in saline and filled in a 10 μL Hamilton syringe (22 g blunt tip) connected to the customized internal cannulae (C315DCMN/SPC, P1 Technologies) by cannula-tubing (C313CT, P1 Technologies, Roanoke, VA, USA). To infuse CNO into the NAc, the mice were gently held in hand without anesthesia before the infusion. After the dummy cannula inserts were removed, needles were gently inserted into the cannulae. Saline or CNO (3 μM, 500 nL) was infused into NAc through the needle at 150 nL/min driven by a syringe pump (Pump 11 Elite, Harvard Apparatus).

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Michael Taffe as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Burt Sharp (Reviewer #2).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Summary</p><p>Previous work had already identified the R-spondin2-positive(Rspo2) magnocellular neurons and the protein phosphatase 1 regulatory subunit 1B-positive (Ppp1r1b) parvocellular neurons, which project from the basolateral amygdala (BLA) to the Nucleus Accumbens ( NAc) BLA-NAc, in driving motivated behavior. The manuscript authored by He et al. introduces a nuanced perspective, distinguishing the roles of these two distinct cell populations in behavioral responses. Particularly, this research sheds light on their contributions to unconditioned stimulus (US)-mediated responses, which reinforce drug-taking behavior, and conditioned stimulus (CS), which promotes drug-seeking behavior. Specifically, the authors found that robustly optogenetically stimulating either the Rspo2 or Ppp1r1b presynaptic terminals in the NAc resulted in the promotion of US-mediated responses, such as intracranial self-stimulation (ICSS). However, only stimulation of Ppp1r1b neurons contributed to CS-mediated reinforcement responses, including cue-induced ICSS and cue-induced cocaine seeking following withdrawal from cocaine self-administration.</p><p>Strength</p><p>1. The manuscript is well-written and organized.</p><p>2. The authors establish a causal behavioral relationship by combining in-vivo physiology with genetic dissection.</p><p>Weaknesses</p><p>1. The differentiation between dopamine D1 receptor and dopamine D2 receptor-expressing NAc medium spiny neurons is determined by the presence or absence of D1-driven tdTomato. However, this approach has a limitation, as there exists a subset of neurons that express both D1 and D2 receptors, leading to their labeling with tdTomato as well.</p><p>2. Considering the relatively small sizes of the animal and recording samples in experiments 1L and 1X, it remains uncertain whether the authors possessed adequate statistical power to ascertain whether Rspo2 and Ppp1r1b neurons exhibited a discernible preference for innervation of the core or shell regions.</p><p>3. Data transparency is somewhat lacking in the manuscript, as it does often not explicitly state the number of animals used in each experiment, and individual data points are infrequently presented.</p><p>4. The manuscript exhibits deficiencies in adequately presenting the statistical analysis employed for the experiments. Within the text and/or figure legends, there is a lack of clarity regarding the specific statistical tests applied to accommodate repeated days or sessions, such as during ICSS and extinction. Furthermore, the effects in relation to the day of withdrawal are not explicitly specified. The incorporation of post-hoc analyses is sparse, and it remains unclear whether statistical tests for repeated measures were employed.</p><p>5. There appears to be an insufficient depth of discussion regarding the reasons behind the Rspo2 projections not affecting cocaine self-administration, despite their promotion of ICSS effects. This is particularly noteworthy considering the existing literature that highlights the behavioral contributions of Rspo2 neurons.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Neural projections from BLA to NAc have been implicated in both US and CS-dependent reinforcement in previous reports. The current experiments employ contemporary methods including opto- and chemogenetics to dissect the effects of two distinct neural projections from BLA to NAc on cue-dependent operant conditioning to ICSS and cocaine. The identification of contrasting functions for these two BLA glutamatergic projections to NAc median spiny neurons, both D1R and D2R, is a novel conceptual advance that may be relevant to the development of targeted therapeutics for addictive disorders. The Ppp1r1b+ BLA projection appears to be involved in the maintenance of longterm conditioning of the cocaine cue and in the incentive salience of this cue, whereas the Rspo2+ projection is involved in encoding the unconditioned reward. These studies would be strengthened by additional controls to further evaluate the function of the Ppp1r1b projection when both projections are concurrently activated during operant conditioning. Such a study might answer the following: Does a similar level of active presses resist extinction as observed following conditioning dependent only on activation of Ppp1r1b terminals? This could enhance the predictive value of the current model. The effects of additional extinction sessions, beyond the three studied in the ICSS model, might also be informative.</p><p>A. Please state the number of daily extinction sessions used during cocaine withdrawal in the d7, d21 and d45 reinstatement tests.</p><p>B. 500nl infusions into NAc are likely to infiltrate surrounding brain regions. Please show that the diffusion is limited to the NAc.</p><p>C. The statement in the Discussion regarding co-innervation of MSNs by both BLA projections needs further support. The results of random selection of MSN for electrophysiological evaluation in response to stimulation of each pathway could be due to alternative patterns of innervation: 1 pathway/1 MSN and/or 2 pathway/1MSN.</p><p>D. IF in fact the dominant innervation pattern is 2 pathways/1MSN, it is all the more important to understand the role of the Ppp1r1b pathway during extinction and reinstatement when both pathways are activated during operant conditioning.</p><p>E. Please discuss in greater detail the differences in the experimental models that yield opposite results regarding the role of BLA Rspo2+ neurons in appetitive vs aversive reinforcement. The current model largely excludes direct BLA-CEA projections by limiting activation to BLA Rspo2+ terminals in NAc. Hence, the current model may correctly identify the role of this pathway, but only in NAc-dependent appetitive reward.</p><p>F. The strong stimulation required of NAc terminals from both types of BLA projections for operant conditioning suggests, as the authors indicate, that other brain regions are concurrently activated by the laser stimulation of NAc. In this regard, VTA activation and release of DA in BLA may significantly affect PNs, especially the Ppp1r1b subset. Please discuss the implication of BLA DA-dependent modulation of the Ppp1r1b subset and the potential role of DA in incentive salience mediated by this BLA projection.</p><p>G. Although BLA Ppp1r1b projection fibers in NAc shell are more abundant than in core, as acknowledged by the authors, their data in Figure 1 (panels T and U) appears to suggest the converse: ChR2-eYFP fluorescence in Cartpt-core x D1-td Tomato mice is much greater in core fibers than shell.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.89766.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Strength</p><p>1.

We agree with the reviewer that sample sizes were relatively small (n = 9, 6, 6 or 7), and because of this, we did not intend to make quantitative comparisons. We previously stated that “for each of the subprojections, we recorded MSNs from both the NAc shell and core and did not detect preferential innervation of core versus shell MSNs.”</p><p>We now change the statement to:</p><p>“For each of the subprojections, we recorded reliable EPSCs in MSNs from both the NAc shell and core, indicating that these subprojections form functional glutamatergic synapses on both NAc shell and core MSNs.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Data transparency is somewhat lacking in the manuscript, as it does often not explicitly state the number of animals used in each experiment, and individual data points are infrequently presented.</p></disp-quote><p>We represented individual data points and reported both the number of recorded cells and number of animals (n/m, number of cells / number of animals) for all electrophysiological results. For behavioral results, because multiple sets of data were presented together over multiple days, there was no room to present individual data points within the graph. Alternatively, we provided the spreadsheets of individual data points in the Supplementary Material section for each figure panel such that readers can see individual data points if interested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The manuscript exhibits deficiencies in adequately presenting the statistical analysis employed for the experiments. Within the text and/or figure legends, there is a lack of clarity regarding the specific statistical tests applied to accommodate repeated days or sessions, such as during ICSS and extinction. Furthermore, the effects in relation to the day of withdrawal are not explicitly specified. The incorporation of post-hoc analyses is sparse, and it remains unclear whether statistical tests for repeated measures were employed.</p></disp-quote><p>This concern might be due to a misunderstanding, because we provided rather detailed statistical reports for all figure panels. Here are two example reports typically appeared in figure legends:</p><p>Rspo2-to-NAc (active lever press, F<sub>4,36</sub> = 1.2, p = 0.32; inactive lever press, F<sub>4,36</sub> = 1.5, p = 0.22; Infusion, F<sub>4,36</sub> = 1.5, p = 0.21; one-way ANOVA repeated measure; F). In this example, ANOVA test did not indicate a significant difference, so no posttest was performed.</p><p>Ppp1r1b-to-NAc (active lever press, F<sub>4,20</sub> = 1.5, p = 0.25; inactive lever press, F<sub>4,20</sub> = 0.4, p = 0.87; Infusion: F<sub>4,20</sub> = 1.8, p = 0.16, Tukey posttest, G). In this example, ANOVA test indicated a significant difference, so posttest was performed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. There appears to be an insufficient depth of discussion regarding the reasons behind the Rspo2 projections not affecting cocaine self-administration, despite their promotion of ICSS effects. This is particularly noteworthy considering the existing literature that highlights the behavioral contributions of Rspo2 neurons.</p></disp-quote><p>We added a brief discussion in the revised version of the manuscript to reflect the following speculation about Rspo2 BLA neurons. Briefly, by manipulating somatic activities, previous studies demonstrate that Rspo2 BLA neurons contribute to motivated behaviors. In the current study, our chemogenetic manipulation was confined to the presynaptic terminals of the two subprojections within the NAc. As such, a lack of behavioral effects in response to Rspo2 presynaptic terminals suggests that the established behavioral contributions of Rspo2 BLA neurons are mediated by the projections of Rspo2 BLA to other brain regions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Neural projections from BLA to NAc have been implicated in both US and CS-dependent reinforcement in previous reports. The current experiments employ contemporary methods including opto- and chemogenetics to dissect the effects of two distinct neural projections from BLA to NAc on cue-dependent operant conditioning to ICSS and cocaine. The identification of contrasting functions for these two BLA glutamatergic projections to NAc median spiny neurons, both D1R and D2R, is a novel conceptual advance that may be relevant to the development of targeted therapeutics for addictive disorders. The Ppp1r1b+ BLA projection appears to be involved in the maintenance of longterm conditioning of the cocaine cue and in the incentive salience of this cue, whereas the Rspo2+ projection is involved in encoding the unconditioned reward. These studies would be strengthened by additional controls to further evaluate the function of the Ppp1r1b projection when both projections are concurrently activated during operant conditioning. Such a study might answer the following: Does a similar level of active presses resist extinction as observed following conditioning dependent only on activation of Ppp1r1b terminals? This could enhance the predictive value of the current model. The effects of additional extinction sessions, beyond the three studied in the ICSS model, might also be informative.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the suggested experiments, which, as the reviewer indicated, will strengthen the conceptual model proposed in this study. We will incorporate these or similar experiments in our ongoing in vivo recording/imaging studies of the BLA and NAc in the context of cocaine seeking and extinction.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A. Please state the number of daily extinction sessions used during cocaine withdrawal in the d7, d21 and d45 reinstatement tests.</p></disp-quote><p>There was one session (1 h) of the extinction training on days 7, 21, and 45. This was stated in the Methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>B. 500nl infusions into NAc are likely to infiltrate surrounding brain regions. Please show that the diffusion is limited to the NAc.</p></disp-quote><p>We infused 500 nL of CNO solution into the NAc. It is technically difficult to trace this colorless chemical in the brain. Nonetheless, because CNO is a small molecule, it will diffuse to adjacent regions, with its concentration decreasing exponentially outside of the injection site. On the other hand, because CNO is expected to selectively affect DREADDs-expressing terminals enriched in the NAc. As such, it is a reasonable assumption that intra-NAc administration of 500 nL of CNO preferentially influenced DREADDs-expressing presynaptic terminals within the NAc.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>C. The statement in the Discussion regarding co-innervation of MSNs by both BLA projections needs further support. The results of random selection of MSN for electrophysiological evaluation in response to stimulation of each pathway could be due to alternative patterns of innervation: 1 pathway/1 MSN and/or 2 pathway/1MSN.</p></disp-quote><p>We revised the statement to better reflect the results:</p><p>“In our experiments, stimulation of Rspo2- or Ppp1r1b-to-NAc presynaptic fibers evokes EPSCs in most randomly sampled MSNs, suggesting co-innervation of individual MSNs by both BLA subprojections. However, the low-throughput feature of electrophysiology did not allow to generate large sample sizes and, thus, did not rule out other possible innervation patterns.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>D. IF in fact the dominant innervation pattern is 2 pathways/1MSN, it is all the more important to understand the role of the Ppp1r1b pathway during extinction and reinstatement when both pathways are activated during operant conditioning.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and we have hypotheses for this. Briefly, the Rspo2 and Ppp1r1b inputs generate different patterns of activation of NAc MSNs in behaving mice, and it is the different activity patterns that are correlate with different behavioral outputs. These experiments involve in vivo monitoring the neuronal activities in behaving mice and are being conducted in the lab for an independent project.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>E. Please discuss in greater detail the differences in the experimental models that yield opposite results regarding the role of BLA Rspo2+ neurons in appetitive vs aversive reinforcement. The current model largely excludes direct BLA-CEA projections by limiting activation to BLA Rspo2+ terminals in NAc. Hence, the current model may correctly identify the role of this pathway, but only in NAc-dependent appetitive reward.</p></disp-quote><p>We revised the related discussion to improve clarity.</p><p>“By manipulating somatic activities or projections to the central nucleus of amygdala, previous studies demonstrate opposite roles of Rspo2 and Ppp1r1b BLA neurons in appetitive versus aversive reinforcement. Our current study focuses on the BLA-to-NAc projection and pinpoints the differential roles of two major BLA-to-NAc subprojections in invigorating US- versus CS-mediated reinforcement.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>F. The strong stimulation required of NAc terminals from both types of BLA projections for operant conditioning suggests, as the authors indicate, that other brain regions are concurrently activated by the laser stimulation of NAc. In this regard, VTA activation and release of DA in BLA may significantly affect PNs, especially the Ppp1r1b subset. Please discuss the implication of BLA DA-dependent modulation of the Ppp1r1b subset and the potential role of DA in incentive salience mediated by this BLA projection.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for raising this interesting topic. We have the expertise and interest to provide additional discussions along this line. However, after a few tries, we realize that it may not be the most appropriate opportunity for this discussion for two main reasons. First, our current study is highly focused on glutamatergic projections without data related to dopamine. Second, we indeed attempted to draft a coherent and balanced discussion about the activation of VTA dopamine neurons by BLA neurons, the VTA dopamine projection to BLA, and potentially differential regulation of Ppp1r1b versus Rspo2 neurons in the BLA. It was rather lengthy and read detached from the central theme of this study. We thus did not include the suggested discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>G. Although BLA Ppp1r1b projection fibers in NAc shell are more abundant than in core, as acknowledged by the authors, their data in Figure 1 (panels T and U) appears to suggest the converse: ChR2-eYFP fluorescence in Cartpt-core x D1-td Tomato mice is much greater in core fibers than shell.</p></disp-quote><p>We presented Figure 1T and U to show that the Rspo2 and Ppp1r1b neurons projected to both the NAc shell and core, echoing our electrophysiological observation that synaptic responses in both shell and core MSNs were detected in response to the stimulation or Rspo2 or Ppp1r1b subprojections. We did not intend to quantify the differential innervation intensity based on fluorescence because many variables were involved determining the fluorescence density in the current experimental setup. For example, both Rspo2 and Ppp1r1b neurons may follow the same anterior-posterior topographic projection rule from the BLA to NAc shell versus core (discussed in the manuscript), exhibiting biased innervation of the NAc shell versus core, regardless of the cell type.</p><p>1.
