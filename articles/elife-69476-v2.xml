The conversion of 5-methylcytosine (5mC) into 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) initiates developmental and cell-type-specific transcriptional programs through mechanisms that include changes in the chromatin structure. Here, we show that the presence of 5hmC in the transcribed gene promotes the annealing of the nascent RNA to the template DNA strand, leading to the formation of an R-loop. Depletion of TET enzymes reduced global R-loops in the absence of gene expression changes, whereas CRISPR-mediated tethering of TET to an active gene promoted the formation of R-loops. The genome-wide distribution of 5hmC and R-loops shows a positive correlation in mouse and human stem cells and overlap in half of all active genes. Moreover, R-loop resolution leads to differential expression of a subset of genes that are involved in crucial events during stem cell proliferation. Altogether, our data reveal that epigenetic reprogramming via TET activity promotes co-transcriptional R-loop formation, disclosing new mechanisms of gene expression regulation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>R-loops</kwd><kwd>DNA hydroxymethylation</kwd><kwd>TET enzymes</kwd><kwd>gene expression</kwd><kwd>stem cells</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Fundação para a Ciência e Tecnologia, Portugal</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PTDC/BIA-MOL/30438/2017</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>de Almeida</surname><given-names>Sérgio Fernandes</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Fundação para a Ciência e Tecnologia, Portugal</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PTDC/MED-OUT/4301/2020</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>de Almeida</surname><given-names>Sérgio Fernandes</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100007601</institution-id><institution>EU Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RiboMed 857119</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>de Almeida</surname><given-names>Sérgio Fernandes</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Fundação para a Ciência e Tecnologia, Portugal</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PD/BD/128292/2017</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sabino</surname><given-names>João C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010434</institution-id><institution>La Caixa Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>LCF/PR/HP21/52310016</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Azzalin</surname><given-names>Claus M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>FCT</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PTDC/BIA-MOL/6624/2020</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Azzalin</surname><given-names>Claus M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>FCT</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PTDC/MED-ONC/7864/2020</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Azzalin</surname><given-names>Claus M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The deposition of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine epigenetic marks in active genes promotes the annealing of the nascent RNA to the template DNA strand, forming an R-loop.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>During transcription, the nascent RNA molecule can hybridize with the template DNA and form a DNA:RNA hybrid and a displaced DNA strand. These triple-stranded structures, called R-loops, are physiologically relevant intermediates of several processes, such as immunoglobulin class-switch recombination and gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">García-Muse and Aguilera, 2019</xref>). However, nonscheduled or persistent R-loops constitute an important source of DNA damage, namely, DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">García-Muse and Aguilera, 2019</xref>). To preserve genome integrity, cells possess diverse mechanisms to prevent the formation of R-loops or resolve them. R-loop formation is restricted by RNA-binding proteins and topoisomerase 1, whereas R-loops are removed by ribonucleases and helicases (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">García-Muse and Aguilera, 2019</xref>). The ribonuclease H enzymes RNase H1 and RNase H2 degrade R-loops by digesting the RNA strand of the DNA:RNA hybrid. DNA and RNA helicases unwind the hybrid and restore the double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) structure. Several helicases unwind R-loops at different stages of the transcription cycle and in distinct physiological contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">García-Muse and Aguilera, 2019</xref>). For instance, we previously reported that the DEAD-box helicase 23 (DDX23) resolves R-loops formed during transcription elongation to regulate gene expression programs and prevent transcription-dependent DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sridhara et al., 2017</xref>). Intrinsic features of the transcribed DNA also influence its propensity to form R-loops. The presence of introns, for instance, prevents unscheduled R-loop formation at active genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bonnet et al., 2017</xref>). An asymmetrical distribution of guanines (G) and cytosines (C) nucleotides in the DNA duplex also influences R-loop propensity, with an excess of Cs in the template DNA strand (positive G:C skew) favoring R-loop formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ginno et al., 2013</xref>). Moreover, chromatin and DNA features such as histone modifications, DNA-supercoiling, and G-quadruplex structures also affect R-loop establishment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">García-Muse and Aguilera, 2019</xref>). R-loops can also drive chromatin modifications. Promoter-proximal R-loops enhance the recruitment of the Tip60–p400 histone acetyltransferase complex and inhibit the binding of polycomb-repressive complex 2 and histone H3 lysine-27 methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2015</xref>). R-loops formed over G-rich terminator elements promote histone H3 lysine-9 dimethylation, a repressive mark that reinforces RNA polymerase II pausing during transcription termination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Skourti-Stathaki and Proudfoot, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chédin, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Skourti-Stathaki et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Besides affecting histone modifications, R-loops also act as barriers against DNA methylation spreading into active genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ginno et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ginno et al., 2012</xref>). DNA methylation, namely, 5-methylcytosine (5mC), results from the covalent addition of a methyl group to the carbon 5 of a C attached to a G through a phosphodiester bond (CpG) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Karpf, 2013</xref>). The activity of DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) enzymes makes 5mC widespread across the mammalian genome where it plays major roles in imprinting, retrotransposon silencing, and gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Greenberg and Bourc’his, 2019</xref>). More than 70% of all human gene promoters contain stretches of CpG dinucleotides, termed CpG islands (CGIs), whose transcriptional activity is repressed by CpG methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Greenberg and Bourc’his, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Weber et al., 2007</xref>). R-loops positioned near promoters of active genes maintain CGIs in an unmethylated state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ginno et al., 2012</xref>), likely by reducing the affinity of DNMT1 binding to DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Grunseich et al., 2018</xref>), or recruiting ten-eleven translocation (TET) methylcytosine dioxygenases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arab et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>The TET enzyme family members share the ability to oxidize 5mC to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pastor et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tahiliani et al., 2009</xref>). 5hmC is a relatively rare DNA modification found across the genome much less frequently than 5mC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mendonca et al., 2014</xref>). Genome-wide, 5hmC is more abundant at regulatory regions near transcription start sites (TSSs), promoters, and exons, consistent with its role in gene expression regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wu et al., 2011</xref>). The levels of 5hmC are enriched at active promoter regions, as observed upon activation of neuronal function-related genes in neural progenitors and neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pastor et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hahn et al., 2013</xref>). 5hmC has the potential to modify the DNA helix structure by favoring DNA-end breathing motion, a dynamic feature of the protein–DNA complexes thought to control DNA accessibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mendonca et al., 2014</xref>). Moreover, 5hmC weakens the interaction between DNA and nucleosomal H2A-H2B dimers, facilitating RNA polymerase II elongation, and diminishes the thermodynamic stability of the DNA duplex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mendonca et al., 2014</xref>). While 5mC increases the melting temperature, 5hmC reduces the amount of energy needed to separate the two strands of the DNA duplex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Leavitt et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wanunu et al., 2011</xref>). Molecular dynamics simulations revealed that the highest amplitude of GC DNA base-pair fluctuations is observed in the presence of 5hmC, whereas 5mC yielded GC base pairs (bp) with the lower amplitude values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wanunu et al., 2011</xref>). The presence of 5hmC destabilizes GC pairing by alleviating steric constraints through an increase in molecular polarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wanunu et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Because features that destabilize the DNA duplex, such as supercoiling or G-quadruplexes, are known to facilitate nascent RNA annealing with the template DNA strand, we reasoned that 5hmC may favor R-loop formation. Here, we show that 5hmC promotes R-loop formation during in vitro transcription of DNA templates. In vivo, depletion of TET enzymes reduces R-loop levels, whereas targeting the enzyme to an active gene drives R-loop formation. Analysis of genome-wide distribution profiles shows a positive correlation between 5hmC and R-loops in mouse embryonic stem (mES) and in human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells, with a clear overlap of 5hmC and R-loops in approximately half of all active genes. We also show that 5hmC-rich regions are characterized by increased levels of phosphorylated histone H2AX (γH2AX), a marker of DNA damage. Finally, by determining the pathways more significantly affected by R-loops formed at 5hmC loci, we disclose novel links between R-loops and gene expression programs of stem cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Transcription through 5hmC-rich DNA favors R-loop formation</title><p>To assess the impact of cytosine methylation on R-loop formation, we performed in vitro T7 transcription of DNA fragments containing either native or modified cytosine deoxyribonucleotides (dCTPs). We synthesized three distinct DNA transcription templates, each composed of a T7 promoter followed by a 400 bp sequence containing a genomic region prone to form R-loops in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sridhara et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Skourti-Stathaki et al., 2014</xref>). Two of these sequences (<italic>ACTB</italic> P1 and <italic>ACTB</italic> P2) are from the transcription termination region of the human β-actin coding gene (<italic>ACTB</italic>); the third sequence is from the human <italic>APOE</italic> gene. The DNA templates for the in vitro transcription reactions were generated by PCR-amplification in the presence of dNTPs containing either native C, 5mC, or 5hmC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Successful incorporation of dCTP variants was confirmed by immunoblotting using specific antibodies against each variant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The formation of R-loops during the in vitro transcription reactions was inspected by blotting immobilized RNAs with the S9.6 antibody (S9.6 Ab), which binds DNA:RNA hybrids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). To increase the specificity of hybrid detection, all samples were treated with RNase A in high-salt conditions in order to digest all RNA molecules except those engaged in R-loops. The specific detection of DNA:RNA hybrids was confirmed by blotting transcription reaction products previously digested with RNase H (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). In agreement with our hypothesis that 5hmC favors R-loops, increased amounts of DNA:RNA hybrids were detected in samples derived from in vitro transcription of 5hmC-rich <italic>ACTB</italic> P1, <italic>ACTB</italic> P2, and <italic>APOE</italic> DNA templates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). To exclude the possibility that our results were biased by an inherent preference of the S9.6 Ab for hybrids containing 5hmC, we performed electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) using the S9.6 Ab and DNA:RNA hybrid substrates of the same sequence but containing C, 5mC, or 5hmC. The S9.6 Ab was able to delay the run of the three substrates with similar kinetics, indicating that the Ab equally recognizes DNA:RNA hybrids formed with any of the three C variants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>5-Hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) favors co-transcriptional R-loop formation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Native or modified deoxyribonucleotides (dCTPs) were incorporated upon PCR amplification into DNA fragments with sequences from the transcription termination region of <italic>ACTB</italic> (<italic>ACTB</italic> P1 and <italic>ACTB</italic> P2) or <italic>APOE</italic>.

The frequency of these structures formed in the presence of C, 5hmC, or 5mC DNA templates was measured and normalized against the frequency formed in RNase H-treated samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). In agreement with the hypothesis that transcription of 5hmC-rich DNA templates results in increased R-loop formation, AFM data revealed that R-loop structures are more frequently formed in the presence of 5hmC.</p><p>To investigate if the DNA modification impacts in vitro transcription levels, we measured RNA synthesis from DNA templates containing unmodified C, 5hmC, or 5mC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). These data show that the T7 polymerase is highly sensitive to DNA modifications since replacing C by either 5hmC or 5mC significantly decreased the transcript levels in vitro. On one side, detecting more R-loops on a lower-transcription levels setting (i.e., 5hmC-rich templates) further strengthens our hypothesis that 5hmC increases R-loop formation. However, we cannot draw any conclusions regarding the impact of 5mC on R-loop formation as a putative effect on R-loop levels could be masked by the significantly altered transcription. To clarify this aspect and further test our model, we continued our study with experiments performed in vivo.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>TET enzymatic activity impacts endogenous R-loop levels</title><p>To test whether the 5hmC DNA modification induces R-loop formation in vivo, we quantified R-loop levels in mES cells after depletion of <italic>Tet1</italic>, <italic>Tet2,</italic> and <italic>Tet3</italic>.

No significant changes were observed in 5mC levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). This finding suggests that there is a partial redundancy in the activity of the three Tet enzymes in mES cells. The loss of Tet1 or Tet2 – but not of Tet3 – is compensated by the remaining Tets. In agreement with the hypothesis that 5hmC promotes R-loop formation, dot-blot hybridization of total cellular nucleic acids using the S9.6 Ab revealed reduced endogenous R-loop levels in mES cells after depletion of Tet3 and after co-depletion of the three Tet enzymes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). We also measured R-loop levels upon RNAi depletion of the Tet enzymes in NIH-3T3 mouse fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>).

The triple knockdown of the Tet enzymes significantly reduced the global levels of R-loops in mouse fibroblasts, whereas Tet3 depletion in these cells had a minor impact in R-loops (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B and D</xref>).

Data from in vitro transcription reactions and AFM provide direct evidence showing that transcription through 5hmC-rich DNA favors R-loop formation. By depleting TET enzymes in mES cells and fibroblasts, we demonstrate that TET activity increases cellular R-loop levels. Notably, the diminished levels of R-loops observed in TET-depleted cells did not result from impaired transcription, suggesting that 5hmC directly promotes R-loop formation. In agreement, tethering TET enzymes to a specific genomic locus using a CRISPR/Cas9-based system increases the levels of R-loops at the target locus.</p><p>As 5hmC is mostly absent from the TSS, other chromatin and DNA features (e.g., histone modifications, DNA-supercoiling or G-quadruplex structures; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">García-Muse and Aguilera, 2019</xref>) known to induce R-loop formation are likely to operate in these regions. In contrast, the robust overlap between R-loops and 5hmC at the TTS of active genes suggests a putative causal link. Mechanistically, 5hmC may impact R-loop formation by either destabilizing the DNA duplex or altering RNA polymerase II elongation rate. Indeed, 5hmC modifies the DNA helix structure by favoring DNA-end breathing motion, diminishes the thermodynamic stability of the DNA duplex, and destabilizes GC pairing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mendonca et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wanunu et al., 2011</xref>). It also weakens the interaction between DNA and nucleosomal histones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mendonca et al., 2014</xref>), which is thought to accelerate RNA polymerase II elongation but can also facilitate nascent RNA annealing with the template DNA strand favoring R-loop formation. Future studies will clarify which one of these mechanisms, if not all, contribute to the observed impact of 5hmC on R-loops.</p><p>Acting as a promoter of R-loops, well-established drivers of DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">García-Muse and Aguilera, 2019</xref>), 5hmC may indirectly harm genome integrity. Indeed, we found that 5hmC-rich loci are hotspots for DNA damage genome-wide. While such unscheduled R-loops formed at 5hmC-rich loci may threaten genomic integrity, regulated formation of R-loops at specific 5hmC-decorated loci may exert important regulatory roles. Indeed, R-loops play diverse physiological functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">García-Muse and Aguilera, 2019</xref>), such as the regulation of gene expression. Our findings that genome-wide 5hmC and R-loops overlap robustly at the TTS of active genes and that TET-deficiency drives transcription readthrough support a model whereby TET enzymes act upstream of R-loop formation during transcription termination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Skourti-Stathaki et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>TETs may play dual roles as both oncogenic and tumour suppressor genes, with the former arising as the consequence of altered expression levels or function, as observed in several cancers, such as triple-negative breast cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bray et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Good et al., 2018</xref>). In addition to altering the expression levels of tumour suppressors or oncogenes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bray et al., 2021</xref>), our findings suggest that TET-driven changes in the DNA methylation landscape may as well drive transcription-dependent genome damaging events that could facilitate cancer development and progression. In agreement with this view, a TET1 isoform that lacks regulatory domains, including its DNA-binding domain, but retains its catalytic activity, is enriched in cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Good et al., 2017</xref>), suggesting that mistargeted TET activity may drive oncogenic events, such as genomic instability. Conversely, TET activity deposits 5hmC at DNA damage sites induced by aphidicolin or microirradiation in HeLa cells and prevents chromosome segregation defects in response to replication stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kafer et al., 2016</xref>). While the role that TETs play during carcinogenesis is not yet clear, the impact of 5hmC on stem cell differentiation and development has been extensively studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ficz et al., 2011</xref>). By driving the developmental DNA methylome reprogramming, TETs carry out numerous functions related to early developmental processes. Here, we disclose a putative new role for R-loops as mediators of 5hmC-driven gene expression programs in stem cells. Our gene ontology analysis revealed that R-loops formed at 5hmC-rich regions impact the expression of genes involved in establishing diapause. This stage of temporary suspension of embryonic development is triggered by adverse environmental conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fenelon et al., 2014</xref>). Accordingly, changes in the activity of mTOR, a major nutrient sensor, control ES cell commitment to trigger diapause (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bulut-Karslioglu et al., 2016</xref>). The mTOR signaling pathway was significantly downregulated upon global R-loop suppression by RNase H. Conversely, MYC targets, which prevent ES cells from entering the state of dormancy that characterizes diapause (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Scognamiglio et al., 2016</xref>), were amongst the genes more significantly upregulated upon RNase H overexpression in mES cells. These cells also displayed reduced expression levels of genes related to pluripotency (<italic>Pou5f1</italic>) and germ layer commitment (Sox17, Sox6, Dll1) pathways. Whether the controlled 5hmC-driven formation of R-loops at specific genes drives stem cells fate and how do TET enzymes capture the environmental cues to target R-loop formation at selected genes are important questions that emerge from our findings. Our study sets the ground for further research aimed at investigating the role of R-loops in ES cells.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell lines and culture conditions</title><p>E14TG2a (E14) mES cells were provided by Domingos Henrique (Instituto de Medicina Molecular João Lobo Antunes) and were a gift from Austin Smith (University of Exeter, UK) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Smith and Hooper, 1987</xref>). 129S4/SvJae (J1) mES cells were kindly provided by Joana Marques (Medical School, University of Porto).

All read counts were normalized by the number of mapped reads (RPKM).</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Formal analysis, Methodology, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Formal analysis, Methodology, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Formal analysis</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Formal analysis</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Formal analysis, Methodology, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Formal analysis, Methodology, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Formal analysis, Methodology, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Software, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Project administration, Supervision, Writing - original draft</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec id="s6" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>Differentially expressed genes upon RNase H overexpression.</title></caption><media mime-subtype="xlsx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-69476-supp1-v2.xlsx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp2"><label>Supplementary file 2.</label><caption><title>Oligonucleotides and antibodies used in the study.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) shRNA sequences.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Jessica Tyler as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Figure 1: These in vitro transcription experiments indicate that 5hmC modified DNA has a somewhat greater tendency (at most two-fold) to form R-loops. My serious worry here is that the S9.6 antibody must be biochemically tested to rule out that it has an inherent binding preference for 5hmcDNA:RNA hybrids over either DNA:RNA or 5mcDNA:RNA. Such a preference might explain the apparent selectivity for 5hmC modification in favoring R-loop formation? S9.6 antibody is well known to recognize RNA:RNA as well as RNA:DNA hybrids. Consequently 5hmcDNA:RNA should also be tested. It is hard to evaluate how quantitative is the independent atomic force microscopy method to evaluate R-loop levels. Clearly detecting these blob, spur and loop structures may be somewhat subjective.</p><p>2) Figure 2: These data showing either depletion of Tet1 or Tet3 (by RNAi) or the targeted dCAS9 tethering of Tet1 to the R-loop enriched APOE gene, all point to some effect of 5hmcDNA levels on R-loop formation. However again the effects observed are modest (less than 2 fold). Why Tet2 isn't also tested and indeed why a triple knock depletion of Tet<sub>1/2</sub>/3 isn't attempted as the small effects of single Tet mRNA depletions may be due to redundancy between these three mC oxidases.</p><p>3) It would be important to see the screen shot of of the whole APOE gene following CRISPR targeting of Tet1 to be sure that the effect is specific for its last exon and that Tet1 tethering is having a localized effect just on this region of the APOE gene.</p><p>4) Figure 1 and 2: In order to strengthen the results, it is important to provide statistical significance in the experiment shown. The authors should also demonstrate that 5hmC modification has no impact in the transcription levels in the in vitro model and in APOE gene upon dCAS-TET1 targeting. Considering the effect of 5hmC on the double helix stability, all the observations could be connected to a facilitation of RNA Pol II elongation in the investigated regions. Moreover, a more correct approach of normalization of dot blot signals is recommended. Normalization should be performed on dsDNA signal obtained from the same exact membrane of the signal of interest stripped and probed again.</p><p>5) Figure 3: These genomic data are quite compelling. However, the correspondence of 5hmcDNA peaks with TTS R-loops but nor TSS R-loops is surprising and needs further discussion, if not further experimental analysis. For example, does Tet deficiency lead to transcription termination/readthrough defects genome wide?</p><p>6) A genome-wide analysis of DNA-RNA hybrids in cells depleted of shTet1 or shTet3 depleted cells is required, so that experimental data could be jointly analyzed with the database to confirm the model and the role of TET in the process defined. Alternatively, a significant number of genes could be validated by DRIP-qPCR to show that TET depletion significantly increases hybrids.</p><p>7) A snapshot showing the distribution pattern of one or two long chromosomal regions should be provided to see how coincident are the patterns of R loops and 5hmeC.</p><p>8) The metagenomic analysis is made on genes with 5hmC and R loops. However, results should also be shown considering peaks to see a more precise association between better defined regions.</p><p>9) It would be important to show that transcription at individual genes identified as R loop accumulating after TET depletion is indeed unaffected. Since TET-depletion causes downregulation and upregulation of genes, it is not possible to make conclusions with just global EU incorporation, in which among other issues, it is unclear the impact on the nucleolus contribute to the signal measured.</p><p>10) Figure 4: the quality of the PLA figures needs to be improved.

My serious worry here is that the S9.6 antibody must be biochemically tested to rule out that it has an inherent binding preference for 5hmcDNA:RNA hybrids over either DNA:RNA or 5mcDNA:RNA. Such a preference might explain the apparent selectivity for 5hmC modification in favoring R-loop formation? S9.6 antibody is well known to recognize RNA:RNA as well as RNA:DNA hybrids. Consequently 5hmcDNA:RNA should also be tested. It is hard to evaluate how quantitative is the independent atomic force microscopy method to evaluate R-loop levels. Clearly detecting these blob, spur and loop structures may be somewhat subjective.</p></disp-quote><p>The possibility that the S9.6 Ab has an inherent binding preference for 5hmC DNA:RNA hybrids, is indeed very relevant for our study. To address this, we performed an EMSA with increasing Ab:hybrids molar ratio. The quantification of the amount of “free” hybrids in the native gel revealed that the Ab is equally competent to bind DNA:RNA hybrids formed with any of the three C variants. These new data are shown in Figure 1 —figure supplement 1.</p><p>R-loop structures in AFM data were defined as in Carrasco-Salas et al.,. The threedimensional architectures resulting from R-loop formation in vitro were quantified in the three experimental conditions (native C, 5hmC and 5mC DNA templates). We now provide a more careful description of these aspects in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Figure 2: These data showing either depletion of Tet1 or Tet3 (by RNAi) or the targeted dCAS9 tethering of Tet1 to the R-loop enriched APOE gene, all point to some effect of 5hmcDNA levels on R-loop formation. However again the effects observed are modest (less than 2 fold). Why Tet2 isn't also tested and indeed why a triple knock depletion of Tet<sub>1/2</sub>/3 isn't attempted as the small effects of single Tet mRNA depletions may be due to redundancy between these three mC oxidases.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, we measured the R-loop levels in Tet2-KD and Tet<sub>1/2</sub>/3 triple-KD mouse ES cells (Figure 2A,B). In addition, we measured the levels of R-loops formed in mouse fibroblasts after depletion of each of the three Tet enzymes and after triple-KD experiments (Figure 2 —figure supplement 2C,D). These new data show that the strongest effect on R-loop levels is observed upon the triple KD, supporting the view that there is redundancy between the activity of the three Tet enzymes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) It would be important to see the screen shot of of the whole APOE gene following CRISPR targeting of Tet1 to be sure that the effect is specific for its last exon and that Tet1 tethering is having a localized effect just on this region of the APOE gene.</p></disp-quote><p>We measured R-loop levels at different regions of the APOE gene, as suggested. The new data are shown in Figure 2F. While the most significant increase in the levels of R-loops was observed at the locus targeted by the dCas9, we also noticed augmented levels throughout the gene. This effect is consistent with the detection of 5hmC along the entire gene and not only at the dCas9-TET1 target locus (Figure 2E). While this may result in part from the lack of resolution of the DRIP assay to isolate distinct regions of the quite small (3,6 kbp) APOE gene, it also raises the hypothesis that R-loops can spread upstream and downstream from their inception site in a zipper-like mechanism that would result in the several hundred base-pair-long structures, which have been detected genome wide in several studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Figure 1 and 2: In order to strengthen the results, it is important to provide statistical significance in the experiment shown. The authors should also demonstrate that 5hmC modification has no impact in the transcription levels in the in vitro model and in APOE gene upon dCAS-TET1 targeting. Considering the effect of 5hmC on the double helix stability, all the observations could be connected to a facilitation of RNA Pol II elongation in the investigated regions. Moreover, a more correct approach of normalization of dot blot signals is recommended. Normalization should be performed on dsDNA signal obtained from the same exact membrane of the signal of interest stripped and probed again.</p></disp-quote><p>To investigate if the 5hmC modification impacts transcription levels in the in vitro model, we measured RNA synthesis from C-, 5hmC- or 5mC-containing DNA templates through RNA column-purification. To test the impact of 5hmC in transcription of the APOE gene upon dCAS-TET1 targeting we quantified RNA synthesis by RT-qPCR. These new data are shown in Figure 1 —figure supplement 2 and Figure 2G. The statistical significance is now provided for all these experiments. These data support our conclusion that increased Rloop levels do not result from increased transcription of 5hmC-marked DNA.</p><p>As suggested, the dot blot signals in Figure 2 —figure supplement 1B and Figure 2 —figure supplement 2B are now normalized against the dsDNA signal obtained from the same exact membrane of the signal of interest after stripping and re-probing.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Figure 3: These genomic data are quite compelling. However, the correspondence of 5hmcDNA peaks with TTS R-loops but nor TSS R-loops is surprising and needs further discussion, if not further experimental analysis. For example, does Tet deficiency lead to transcription termination/readthrough defects genome wide?</p></disp-quote><p>This is a very interesting point and we thank the reviewers for the suggestion. In the revised manuscript we include the results of the analysis of RNA-seq data from human embryonic stem cells. As predicted from the observed correspondence between R-loops and 5hmC at the TTS, we observed increased levels of transcription readthrough in several loci upon TET1 depletion. These novel data are shown in Figure 3G.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) A genome-wide analysis of DNA-RNA hybrids in cells depleted of shTet1 or shTet3 depleted cells is required, so that experimental data could be jointly analyzed with the database to confirm the model and the role of TET in the process defined. Alternatively, a significant number of genes could be validated by DRIP-qPCR to show that TET depletion significantly increases hybrids.</p></disp-quote><p>Following the reviewers’ suggestion, we analyzed R-loops levels in a panel of genes upon Tet<sub>1/2</sub>/3 triple-KD in mouse ES cells. Moreover, we have also performed this DRIP-qPCR assay in mouse fibroblasts. As shown in the new Figure2C and Figure 2 —figure supplement 2E, there is a significant reduction of R-loops levels in Tet-depleted cells. Importantly, this reduction is not caused by diminished transcription levels, as shown in the new Figure 2D and Figure 2 —figure supplement 2F.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) A snapshot showing the distribution pattern of one or two long chromosomal regions should be provided to see how coincident are the patterns of R loops and 5hmeC.</p></disp-quote><p>The distribution pattern of R-loops and 5hmC along two long chromosomal regions are now shown in the new Figure 3 —figure supplement 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) The metagenomic analysis is made on genes with 5hmC and R loops. However, results should also be shown considering peaks to see a more precise association between better defined regions.</p></disp-quote><p>The metagenomic analysis was performed using enriched regions from 5hmC and R-loops (i.e. peaks) and assessing their overlap. Then, the overlapping regions were mapped to genes to summarize their occupation in functionally relevant regions. The Methods section was rewritten to clarify this point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) It would be important to show that transcription at individual genes identified as R loop accumulating after TET depletion is indeed unaffected. Since TET-depletion causes downregulation and upregulation of genes, it is not possible to make conclusions with just global EU incorporation, in which among other issues, it is unclear the impact on the nucleolus contribute to the signal measured.</p></disp-quote><p>We performed RT-qPCR to measure transcription of the genes where we assessed the Rloop levels upon Tet depletion. These data (Figure 2D and Figure 2 —figure supplement 2F) show that Tet activity impacts R-loop levels independently of changes in the transcription rate. Following the reviewers concerns about the global EU incorporation experiments, and since we now measure transcription using RT-qPCR, we have removed EU incorporation data from the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) Figure 4: the quality of the PLA figures needs to be improved. Higher magnification and better resolution in the Z axis are crucial. The signal is not nuclear. Treating cells with a combination of RNAseIII+RNAseT1 might improve specificity of S9.6 antibody. RNaseH control for S9.6 antibody signal should also be provided.</p></disp-quote><p>We now show PLA images with higher quality. We also include the RNase H control and quantified the PLA foci per nucleus in all experimental conditions. These data are shown in Figure 4 and reveal the specificity of the PLA signal observed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) Figure 6: The analysis proposed is mainly focused on the contribution of R-loops modulation in mES transcription program, rather than the effect of 5hmC modulation.

Yet, in this revised manuscript we present additional data further strengthening the hypothesis that R-loops (eventually a 5hmC/R-loops axis) impinge on the regulation of gene expression programs related to pluripotency and germ layer commitment pathways in mES cells (Figure 6D).</p></body></sub-article></article>
