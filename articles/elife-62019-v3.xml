targeted by T cell receptor (TCR)-based adoptive T cell therapy. Based on a spliced peptide prediction algorithm, TCRs were generated against putative KRAS<sup>G12V</sup>- and RAC2<sup>P29L</sup>-derived neo-splicetopes with high HLA-A*02:01 binding affinity. TCRs generated in mice with a diverse human TCR repertoire specifically recognized the respective target peptides with high efficacy. However, we failed to detect any neo-splicetope-specific T cell response when testing the in vivo neo-splicetope generation and obtained no experimental evidence that the putative KRAS<sup>G12V</sup>- and RAC2<sup>P29L</sup>-derived neo-splicetopes were naturally processed and presented. Furthermore, only the putative RAC2<sup>P29L</sup>-derived neo-splicetopes was generated by in vitro PCPS.

An important step in defining the proteasome as HLA class I epitope generation machine was the early observation that purified 20S proteasomes in combination with synthetic polypeptide substrates encompassing the epitope of interest reproduced the in vivo generation of these epitopes with high fidelity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Boes et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Guillaume et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Kessler et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Niedermann et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">van der Bruggen and Van den Eynde, 2006</xref>). Thus, in vitro antigen processing experiments in combination with specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells to monitor HLA class I binding and immune recognition are a widely used reliable tool to verify the generation efficiency of antigenic peptides of viral, bacterial, and human origin.</p><p>Our view on antigen processing was significantly extended by analysis of cancer patient-derived CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells revealing that by proteasome-catalyzed peptide splicing (PCPS) proteasomes can also fuse excised peptide fragments in a reverse proteolysis reaction, thereby generating new immune reactive spliced epitopes (splicetopes) with an amino acid sequence that differs from that of the substrate protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Hanada et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Vigneron et al., 2004</xref>). The isolation of splicetope-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells from cancer patients and the finding that splicetope-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells derived from tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) inhibited the engraftment of human acute myeloid leukemia cells in SCID mice indicated the potential immune relevance of such tumor antigen-derived splicetopes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Robbins et al., 1994</xref>).</p><p>Importantly, for the fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-5 and several splicetopes derived from the tumor differentiation antigen gp100mel, in vitro proteasome splicing reactions were also found to mimic the in vivo splicing reactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Ebstein et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Warren et al., 2006</xref>), suggesting that in vitro PCPS reactions may be a useful tool to discover new spliced epitopes generated from tumor antigens of interest. To be able to identify splicetopes in in vitro PCPS experiments independent of the availability of patient-derived CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, we developed the prediction algorithms ProteaJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Liepe et al., 2010</xref>) and the here-described ProtAG. Using these algorithms, we established an inclusion list of potentially immune-relevant spliced peptides theoretically generated from a given antigen, which in combination with the mass spectrometric analysis of the in vitro digest should allow the identification of new splicetopes. Testing the feasibility of such an algorithm-aided ‘reverse immunology’ approach, we had isolated CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells from <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic>–infected mice that specifically recognized two phospholipase PlcB-derived splicetopes generated by the proteasome in vitro and in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Platteel et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Targeting somatic cancer-specific driver mutations derived from neoantigens by TCR-mediated adoptive T cell transfer (ATT) represents a promising approach for personalized cancer therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Blankenstein et al., 2015</xref>). One drawback of this approach is that often neoepitopes may not exhibit HLA class I binding affinities sufficient to trigger an efficient T cell response or not be generated efficiently by the proteasome. In fact, even if a suitable neoepitope is generated, its HLA haplotype specificity frequently does not match with the patient's HLA class I allele, consequently excluding these tumor patients from ATT.</p><p>As outlined above, taking advantage of PCPS for the identification of spliced neoepitopes (neo-splicetopes) may therefore represent an interesting approach to identify suitable TCR targets when the recurrent somatic mutations in a tumor antigen do not result in the production of a non-spliced tumor neoepitope either exhibiting a sufficient HLA class I binding affinity or the appropriate HLA class I haplotype. Furthermore, due to the ligation of two distant generated peptide fragments PCPS not only possesses the interesting potential to generate high-affinity neo-splicetopes harboring the respective somatic mutation but also to extend the HLA haplotype diversity of epitopes generated from a given neoantigen.</p><p>In a proof-of-principle ‘reverse immunology’ study, we here identified HLA-A*02:01 restricted putative neo-splicetopes predicted by spliced peptide prediction algorithm derived from the two recurrent somatic mutations KRAS<sup>G12V</sup> and RAC2<sup>P29L</sup>. TCRs specific for the putative neo-splicetopes were generated in huTCR-α/huTCR-β gene loci transgenic HLA-A*02:01 mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Li et al., 2010</xref>). TCRs recognized the respective putative neo-splicetope with high efficacy when tested in vitro. However, we failed to detect a neo-splicetope-specific T cell response when testing the in vivo (in cellulo) generation of the predicted neo-splicetopes and thus failed to gain evidence that the two KRAS<sup>G12V</sup> and RAC2<sup>P29L</sup>derived neo-splicetopes were also generated in vivo as predicted by algorithm-aided studies. In addition, only the predicted neo-splicetope for RAC2<sup>P29L</sup> could be confirmed by in vitro proteasomal digest. The experiments pose severe questions on the applicability of the previously highlighted pipeline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Mishto et al., 2019</xref>) for the identification of immune-relevant neo-splicetopes.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Prediction of KRAS<sup>G12V</sup>-derived neo-splicetope</title><p>KRAS is one of the most frequently mutated genes in human cancer with the G12X (X = V, S, D, A, C) substitution accounting for most of the mutations found in this position. However, none of these mutations result in the formation of a non-spliced (linear) high-affinity HLA-A*02:01 binding neoepitope (IC50 &lt;100 nM). Since KRAS harbors the oncogenic mutation G12V in approximately 30% of pancreatic ductal adeno carcinoma and 20% of the colon and non-small cell lung cancers, we used the algorithm ProtAG for theoretical prediction of spliced peptides delineated from the KRAS<sup>G12V</sup><sub>2-35</sub> protein sequence. The algorithm-predicted spliced 9mer peptides were submitted to netMHCpan 4.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Jurtz et al., 2017</xref>) to screen for putative neo-splicetopes with predicted HLA-A*02:01 binding affinity IC50 &lt;100 nM and carrying the mutant V<sub>12</sub> amino acid residue.

Thus, polypeptide substrates with mistakes in their sequence that are degraded at a rate similar to the rate of the correct substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5C</xref>) may become a prevalent source for the generation of faked spliced peptides.

To search for spliced peptides, a fasta data file generated with ProtAG was loaded onto PD2.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Willimsky et al., 2021</xref>).

Supporting that RAC2<sup>P29L</sup><sub>28-34/36-37</sub> was generated via precursor peptides, we also detected the corresponding N-terminal splice acceptor peptide RAC2<sup>P29L</sup><sub>28-34</sub> (FLGEYIP) and the C-terminal splice donor peptide RAC2<sup>P29L</sup><sub>36-40</sub> (VFDNY) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>).

For analysis of in vivo generation and presentation of the spliced RAC2<sup>P29L</sup><sub>28-34/36-37</sub> peptide, we transduced Mel21a cells to express a triple RAC2<sup>P29L</sup><sub>1-45</sub> 45mer polypeptide minigene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>) and monitored HLA-A*02:01 epitope presentation by T cell recognition.

We also raised a TCR (TCR<sub>22894</sub>) in ABabDII mice against the linear RAC2<sup>P29L</sup> peptide.

We repeated the experiments with TCR-engineered mouse T cells derived from TCR1xCD45.1xRag1<sup>-/-</sup> mouse splenocytes (expressing a monoclonal irrelevant TCR against SV40 large T) to monitor RAC2<sup>P29L</sup><sub>28-34/36-37</sub> peptide cell surface expression using mouse NIH-HHD cells expressing a chimeric HLA-A02:01 (HHD) molecule.

More importantly, again the spliced peptide-specific TCR<sub>20967A2</sub> did not confer any reactivity to T cells upon co-culture without prior peptide loading of the target cells or overexpression of the spliced epitope (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B–D</xref>). Quantitative PCR analysis of the triple RAC2<sup>P29L</sup><sub>1-45</sub> 45mer polypeptide minigene and RAC2<sup>P29L</sup> triple epitope spliced nonamer expressed in mouse NIH-HHD cells revealed that RAC2<sup>P29L</sup><sub>1-45</sub> 45mer polypeptide minigene is expressed almost fivefold higher than the RAC2<sup>P29L</sup> triple epitope spliced nonamer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>).

Thus, even high-affinity peptides, if embedded in a non-favorable protein sequence, will not surpass the necessary threshold for eliciting a T cell response.</p><p>The cleavage properties of proteasomes have been intensively studied. However, due to the complexity of protein sequences and lacking information on cleavage strength that decisively determines epitope generation efficiency, algorithms predicting proteasomal generation of immune-relevant non-spliced epitopes still do not reach prediction efficiencies sufficient for large-scale ‘reverse immunology’ approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Calis et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Di Carluccio et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Singh and Mishra, 2016</xref>). Thus, many predicted epitopes may be false-positives, which could impede immunotherapy, for example, neoantigen vaccines. Prediction algorithms for spliced epitopes, which are based on protein sequence and proteasomal cleavage properties, do not even yet exist.</p><p>Therefore, in vitro generation of epitopes using purified 20S proteasomes and synthetic polypeptide substrates encompassing the epitope(s) of interest, in combination with mass spectrometric analyses and both in vitro and in vivo CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell assays, still represents the most frequently used tool to validate the generation of immune-relevant non-spliced peptides, assuming that it closely simulates the in vivo (<italic>in cellulo</italic>) situation with respect to both quality and relative amounts of the epitope (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Kessler et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kessler and Melief, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Sijts and Kloetzel, 2011</xref>).</p><p>While a number of virus- or tumor-derived non-spliced epitopes have been validated by in vitro experiments and correlated to the in vivo situation, examples for spliced HLA class I epitopes are still very limited. Nevertheless, what applied to non-spliced epitopes also seemed to be valid for spliced HLA class I epitopes generated in vitro by PCPS. Thus, FGF-5, SP110, and several gp100-derived spliced epitopes that are recognized by CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells on the cell surface were demonstrated to be produced also in in vitro PCPS assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Ebstein et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Vigneron et al., 2019</xref>). Although in these cases the generation efficiency of spliced epitopes in in vitro PCPS assays seemed to be in line with the in vivo situation, it should be noted, however, that the abundance of spliced epitopes presented at the cell surface is a matter of substantial controversy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Liepe et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Liepe et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Mylonas et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Paes et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Rolfs et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, in light of recent reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Mylonas et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Rolfs et al., 2019</xref>) the amount of cell surface-presented spliced epitope seems to be considerably less than initially estimated.</p><p>On the other hand and supporting a potential immune relevance, the initial discovery of the splicing event and spliced epitopes was based on the identification of patient-derived CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells reactive towards spliced epitopes generated from tumor antigens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Hanada et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Vigneron et al., 2004</xref>). Widespread identification of spliced epitopes is however limited by the rare availability of corresponding specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. Therefore, we developed prediction algorithms allowing the mass spectrometric identification of predicted and in vitro proteasome-generated spliced peptides. Indeed, applying such an algorithm-aided ‘reverse immunology’ approach successfully led previously to the identification of two spliced phospholipase PlcB epitopes that primed antigen-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic>-infected mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Platteel et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Because somatic mutations in tumor antigens frequently do not result in the generation of neoepitopes suitable for generation of TCRs for ATT therapy, we applied spliced peptide prediction algorithms to identify neo-splicetopes with HLA-A*02:01 binding affinity predicted to be generated from the mutant tumor antigens KRAS<sup>G12V</sup> and RAC2<sup>P29L</sup> and used those for TCR generation.</p><p>In vitro PCPS experiments in combination with MS analysis aiming at the identification of the algorithm-predicted putative KRAS<sup>G12V</sup>-derived neo-splicetopes, however, gave no final evidence for their in vitro generation. In the initial kinetic splicing reactions, we seemed to have identified the predicted spliced peptides, thereby corroborating also data obtained with a KRAS<sup>G12V</sup><sub>2-35</sub> polypeptide substrate reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Mishto et al., 2019</xref>.</p><p>However, we found that most likely the extreme hydrophobicity of the KRAS amino acid composition had led to faulty polypeptide synthesis, resulting in polypeptide substrates mimicking in sequence the results of the predicted splicing reaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Considering that in general the generation of spliced peptides is significantly less efficient than that of non-spliced peptides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), even minor amounts of faulty peptide substrates will become prevalent in in vitro splicing reactions (see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5B</xref>). Because high-quality peptide synthesis reaches a purity of 95–99% at most, a thorough substrate analysis appears essential to avoid false-positive results in in vitro PCPS experiments, particularly for chemically difficult substrates. However, when we used a newly synthesized KRAS<sup>G12V</sup> substrate not contaminated with peptides mimicking the KRAS<sup>G12V</sup><sub>5-8/9-14</sub> and KRAS<sup>G12V</sup><sub>5-10/12-14</sub> splicing reactions, we failed to identify the in silico-predicted neo-splicetope. This negative result cannot finally prove the non-existence of the KRAS<sup>G12V</sup><sub>5-8/9-14</sub> and KRAS<sup>G12V</sup><sub>5-10/12-14</sub>, but being in line with the in vivo experiments, one has to conclude that if these KRAS<sup>G12V</sup>-derived spliced epitopes are generated, then their amount is below detectable level. In contrast to the negative results obtained with respect to KRAS<sup>G12V</sup>, the analysis of RAC2<sup>P29L</sup> led to the identification of the in silico-predicted RAC2<sup>P29L</sup><sub>28-34/36-37</sub> peptide in in vitro PCPS experiments. Nevertheless, the putative RAC2<sup>P29L</sup><sub>28-34/36-37</sub> neo-splicetope was generated significantly less efficient than the non-spliced RAC2<sup>P29L</sup><sub>28-36</sub> neoepitope.</p><p>Testing the in vivo generation of the spliced KRAS<sup>G12V</sup><sub>5-8/10-14</sub> and RAC2<sup>P29L</sup><sub>28-34/36-37</sub> peptides using the respective peptide-specific TCRs, which were of high affinity and recognized as little as 10<sup>−10</sup> M peptide, we obtained no T cell signal and no evidence for the immune relevance of the two candidate neo-splicetopes, independent of the experimental conditions. Our experiments provide no evidence that either KRAS<sup>G12V</sup><sub>5-8/10-14</sub> or RAC2<sup>P29L</sup><sub>28-34/36-37</sub> are produced in vivo or presented at the cell surface. However, even in case both neo-splicetopes were generated in vivo, their generation efficiency and the total amount presented by HLA-A*02:01 molecules on the cell surface are too low to be of any immune significance. One possible explanation for the failure to verify the in vitro PCPS reaction for RAC2<sup>P29L</sup><sub>28-34/36-37</sub> in in vivo settings could be the high substrate and proteasome concentration as used for in vitro PCPS, thereby forcing splicing reactions that do either not or only inefficiently occur under in vivo conditions where only a single substrate protein enters the catalytic cavity of the proteasome for processing at a given time.</p><p>Thus, quite in contrast to the experience resulting from proteasome-dependent processing of non-spliced epitopes in vitro, in vitro generation of spliced epitopes by PCPS may not exhibit the same fidelity and does not always simulate the efficacy of in vivo spliced epitope generation. This of course strongly questions the general application of the recently highlighted experimental pipeline for the identification of cancer-specific neo-splicetopes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Mishto et al., 2019</xref>). Reconsidering the workflow for the identification of neo-splicetopes, it thus seems that in vitro PCPS even when combined with peptide binding and TAP transport assays are not sufficient for the prediction of their immune relevance. We therefore believe that it is mandatory to first prove the cell surface presentation of algorithm-predicted candidate neo-splicetopes, either in humanized mice under conditions requiring processing and presentation or by peptide elution experiments, before TCR generation. Our data also support the notion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Mylonas et al., 2018</xref>) that the frequency of spliced epitopes is largely overestimated.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Peptides, proteasome, and PCPS</title><p>The polypeptides substrates KRAS<sup>G12V</sup><sub>2-14</sub> (BIH 107) (<named-content content-type="sequence">TEYKLVVVGAVGV</named-content>), KRAS<sup>G12V</sup><sub>2-21</sub> (Kloe 1178) (<named-content content-type="sequence">TEYKLVVVGAVGVGKSALTI</named-content>), KRAS<sup>G12V</sup><sub>2-32</sub>(<named-content content-type="sequence">TEYKLVVVGAVGVGKSALTIQLIQNHFVDEY</named-content>), KRAS<sup>G12V</sup><sub>2-35</sub>(<named-content content-type="sequence">TEYKLVVVGAVGVGKSALTIQLIQNHFVDEYDPT</named-content>), as well as the RAC2<sup>P29L</sup><sub>20-44</sub> (BIH 5) polypeptide substrate (<named-content content-type="sequence">LISYTTNAFLGEYIPTVFDNYSANV</named-content>) were synthesized by the core facility of the Institute of Biochemistry (Dr. Petra Henklein) using standard Fmoc (<italic>N</italic>-(9-fluorenyl) methoxycarbonyl) methodology (0.1 mmol) on an Applied Biosystems 433A automated synthesizer.

The peaks of the MS intensity profile were approximated by Gaussian functions. Goodness of fit was used as one criterion for assessing the reliability of a mass peak. Only peaks above a user-defined noise threshold were compiled together with their HPLC retention times. The likelihood for correctly assigning a peptide to an MS peak was scored by the correspondence between computational and experimental values for peptide mass, occurrence of expected <italic>m/z</italic> values, similarity of retention times, and tandem MS/MS data. Chemically modified peptides (e.g., by oxidation) were identified by adding to the theoretical mass the masses of possible modifiers. Such modified peptides were included into the list of identified peptides only if the non-modified peptide could also be identified. After assigning the MS peaks to all direct or chemically modified fragments that theoretically can be derived from the protein substrate by one or multiple cleavages, a group of significant but ‘unexplained’ MS peaks remains, which may represent possible spliced products, that is, peptides composed of fragments distant in the parental protein substrate. The likelihood for correctly assigning a splice peptide to unexplained MS peaks was computed in the same way as for conventional peptides, including the additional criterion, that the two fragments merged together in the presumed splice peptide were also present in the set of identified conventional peptides.</p><p>Proteasomal cleavage products (PCP) of a substrate peptide can clearly be described by the numbers of the first and last amino acid within the substrate: P(i,j) denominates the peptide of length j-i +1 starting with amino acid i and ending with amino acid j. Proteasomal splice products (PSP) consist of two such fragments, therefore denominated by SP(i,j,k,l), consisting of the peptides P(i,j) and P(k,l) and having a length of (j + l-i-k + 2). They can be in normal order (i &lt; j &lt; k &lt; l), inverse order (k &lt; l &lt; i &lt; j), or overlapping. Overlapping splice product means that there exists a position m that is both part of P(i,j) and P(k,l), therefore max(i,j) &lt;= min(j,l), meaning that the splice product consists of parts of two substrate peptides.</p><p>Splice peptides in normal order with j + 1 = k are identical to the original PCP P(i,l) and should therefore be excluded. Splice peptides can have the same sequence like PCPs, for example, if the sequence of the substrate is redundant, or the length of one of the parts is short – such peptides can be excluded from the database. Splice peptides can have the same sequence, so the splice peptides SP(i,j,k,l) and SP(i,j + 1,k + 1,l) have the same sequence if the amino acid in position j + 1 and in position k are the same. Nevertheless, both versions should be kept within the database because if the original peptides P(i,j) and P(k,l) are found within the cleavage products, and P(i,j + 1) not, the first version of the PSP is more likely.</p><p>When searching for splice products that are at the same time epitopes for MHC class I or MHC class II, the length of the predicted splice products should be limited. Therefore, according limits are included into the algorithm. Also, the database of spliced products can become very large if you try to evaluate all possible splice products of a large substrate without limits. The number of all possible splice products of a substrate of length 100 consists of about 25 million peptides, and results into a database of nearly 3 GB, so you can predict the size of the database without evaluating it, and avoid the evaluation.</p><p>The ProtAG program evaluates a database of splice products in fasta format according different parameters:</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Sequence of the substrate of length L(sub).</p></list-item><list-item><p>Minimal/maximal length of the parts of the splice peptides (MinP,MaxP).</p></list-item><list-item><p>Minimal/maximal length of the gap between the parts of the splice peptide (only used if you evaluate splice peptides in normal or inverse order) (MinG,MaxG).</p></list-item><list-item><p>Minimal/maximal length of the whole splice peptide (MinS,MaxS).</p></list-item><list-item><p>Do you want to include PCPs into the database (recommended)?</p></list-item><list-item><p>Do you want to exclude PSPs with sequences identical to PCPs (recommended)?</p></list-item><list-item><p>Do you want to evaluate only PSPs in normal order, or PSPs in normal or inverse order (coming from the same substrate), or all PSPs including PSPs from different substrates?</p></list-item></list><sec id="s4-9-1"><title>Algorithm</title><list list-type="simple"><list-item><p>Algorithm for the evaluation of PSPs in normal or inverse order – ignoring MaxG for simplification:</p></list-item><list-item><p>– evaluate all possible lengths of splice products actL with MinS&lt;=actL&lt;=MaxS</p></list-item><list-item><p>– evaluate possible lengths for the parts: MinP&lt;=actL1&lt;=min(actL-MinP,MaxP), actL2=actL-actL1</p></list-item><list-item><p>– evaluate starting points for the first fragment of the splice peptide: 1&lt;=Start1&lt;=L(sub)-actL-MinG+1</p></list-item><list-item><p>endpoint for the first fragment will be End1=Start1+actL1-1</p></list-item><list-item><p>– evaluate starting points for the second fragment: End1+1+MinG&lt;=Start2&lt;=L(sub)-actL2+1</p></list-item><list-item><p>endpoint for the second fragment will be End2=Start2+actL2-1</p></list-item><list-item><p>– evaluate the normal PSP SP(Start1,End1,Start2,End2) if Start2 &gt;End1+1</p></list-item><list-item><p>check if the sequence of the PSP is a sub sequence of the substrate</p></list-item><list-item><p>– if not: write out the PSP in fasta format with the name line containing information to the positions</p></list-item><list-item><p>Start1, End1, Start2, End2, mass, m/z values for z=1,2,3</p></list-item><list-item><p>– if inverse PSPs should be included: evaluate the inverse PSP SP (Start2, End2, Start1, End1)</p></list-item><list-item><p>– check if the sequence of the PSP is a sub sequence of the substrate</p></list-item><list-item><p>if not: write out the PSP in fasta file format</p></list-item></list><p>The ProtAG algorithm, together with an instruction sheet is available on Dryad.</p></sec></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Sabrina Horn, Kathrin Borgwald, and Mathias Pippow for excellent technical support.

author responses.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;in vitro proteasome processing of neo-splicetopes does not predict their presentation in vivo&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Tadatsugu Taniguchi as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Michal C Bassani (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, when editors judge that a submitted work as a whole belongs in <italic>eLife</italic> but that some conclusions require a modest amount of additional new data, as they do with your paper, we are asking that the manuscript be revised to either limit claims to those supported by data in hand, or to explicitly state that the relevant conclusions require additional supporting data.</p><p>Our expectation is that the authors will eventually carry out the additional experiments and report on how they affect the relevant conclusions either in a preprint on bioRxiv or medRxiv, or if appropriate, as a Research Advance in <italic>eLife</italic>, either of which would be linked to the original paper.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The manuscript by Willimsky et al. describes an intensive experimental assessment of the (lack of) immunogenicity of predicted neo-splicetopes covering two common driver mutations. Following prediction of potential proteasomal spliced peptides covering two mutations, the authors identified by MS spliced-products in in-vitro digest assays, and they generated specific TCRs against these epitopes in in-vivo mice models. With these TCR, they concluded lack of natural presentation of the spliced peptides in vivo, also in cells overexpressing the mutation.</p><p>Globally the study is well performed and demonstrates very convincingly that algorithms combined with in vitro precursor peptide digestions are by no means a guarantee that spliced epitopes will be generated in cellulo and in vivo. The results concerning the mutant KRAS epitope contradict a recently published report claiming, in the discussion and without showing data, that the spliced KRAS(G12V) epitope is presented by tumor cells (Mishto 2019 in the reference list).</p><p>The dilemma with this report is of course that it shows &quot;negative data&quot;. However, it appears that the report will be of interest to a broad public. There are numerous examples in the literature where T cell epitopes are lightheartedly taken for real without hard evidence as pursued in this report. Moreover, the issue of the in vivo relevance of proteasome-produced spliced epitopes remains controversial since several years and this report adds a cautionary note to this ongoing discussion.</p><p>All in all, although this is an n=2 study, this work adds important experimental validation to an ongoing debate about the fidelity, the prevalence and the clinical importance of proteasomal spliced peptides. Overall, the data reported is convincing that there is no natural presentation of these selected neo-splicetopes. However, it is important to note that the readers might be left with a feeling that these were just two unlucky examples.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The authors should address the following points raised by the reviewers:</p><p>1. Lines 129-140. The information reported in this section is highly important to understand the validity of the previous paper (Mishto et al. 2019). However, it is unclear how the authors obtained the information that there was a faulty peptide synthesis and technical issues with the in-vitro splicing experiments in that paper (&quot;in the initial PCPS experiments&quot;). The authors should provide more clarifications and data to support these arguments of &quot;contaminating peptides mimicking a PCPS reaction&quot;. A discussion should be added on how prevalence are these contaminating peptides, and what are the quality control assays that should be included to exclude such critical technical issues in future experiments.</p><p>2. Lines 143-151 and 267-281: Here the authors report that the spliced peptides were identified by MS in the in-vitro assays. These section should be extended and supported with more data to report how efficient were these splicing reaction. For example – how many copies of each of the spliced peptides were obtained compared to the non-spliced products? Annotated MSMS should be provided for all the spliced peptides. For example, in Figure 1B, there are many dominant peaks that were not annotated, and it is impossible for the reader/reviewer to assess the quality of this identification, which overall looks not great. Each of the identified peptides (spliced and non-spliced) should be reported in a table, with quality scores that are generated by the database search tool (in this case the PD2.1 tool), such as accuracy, intensity in each of the time points in the kinetics assays, identification score, FDR, score to second bet match etc. MS raw data should also be deposited and available for the readers to explore. Standard parameters about the database search should be provided, such as the reference database used (the spliced targets and which baseline reference?), FDR, mass deviation for parent mass and for precursor ions, etc.</p><p>3. While the authors make a very convincing case that tumor cells do not present the two epitopes, they might consider corroborating the conclusion that even over-expression of the source antigen does not allow for epitope presentation, i.e. that lack of presentation is not due to limiting intracellular epitope amounts. Presently this conclusion is based on the fact that transfection of the 35mer also fails to induce presentation (Figure 4). However, this construct encodes an artificial tandem peptide and it is unclear whether digestion of this peptide would yield the spliced epitope in vitro. In other words, without an in vitro digestion of this peptide, the argument that in vitro digestion is unsuitable for predicting processing in cellulo cannot be made, for the situation of over-expressed source antigens.</p><p>4. Moreover, the authors do not make any effort to estimate the amount of the 35mer expressed; directly quantifying expression levels would make their argument more solid.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.62019.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The authors should address the following points raised by the reviewers:</p><p>1.

In this context it is important to note that the KRAS<sup>G12V</sup> polypeptide substrates in question, i.e. KRAS<sup>G12V</sup><sub>2-32,</sub>KRAS<sup>G12V</sup><sub>2-21</sub> and KRAS<sup>G12V</sup><sub>2-14</sub> (newly added) as well as KRAS<sup>G12V</sup><sub>2-35</sub> (the substrate used by Mishto et al.) were synthesized by the same Charité core facility.</p><p>Initially we were misled because generation of the KRAS<sup>G12V</sup> derived spliced epitopes in our PCPS experiments perfectly followed the kinetics expected for the generation of spliced peptides (shown in Figure 3—figure supplements 4 and 5A). Early concerns regarding the fidelity of our experiments were raised by the negative in vivo experiments. Also, when we routinely searched the MS data from our kinetic PCPS experiments for N-terminally or C-terminally elongated precursors of the spliced epitopes generated during the PCPS reaction, we detected several long polypeptides that already in the absence of any processing event reflected the sequence of the predicted spliced peptides (now summarized in Supplementary File 2). This strongly indicated that these faulty polypeptides could have served as substrates for a normal proteasomal processing reaction resulting in the production of non-spliced peptides mimicking a splicing reaction.</p><p>Prevalence</p><p>As can be seen in Figure 3—figure supplements 5B, C these faulty KRAS<sup>G12V</sup> derived polypeptides, KRAS <sup>G12V</sup><sub>2-8_10-21</sub> and KRAS <sup>G12V</sup><sub>2-10_12-21</sub> are degraded by the proteasome with kinetics similar to that of the total polypeptide substrate reflecting cleavage and generation of linear non-spliced peptides.</p><p>Considering, that in vitro generation of non-spliced epitopes is in most cases significantly more efficient than the generation of spliced epitopes, i.e. for RAC2<sup>P29L</sup> approx. 200-fold (numbers in the literature vary between 100- to 10000-fold) even minor amounts of false substrate peptide may lead to the generation of prevalent false spliced peptides. As requested this aspect is now included and discussed in the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Lines 143-151 and 267-281: Here the authors report that the spliced peptides were identified by MS in the in-vitro assays. These section should be extended and supported with more data to report how efficient were these splicing reaction. For example – how many copies of each of the spliced peptides were obtained compared to the non-spliced products? Annotated MSMS should be provided for all the spliced peptides. For example, in Figure 1B, there are many dominant peaks that were not annotated, and it is impossible for the reader/reviewer to assess the quality of this identification, which overall looks not great. Each of the identified peptides (spliced and non-spliced) should be reported in a table, with quality scores that are generated by the database search tool (in this case the PD2.1 tool), such as accuracy, intensity in each of the time points in the kinetics assays, identification score, FDR, score to second bet match etc. MS raw data should also be deposited and available for the readers to explore. Standard parameters about the database search should be provided, such as the reference database used (the spliced targets and which baseline reference?), FDR, mass deviation for parent mass and for precursor ions, etc.</p></disp-quote><p>Because our intention was to focus more on the in vivo data the part concerning peptide splicing was kept rather short. But we fully agree with the reviewer that the lack of documentation left many questions open. As requested, we now deposited MS raw data, PD2.1 files and quality scores used for the identification of spliced and non-spliced peptides in our KRAS<sup>G12V</sup> and RAC2<sup>P29L</sup> kinetic PCPS experiments as well as cleavage map for the RAC2<sup>P29L</sup> substrate.</p><p>Since we also extended the number of documented experiments considerably, we adapted the material and methods section accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>For example, in Figure 1B, there are many dominant peaks that were not annotated, and it is impossible for the reader/reviewer to assess the quality of this identification, which overall looks not great.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is absolutely correct as this made us aware of a critical embarrassing mistake which changed the conclusion of our KRAS<sup>G12V</sup> experiments and for which we have to deeply apologize. It shouldn´t have happened. Thorough reanalysis of the MSMS data generated in the kinetic experiments performed with the new KRAS<sup>G12V</sup><sub>1-21</sub> polypeptide substrate made us realize that in our database two peptides with identical masses were proposed. Thus, the MS/MS spectrum shown in the Figure 1B in the initial manuscript is the spectrum for KRAS<sup>G12V</sup> ORI_5-13 KLVVVGAVG and not as falsely assumed KRAS<sup>G12V</sup> 58_10-14 KLVV_GAVGV. The dominant peaks at 383.45 and 539.11 can clearly only be identified in KRAS<sup>G12V</sup> ORI_5-13 KLVVVGAVG and not in KRAS<sup>G12V</sup> 5-8_10-14 KLVV_GAVGV (synthetic peptide). Consequently and in line with our in vivo data we have thus no experimental evidence that the predicted KRAS<sup>G12V</sup><sub>5-8/10-14</sub> neo-splicetope is generated.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>For example – how many copies of each of the spliced peptides were obtained compared to the non-spliced products?</p></disp-quote><p>The main interest of the project relied in the identification of potentially new spliced tumor epitopes at the qualitative level. Therefore, we didn´t perform any titration experiments with spiked peptides which would have allowed a reliable estimation of peptide number. As now pointed out in the manuscript the absolute numbers of peptides generated in vitro is strongly dependent on a number of different parameters such as substrate concentration, type of substrate, amount and activity of proteasomes as well as assay time. Importantly, the experimental conditions for a PCPS reaction by no means reflect the in vivo situation where only a single substrate molecule occupies the catalytic cavity at any given time. In contrast, in vitro peptide splicing reactions as a result of transpeptidation require relatively high substrate concentrations and are at large driven by a high substrate density in the cavity. This bears the risk of artificial splicing reactions as evidenced in by the formation of a reversed spliced peptide with sequence overlap RAC2<sup>P29L</sup><sub>28-31/24-28</sub> (Mai et al., 2020, cleavage map RAC2<sup>P29L</sup>). Therefore, and with respect to judging splicing efficiency for a specific spliced epitope, for example RAC2<sup>P29L</sup><sub>28-34/36-37</sub> (Figure 4A) it seems appropriate to compare the generation of a spliced epitope with that of the non-spliced epitope. For RAC2<sup>P29L</sup> this means that even under conditions that favor peptide splicing the RAC2<sup>P29L</sup> non-spliced neo-epitope is at least 200-fold more efficiently generated than RAC2<sup>P29L</sup><sub>28-34/36-37</sub>, as judged by the comparison of ion currents. [We also calculated the molecule numbers generated in an independent 24h experiment using the Avogadro constant. In this case generation of the non-spliced epitope is approximately 1000 more efficient than the generation of the spliced epitope].</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. While the authors make a very convincing case that tumor cells do not present the two epitopes, they might consider corroborating the conclusion that even over-expression of the source antigen does not allow for epitope presentation, i.e. that lack of presentation is not due to limiting intracellular epitope amounts. Presently this conclusion is based on the fact that transfection of the 35mer also fails to induce presentation (Figure 4). However, this construct encodes an artificial tandem peptide and it is unclear whether digestion of this peptide would yield the spliced epitope in vitro. In other words, without an in vitro digestion of this peptide, the argument that in vitro digestion is unsuitable for predicting processing in cellulo cannot be made, for the situation of over-expressed source antigens.</p></disp-quote><p>An in vitro digest of repetitive sequences and its interpretation is highly questional. For analysis of T cell recognition of the neo-spicotope RAC2<sup>P29L</sup> – that we also confirmed by in vitro proteasomal digest – we now include cell lines that overexpress RAC2<sup>P29L</sup> cDNA excluding any artificial tandem peptide generation. Since the TCR 22894, specific for the non-splice epitope, comparatively recognizes RAC2<sup>P29L</sup> triple 45mer (Figures 5A/C) as well as RAC2<sup>P29L</sup> cDNA (Figures5B/C) we prove sufficient generation of the non-splice epitope from both recombinantly expressed expression cassettes. Splice-specific TCR 20967A2 exclusively only recognizes the overexpressed RAC2<sup>P29L</sup> triple epitope nonamer (Figures 5A/C), supporting our notion that even if the RAC2<sup>P29L</sup><sub>28-34/36-37</sub> neo-splicetope is derived from an overexpressed substrate protein, its amounts are negligible and insufficient to allow its recognition by T cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Moreover, the authors do not make any effort to estimate the amount of the 35mer expressed; directly quantifying expression levels would make their argument more solid.</p></disp-quote><p>Using quantitative PCR we analysed expression of multimer peptide minigenes (KRAS<sup>G12V</sup> 35mer, RAC2<sup>P29L</sup> 45 mer) in comparison to our epitope minigenes (Figures 3E and 5E). Whereas the KRAS<sup>G12V</sup> 35mer shows two-fold higher expression than the spliced KRAS<sup>G12V</sup> 9mer, expression of the RAC2<sup>P29L</sup> 45 mer is five-fold stronger than expression of the spliced RAC2<sup>P29L</sup> 9mer. Therefore we conclude that – despite overexpression – still insufficient, if at all, amounts of a putative neo-splicotope are produced from the multimers to be recognized by respective T cells.</p></body></sub-article></article>
