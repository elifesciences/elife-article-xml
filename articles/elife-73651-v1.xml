sensory inputs to achieve behavior. To study such dynamic algorithms from mass neural signals, we recorded the magnetoencephalographic (MEG) activity of participants who resolved the classic XOR, OR, and AND functions as overt behavioral tasks (N = 10 participants/task, N-of-1 replications). Each function requires a different computation over the same inputs to produce the task-specific behavioral outputs. In each task, we found that source-localized MEG activity progresses through four computational stages identified within individual participants: (1) initial contralateral representation of each visual input in occipital cortex, (2) a joint linearly combined representation of both inputs in midline occipital cortex and right fusiform gyrus, followed by (3) nonlinear task-dependent input integration in temporal-parietal cortex, and finally (4) behavioral response representation in postcentral gyrus. We demonstrate the specific dynamics of each computation at the level of individual sources. The spatiotemporal patterns of the first two computations are similar across the three tasks; the last two computations are task specific. Our results therefore reveal where, when, and how dynamic network algorithms perform different computations over the same inputs to produce different behaviors.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>computation</kwd><kwd>categorization</kwd><kwd>task</kwd><kwd>representation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schyns</surname><given-names>Philippe G</given-names></name><name><surname>Ince</surname><given-names>Robin AA</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100014036</institution-id><institution>Multidisciplinary University Research Initiative</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schyns</surname><given-names>Philippe G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010269</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schyns</surname><given-names>Philippe G</given-names></name><name><surname>Ince</surname><given-names>Robin AA</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Four stages of linear and nonlinear computations in hierarchical dynamic brain networks progressively transform the same two visual inputs into the task-specific XOR, AND, and OR behavioral responses.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Extensive studies revealed that the primate visual system comprises the ventral and dorsal pathways, with specific anatomical and functional hierarchical organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Van Essen et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kravitz et al., 2013</xref>).

However, despite considerable progress, we have yet to understand where, when, and how specific algorithmic computations in the pathways dynamically represent and transform the visual input into integrated features to produce behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kriegeskorte and Douglas, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Naselaris et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Wu et al., 2006</xref>) and vice versa, when reversing the flow in the hierarchy, to predict a cascade of features from complex to simpler ones. Furthermore, it is unclear that such an algorithmic understanding can be achieved with current analytical approaches to neuroimaging, even in simple tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jonas and Kording, 2017</xref>). Here, we achieved such systems-level algorithmic understanding with magnetoencephalographic (MEG) measurements, in the context of well-defined visual inputs and tasks.</p><p>We framed this broad problem using the classic logical functions XOR, AND, and OR, in which different algorithms are required to produce correct responses from the same input stimuli (see these input-output relationships in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>).

Its Lin computation (see Legend and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) develops over seven time-steps (from 2 to 74ms) to linearly discriminate the âonâ (dark) vs. âoffâ (clear) state of the left input (see schematic in the bottom left quadrant). The plot shows how 2D source activity progressively separates left lens âonâ trials (red and gray stimuli, see blue line in schematic) from left lens âoffâ trials (blue and black stimuli). The adjacent scatter (upper right quadrant) shows the source response to individual trials at 74ms (final plotted time point). The vector diagram (lower right quadrant) confirms that the linear addition of the vector responses [0, 1] and [1, 0] (gray point, sum of blue and red vector) is close to the actual source response to [1, 1] (black point). The left occipital source (orange, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,C</xref>) reflects a similar unfolding for the linear discrimination of the right input âonâ vs. âoffâ state. Again, the response is close to the linear sum of the responses to each individual input.</p><p>The second computation (LinBoth, magenta) that linearly and jointly represents the âonâ vs. âoffâ state of both inputs takes two distinct forms. In midline occipital sources (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,D</xref>), all four stimuli are equally spread out in the quadrants of the source response space (i.e. all inputs are equally discriminated). In contrast, the right fusiform gyrus source (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,E</xref>) discriminates the [1,0] and [0,1] stimuli with an opposite activity, whereas the [1,1] (black dot) and [0,0] (gray dot) stimuli are less discriminated. The vector diagrams of the two LinBoth examples confirm that the joint response to [1,1] is indeed the sum of [1,0] and [0,1] responses. Interestingly, the two LinBoth discriminations illustrate a progression toward an XOR representation. The first LinBoth midline occipital source (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>) discriminates equally each input in the quadrants of its 2D response. In contrast, the amplitude response of the LinBoth right fusiform gyrus source (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>) can linearly discriminate the XOR responses, but only if a nonlinear operation was added (i.e. drawing a circle that separates the two âsameâ black and gray stimuli near the origin in the 2D source response space from the two âdifferentâ blue and red stimuli). So, the right fusiform gyrus LinBoth stage likely represents an important intermediate step toward the computation of XOR. We will see next that the green computation adds the nonlinear computation.</p><p>The third and most critical computation that starts distinguishing the task (NonLin, green) occurs when the parietal source (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A, F</xref>) nonlinearly represents the XOR solution for behavior, with âsameâ vs. âdifferentâ stimuli discriminated at 254ms. Like LinBoth in right fusiform gyrus, this representation has black dot [1,1] and gray dot [0,0] responses close together, but with two crucial differences. First, the red and blue vectors (lower right quadrant) now point in the same direction, rather than in opposite directions, as happens in right Fusiform Gyrus LinBoth. Such different source-level responses to the same [1,0] and [0,1] stimuli likely reflect different activities of the neural populations in the regions where the two sources are located. In parietal source NonLin, responses to [1,0] and [0,1] stimuli are magnetic fields with the same dipole orientation, suggesting that the same pattern of cortical activity (i.e. the same neural population) responds to both stimuli. In right fusiform gyrus source LinBoth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A, E</xref>), responses to [1,0] and [0,1] are magnetic fields with different dipole directions, suggesting that different neural populations within the region modeled by the source respond to each stimulus. Second, the representation of [1,1] (black dot) is now nonlinear (green vector), pointing away from the sum of the red and blue vectors of the individual inputs. Following this nonlinear transformation, the XOR outputs are now linearly decodable in the 2D MEG response space.</p><p>Finally, the fourth stage on a postcentral gyrus source (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A, G</xref>, NonLin&amp;RT, yellow) also nonlinearly represents the stimuli, also allowing linear readout of the XOR task outputs at 386ms. In addition, this source activity now relates trial by trial to behavioral RTs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1</xref> shows that this last postcentral gyrus fourth stage (also in frontal regions) primarily relates to behavioral RTs.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> shows that the key differences in the AND and OR tasks are at the third and fourth stages, where the temporal-parietal (green) and postcentral gyrus (yellow) sources represent AND and OR solutions for task behavior. The earlier stages linearly represent the two inputs, with light blue and orange Lin, magenta LinBoth discriminating the four stimuli as in XOR participants (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2</xref> for individual replications, prevalence = 1 [0.75 1], MAP [96% HPDI], <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ince et al., 2021</xref>). In NonLin and NonLin&amp;RT stages, the representation is nonlinear and reflects the task (cf. vector diagrams inset, bottom right quadrant). In AND, the task output is linearly separable in the 2D MEG response space: the black [1,1] response is further from the other stimulus classes than they are from each other, see <italic>Methods, Representational Patterns</italic>. In OR, the task outputs are also linearly separable, with the gray [0,0] stimulus class represented apart from the other ones. This shows how these later post-200ms computational stages involve nonlinear task-specific stimulus representations in ventral (NonLin) and parietal (NonLin, NonLin&amp;RT) areas.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Here, we addressed the challenge of understanding where, when, and how the brain dynamically implements different algorithmic computations over sensory inputs. We tightly controlled behavior using the simple logical functions XOR, OR, and AND as tasks that require different computations over the same tightly controlled binary inputs. Our analyses revealed, at the level of individual MEG sources, four main stages of computation that dynamically unfold from ~60 to 400 ms poststimulus. The first computation linearly discriminates the âonâ vs. âoffâ state of each input in contral-lateral occipital cortex ~60ms poststimulus. This is followed by the linear discrimination of both inputs on occipital and ventral sources ~100ms, followed by the nonlinear integration of both inputs, revealing the XOR, AND, or OR task solution in 2D source response space in the parietal-temporal regions ~260ms, and finally the nonlinear integration with RT-related activity in postcentral gyrus ~400ms. These four stages are common to XOR, AND, and OR, with the main task-related changes occurring in the latter two nonlinear stages. Notably, we performed all statistical analyses leading to these results within each individual participant, controlling the familywise error rate (FWER) over all considered sources and time points. By treating each participant as an N-of-1 study, 10 participants per task provide 10 independent replications of the experiment. We replicated the four computational stages in at least 9/10 participants (and in two further replication experiments with similarly high prevalence), providing strong evidence that a majority of individuals in the population sampled and tested in the same way would show the same effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ince et al., 2021</xref>).</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Reverse engineering systems-level algorithms</title><p>Our systems-level approach aims to reverse engineer, from mass brain signals, the hierarchy of brain computations that represent and transform sensory inputs to produce behaviorâi.e., the brainâs algorithm of the behavioral task. The four stages of computation that we systematically found in each individual participant and tasks meet the five key properties of an algorithm: (1) the inputs were specified as the four possible combinations of two binary inputs; (2) the output responses were also specified as the responses of the logical functions XOR, OR, and AND; (3) the algorithms were definite in each task, with a sequence of two characterized Lin and two NonLin computations that transformed the same inputs into the task-specific outputs; the algorithms were also (4) effective in the brain, in the sense that they only relied on brain resources, and (5) finite in processing time, producing behavior with ~450â500ms.</p><p>Note that reverse engineering a systems-level algorithm at the granularity of MEG brain measures does not preclude the existence of different compositions of algorithms at lower levels of granularity of individual neurons that together implement the higher-level algorithm (much like the lower granularity algorithms of machine language implement the higher-level algorithms of C++). Rather, such systems-level analysis provides constraints on where (the brain regions) and when (the specific time windows) specific computations take place, enabling targeted studies of the algorithmic âhowâ across modalities and granularities of brain measures. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jonas and Kording, 2017</xref> used a related systems-level approach to understand the hierarchy of computations of a microprocessor and concluded that there was risk that analytic approaches in neuroimaging could fall short of producing a meaningful algorithmic understanding of neural activity. We could do so here because we adhered to the main properties of an algorithm: our explicit behavioral tasks (i.e. XOR, OR, and AND) require an implementation of a specific computation on simple (i.e. fully characterized) binary inputs to achieve behavior. We could therefore trace the dynamic representations of the inputs into the 2D space of MEG activity to understand the stages of representation underlying the computation (i.e. Lin, LinBoth, and task-specific NonLin). Such descriptive models of an algorithm enable explicit testing of the different stages of the computation hierarchy. For example, by manipulating the timing or nature of the presented stimuli, or by targeting causal interventions (e.g. magnetic stimulation, or stimulus manipulations) at specific brain regions and peristimulus times.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Generalization to naturalistic categorization tasks</title><p>Generalizing from our case study of the algorithms underlying the simple XOR, AND, and OR functions to more naturalistic face, object, and scene categorization tasks will incur many challenges that we can frame in the context of the properties of an algorithm detailed above.</p><p>A key challenge is that the task-relevant features of real-world faces, objects, and scenes, may be completely different for different behaviors and participants, effectively changing the inputs to the algorithm. Unfortunately, task- or participant-specific features are generally not considered in studies of neural representation, processing, and categorization. Their understanding remains a similar challenge for deep convolutional neural network research, including instances when these are used as models of the brain. Specifically, a key property of an algorithm is that we specify its inputs as precisely as possible. In real-world categorizations, this implies understanding which specific features of the complex images are task relevant for each particular participant performing each specific behavioral task. Furthermore, specification of the outputs is another key property of an algorithm. Passive viewing, or one-back tasks do not provide this specification. For example, from the same face, the feature of a smiling mouth feature will be used to overtly respond âhappyâ, but the forehead wrinkles to respond â45 years of ageâ; from the same car picture, its specific shape to respond âNew Beetleâ, but the front tyre shape to respond âflat tyreâ; or the specific roof tiles to respond âChrysler buildingâ but the density of buildings on the horizon to respond âcityâ; and so forth. Relatedly, experts vs. novices will use different features to classify the same pictures of the 35 different subtypes of sparrows that exist in North America. Such relative perceptual expertise and associated features generally characterize the relationship between visual cognition and outside world stimuli. Then, to infer the hierarchical stages of computation from the brain measures, we can start tracing the dynamic representation of these specific task-relevant input features, when we have formally characterized them, between stimulus onset and explicit output task behavior, as we did here. Different modalities or granularities of brain measures (e.g. M/EEG, 3/7T fMRI, NIRS vs. single electrodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Gidon et al., 2020</xref>) and electrode arrays) will likely provide complementary understandings (e.g. timing vs. location) of the computations in different brain regions. And when we finally have a model of the computation hierarchy (even initially a descriptive model), we can test its key properties.</p><p>To conclude, we reverse engineered four stages of dynamic algorithmic computations over the same sensory inputs that produce different behaviors in the brain. We could do so because we explicitly controlled the input features and the explicit tasks that each individual participant was instructed to resolve while we modeled their brain response with MEG source level activity. Therefore, our results and methodology pave the way to study algorithmic computations when the stimuli and tasks are more complex (e.g. face, object, and scene and their explicit categorizations) but well controlled (e.g. with generative systems rather than uncontrolled 2D images), as they are in any algorithm.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Participants</title><p>We recruited 35 participants (all right handed; 24 women).

Using brain surfaces segmented from individual warped MRI, we then prepared a realistic single-shell head model. Next, we low-pass filtered the clean dataset at 40 Hz, re-epoched the data between â100 and 400ms around stimulus onset, demeaned using a prestimulus baseline, and computed covariance across the entire epoch. Using average sensor positions across good runs (i.e. where head movement was &lt;0.6 cm, see above), and a 6 mm uniform grid warped to standardized MNI space, we then computed the forward model, keeping the two orientations of MEG activity. We computed the Linearly Constrained Minimum Variance beamformer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hillebrand and Barnes, 2005</xref>) solution with parameters âlambda = 6%â and âfixedori = noâ. The resulting inverse filter applied to the sensor space MEG activity enabled reconstruction of the single-trial 2D MEG magnetic field vector (i.e. dipole with amplitude and direction) activity time courses on 12,773 grid points. Using a Talairaih-Daemon atlas, we excluded all cerebellar and noncortical sources and performed the statistical analyses on the remaining 5107 cortical grid points.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Linear vs. nonlinear representations</title><sec id="s4-6-1"><title>Linear representation</title><p>Every 4ms time point between â100 and 400ms poststimulus, we computed independent multivariate linear regressions to model the dynamic representation of the state of each input (i.e. 0, clear lens vs. 1, dark lens) into the 2D MEG responses of each source.

To study the dynamic algorithms from mass neural signals, the authors recorded the MEG activity of participants who resolved the classic XOR, OR, and AND behavioral tasks. Using linear and nonlinear representations, they found that source-localized MEG activity progresses through four systems-level computations identified within individual participants. The first two computations similarly represent the inputs across the three tasks; the last two differently represent the inputs in a task-dependent manner. The topic is interesting and timely.

The first two computations similarly represent the inputs across the three tasks; the last two differently represent the inputs in a task-dependent manner. The topic is interesting and timely. The study is elegantly designed and the data statistics are highly significant. I have some comments listed as below.</p><p>1. For each task, the authors proposed the 4 systems-level stages of computation link stimulus to behavior (the first two stages represent and linearly discriminate the visual inputs; the third and fourth stages nonlinearly integrate them in a task-specific manner), according to the different onsets from post-stimulus (~60, 100, 260, and 400ms for each stages, respectively). However, the time window of the first stage (Lin) is the same as the second stage (LinBoth), namely, 74-117ms. This was also reflected very well in the results from Figure 1B, the &quot;Lin&quot; and &quot;LinBoth&quot; computations have almost the same onsets and peaks, particularly, the peak of the blue line (first stage, Lin) looks like much latter than the magenta line (second stage, LinBoth). I am confused that how the authors distinguished these two stages when they had the same time window and why the authors proposed they were the two different stages rather than the same stage during their computations. More generally, the authors should offer more evidence for the 4 systems-level stages of computation, for example, whether it explained their results better than the 3 systems-level stages or 2 systems-level stages of computation.</p><p>2. Similar to the first point, for the results in Figure 3, there were several significant peak values in the very early time window (0-60ms) for the third stage (&quot;NonLin&quot;). However, the author only focused on the late time window (~260ms) for this stage. How to reconcile these early peaks (early effects) of the third (late) stage?</p><p>3. The behavior data and decoding performance lacked in the first three systems-level computations. Functional inferences based on hypothetical computations of MEG data are not convincing.</p><p>4. I would like to suggest the authors collect eye movement data to address whether eye movements are a possible confound for the difference between the four systems-level computations.</p><p>5. The legend descriptions are too long and confusing, like figure 2. I would like to suggest the authors label small figures in one figure to make the legend easier to understand by readers.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.73651.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Testing the representational generalization across stimulus set.

The alignment in time of the first and second stages in the original manuscript is now clearly separated in each task in the revised figures (see the plots of the revised Figures 1 and 3 in the manuscript reported in a âbeforeâ and âafterâ <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>). The next section explains the revised computations that led to these changes. We know from the anatomy of the visual system that information from a one side of the visual field will first be represented in early visual cortical areas in the contralateral hemisphere. We do indeed find this at Stage 1, but this first stage is very brief (~10-15 ms), because the bottom-up input is quickly propagated across hemispheres to higher visual areas. This duration is consistent with the latencies of cross-hemispheric transfer (~15 ms, Brown et al. 1994; Ipata et al., 1997) also found in our earlier work on cross hemisphere communication of specific visual features (Ince et al. 2016). The second stage that linearly represents both inputs onto the same MEG source in occipital and temporal-ventral cortex is longer (color-coded in purple, see Stage 2 in Figure 1âfigure supplement 1 and (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>)).</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>This image shows the changes to the main results presented in Figures 1 and 3 between the original and the revised manuscripts.</title><p>The color-coded curves present each computation. We can now better see the 4 distinct stages (cf. 4-stage image above), where the brief timing of Stage 1 (in orange and blue, LinLeft and LinRight computations) is now better decoupled from that of Stage 2 (in magenta, LinBoth). Individual participants peak time results for each computation (represented as colored dots) further demonstrates the decoupling into four stages.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-73651-sa2-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><p>Brown WS, Larson EB, Jeeves MA (1994) Directional asymmetries in interhemispheric transmission time: Evidence from visual evoked potentials. <italic>Neuropsychologia</italic> 32:439â448.</p><p>Ipata A, Girelli M, Miniussi C, Marzi CA (1997) Interhemispheric transfer of visual information in humans: the role of different callosal channels. <italic>Arch Ital Biol</italic> 135:169â182.</p><p>Ince, A.A., Jaworska, K., Gross, J., Panzeri, S., van Rijsbergen, N., Rousselet, G. and Schyns, P.G.

The early peaks of nonlinear computations in Stage 3 (particularly of the OR task) were indeed problematic. We went back to our pipeline, starting with the data of each participant. We noticed in a few participants that an anomaly occurred due to the potential for the task representational distance measure to be noisy, particularly when brain regions had weak representations of the inputs at specific time points. Though the Log-Likelihood Ratio measure of non-linear computation was significant, its effect size was extremely weak compared to the later effects, implying that the task distance was correspondingly less meaningful. We addressed this anomaly by multiplying the statistically significant R2 and LLR (i.e. the effect size for the evidence of the linear and nonlinear relationships) with the statistically significant distance metrics for each computation, to better combine the two measures (and avoid considering distance metrics with very weak effects). This did not change the substance of a 4-stage process but smoothed these anomalies in the plots, as now shown in the key panels of Figures 1 and 3 of the revised manuscript and in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>. An important side-effect of the better quantifications is the clearer expected separation of Stages 1 and 2 (including in individual participants data), and all stages are sharper in time. We updated all figure and figure supplements accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Adding analyses to test alternative computational steps, e.g., 3 system-level, 2 system-level for comparison, and clarifying why the proposed 4-step is the best model to characterize the whole process.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank you and the reviewers for raising these important points. In our methods we described the computations that led to 4 stages, but we did not explicitly test explicitly alternatives numbers of stages (2-, 3-, 4- and more). In our revised manuscript, we now explicitly test these alternative numbers of stages to characterize the whole process. We used a simple data-driven k-means clustering analysis over the measures of each computation across time, pooling all participantsâ data and performed separately in the XOR, AND and OR tasks. This created a computation space, where clusters represent different stages of the full process over time, with different brain volumes of source-level computations (i.e. Lin left and right, LinBoth, NonLin XOR, AND and OR). In this space, the data clustered into 4 stages in each task (i.e. with k = 5, determined using the elbow method), with a first null Stage 0 of no computation followed by 4 stages, each characterized with brain volumes of sourcelevel computations (as shown in the new Figure 1âfigure supplement 1). Using in each task the indexes to these clusters shows that each cluster does indeed capture a specific stage of the entire process that fits the 4-stage data presented in Figures 1 and 3 of the original paper. To conclude, 4stage is the better model of the entire process.</p><p>Furthermore, a similarity analysis of the 4 stages in each task (see Figure 1âfigure supplement 1B) revealed the similarity of Stages 1 and 2 of linear computations across the XOR, AND and OR tasks (i.e. Stage 1: Lin left and right, cyan and orange; Stage 2: LinBoth), followed by dissimilar nonlinear computations (i.e. NonLin, green; NonLin and RT) to compute and XOR, AND and OR for task specific behaviors.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The behavioral relevance analysis was only performed on the fourth component. What about the first three components which should in principle be related to behavioral performance as well? More generally, is there any neural signature that is related to behavior for both linear and nonlinear calculations?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank for you for this comment. We had performed this full analysis but did not report it. It is now included in the manuscript (as Figure 2âfigure supplement 1) and we can indeed confirm that the fouth Stage is the only one that relates to behavioral reaction time.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The authors should collect new data or at least address the possibility of the involvement of eye movement in the four levels of computation.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a difficult point to address for two main reasons: First, we did not collect eye movement data for all participants and so would need to rerun the entire experiment to address this comment. Second, there is no specific proposal for how eye movements could confound the differences between the four systems-level computation stages that we report. Here, we review the arguments that make such confounds unlikely. First, consider that our experimental conditions and task instructions were optimized to minimize eye movement artifacts. Participants were instructed to fixate the center of the screen and not move their eyes throughout the experiment, a fixation cross was presented at the center of the screen on each trial (for a random duration of 500-1000ms), the stimuli were presented for only 150 ms (the timing of only one potential fixation) and preprocessing of our MEG data removed all eye movements artifacts (we now amended the manuscript to make this explicit). Second, further consider that each stage is consistently located in specific brain regions, which are not primarily involved with fixation control (the frontal eye field is). Specifically, we located LinRight and LinLeft at left and right occipital cortex at Stage 1, LinBoth at Stage 2, starting ~15 ms later, in mid-line occipital cortex and right fusiform gyrus, and NonLin XOR, AND and OR task-relevant computations in temporal parietal, parietal and pre-motor cortex. Furthermore, we now show that Stages 1 and 2 are similar across all three tasks, with rapid sequencing (of ~10-15 ms) compatible with the timing of hemispheric transfer (Brown et al., 1994; Ince et al., 2016; Ipata et al., 1997), not with the timing of different fixations (each would take ~150 â 300 ms with face stimuli). The last two NonLin computations are different across the three tasks, but they occur between ~200-400 ms, when the stimulus is not on the screen anymore. In sum, as the two inputs are identical in all tasks, but disappear from the screen (at 150 ms), it is unclear how specific eye movements would confound Stages 3 and 4 (~200-400 ms post-stimulus). These two stages perform task-specific nonlinear integrations (of inputs absent from the screen at this time) over 76 ms in temporal, parietal and premotor cortex (and not in the frontal eye field). In sum, we deem it unlikely that different patterns of eye movement in each task could confound the stages of computation that we report.</p><p>Brown WS, Larson EB, Jeeves MA (1994) Directional asymmetries in interhemispheric transmission time: Evidence from visual evoked potentials. <italic>Neuropsychologia</italic> 32:439â448.</p><p>Ipata A, Girelli M, Miniussi C, Marzi CA (1997) Interhemispheric transfer of visual information in humans: the role of different callosal channels. <italic>Arch Ital Biol</italic> 135:169â182.</p><p>Ince, A.A., Jaworska, K., Gross, J., Panzeri, S., van Rijsbergen, N., Rousselet, G. and Schyns, P.G.

Our analyses are mainly within participant and so we do not have an explicit classifier for the group (and such classifier would likely require higher participant numbers). Thus, we addressed the question of generalization by considering explicitly the similarity of stages of computation across the XOR, AND and OR groups of participants we have, with an approach that also speaks to the generalization from face stimuli to other types of stimuli. See the fuller response in point 3 of the response to the Editors and the generalization data in Figure 1âfigure supplement 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) I am curious how could the authors make sure that the logical computation (based on the binary classification on four types of stimuli) are the genuine calculation in the brain, since it is completely defined in terms of the experimenter's terminology and the subjects might use different strategy. Have the authors considered other alternative computation over the same inputs? Or put in another way, how could the current results be incorporated into or account for previous findings?</p></disp-quote><p>Here, we took the simplest computations that we could think of, documented in theory of computation as a well-known nonlinearity required to resolve XOR (in contrast to AND and OR). Each of these tasks are defined completely by a four element âtruth tableâ and theory of computation consider them to be undecomposable computational primitives. We acknowledge the limitations of such simple tasks, but their advantage is that if the participants are correctly performing it, then we can be confident that somewhere in their brains the XOR computation (i.e. the rule specified in the truth table) is indeed being dynamically implemented. It is difficult to see how different strategies than nonlinear integration could be employed to perform XOR starting with two separate inputs. We did indeed ensure (cf. Stage 1) initial contra-lateral representation of each input (as predicted from neurophysiology and neuroanatomy) to enable a network model that takes in two separate inputs and must necessarily integrate them for behavior. From there on, we traced where and when MEG source activity linearly (Stage 2) and nonlinearly (Stages 3 and 4) represents the same two inputs on the way to behavior.</p><p>As we cannot access the ground-truth computations of the brain, all we can do is model them. With each task (XOR, AND and OR) and participant (N = 10 in each group), we now show similar Stages 1 and 2 of linear computations over the two inputs and divergent, task-related Stage 3 and Stage 4 computations over these same inputs (cf. Figure 1âfigure supplement 1). Thus, within each task and across the tasks (and now also across stimuli), we are validating that the brain does indeed perform different computations over the same inputs, both at different stages of the process within task and across the final two stages across tasks.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The last component is interesting and shows behavioral correlates, which is important evidence. If my understanding is correct, that component only applies to nonlinear integration in combination with RT. What about the behaviorally related linear computation? Is there a general behaviorally related neural component that is related to both linear and nonlinear computation?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank for you for this comment. We had performed this analysis but did not report it. We have now included in the manuscript (as Figure 2âfigure supplement 1) and can indeed confirm that the fourth component is the only one that relates to behavioral reaction time.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>The study is elegantly designed and the data statistics are highly significant. I have some comments listed as below.</p><p>1. For each task, the authors proposed the 4 systems-level stages of computation link stimulus to behavior (the first two stages represent and linearly discriminate the visual inputs; the third and fourth stages nonlinearly integrate them in a task-specific manner), according to the different onsets from post-stimulus (~60, 100, 260, and 400ms for each stages, respectively). However, the time window of the first stage (Lin) is the same as the second stage (LinBoth), namely, 74-117ms. This was also reflected very well in the results from Figure 1B, the &quot;Lin&quot; and &quot;LinBoth&quot; computations have almost the same onsets and peaks, particularly, the peak of the blue line (first stage, Lin) looks like much latter than the magenta line (second stage, LinBoth). I am confused that how the authors distinguished these two stages when they had the same time window and why the authors proposed they were the two different stages rather than the same stage during their computations. More generally, the authors should offer more evidence for the 4 systems-level stages of computation, for example, whether it explained their results better than the 3 systems-level stages or 2 systems-level stages of computation.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment, agree with them and have developed a new data-driven analysis that delivers the 4-stage account of the data, rather than fewer or more stages. We presented these results in the context of the overall response to the 5 main points of the Editors.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Similar to the first point, for the results in Figure 3, there were several significant peak values in the very early time window (0-60ms) for the third stage (&quot;NonLin&quot;). However, the author only focused on the late time window (~260ms) for this stage. How to reconcile these early peaks (early effects) of the third (late) stage?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank again the reviewer for this comment and for pointing to these peaks that caused confusion.</p><p>We explained how we addressed the peaks in the response to the Editors and provide a âBefore and Afterâ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>) that handle these anomalies and revised Figures 1 and 3 accordingly. Note the clearer separation of the early stages (including individual participants data) and their increased sharpness in time.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The behavior data and decoding performance lacked in the first three systems-level computations. Functional inferences based on hypothetical computations of MEG data are not convincing.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank for you for this comment. We had performed this analysis but did not report it. We have now included in the manuscript (Figure 2âfigure supplement) and can indeed confirm that the fourth Stage is the only one that relates to behavioral reaction time. Please see response to the Editors above for the figure showing the data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. I would like to suggest the authors collect eye movement data to address whether eye movements are a possible confound for the difference between the four systems-level computations.</p></disp-quote><p>See response to this point in response to the Editorsâ comments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. The legend descriptions are too long and confusing, like figure 2. I would like to suggest the authors label small figures in one figure to make the legend easier to understand by readers.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree, have simplified the caption, and added a Supplementary video (Figure 1-video supplement 1) that presents the dynamics that Figure 2 illustrated statically. The figures and new video should make the specifics of the different dynamic computations over the same input a lot easier to understand.</p></body></sub-article></article>
