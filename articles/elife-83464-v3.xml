It plays a key role in the regulation of the extracellular glutamate concentration in the mammalian brain. The structure of EAAT1 was determined in complex with UCPH-101, apotent, non-competitive inhibitor of EAAT1. Alanine serine cysteine transporter 2 (ASCT2) is a neutral amino acid transporter, which regulates pools of amino acids such as glutamine between intracellular and extracellular compartments . ASCT2 also belongs to the SLC1 family and shares 58% sequence similarity with EAAT1. However, allosteric modulation of ASCT2 via non-competitive inhibitors is unknown. Here, we explore the UCPH-101 inhibitory mechanisms of EAAT1 and ASCT2 by using rapid kinetic experiments. Our results show that UCPH-101 slows substrate translocation rather than substrate or Na<sup>+</sup> binding, confirming a non-competitive inhibitory mechanism, but only partially inhibits wild-type ASCT2. Guided by computational modeling using ligand docking and molecular dynamics simulations, we selected two residues involved in UCPH-101/EAAT1 interaction, which were mutated in ASCT2 (F136Y, I237M, F136Y/I237M) in the corresponding positions. We show that in the F136Y/I237M double-mutant transporter, 100% of the inhibitory effect of UCPH-101 could be restored, and the apparent affinity was increased (<italic>K</italic><sub>i</sub> = 4.3 μM), much closer to the EAAT1 value of 0.6 μM. Finally, we identify a novel non-competitive ASCT2 inhibitor, through virtual screening and experimental testing against the allosteric site, further supporting its localization. Together, these data indicate that the mechanism of allosteric modulation is conserved between EAAT1 and ASCT2. Due to the difference in binding site residues between ASCT2 and EAAT1, these results raise the possibility that more potent, and potentially selective ASCT2 allosteric inhibitors can be designed .</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>SLC1</kwd><kwd>glutamate transporter</kwd><kwd>alanine serine cysteine transporter</kwd><kwd>inhibition</kwd><kwd>docking</kwd><kwd>electrophysiology</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 GM108911</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schlessinger</surname><given-names>Avner</given-names></name><name><surname>Grewer</surname><given-names>Christof</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32 CA078207</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Garibsingh</surname><given-names>Rachel-Ann</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R15 GM135843-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Grewer</surname><given-names>Christof</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Functional and computational studies reveal that the allosteric inhibition mechanism is conserved between glutamate and neutral amino acid transporters of the SLC1 family, and identify a novel allosteric inhibitor.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Excitatory amino acid transporters (EAATs) from the solute carrier 1 (SLC1) family are an important class of membrane proteins, which are strongly expressed in the mammalian central nervous system (CNS). EAATs are responsible for the transport of glutamate across neuronal and astrocytic membranes in the CNS. Glutamate transporters are secondary active transporters, which utilize energy from the sodium concentration gradient between the extra- and intracellular sides of the membrane to take up glutamate into cells against a large concentration gradient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Wadiche et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zerangue and Kavanaugh, 1996a</xref>). In addition, H<sup>+</sup> is co-transported and K<sup>+</sup> is counter-transported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zerangue and Kavanaugh, 1996a</xref>). This glutamate uptake is an important process, preventing glutamate concentrations from reaching neurotoxic levels in the extracellular space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zerangue and Kavanaugh, 1996a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Tanaka et al., 1997</xref>).</p><p>The SLC1 family contains five glutamate transporters (EAATs1–5), as well as two neutral amino acid transporters, the alanine serine cysteine transporters alanine serine cysteine transporter 1 and 2 (ASCT1 and -2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arriza et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Utsunomiya-Tate et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zerangue and Kavanaugh, 1996b</xref>). ASCT2 has been implicated in rapidly growing cancer cells as a supply mechanism for glutamine, and inhibition of the transporter was shown to reduce cell proliferation and tumor size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bröer et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Son et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Wahi and Holst, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kanai et al., 2013</xref>). Therefore, ASCT2 is emerging as a promising drug target.</p><p>Structurally, SLC1 family members are assembled from three identical subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Canul-Tec et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Garaeva et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Yu et al., 2019</xref>), each contain eight transmembrane domains (TM1–8). TMs 1, 2, 4, and 5 form the trimerization domain, and TMs 3, 6, 7, and 8, together with hairpin loops HP1 and HP2, form the transport domain, which is based on an inverted repeat structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Crisman et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Reyes et al., 2009</xref>). Glutamate transporter inhibitors were widely studied for pharmacological purposes. Several types of competitive inhibitors were developed based on an aspartate scaffold, for example, TBOA (DL-<italic>threo</italic>-beta-benzyloxyaspartate) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Shimamoto et al., 1998</xref>) and TFB-TBOA ((3S)-3-[[3-[[4-(trifluoromethyl)benzoyl]amino]phenyl]methoxy]-L-aspartic acid) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Shimamoto et al., 2004</xref>). In addition, non-competitive inhibitors were identified such as UCPH-101 and -102 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Erichsen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abrahamsen et al., 2013</xref>). Characterization with electrophysiological methods suggested UCPH-101 was specific for EAAT1 rather than EAATs 2–5. The inhibition of EAAT1 by UCPH-101 was not affected by glutamate or competitive inhibitors, such as TBOA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Shimamoto et al., 1998</xref>). Subsequently, the binding site of UCPH-101 was identified, first by site-directed mutagenesis, and then in a UCPH-101-bound crystal structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Canul-Tec et al., 2017</xref>). UCPH-101 was found to bind to a hydrophobic region between the trimerization and transport domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Canul-Tec et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>In addition to UCPH-101, other allosteric modulators, GT949 and derivatives, were first introduced by Falucci et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Falcucci et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kortagere et al., 2018</xref>). GT949 is a positive allosteric modulator in EAAT2. However, it operates as an inhibitor in other EAAT subtypes. After incubation of GT949, glutamate uptake activity and <italic>v</italic><sub>max</sub> increase in EAAT2, without altering the substrate affinity. The report also suggested that the allosteric binding site is located between the transport and the trimerization domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Falcucci et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kortagere et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>For ASCTs, inhibitor pharmacology is less well studied. Currently, a number of competitive inhibitors have been identified, on the basis of structural similarity with EAAT inhibitors, as well as docking to homology models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Singh et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ndaru et al., 2019</xref>). While these newly discovered substrate binding site inhibitors show improved potencies and selectivities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Garibsingh et al., 2021</xref>), because of their high similarity to amino acid substrates they (i) likely have poor bioavailability and (ii) need to compete with the amino acid-rich media; thus, they are unlikely to be useful as future anti-cancer drugs via inhibition of ASCT2-mediated transport. It is therefore critical to identify specific, allosteric, non-amino acid-like inhibitors for ASCT2. EAAT1 and ASCT2 share 57.6% sequence similarity and 38.5% sequence identity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>); however, it is not known if the allosteric binding site of EAAT1 is also found in ASCTs, and whether small molecules can modulate ASCT2 non-competitively via this potential site. Structural analysis of the allosteric sites of EAAT1 and ASCT2 suggests that two non-conserved residues in EAAT1 (e.g., F136, and I237) significantly contribute to the UCPH-101 interaction, while other binding site residues that are less critical for binding are conserved between EAAT1 and ASCT2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>In this report, we first compare and detail the effects of UCPH-101 on the SLC1 family members EAAT1 and ASCT2, including analysis of rapid chemical kinetic experiments. While UCPH-101 was found to be a partial and low affinity inhibitor of wild-type ASCT2, engineering of a double-mutant ASCT2 transporter based on computational docking analysis on the basis of the EAAT1 binding site resulted in a largely recovered UCPH-101 effect. In addition, we describe the identification of a non-competitive inhibitor that is not related to UCPH-101 from a virtual screen. Finally, we discuss the importance of our results to the understanding of allosteric inhibition in SLC1 transporters as well as their relevance to the identification of future, non-competitive modulators for ASCTs, including anti-cancer drugs.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>UCPH-101 has been previously reported to be a potent non-competitive glutamate transporter inhibitor with high specificity for EAAT1 rather than the other SLC1 glutamate transporter subtypes.

Several residues are conserved between these proteins maintaining the overall shape of the site. For example, L104, V227, F369 in EAAT1 correspond to L112, V235, and F377 in ASCT2.

However, when F136 and I273 are remodeled to tyrosine and methionine respectively, UCPH-101 can be successfully docked into ASCT2 with a pose similar to that seen in the EAAT1 structures (see below). This result added further support to our hypothesis that Y127 and M271 are key residues impacting binding of UCPH-101 in EAAT1 and explains why inhibition is only partial in wild-type ASCT2 (see below). Next, our goal was to experimentally test predictions from docking with respect to interaction of UCPH-101 with the SLC1 family member ASCT2, contrasting them with results from EAAT1. To validate our experimental system and to compare inhibitor effects on pre-steady-state currents, which had not been investigated in the past, we first briefly summarize UCPH-101 effects on EAAT1.</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>UCPH-101 is a slow-binding, non-competitive inhibitor of EAAT1, which blocks translocation rather than other partial reactions of the transport cycle</title><p>As reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Erichsen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abrahamsen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jensen et al., 2009</xref>), glutamate-induced EAAT1 anion current was inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner by UCPH-101 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>).

This system has a 5–10 ms time resolution when applied to whole cells, and also allows the rapid removal of substrate, providing information on the recovery of current after glutamate removal. However, due to the millisecond time resolution, it will limit determination of very early intermediates in the transport cycle, which are present in a sub-millisecond time domain, but the time resolution is high enough for determining glutamate transporter turnover rate, and how it is affected by the presence of inhibitor. EAAT1 anion currents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) and transport currents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>) show rapid rise of the current after glutamate application within the time resolution afforded by solution exchange (5–10 ms). The rise of the current is followed by rapid decay of a transient current component to the steady state, as demonstrated previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Grewer et al., 2000</xref>). This transient phase of the current was previously assigned to steps associated with the glutamate translocation reaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Wang et al., 2018</xref>). After pre-incubation and in the continuous presence of UCPH-101, both transient and steady-state current amplitude were reduced in a dose-dependent manner, as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B and F</xref>, currents were fully eliminated at 40 μM UCPH-101), but at concentrations close to the apparent <italic>K</italic><sub>i</sub>, the decay of the current was also slowed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, <italic>τ</italic>=11 ± 1.3, 16±2.1, 20±2.1 ms, at 0, 0.2, and 2 μM UCPH-101, respectively). The reduction of the decay rate of the transient current indicates a slowing of the translocation reaction in the presence of UCPH-101. In contrast to competitive inhibitors, UCPH-101 application in the absence of glutamate did not induce any currents, as expected for non-competitive inhibitors, which are not known to be able to block the glutamate transporter leak anion conductance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C and G</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>UCPH-101 has only minor effect on recovery kinetics of excitatory amino acid transporter 1 (EAAT1) current after glutamate removal.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Anion currents in response to two pulses of rapid glutamate application (1 mM), with varying inter-pulse interval (pulse protocol shown at the top) under forward transport conditions.

At 0.2 μM UCPH-101 recovery of the transient current after glutamate removal occurred with a time constant of 115±11 ms, as quantified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F and H</xref>. Therefore, it appears that UCPH-101 does not significantly slow the recovery rate of the transient current. The most likely explanation is that, at low concentrations (&lt;1 μM) UCPH-101 binding to EAAT1 and unbinding are very slow, with time constant of 10 s for binding, and 100 s for dissociation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abrahamsen et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, within the time course of the paired-pulse experiment (1.4 s), UCPH-101-bound and -unbound transporter populations do no interconvert, and the time course of current recovery, thus, reflects that of the UCPH-101-free state.</p><p>Finally, we tested whether UCPH-101 binding affects how Na<sup>+</sup> interacts with the <italic>apo</italic> (glutamate-free) form of the transporter. This question was raised from the crystal structures of EAAT1 in the presence of UCPH-101 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Canul-Tec et al., 2017</xref>). The structure shows Na<sup>+</sup> bound only at the Na2 position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Canul-Tec et al., 2017</xref>). However, two more Na<sup>+</sup> binding sites exist, Na1 and Na3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Canul-Tec et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Reyes et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boudker et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Yernool et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Verdon and Boudker, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Guskov et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Wang et al., 2019</xref>).

Consistently, step changes of the membrane potential from –100 to +60 mV resulted in transient currents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>), which decayed with a time constant in the 0.5 ms range (140 mM Na<sup>+</sup>), in the absence of glutamate. Non-specific currents were subtracted by applying 200 μM TBOA. In the presence of UCPH-101, the charge movement was still present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>), and the midpoint potential (a measure of Na<sup>+</sup> affinity) was not significantly changed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>). These results are consistent with the interpretation that Na<sup>+</sup> binding (most likely to the Na1 and Na3 sites) is not inhibited by bound UCPH-101 and occurs with similar affinity as in the absence of the inhibitor.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>UCPH-101 is a partial inhibitor of ASCT2</title><p>In the next paragraphs, we describe electrophysiological measurements on ASCT2 in the presence of UCPH-101, to test whether the inhibition mechanism is conserved between the EAAT1 and ASCT2 members of the SLC1 family. To corroborate the residues directly contributing to the UCPH-101-bound state in EAAT1 suggested by docking, we used molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, to investigate the stability of UCPH-101 in its EAAT1 binding pocket (Materials and methods).

Finally, as a control, we measured the distance between bound amino acid substrate and a residue in the binding site throughout the simulation. This distance remained stable throughout the simulations, until amino acid substrate dissociation occurred (dissociation is expected due to the low substrate affinity), illustrating convergence of our simulations and increasing the confidence in our approach.</p><p>To test the predictions from docking calculations and MD simulations, we next experimentally investigated the interaction of UCPH-101 with ASCT2<sub>WT</sub>, and transporters with mutations to the analogous positions in ASCT2, using electrophysiological characterization of anion current, which is activated during substrate exchange. Anion conductance is an indirect measure of ASCT2 transport activity, but was previously shown to correlate with transport activity (direct amino acid transport measurements are shown below) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Grewer and Grabsch, 2004</xref>). Typical anion currents, using the highly permeant anion SCN<sup>-</sup>, were inwardly directed, due to SCN<sup>-</sup> outflow through the ASCT2 anion conductance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). As expected, the anion currents increased with increasing serine concentration, with an apparent <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> of 280±40 μM. When serine was co-applied together with UCPH-101, the current was inhibited, but not to 100%, even at saturating [UCPH-101] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). In addition, inhibition required much higher UCPH-101 concentrations than in EAAT1. The UCPH-101 dose-response relationship, at a constant serine concentration of 100 μM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>) demonstrates maximum inhibition of about 45% at 200 μM UCPH-101, with an apparent <italic>K</italic><sub>i</sub> value of 77±20 μM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C and D</xref>).

In contrast to the wild-type transporter, UCPH-101 was able to block virtually 100% of the serine-induced inward current at a concentration of 200 μM in both F136Y and the double-mutant transporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B and C</xref>). However, no complete block was observed in ASCT2<sub>I237M</sub>, and the UCPH-101 interaction was of low affinity. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C and D</xref>). For the double-mutant F136Y/I237M transporter, the apparent UCPH-101 affinity was significantly increased over the wild-type transporter, at least at low [serine].

In contrast to EAAT1, ASCT2 is an amino acid exchanger, therefore, the experiments were performed in the exchange mode (saturating [Na<sup>+</sup>] and [amino acid] on the intracellular side of the membrane). Because ASCT2 amino acid exchange is electroneutral at equilibrium (equal net rate of forward and reverse charge movement), no steady-state current was observed under these conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>). However, upon rapid removal of extracellular amino acid, transient outward current was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>), due to the re-equilibration of the homo-exchange translocation equilibrium to favor the outward-facing conformation in the absence of external amino acid. In contrast to the EAATs, Na<sup>+</sup> apparent binding affinity to the <italic>apo</italic>-form of the ASCT2 transporter is high (<italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> &lt; 1 mM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zander et al., 2013</xref>]). Therefore, the Na<sup>+</sup> binding equilibria of the amino acid-free transporter are fully saturated at 140 mM external [Na<sup>+</sup>], and the amino acid-induced charge movement can only be caused by Na<sup>+</sup> binding to the amino acid-bound transporter, substrate translocation, or, most likely, both of those processes. Alanine and serine exchange was previously reported to be rapid in ASCT2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wang et al., 2022</xref>). Consistent with this proposal, transient transport current recovered much faster than in EAAT1 after amino acid removal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E and H</xref>), with a time constant of 15±0.2 ms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8H</xref>).</p><p>When the same paired-pulse serine solution exchange protocol was applied to ASCT2 in the presence of UCPH-101, similar transient currents were observed (inward upon serine application and outward upon removal), but the amplitude of the transient currents was significantly reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref>). However, similar to the observations from the anion currents, UCPH-101 was unable to completely block transient transport current. Residual inward transient current amplitude at 100 μM [UCPH-101] was 50% compared to control. As expected, UCPH-101 application alone did not generate any transient currents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8G</xref>). Recovery time of the current was increased twofold to 30±0.4 ms at 100 μM UCPH-101 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8H</xref>).

We therefore employed virtual screening of the ZINC20 lead-like library (3.8 million compounds) to identify potential binders (Materials and methods). We analyzed the top scoring compounds for closer inspection and selected compounds that made predicted hydrogen bonding interactions to side chains of the allosteric binding site. From the best compounds found in the virtual screening, 11 were tested experimentally. We tested the inhibitory effect at 100 µΜ of serine. One of these compounds (#302, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A</xref>, docking pose shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B</xref>) inhibited ASCT2 anion current (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10G and H</xref>), with an apparent <italic>K</italic><sub>i</sub> of 238±58 µM, as well as transient transport current elicited by the transported substrate L-serine. In addition, 300 μM compound #302 inhibited the peak amplitude of ASCT2 transient transport current after rapid application of 1 mM serine to 48 ± 6% of the control current (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10C and D</xref>).

First, UCPH-101 inhibits substrate transport by interfering with conformational changes associated with the substrate translocation reaction, rather than substrate and Na<sup>+</sup> binding. Second, the general location of the allosteric binding site of UCPH-101 is conserved between the SLC1 family members EAAT1 (glutamate transporter) and ASCT2 (neutral amino acid transporter), and possibly ASCT1, while the transporter side chains contributing to the binding pocket are not fully conserved. Third, occupancy of the allosteric binding site does not necessarily result in full inhibition of substrate transport, it can also lead to a partially active state, as seen for ASCT2<sub>WT</sub>’s interaction with UCPH-101. Our results are therefore in agreement with previous mutagenesis studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abrahamsen et al., 2013</xref>), suggesting that allosteric compounds may be found that modulate transport activity, rather than completely blocking it, even raising the possibility of allosteric modulators that increase transport activity by increasing the substrate translocation rate. Fourth, the allosteric ASCT2 binding site can be targeted by compounds that are non-UCPH-101-like in structure. Overall, these are novel findings that would warrant the further investigation of the allosteric binding site and the development of future, more potent compounds targeting it.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>UCPH-101 interaction with EAAT1</title><p>This report provides additional mechanistic information on the action of the allosteric inhibitor, UCPH-101 on EAATs. In agreement with previous studies, UCPH-101 shows the hallmark of a non-competitive inhibitor of EAAT1, that is, a lack of effect of substrate concentration on the inhibitor <italic>K</italic><sub>i</sub>. In addition, Na<sup>+</sup> affinity of the <italic>apo</italic>-transporter seems to be unaffected. We also concluded that UCPH-101 does not affect the substrate binding steps, mainly by analysis of the kinetics of pre-steady-state currents in the presence of UCPH-101. These conclusions are in agreement with the EAAT1 structure in complex with both UCPH-101 and a competitive inhibitor, TFB-TBOA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Shimamoto et al., 2004</xref>), which demonstrated that the allosteric and substrate binding sites can be occupied at the same time.</p><p>In contrast to substrate binding, we propose that the substrate translocation step is the major partial reaction that is blocked in the UCPH-101-bound state. This interpretation is based on the significant reduction of the amplitude and the rate of the transient current decay in response to glutamate application (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), which for EAAC1 was previously assigned to the glutamate translocation step. From a structural viewpoint, this interpretation is logical, and was proposed by Canul-Tec et al. in 2017 from the EAAT1 structure in complex with UCPH-101 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Canul-Tec et al., 2017</xref>). Since binding occurs at the interface between transport and the trimerization domain, it is likely that transport domain movements relative to the trimerization domain are affected by the occupied allosteric site, either fully inhibiting those movements or slowing them to attain partial activity.</p><p>The effect of UCPH-101 on the glutamate-induced anion current of EAAT1 fits with this interpretation. It was shown previously that UCPH-101 exhibits very slow binding and dissociation kinetics (on the 10 s second time scale), much slower than the partial reactions of the glutamate-induced transport process and the turnover rate (in the 10–30 s<sup>–1</sup> range). Therefore, it is likely that the UCPH-101-free and -bound states interconvert slowly on the time scale of transport. Thus, UCPH-101 reduces the amplitude of glutamate-induced anion and transport current, without a significant effect on the observed kinetics associated with these reactions.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Conserved modulatory allosteric mechanism in ASCT2</title><p>The development of novel inhibitors are essential steps for potential treatment of diseases, especially for ASCT2 transporter. In previous reports, overexpression of ASCT2 was observed in several cancer cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bröer et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Son et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Wahi and Holst, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kanai et al., 2013</xref>). Among the several published ASCT2 inhibitors, most of them target the substrate binding site. However, allosteric modulators would be useful because of the independence of their inhibitory effect on substrate concentration. The known allosteric binding pocket of EAAT1 as well as the biomedical importance of ASCT2 prompted us to investigate whether a similar allosteric mechanism is present in ASCT2; and, indeed, UCPH-101 was found to interact with this binding site. Therefore, the importance of this report lies in the generation of a new structural model proposed here to develop future novel allosteric modulators with the potential for higher affinity and specificity for ASCT2 in future compounds.</p><p>In the EAAT members of the SLC1 family, UCPH-101 was found to be specific for EAAT1. For example, in wild-type Glt-1 (EAAT2), no inhibition was observed, unless EAAT1/EAAT2 chimeras were generated that contained the EAAT1 N-terminal six transmembrane domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abrahamsen et al., 2013</xref>). In contrast to the EAATs, however, it was not known whether UCPH-101 can interact with the ASCT members of the SLC1 family. Our results reported here are, to our knowledge, the first to show that UCPH-101 inhibits ASCT2, providing evidence for the existence of the allosteric binding site in the same location as in EAAT1. While UCPH-101 is only a partial inhibitor of wild-type ASCT2, and its apparent inhibition constant is relatively high (low affinity, in the range of 100 μM), it demonstrates the principle of allosteric inhibition, or modulation of ASCT function through the allosteric binding site. Importantly, we were able to restore complete inhibition of substrate-induced anion current in mutant ASCT2 transporters, in which the proposed UCPH-101 binding site was modified to resemble that of EAAT1. In the double-mutant ASCT2<sub>F136Y/I237M</sub> the affinity was also increased compared to the wild-type transporter, although not reaching the high-affinity levels seen in EAAT1.</p><p>As expected, UCPH-101 shows the hallmarks of a non-competitive inhibitor for ASCT2<sub>WT</sub>, however, for the double-mutant transporter a mixed inhibition mechanism was observed, pointing to higher affinity of the <italic>apo</italic>-transporter for UCPH-101, compared to the substrate-bound form. The reason for this is not known, but somehow the UCPH-101 binding site in this mutant transporter must communicate with the substrate binding site. A proposed kinetic mechanism for inhibition of EAAT1/ASCT2 by UCPH-101 is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>, in analogy to previously published alternating access mechanisms for the SLC1 family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kanner and Bendahan, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kanner and Zomot, 2008</xref>). Here, UCPH-101 can bind to all of the states the transporter can access during the transport cycle, including substrate- and Na<sup>+</sup>-bound states. The reaction that is affected by occupation of the allosteric site is the translocation reaction, or reactions closely associated with it, such as Na<sup>+</sup> binding to the substrate-bound transporter. In EAAT1, due to the high affinity of the compound, equilibration of the UCPH-101-bound and -unbound states is slow, thus, UCPH-101 inhibits the transient and steady-state currents, with little effect on apparent transport kinetics. In essence, UCPH-101 acts by removing active EAAT1 transporters from the pool, thus inhibiting the overall transport rate. On the other hand, equilibration of the UCPH-101-bound and -unbound states is fast in ASCT2, therefore, kinetics of substrate-induced current activation and recovery are slowed in the presence of inhibitor. Thus, the kinetic mechanism shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref> can account for the subtleties of kinetic differences in UPCPH-101 effects between EAAT1 and ASCT2.</p><fig id="fig11" position="float"><label>Figure 11.</label><caption><title>Proposed simplified mechanism of inhibitors (<bold>U</bold>) targeting the allosteric binding site interacting with alanine serine cysteine transporter 2 (ASCT2) and excitatory amino acid transporter 1 (EAAT1) transporters (<bold>T</bold>).</title><p>The amino acid substrate is abbreviated as AA. Potential charges of the cation (Na<sup>+</sup>) and the transporter/substrate were omitted for simplicity, and only two of the three Na<sup>+</sup> binding steps are shown. For UCPH-101 interaction with EAAT1 the UCPH binding/dissociation process (transition from the first to the second row of the scheme) is slow, while this transition is fast for ASCT2, accounting for the differential effect of UCPH-101 on transport kinetics of both transporters.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-83464-fig11-v3.tif"/></fig><p>One limitation with current compounds targeting ASCT2 for cancer therapy is that they are amino acid-like compounds targeting the substrate binding site, and thus have poor pharmacokinetics. Interestingly, we were able to identify a compound with a structure unrelated to UCPH-101, compound #302, which inhibited wild-type ASCT2 in a non-competitive manner, although at relatively high concentrations and, like UCPH-101, showing only partial inhibition of the transient transport current elicited by substrate application. This compound was found from virtual screening against the putative allosteric binding site. Interestingly compound #302 also inhibited ASCT1, in which the critical residues in the allosteric binding site are similar to ASCT2. Like UCPH-101, compound #302 is relatively hydrophobic and harbors an amino function. However, it also has a OH group, suggesting that additional hydrophilic interaction may be important in the allosteric binding site. These results further support the presence of the allosteric binding site in ASCT2 and suggest that it may be possible to identify allosteric inhibitors of ASCT2 with novel scaffolds, opening new avenues for future structure-activity relationship studies, to improve affinity and specificity.</p><p>ASCT2 has recently received attention due to its involvement in neutral amino acid homeostasis in cells, in particular cancer cells. It was shown that down-regulation of ASCT2 function either by siRNA or by competitive inhibitors, can block the growth of cancer cells in cell-line models, as well as in vivo tumor transplants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ni et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wang et al., 2015</xref>). Competitive inhibitors have the disadvantage of becoming less effective as the amino acid concentration rises. Having allosteric inhibitors available would result in amino acid concentration independent block of ASCT2 function, which would be much more desirable for pharmacological applications. The existence of the allosteric binding site on ASCT2 raises the possibility that such compounds could be developed, which, in contrast to UCPH-101, would result in complete inhibition of transporter function.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The results presented in this report reveal a conserved allosteric inhibition mechanism for SLC1 members for the first time. The results suggest that the major effect of the compound, once bound to the binding site at the interface between the transport and trimerization domain, is to block reactions associated with substrate translocation and anion conductance activation. In contrast, other partial reactions, such as substrate and Na<sup>+</sup> binding can still take place, although the electrogenicity of Na<sup>+</sup> binding is reduced, pointing to a slight conformational change of the substrate-free transporter state induced by UCPH-101. While UCPH-101 is a partial and weak inhibitor of wild-type ASCT2, complete inhibition could be restored by mutating the UCPH-101 binding site to one that resembles EAAT1. Therefore, our results suggest that ASCT2 also harbors the allosteric binding site, however, with differences in the amino acid side chains contributing to the site. These results raise the possibility that this allosteric binding site can be exploited by future compounds specifically targeting ASCT2. Our results involving the novel inhibitor compound #302 further confirm the location of the allosteric binding site in ASCT and suggest that compounds with varying chemical scaffolds could be found that modulate or completely inhibit SLC1 activity. In light of the emerging role of ASCT2 as an anti-cancer drug target, the future characterization of this allosteric site appears promising.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell culture and transfection</title><p>HEK293 cells (American Type Culture Collection, ATCC No. CRL 1573) were cultured as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wang et al., 2022</xref>).

We purchased 11 molecules for experimental testing.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing - original draft, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing - original draft, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Software, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Project administration, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing - original draft, Project administration, Writing - review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media xlink:href="elife-83464-mdarchecklist1-v3.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="scode1"><label>Source code 1.</label><caption><title>UCPH-101 parameter file.</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-83464-code1-v3.zip" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="zip"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="scode2"><label>Source code 2.</label><caption><title>UCPH-101 rtf file.</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-83464-code2-v3.zip" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="zip"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>All data generated or analyzed during this study are included in the manuscript and supporting file.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Randy B Stockbridge as Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Richard Aldrich as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The following revisions are essential to support the central claims of the manuscript regarding the conservation of an allosteric inhibition site in SLC1 transporters:</p><p>1. The MD simulations should include detailed convergence analyses to support the conclusions. According the X-ray crystal structure, the UCPH-101 binding pocket is only accessible via the lipid membrane. It seems unlikely that the 100-ns timescales of the simulations is sufficiently long to permit conclusions to be drawn. The minimum length of the MD replicas should be chosen such that complete dissociation of UCPH-101 is observed in all the ASCT2 replicas. The authors should also comment on how independence of the simulation replicas is ensured.</p><p>2. A major conclusion of the paper is that ASCT2 and EAAT1 share a conserved allosteric inhibition mechanism. However, the reviewers are not convinced that an allosteric inhibition mechanism has been established for ASCT2. The data for UPC101 suggests a mixed inhibition mechanism (lines 460-465 and Figure 7). The authors should comment on why the mechanism of UPC101 inhibition differs for the two SLC1 subtypes. Likewise, the evidence that #302 acts as an allosteric inhibitor (i.e., that the inhibition constant is independent of substrate concentration) is quite sparse, since inhibition was only tested at two substrate concentrations, and different inhibitor concentrations were used at these two substrate concentrations. An experiment with constant #302 concentration and varying substrate concentration should be performed to establish the allosteric inhibition mechanism.</p><p>3. The only evidence that #302 binds to the same binding pocket as UPC101 is from docking studies. The authors should provide data that #302 binds in the same pocket in ASCT-2 as UCPH-101, for example by testing the same point mutations that were used for the UCPH-101 experiments.</p><p>4. The manuscript is written in a very technical manner. The reviewers recommend that the authors revise the manuscript for readability, taking into consideration <italic>eLife</italic>'s broad readership. In addition, the studies of UPC101 inhibition of EAAT1 largely confirm previous studies that established the allosteric inhibition mechanism (PMID: 35192345; PMID: 33597752). In the text, the authors should clearly explain how their studies of UPC101/EAAT1 inhibition are significant advances beyond what is already known about the inhibition mechanism, or consider shifting the emphasis of the paper towards the more novel studies involving ASCT2 mutagenesis and inhibition.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The manuscript is written in a very technical way and should be edited to improve readership by a broader <italic>eLife</italic> community.</p><p>Throughout, 'trimerization' and 'scaffold' domain are used interchangeably. One term to describe this domain should be selected and used throughout the manuscript.</p><p>Line 24: the EAAT1 structure was solved by X-ray crystallography, not cryo-EM.</p><p>Line 53: the counter-transport of K<sup>+</sup> and co-transport of H<sup>+</sup> that also occur with glutamate transport are not mentioned.</p><p>Line 63-64: the description of the TMD making up the transport domain and the scaffold domain is incorrect.</p><p>Figure 1. in panel B, TFB-TBOA and UCPH-101 should be indicated clearly with labels and different colors.

To fit with the broader readership of <italic>eLife</italic> (also see Editor's comment), we have completely revised the section of the manuscript on the mechanism of UCPH-101 interaction with EAAT1, removing the overly-technical detail, in particular the caged glutamate experiments (previous Figure S3), which do not contribute strongly to the general conclusions. We also revised the Discussion section accordingly. For the ASCT2 Results section, however, we believe that a thorough description of the anion-current vs transport-current recording experiments, as well as the paired-pulse analysis, are crucial for the non-expert reader to be able to follow the interpretation of the data. Therefore, we made less substantial changes to this section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Throughout, 'trimerization' and 'scaffold' domain are used interchangeably.

We have revised this paragraph to make this point more clear.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Table 1 shows the Km for various substrates for the ASCT2 mutants.

For serine as the substrate, this is clearly the case. However, for alanine and glutamine, some deviations from this expectation were noted. The reason for this is not clear, because these residues are far from the substrate binding site, as the reviewer points out. We can speculate that there are some indirect effects of these mutations on ASCT2 function that are not related to their contribution to the proposed allosteric site. We added a sentence explaining this in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 7D.

This needs to be clarified.</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, this is correct, the [serine] dependence of the K<sub>i</sub> for UCPH-101 is consistent with an inhibition mechanism, in which the compound binds somewhat more strongly to the mutant transporters in the absence of serine than in the presence, in other words a mixed mechanism. We have now revised this sentence, see also response to Reviewer #1, who also raised this point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Did the authors test if UCPH-101 inhibits the more closely related ASCT1? What is the conservation like in the UCPH-101 binding site?</p></disp-quote><p>This is a great point. Yes, UCPH101 also inhibits ASCT1 function. However, we feel that detailed analysis of the effect on ASCT1 is beyond the scope of this manuscript. Instead, we also tested our new compound, #302, with ASCT1 and it does, in fact, inhibit ASCT1 substrate-induced currents (new Figure 10J). This is expected, since the predicted allosteric binding site is largely conserved between ASCTs 1 and 2 (see revised sequence alignment in the supplement, which now includes ASCT1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>(1) I strongly recommend to include experimental evidence that (i) compound #302 also mediates allosteric inhibition (i.e., that the inhibition constant is independent of substrate concentration) and (ii) that it binds to the same binding pocket in ASCT-2 as UCPH-101 (perhaps using the same point mutations that you have used for the UCPH-101 experiments).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree.

Even with a 5-fold extended time scale, we observed only two UCPH dissociation events for ASCT2<sub>WT</sub> (total of six trajectories, dissociation occurred into the lipid bilayer), and none for the double mutant transporter. In our view, this points to the occluded nature of UCPH-101 in the binding site of the transporter, resulting in slow dissociation kinetics, consistent with experimental results. Unfortunately, due to time restrictions, we were not able to run these simulations at an even longer time scale.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Furthermore, Figure 5 suggests you conducted four simulation replicas for each condition, whereas the main text says you have six replicas (line 388), what is correct?</p><p>Finally, how did you ensure independence of your simulation replicas?</p></disp-quote><p>We performed six replicas, but only four are shown in Figure 5.

Please provide this information.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the omission of this critical point. The information on the parametrization of UCPH101 is now provided in the original data (deposited parameter and topology files). We did not use physical chemistry experimentation to validate UCPH-101 MD parameters. Since the MS results are supportive in nature, and not critical to the overall conclusions, we feel that experimental validation is beyond the scope for this manuscript.</p></body></sub-article></article>
