It later proved to be an ideal laboratory organism that was easy to maintain due to its small body size, and its simple dietary and habitat requirements. The combination of a sexual dimorphism, short generation times, large and transparent eggs with easily observable development, high tolerance to inbreeding and a comparably small genome size (~700 Mb) also made medaka suitable for a wide range of studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Braasch et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kasahara et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kirchmaier et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Parenti, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Wittbrodt et al., 2002</xref>). Today, the medaka is a fully fledged model vertebrate that is deeply rooted within the life sciences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hori, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kirchmaier et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Shima and Mitani, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Takeda and Shimada, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Wittbrodt et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>Early systematic crossing of color mutants of medaka provided evidence for Mendelian inheritance in vertebrates, sex limited inheritance and crossing over between sex chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aida, 1921</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ishikawa, 1913</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Toyama, 1916</xref>). Subsequently, the first hormone induced sex-reversal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Yamamoto, 1958</xref>) and the discovery of the first sex determining gene in a non-mammalian vertebrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Matsuda et al., 2002</xref>) paved the way for the medaka as a model for sex determination and sex differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kondo et al., 2009</xref>). Scientific milestones achieved with the medaka further include the detection of the first active DNA-based transposable element (<italic>Tol1</italic>) in a vertebrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Koga et al., 1995</xref>), which laid the foundation for the development of several tools for genetic modification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Koga, 2011</xref>).</p><p>Over time, medaka developed into a model for development, toxicology, carcinogenesis and behavior and a growing number of inbred strains in combination with an expanding genetic toolbox provided ever growing resources for genetic studies (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kirchmaier et al., 2015</xref>). Medaka’s role as genomic model organism was consolidated when its genome became available as one of the first for any vertebrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kasahara et al., 2007</xref>). More recently, the gene-editing tool CRISPR/Cas9 was also established in medaka and employed in multiple studies (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gutierrez-Triana et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Letelier et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Murakami et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Watakabe et al., 2018</xref>). In many fields, including cancer research, medaka serves as complementary model to the well-established zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Schartl and Walter, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Takeda and Shimada, 2010</xref>). In particular, the natural variation captured in several inbred strains and an isogenic panel offers a unique resource to study allelic variation including disease modifier genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Schartl and Walter, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Spivakov et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Due to its long and successful history as a model organism, several comprehensive reviews focus on the medaka and its role in different fields of research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kinoshita et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kirchmaier et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Naruse et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Shima and Mitani, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Takeda and Shimada, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Wittbrodt et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Yamamoto, 1975</xref>). In contrast, the natural history of the medaka and its relatives has so far gained comparatively little attention. This is despite the fact that particularly Japanese biologists have been working on ricefishes for decades, which generated a more complete knowledge of <italic>O. latipes</italic> and its relatives than is available for many other fish species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Iwamatsu, 2006</xref>). However, some of this work is not available in English and thus is less accessible to the international research community. Furthermore, studies have highlighted a so far underexplored ricefish diversity in the wild (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Katsumura et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Parenti, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Takehana et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Uwa et al., 1988</xref>), which has already inspired new research agendas (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Matsuda and Sakaizumi, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Mokodongan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Spivakov et al., 2014</xref>). The combination of available medaka resources and the diversity of its wild relatives represent a treasure trove to target various aspects of biology, which will equally expand our insight into the medaka as a model system. Here, we focus on the natural history of ricefishes and point out recent progress as well as remaining potential for studies focusing on their natural diversity.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Medaka’s life in the wild</title><p>Medaka species are distributed in Japan, China, Taiwan and Korea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Shima and Mitani, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Yamamoto, 1975</xref>), where they are mainly found in standing and slow-flowing water bodies such as rice paddies, ponds and agricultural channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fukuda et al., 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The preferred habitats of medaka are shallow zones close to the shoreline with abundant plant cover where it feeds on microscopic organisms, including algae and zooplankton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Edeline et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fukuda et al., 2005</xref>). Although detailed studies on its position in the food web are lacking, medaka is likely mainly preyed upon by dragonfly larvae, birds and predatory fishes. Throughout its life, medaka is parasitized by both ectoparasites and endoparasites from across the animal kingdom (catalogued in: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Nagasawa, 2017</xref>), and females appear to be particularly susceptible to ectoparasites during the breeding season (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Edeline et al., 2016</xref>). In the wild, most medaka have a lifespan of roughly one year during which males and females can reach a length between three and four centimeters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Leaf et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Parenti, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Shima and Mitani, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Yamamoto, 1975</xref>). In captivity, medaka may live for more than four years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Egami and Etoh, 1969</xref>). As an inhabitant of the temperate zone, medaka is confronted with and tolerates a wide range of temperatures, from 4°C to 40°C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kinoshita et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Sampetrean et al., 2009</xref>). When the water cools down, fish enter a state of hibernation during which they barely move and stop feeding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Edeline et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kinoshita et al., 2009</xref>). Cooling has been used in the lab to slow down the life cycle of medaka and store it for later use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Wittbrodt et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>During the breeding season, medaka spawns every morning around sunrise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Leaf et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Ueda and Oishi, 1982</xref>). Mating involves an intricate courtship dance during which males repeatedly approach females and exhibit diverse displays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Ono and Uematsu, 1957</xref>). If accepted, males hold on to the females with their elongated anal and dorsal fins, while females spawn up to 48 eggs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Leaf et al., 2011</xref>). Bundles of fertilized eggs stay attached to the mother’s ovarian cavity via attaching filaments for up to a few hours, before they are deposited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Parenti, 2005</xref>). Despite its practical use in the laboratory to easily harvest eggs from unambiguously identifiable mothers, the reasons for the evolution of this unusual reproductive strategy remain unexplored. Juveniles finally hatch after 7–9 days and grow to maturity within about two and a half months (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Iwamatsu, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Takeda and Shimada, 2010</xref>).</p><p>Overall, relatively little of our current knowledge on the biology of medaka has been gathered from studies in the wild.

While most ricefishes deposit fertilized eggs shortly after spawning, pelvic brooders instead carry an egg-clutch in a ventral concavity until the fry hatches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="box2fig1">Box 2—figure 1</xref>). Pelvic brooding likely relies on a complex set of adaptations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Iwamatsu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Iwamatsu et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Kottelat, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Parenti, 2008</xref>). Elongated pelvic fins cover the eggs, while a plug structure that is connected to the eggs via attaching filaments anchors them inside the female’s ovarian cavity. Ovulation is delayed in pelvic brooders for as long as eggs are attached, and the plug was even assumed to allow the transfer of nutrients, akin to a placenta (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Iwamatsu et al., 2008</xref>). Despite this complexity, pelvic brooding occurs in at least three species from two lineages, namely <italic>Adrianichthys oophorus, Oryzias eversi</italic> and <italic>Oryzias sarasinorum</italic>. This means it was either lost multiple times or evolved twice independently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Mandagi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Mokodongan and Yamahira, 2015</xref>). Pelvic brooding was suggested to have evolved in adaptation to the absence of suitable spawning substrates in pelagic habitats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Herder et al., 2012a</xref>). The recent discovery of the oviparous <italic>O. dopingdopingensis</italic> by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Mandagi et al. (2018)</xref>, a sister species of the pelvic brooding <italic>O. sarasinorum</italic> and <italic>O. eversi,</italic> in a river in central Sulawesi might be considered as support for this hypothesis. However, the pelvic brooding <italic>O. eversi</italic> was described from a spring where potential spawning substrates are abundant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Herder et al., 2012a</xref>). Consequently, the eco-evolutionary dynamics promoting pelvic brooding as well as the underlying molecular mechanisms remain virtually unknown.</p><fig id="box2fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46994.006</object-id><label>Box 2—figure 1.</label><caption><title>Overview of pelvic brooding.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The pelvic brooding ricefish <italic>O. eversi</italic> carries its eggs until the fry hatches (dashed box indicates section depicted in (<bold>C</bold>)).

They differ in a number of traits including craniofacial anatomy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kimura et al., 2007</xref>), body coloration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Asai et al., 2011</xref>), aggressiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kagawa, 2014</xref>) and the degree of sexual dimorphism of the dorsal fin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Asai et al., 2011</xref>), the last of which is likely mediated by different sex steroid levels during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Katsumura et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kawajiri et al., 2015</xref>). Nonetheless, both species produce viable hybrid offspring in the laboratory (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Murata et al., 2012</xref>) and current evidence also suggests limited gene flow in the wild (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Iguchi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Katsumura et al., 2019</xref>). <italic>Oryzias latipes</italic> and <italic>O. sakaizumii</italic> thus offer the opportunity to gain insight into the evolution of physiological and behavioral trait disparity and their genetic bases. Recent insight into the biogeography of the medaka also suggests that <italic>O. latipes</italic> colonized the main island of Japan from the south (i.e., from Kyushu) and subsequently dispersed along the Pacific coast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Katsumura et al., 2019</xref>).

Additionally, juveniles of <italic>O. sakaizumii</italic> from higher latitudes compensate for a shorter growing season further north with faster growth rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Yamahira and Takeshi, 2008</xref>). However, faster growth, which is achieved by higher feeding rates, comes with a cost and is accompanied by higher vulnerability for predation by dragonfly larvae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Suzuki et al., 2010</xref>). Hence, different growth capacities in <italic>O. sakaizumii</italic> likely evolve in response to both predation pressure and length of the growing season (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Suzuki et al., 2010</xref>).

However, this study illustrates the caveats related to taxonomic uncertainties, because the authors unintentionally compared populations of different species and thus did not take other interspecific differences into consideration.

Nonetheless, the ricefishes known to science exhibit striking functional diversity, with relatively little of it understood or even investigated so far. In the following paragraphs we highlight research making use of ricefish diversity together with aspects that appear especially promising for future research endeavors.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Sex determination</title><p>Sex determination mechanisms are highly variable in bony fishes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Heule et al., 2014</xref>) and genetic sex determination (SD) appears to be particularly diverse in ricefishes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kondo et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Matsuda and Sakaizumi, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Myosho et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Takehana et al., 2007a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Takehana et al., 2007b</xref>).

Interestingly, <italic>Oryzias latipes</italic> can better adjust to saltwater when exposed to elevated levels of salinity earlier in life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Miyanishi et al., 2016</xref>).

While most ricefishes are largely pale in color, Sulawesi ricefishes exhibit several different fin and nuptial colorations and males in the <italic>O. woworae</italic> complex evolved an outstanding iridescent blue ornamentation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Parenti et al., 2013</xref>). This diversity allows us to expand on the tremendous knowledge of medaka color mutants and to investigate, for example, its genetic basis and the evolutionary role of coloration disparity in ricefishes. Ricefishes further have a wide range of body shapes and sizes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Parenti, 2008</xref>). Within the <italic>O. woworae</italic> species complex there is variation in body depth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Parenti et al., 2013</xref>), which likely evolved in response to different flow regimes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Mokodongan et al., 2018</xref>) and raises the question of interspecific diversity and plasticity of this trait. The largest ricefish <italic>A. poptae</italic> from the ancient Lake Poso reaches more than ten times the size of miniature species such as <italic>O. mekongensis</italic> (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Parenti, 2008</xref>). Investigating the evolutionary mechanisms that gave rise to the sympatric ricefish species flocks from Lake Poso (namely <italic>Oryzias orthognathus</italic>, <italic>O. nigrimas</italic>, <italic>O. nebulosus</italic> and <italic>Adrianichthys oophorus, A. kruyti, A. roseni, A. poptae</italic>) appears particularly intriguing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Mokodongan and Yamahira, 2015</xref>). Virtually nothing is known about the ecology and evolution of these species, but striking differences in their craniofacial anatomy point at specialization in their feeding habits as a potential driver of lineage diversification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Parenti, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Parenti and Soeroto, 2004</xref>). Finally, a new reproductive strategy referred to as “pelvic brooding” has evolved in at least two lineages from Sulawesi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Herder et al., 2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Kottelat, 1990</xref>). Pelvic brooders do not deposit fertilized eggs, but instead carry their clutch until the fry hatches (<xref ref-type="box" rid="box2">Box 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Iwamatsu, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Iwamatsu et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Parenti, 2008</xref>). While this innovation likely relies on a complex set of behavioral, physiological and anatomical adaptations, the adaptive benefit of this female investment remains unexplored.

Only seven out of 21 assessed ricefish species are classified as least concerned according to the IUCN Red List. However, much of the currently available data needs to be treated with caution because the majority of species assessments based on sufficient data were carried out more than two decades ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">IUCN, 2019</xref>). What is known is that the high endemism among Sulawesi ricefishes, which are threatened by invasive species, habitat destruction, intensive fishing and pollution, makes them particularly vulnerable for extinction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Herder et al., 2012b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hilgers et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Mokodongan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Parenti, 2008</xref>). Accordingly, the Lake Poso endemics <italic>A. roseni</italic> and <italic>A. kuyti</italic>, which have not been caught since 1978 and 1983, respectively, are either on the brink of extinction or have already gone extinct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Kottelat, 1990</xref>). However, severe threats are not restricted to medaka’s relatives from Sulawesi. Populations of both Japanese ricefish species have reportedly been declining, particularly in densely populated regions and where exotic species have been introduced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Asai et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Mamun et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Parenti, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Parenti and Soeroto, 2004</xref>).

The taxonomic debate around medaka that is fueled by recent insights clearly calls for further investigations, particularly targeting continental medaka species. Combining the tools and resources available for medaka with the diversity of its wild relatives harbors tremendous potential for evolutionary biology. In turn, putting our knowledge on medaka into an evolutionary context may inspire and inform further research in the fields that have traditionally used medaka as a model organism. Sulawesi appears to be an obvious focal point for studying the evolution of ricefish diversity. Conservation efforts targeting some of the ricefish species that are most interesting to science and which appear to be on the brink of extinction are urgently needed. Finally, exciting new research opportunities on medaka arise from the recent establishment of new gene-editing tools and the first isogenic population genetic panel for a vertebrate, which will allow interactions between genotype and environment to be dissected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Spivakov et al., 2014</xref>).</p></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Fabian Herder, Manfred Schartl, Bernhard Misof, Arne Nolte and the entire AG RICEFISH for helpful discussions and comments to a previous version of this manuscript.

interests of transparency, eLife includes the editorial decision letter and accompanying author responses. A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;The Natural History of Model Organisms: The untapped potential of medaka's wild relatives&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by two Features Editors at <italic>eLife</italic> (Stuart King and Peter Rodgers). The following individuals involved in review of your submission have also agreed to reveal their identity: Kiyoshi Naruse (Reviewer #2); Lynne Parenti (Reviewer #3).</p><p>After a consultation with the reviewers, the editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This essay is being considered as part of a series of articles on &quot;The Natural History of Model Organisms&quot; (https://elifesciences.org/collections/8de90445/the-natural-history-of-model-organisms). Each article should explain how our knowledge of the natural history of a model organism has informed recent advances in biology, and how understanding its natural history can influence/advance future studies.</p><p>This article on the &quot;untapped potential of medaka's wild relatives&quot; sheds interesting light on under-explored resources around the long-established genetic model system: the Japanese ricefish or medaka. The authors swiftly review the history and advantages of medaka as a model system before highlighting the possible application of medaka and its relatives for the context of evolutionary biology. The editors and reviewers share the authors' conviction that this article will interest a wide audience that includes scientists working with medaka in the lab, and evolutionary biologists with a focus on other natural model systems. However, a number of details should be attended to prior to publication.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The reviewers believe that the revised article could do more to acknowledge prior work involving medaka. In particular, Japanese biologists have been comparing their native ricefish species to those found throughout Asia for decades and, as a result, more is known about Oryzias latipes and its close relatives than about many other species of fishes. For example, Takashi Iwamatsu's multiple editions of The Integrated Book for the Biology of the Medaka (most recent edition 2018) are remarkably detailed and comparative texts available in Japanese. The revision should avoid any phrases that could be misinterpreted as a dismissal of this knowledge (e.g. &quot;surprisingly little is known about the natural history of medaka&quot;).</p><p>2) To further highlight the potential of this model system, reviewer #1 has suggested adding an additional paragraph that discusses how new technical advances could help to convert the described diversity in the natural resources into a molecular understanding of evolutionary processes, such as adaptation and speciation.</p><p>3) The article uses the word &quot;medaka&quot; in several ways: once to mean <italic>Oryzias latipes</italic> (Introduction, second paragraph); a second time to mean <italic>O. latipes</italic> and <italic>O. sakaizumii</italic> (publications on the Japanese Medaka before 2011 referred to general characteristics of both of these species unless the particular population was specified); and a third to mean the <italic>O. latipes</italic> complex (Introduction, first paragraph and subsection “Medaka’s life in the wild”). Further, the article also uses &quot;medaka&quot; as a collective and a singular noun. Though this is a common problem when the meaning of a word is changed, it may confuse readers. All of these species have unique common names, so please revise the article with this in mind. Reviewer #3 suggested adding a table of scientific names along with those common names to help readers sort through this information.</p><p>4) Reviewer #2 felt that, while they are described as <italic>Oryzias latipes</italic> from the Aichi Prefecture (Aichi-ken), the fish depicted in Figure 1A-B look more like an orange-red variety rather than the wild type brown. Please consider changing the figure legend to acknowledge this, or finding new photos that more clearly show the brown coloration of wild type medaka.</p><p>5) Reviewer #2 also thought that the distribution of the ricefish family (Adrianichthyidae) in Figure 1D was potentially misleading. To our knowledge, there is no information about distribution of these fish inside the Asian continent, especially in the Himalayan area. We are also unaware of any information about the <italic>Oryzias latipes</italic> species complex around Hong Kong (subsection “Medaka’s life in the wild”, first paragraph). The revised article should provide additional references to support these claims, or revise the figures and the text to match the distributions described in previous studies.</p><p>6) Box 2's discussion of the pelvic brooding could benefit from the inclusion of the recently described species, <italic>Oryzias dopingdopingensis</italic> [Mandagi et al., 2018]. This species is a sister species of <italic>O. eversi</italic> and <italic>O. sarasinorum</italic>, both of which live in lake habitats and have pelvic fin brooding system. <italic>O. dopingdopingensis</italic>, on the other hand, lives in a river system and deposits its fertilized eggs on substrates around its habitat. The reviewers feel that these details are important in the context of the evolutionary scenario of the pelvic fin brooding system in <italic>Oryzias</italic> in Sulawesi.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46994.009</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The reviewers believe that the revised article could do more to acknowledge prior work involving medaka.

To avoid statements that could be misinterpreted as dismissal of knowledge based on prior work, we followed the reviewers’ advice and now reference Iwamatsu’s “The integrated book for the biology of the medaka” and added all further citations mentioned by the reviewers. As suggested by reviewer #3 we further changed: &quot;surprisingly little is known about the natural history of medaka&quot; to “there is much more we can learn about the natural history of medaka”.</p><p>Additionally: “Overall, very little of our current knowledge on the biology of medaka has been gathered from studies in the wild.” has been modified to “Overall, relatively little of our current knowledge on the biology of medaka has been gathered from studies in the wild.”</p><p>Finally, to further acknowledge previous achievements, yet still underline the contrast between knowledge on the model system and the natural history of ricefishes, we modified the following section, which now reads:</p><p>“This is despite the fact that particularly Japanese biologists have been working on ricefishes for decades, which generated a more complete knowledge of <italic>O. latipes</italic> and its relatives than is available for many other fish species (Iwamatsu, 2006). However, some of this work is not available in English and thus remains hardly accessible for the international research community. Furthermore, studies have highlighted a so far underexplored ricefish diversity in the wild (Katsumura et al., 2018; Parenti, 2008; Takehana et al., 2005; Uwa et al., 1988), which has already inspired novel research agendas (e.g., Matsuda and Sakaizumi, 2016; Mokodongan et al., 2018; Spivakov et al., 2014).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) To further highlight the potential of this model system, reviewer #1 has suggested adding an additional paragraph that discusses how new technical advances could help to convert the described diversity in the natural resources into a molecular understanding of evolutionary processes, such as adaptation and speciation.</p></disp-quote><p>We are grateful for the suggestion of reviewer #1 to add an additional paragraph that discusses how recent technical advances can be used to generate a better understanding of the molecular processes that gave rise to the previously discussed natural diversity of ricefishes. We agree that this may be an interesting addition and thus included a short paragraph that discusses recent advances together with some of the benefits that may be employed to shed light onto the evolution of ricefish diversity.</p><p>“New opportunities: Technological advances</p><p>Technological progress continues to open up new opportunities to study the molecular basis of the natural ricefish diversity. Genome evolution can now be studied using long sequencing reads (Eid et al., 2009; Jain et al., 2018; Vaser et al., 2017) to shed light on the contribution of structural variants (see Sedlazeck et al., 2018) and methylation patterns (Simpson et al., 2017) to adaptation and speciation in ricefishes. Additionally, the development of single cell transcriptome sequencing enables insight into cell-specific gene expression patterns (Andrews and Hemberg, 2018; Fiers et al., 2018; Tang et al., 2010). Single cell transcriptome sequencing can for example be employed to study the evolution of gene regulatory networks underlying sex determination. All of these technologies can help to identify candidate loci that potentially contribute to evolutionary processes of interest. Intriguingly, phenotypic effects of natural genetic variation at these loci can now be assessed using the gene editing tool CRISPR/Cas9 (Gutierrez-Triana et al., 2018; Letelier et al., 2018; Murakami et al., 2017; Watakabe et al., 2018). Consequently, recent technological advances will facilitate converting the described natural ricefish diversity into a better understanding of the molecular basis of evolutionary processes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The article uses the word &quot;medaka&quot; in several ways: once to mean <italic>Oryzias latipes</italic> (Introduction, second paragraph); a second time to mean <italic>O. latipes</italic> and <italic>O. sakaizumii</italic> (publications on the Japanese Medaka before 2011 referred to general characteristics of both of these species unless the particular population was specified); and a third to mean the <italic>O. latipes</italic> complex (Introduction, first paragraph and subsection “Medaka’s life in the wild”).

We agree that this may cause confusion and have revised the manuscript accordingly. Hence, medaka is only used as singular noun in the revised manuscript. Further, we only use the term “medaka” to collectively refer to lineages within the <italic>Oryzias latipes</italic> species complex in the context of the model system. We stick to common or scientific species names when we specifically refer to individual lineages. Furthermore, to help readers sort through this information, we added Table 1 – Medaka nomenclature, which explains our use of medaka within this manuscript. Additionally, to assist the reader, we follow the recommendation of reviewer #3 and added Table 1 with common and scientific names of species in the <italic>Oryzias latipes</italic> species complex.</p><p>The explanatory text in Table 1 now reads:</p><p>“The model organism medaka comprises several species and deeply divergent lineages from the <italic>Oryzias latipes</italic> species complex. Hence, in this article we only use the term “medaka” when we collectively refer to lineages within the <italic>Oryzias latipes</italic> species complex in the context of the model system. Common or scientific species names are used to specifically refer to individual lineages as shown in Table 1.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Reviewer #2 felt that, while they are described as <italic>Oryzias latipes</italic> from the Aichi Prefecture (Aichi-ken), the fish depicted in Figure 1A-B look more like an orange-red variety rather than the wild type brown. Please consider changing the figure legend to acknowledge this, or finding new photos that more clearly show the brown coloration of wild type medaka.</p></disp-quote><p>We followed reviewer #2’s suggestion and chose a different photograph for which no doubt exists with respect to type or locality. The figure and figure legend have been modified accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Reviewer #2 also thought that the distribution of the ricefish family (Adrianichthyidae) in Figure 1D was potentially misleading.

Within this study it is also stated that medaka is “widely distributed throughout eastern China, Hong Kong and Hainan Is.”. However, since we lack definite evidence for the distribution of medaka in Hong Kong and this is not an essential point within this manuscript, we decided to remove “Hong Kong”. To point out the reference we followed in preparing Figure 1C, we now explicitly reference Parenti, 2008, in the figure legend. Additionally, we recognize reviewer #2’s concern and now stress that this is an approximation of distributional limits and not a map of known distribution. This modification was also suggested by reviewer #3. The respective section of the figure legend now reads:</p><p>”(C) Approximate distributional limits of Adrianichthyidae (black) following Parenti, 2008, with the locations from which some of the most famous medaka strains are derived (blue).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Box 2's discussion of the pelvic brooding could benefit from the inclusion of the recently described species, <italic>Oryzias dopingdopingensis</italic> [Mandagi et al., 2018].

However, <italic>O. eversi</italic> does not occur in a lake habitat (see Herder et al. 2012a). To further discuss the potential implication of the recent description of <italic>O. dopingdopingensis</italic>, but also point out the somewhat contradictory evidence for pelvic brooding as an open water adaptation, we modified the following section. “Pelvic brooding was suggested to have evolved in adaptation to the absence of suitable spawning substrates in pelagic habitats (Herder et al., 2012a). The recent discovery of the oviparous <italic>O. dopingdopingensis</italic> Mandagi et al., (2018), a sister species of the pelvic brooding <italic>O. sarasinorum</italic> and <italic>O. eversi,</italic> in doping-doping river might be considered as support for this hypothesis. However, the pelvic brooding <italic>O. eversi</italic> was also described from a river (Herder et al., 2012a). Consequently, the eco-evolutionary dynamics promoting pelvic brooding as well as the underlying molecular mechanisms remain virtually unknown.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
