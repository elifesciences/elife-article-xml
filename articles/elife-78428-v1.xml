detailed neurophysiological mechanisms at a network level remain unclear. We recorded local field potentials (LFPs) from the dorsal medial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) and basolateral amygdala (BLA) while male mice engaged on social behavior. We found that in wild-type mice, both the dmPFC and BLA increased 4–7 Hz oscillation power and decreased 30–60 Hz power when they needed to attend to another target mouse. In mouse models with reduced social interactions, dmPFC 4–7 Hz power further increased especially when they exhibited social avoidance behavior. In contrast, dmPFC and BLA decreased 4–7 Hz power when wild-type mice socially approached a target mouse. Frequency-specific optogenetic manipulations replicating social approach-related LFP patterns restored social interaction behavior in socially deficient mice. These results demonstrate a neurophysiological substrate of the prefrontal cortex and amygdala related to social behavior and provide a unified pathophysiological understanding of neuronal population dynamics underlying social behavioral deficits.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>prefrontal cortex</kwd><kwd>amygdala</kwd><kwd>social

Vertes, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Adhikari et al., 2015</xref>) and plays central roles in emotional responses such as fear and anxiety. A number of gene expression patterns and intracellular signaling pathways related to social behavior have been identified in the mPFC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bicks et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Schubert et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yan and Rein, 2022</xref>). Under pathological conditions, a number of studies have reported alterations in overall mPFC neuronal excitability and disruptions of mPFC-amygdala interactions in humans with psychiatric disorders with social behavior deficits such as autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Happé et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Castelli et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pierce et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Greicius et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Drysdale et al., 2017</xref>) and animal models of these disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brumback et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abe et al., 2019</xref>). A fundamental issue is how such molecular and cellular mechanisms are integrated to form organized mPFC and amygdalar neuronal population activity that cooperatively controls social behavior.</p><p>Neurophysiological signatures representing neuronal population activity are local field potential (LFP) signals, consisting of diverse oscillatory patterns that dynamically vary with attentional, motivational, arousal states, and entrain synchronous rhythmic spikes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Buzsáki, 2006</xref>). Recently, LFP oscillations in the PFC have been shown to modulate social behavior. A PFC oscillation at a low gamma-range (20–50 Hz) band mediated by interneurons facilitates social interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Liu et al., 2020</xref>). Consistently, autism mouse models with social deficits exhibit impairments in PFC interneuronal activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Han et al., 2012</xref>) and gamma oscillations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cao et al., 2018</xref>). These studies suggest a key role of PFC gamma-range signals in the modulation of social behavior. On the other hand, several studies have shown that theta-range (4–12 Hz) LFP signals in the prefrontal-amygdalar circuit are associated with the expression of emotional behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Calıskan and Stork, 2019</xref>) such as fear retrieval (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Seidenbecher et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Likhtik et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Stujenske et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dejean et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Karalis et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ozawa et al., 2020</xref>) and anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adhikari et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Likhtik et al., 2014</xref>). In addition, mPFC LFP power at a theta frequency (2–7 Hz) band influences oscillatory activity in the amygdala and ventral tegmental area during stress experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hultman et al., 2016</xref>) and predicts vulnerability to mental stress in individual animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kumar et al., 2014</xref>). While these studies imply that social behavior is mediated by oscillatory signals at various frequency bands in the prefrontal-amygdalar circuit, their causal relationship and pathological changes remain fully elusive. Addressing these issues is critical for a unified understanding of neurophysiological mechanisms at a neuronal network level underlying social behavior and its deficits.</p><p>In this study, we analyzed changes in LFP signals from the dorsal mPFC (dmPFC) and basolateral amygdala (BLA) among wild-type mice and mouse models with social behavioral deficits in a social interaction (SI) test. By extracting detailed animal’s behavioral patterns on a moment-to-moment basis that potentially reflect increased and decreased motivation for social behavior, we discovered prominent changes in dmPFC-BLA LFP signals that specifically varied with social behavior. Optogenetic experiments verified a causal relationship between these oscillatory signals and social behavior, highlighting the importance of frequency-specific manipulations of neuronal activity in the dmPFC-BLA circuit.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Changes in dmPFC and BLA LFP power in a social interaction test</title><p>Male C57BL/6 J mice were tested in a conventional SI test in which they freely interacted with an empty cage and the same cage containing a target CD-1 mouse for 150 s, termed a no target and a target session, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The degree of social interactions for each mouse was quantified as a SI ratio, which refers to the ratio of stay duration in an interaction zone (IZ) in a target session to that in a no target session. Consistent with previous observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Golden et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Venzala et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ramaker and Dulawa, 2017</xref>), the majority of wild-type mice (11 out of 14) exhibited SI ratios of more than 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), demonstrating their motivation for social interactions. From the mice performing the SI tests, LFP signals were simultaneously recorded from the dmPFC, corresponding to the prelimbic (PL) region, and the BLA using an electrode assembly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). The locations of individual electrodes were confirmed by a postmortem histological analysis. To compute an overall tendency of LFP power changes, a fourier transformation analysis was applied to LFP signals from each entire session. Absolute LFP power spectrums were variable across individual mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>), but their averages over all mice exhibited differences between the two sessions at relatively lower (below 10 Hz) and higher (10 Hz) frequency bands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, top; n=14 mice). To further examine these differences, two LFP spectrums from the two sessions were converted to a spectrum representing the ratios of LFP power at each frequency band in the target session relative to that in the no target session (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, bottom). The spectrum revealed an increase and a decrease in dmPFC power at a frequency band of 4–7 Hz and 30–60 Hz, respectively, in a target session compared with a no target session. Overall, dmPFC 4–7 Hz and 30–60 Hz power in the target session was significantly increased to 113.1 ± 4.0% and decreased to 94.6 ± 1.6%, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>, n=14 mice, 4–7 Hz: <italic>t</italic><sub>13</sub>=3.56, p=0.0070; 30–60 Hz: <italic>t</italic><sub>13</sub> = 2.99, p=0.021, paired <italic>t</italic>-test followed by Bonferroni correction), and BLA 4–7 Hz was significantly increased to 110.6 ± 2.7%, compared with that in the no target session (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>, n=6 mice, 4–7 Hz: <italic>t</italic><sub>5</sub>=4.95, p=0.0086; 30–60 Hz: <italic>t</italic><sub>5</sub> = 2.13, p=0.17, paired <italic>t</italic>-test followed by Bonferroni correction). The same power analyses were applied to the same datasets at the other frequency bands, including 1–4 Hz, 7–10 Hz, 10–30 Hz, and 60–100 Hz bands, but no significant differences were found between the target and no target sessions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A and B</xref>; p&gt;0.05, paired <italic>t</italic>-test followed by Bonferroni correction at all the frequency bands). These results suggest that dmPFC-BLA 4–7 Hz and 30–60 Hz power specifically become higher and lower, respectively, when mice are exposed to an environment including the other target mouse. Unlike fear-related theta-gamma coupling reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Stujenske et al., 2014</xref>), we found no pronounced phase-amplitude coupling between the 4–7 Hz and 30–60 Hz frequency bands in both the dmPFC and BLA LFP traces (a representative result shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>). In addition to the LFP power changes, dmPFC-BLA coherence at the 4–7 Hz band in the target session was significantly higher than that in the no target session (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>, n=6 mice, 4–7 Hz: <italic>t</italic><sub>5</sub>=3.95, p=0.022; 30–60 Hz: <italic>t</italic><sub>5</sub> = 1.37, p=0.46, paired <italic>t</italic>-test followed by Bonferroni correction), confirming the coordination of dmPFC-BLA at the 4–7 Hz band. The granger causality spectrum exhibited a significantly higher granger causality index at the 4–7 Hz band for the direction from the dmPFC to BLA than that for the direction from the BLA to the dmPFC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>, n=6 mice, 4–7 Hz: p=0.030; 30–60 Hz: p=0.26, Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic> test followed by Bonferroni correction), possibly reflecting the preferential projection of the dmPFC to the BLA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gabbott et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bukalo et al., 2015</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Changes in dorsal medial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) and basolateral amygdala (BLA) Local field potential (LFP) signals in a social interaction (SI) test.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A SI test with an interaction zone (IZ; labeled in green).

However, we found no significant correlations between these two variables (n=14 mice, 4–7 Hz: <italic>R</italic> = –0.27, p=0.34; 30–60 Hz: <italic>R</italic>=0.40, p=0.15), demonstrating that individual differences in social behavior are not crucially associated with dmPFC power changes at least within the wild-type mouse group.</p><p>A possible explanation for these power changes between the two sessions may be due to differences in running speed. To test this possibility, we compared moving speed between the two sessions and found that moving speed was significantly higher in the no target session than in the target session (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2D</xref>; <italic>Z</italic>=20.20, p=9.0 × 10<sup>-89</sup>, Mann-Whitney U test). We then compared LFP power changes between running periods with a moving speed of more than 5 cm/s and stop periods with a moving speed of less than 1 cm/s, which occupied 20.2 and 40.6% of entire recording periods, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2E and F</xref>). Both in the dmPFC and BLA, 4–7 Hz power during stop periods was significantly higher than that during running periods (dmPFC, <italic>Z</italic>=4.93, p=8.26 × 10<sup>–7</sup>; BLA, <italic>Z</italic>=2.42, p=0.016, Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic> test), whereas 30–60 Hz power exhibited opposite changes (dmPFC, <italic>Z</italic>=2.13, p=0.033, p=0.19; BLA, <italic>Z</italic>=2.00, p=0.045), suggesting that locomotion is a crucial factor to affect these LFP power changes. We thus applied the same power analysis by specifically extracting stop and running periods. Similar to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>, significant increases in dmPFC LFP power in the target session were observed during stop periods but not running periods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2H</xref>, stop periods: n=14 mice, 4–7 Hz: <italic>t</italic><sub>13</sub>=3.72, p=0.0052; 30–60 Hz: <italic>t</italic><sub>13</sub> = 3.05, p=0.019; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2G</xref>, running periods: 4–7 Hz: <italic>t</italic><sub>13</sub>=1.33, p=0.41; 30–60 Hz: <italic>t</italic><sub>13</sub> = 1.25, p=0.46, paired <italic>t</italic>-test followed by Bonferroni correction). These results confirm that while 4–7 Hz and 30–60 Hz power in the dmPFC and BLA is higher and lower, respectively, as moving speed is lower, the LFP power changes were still prominent in the entire target session, compared with the no target session, when mice stopped.</p><p>In the SI test above, we utilized a CD-1 mouse as a target mouse in the cage that was substantially larger than the recorded C57BL/6 J mice. This recording condition may induce anxiety-related or fear-related behavior in the recorded mice. To reduce these emotional factors as possible, we performed a similar SI test using an unfamiliar C57BL/6 J mouse with a similar body size as a target mouse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>). Similar to the results when the target CD-1 mice were used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>), dmPFC 4–7 Hz power in the target session was significantly higher than that in the no target session (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>, n=6 mice, 4–7 Hz: <italic>t</italic><sub>5</sub>=5.36, p=0.0060; 30–60 Hz: <italic>t</italic><sub>5</sub> = 1.04, p=0.70, paired <italic>t</italic>-test followed by Bonferroni correction). In addition, as a control experiment without social behavior, we performed a similar SI test by placing a plastic toy mouse in the cage as a novel object instead of a real mouse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K</xref>). In this case, significant changes in dmPFC 4–7 Hz and 30–60 Hz power between the two sessions were not observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K</xref>, n=7 mice, 4–7 Hz: <italic>t</italic><sub>6</sub>=0.51, p&gt;0.99; 30–60 Hz: <italic>t</italic><sub>6</sub> = 0.60, p&gt;0.99, paired <italic>t</italic>-test followed by Bonferroni correction). These results further confirm that the dmPFC power changes are induced specifically in a condition where mice exhibit social behavior while they are less associated with an object novelty or emotional components such as anxiety.</p><p>While LFP power changes were observed in the target session with both a CD-1 mouse and a C57BL/6 J mouse as a target mouse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F and J</xref>), there still remains a possibility that these changes are induced by increased anxiety and/or novelty against social interaction, as mice are generally anxious when encountering a novel (target) mouse. Previous studies have demonstrated that anxiety induces theta-range (4–10 Hz) power increases in the mPFC-BLA-ventral hippocampal circuit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adhikari et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Likhtik et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Padilla-Coreano et al., 2019</xref>). We thus examined whether anxiogenic conditions could induce the similar changes in the dmPFC-BLA LFP signals observed in this study. The test box was divided into social avoidance zones (corners of the box opposing the target mice), peripheral areas (near the walls of the box), and a center area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Based on the similarity of the no target session and conventional open field tests, mice are considered to more feel anxiety in the avoidance zones and peripheral areas, compared with the center area, in the no target session. To compare relative changes in LFP power across behavior and sessions, LFP power at each frequency band was z-scored based on the average and SD of LFP power at each frequency band in an entire period including the no target and target sessions. In the no target session, no significant differences in dmPFC and BLA 4–7 Hz and 30–60 Hz LFP power were observed among these areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, dmPFC: n=7 mice, 4–7 Hz, <italic>F</italic><sub>2,40</sub> = 1.36, p=0.27; 30–60 Hz; <italic>F</italic><sub>2,40</sub> = 0.11, p=0.90; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, BLA: n=6 mice, 4–7 Hz, <italic>F</italic><sub>2,16</sub> = 1.12, p=0.35; 30–60 Hz; <italic>F</italic><sub>2,16</sub> = 0.61, p=0.56, one-way ANOVA). On the other hand, mice are considered to most increase anxiety or most decrease motivation for social behavior in the avoidance zones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Golden et al., 2011</xref>) and more increase anxiety levels in the peripheral areas, compared with the center area, in the target session. In the target session, no significant differences in dmPFC and BLA 4–7 Hz and 30–60 Hz LFP power were observed among these areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, dmPFC: n=14 mice, 4–7 Hz, <italic>F</italic><sub>2,35</sub> = 0.50, p=0.61; 30–60 Hz; <italic>F</italic><sub>2,35</sub> = 0.13, p=0.88; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, BLA: n=6 mice, 4–7 Hz, <italic>F</italic><sub>1,10</sub> = 3.38, p=0.099; 30–60 Hz; <italic>F</italic><sub>1,10</sub> = 0.27, p=0.62, one-way ANOVA).

To test this possibility, we first compared LFP power between when the wild-type normal mice stayed within and were outside the IZ as conventional measures in an SI test. However, no significant changes in 4–7 Hz and 30–60 Hz power in the dmPFC and BLA during the target session were detected between the IZ and the other areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>; dmPFC, n=14 mice; 4–7 Hz: <italic>t</italic><sub>13</sub> = 0.76, p=0.46; 30–60 Hz: <italic>t</italic><sub>13</sub> = 1.38, p=0.19; BLA, n=6 mice; 4–7 Hz: <italic>t</italic><sub>5</sub> = 0.76, p=0.48; 30–60 Hz: <italic>t</italic><sub>5</sub> = 0.02, p=0.98, paired <italic>t</italic>-test followed by Bonferroni correction). While this analysis focused on the entire period during which the mice stayed in the IZ, their behavioral patterns within the IZ were not consistent across time; mice actively approach or interact with a target mouse in some periods, reflecting high motivation, whereas they occasionally turn around, move away from a target mouse, or continue to stay at a location in an IZ, possibly reflecting no strong motivation for social interaction. These behavioral observations indicate that animals’ motivation toward and salience regarding the other mouse are not equivalent even when they are similarly located in an IZ.</p><p>The results suggest that changes in dmPFC-BLA oscillations are not simply explained by where the mice stayed in the SI test. We further analyzed how LFP patterns are associated with their instantaneous behavior every 1 s. We defined social approach behavior, potentially representing increased motivation for social interaction, as the time during which the mice approached the cage (within the half of the box containing the cage) with their cage-oriented moving directions θ less than 90° in the target session (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–C</xref>). Assuming that mice potentially exhibited the highest motivation and salience during an initial bout of a social approach, this definition was restricted to the initial 5 s periods of social approach behavior. As a control behavior against approach behavior, we defined leaving behavior as the time during which the mice left from the cage with their cage-oriented moving directions θ more than 90° in the target session. No significant differences in the distributions of moving speed were found between the approach behavior and leaving behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>; <italic>Z</italic>=0.85, p=0.39, Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic> test). These results confirm that approach and leaving behavior is not explained by speed or locomotion itself, allowing us to compare LFP power between the two behavioral periods without being affected by moving speed. Both in the dmPFC and BLA, 4–7 Hz power was significantly decreased during the approach behavior compared with the leaving behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>, left, dmPFC: 4–7 Hz: <italic>t</italic><sub>13</sub>=2.71, p=0.018; 30–60 Hz: <italic>t</italic><sub>13</sub>=0.47, p=0.65; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>, middle, BLA: 4–7 Hz: <italic>t</italic><sub>5</sub>=2.83, p=0.037; 30–60 Hz: <italic>t</italic><sub>5</sub>=1.01, p=0.36, paired <italic>t</italic>-test).

Consistent with the LFP power changes, dmPFC-BLA coherence at the 4–7 Hz band during leaving behavior was significantly higher than that during approach behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>, right, n=6 mice, 4–7 Hz: <italic>t</italic><sub>5</sub>=6.34, p=0.0028; 30–60 Hz: <italic>t</italic><sub>5</sub> = 5.54, p=0.0052, paired <italic>t</italic>-test followed by Bonferroni correction). Moreover, the Granger causality index at the 4–7 Hz band in the dmPFC-BLA direction was significantly higher than that in the BLA-dmPFC direction during leaving behavior, but not during approach behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>, n=6 mice, 4–7 Hz: p=0.030; 30–60 Hz: p=0.26, Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic> test followed by Bonferroni correction). These results suggest that functional information transfer at the 4–7 Hz band from the dmPFC to the BLA is lowered during social approach behavior, compared with leaving behavior. In Shank3 KO mice, we did not observe significant differences in dmPFC 4–7 Hz and 30–60 Hz power between approach and leaving behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>, n=7 mice, 4–7 Hz: <italic>t</italic><sub>6</sub>=0.48, p=0.65; 30–60 Hz: <italic>t</italic><sub>6</sub>=0.67, p=0.53, paired <italic>t</italic>-test followed by Bonferroni correction), suggesting that social behavior-related dmPFC activity is not properly regulated in socially deficient mice. The reductions of dmPFC 4–7 Hz power during social interaction behavior are consistent with the opposite changes (the increases in dmPFC 4–7 Hz power) observed during social avoidance behavior in the socially deficient mice (shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>).

On the other hand, putative fast-spiking (FS) interneurons were identified as neurons that had baseline spike rates higher than 10 Hz (n=9 neurons from 6 mice). While these criteria might define a minority of interneurons as putative RS neurons, it was unlikely that true pyramidal neurons are misclassified as putative FS neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wilson et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tierney et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Homayoun and Moghaddam, 2007</xref>). We tested whether these mPFC neurons exhibited spike patterns phase-locked to the 4–7 Hz oscillations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). All spike analyses were restricted to a target session. An example putative FS neuron shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref> exhibited apparent spike rate changes corresponding to altering phases in the 4–7 Hz oscillations. For each neuron, the degree of spike phase locking was quantified by computing the mean vector length (MVL). In the example neuron, the MVL was 0.12. To assess the significance of each MVL, we created shuffled datasets in which spike timing was randomized within the session and MVL was similarly computed from 1000 shuffled datasets, termed MVL<sub>shuffled</sub>. The MVL of an original data was considered to be significant (p&lt;0.05) when the MVL was higher than the top 95% of the corresponding MVL<sub>shuffled</sub>. According to this criterion, the MVL of the example neuron was higher than the corresponding 1000 MVL<sub>shuffled</sub> (p&lt;0.001), demonstrating that these neuronal spikes were entrained by the 4–7 Hz oscillations. For each neuron, the MVL was compared between approach and leaving behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Of the 48 and 9 putative RS and FS neurons tested, 5 (10.4%) and 3 (33.3%) neurons showed significant MVL in both approach and leaving behavior (the neurons indicated by the red lines in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). These neurons were considered to show phase locking spikes irrespective of behavior and excluded from further statistical analyses. After this exclusion, the remaining FS neurons showed significantly higher MVL for the 4–7 Hz oscillations during leaving periods, compared with approach periods (n=6 neurons; <italic>t</italic><sub>5</sub>=3.15, p=0.025, paired <italic>t</italic>-test). These results demonstrate that a subset of FS neurons alter their entrainment to the 4–7 Hz oscillations depending on animal’s behavioral patterns.

Taken together, these results suggest that mPFC FS neurons are more preferentially entrained by the 4–7 Hz oscillations during leaving behavior than approach behavior.

To address this idea, a technique to reduce dmPFC 4–7 Hz oscillations is needed. Based on our observations that the entrainment of mPFC inhibitory neuronal spikes to the 4–7 Hz oscillations dynamically varies with social behavior, we sought to develop a method to alter dmPFC 4–7 Hz oscillations by manipulating dmPFC inhibitory neurons. Here, we focused on parvalbumin (PV)-positive interneurons, a major type of interneurons as this cell type has been reported to be crucial for the generation of cortical gamma-range (30–60 Hz) oscillations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Whittington et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bartos et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cardin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sohal et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Buzsáki and Wang, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Nakamura et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cao et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Liu et al., 2020</xref>).

While we noted that not all interneurons in the dmPFC express PV, we took this optogenetic approach as a means to potentially alter dmPFC neuronal oscillations at these frequency bands. The PV-Cre mice were first subjected to chronic social defeat stress and then injected with a Cre-inducible viral construct, AAV5-EF1a-DIO-ChR2-eYFP or AAV5-EF1a-DIO-eYFP, into the dmPFC so that PV interneurons selectively expressed ChR2-YFP or YFP, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). In addition, an optic cannula and recording electrodes were implanted into the identical region of the dmPFC, and additional recording electrodes were implanted into the BLA. We first sought to identify appropriate photostimulation protocols by simultaneous LFP recordings of the dmPFC and BLA. Two weeks after surgery, photostimulation at 4, 10, and 40 Hz was applied in defeated mice expressing ChR2-YFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>), a frequency corresponding to 4–7 Hz, an intermediate frequency, and a frequency corresponding to 30–60 Hz, respectively. The width of each photostimulation pulse was set to half the pulse intervals: 125, 50, and 12.5ms for 4, 10, and 40 Hz, respectively, meaning that the total duration of applied photostimulation was equivalent in all protocols. Photostimulation at 4 Hz induced a significant 19.5 ± 9.0% power increase in the corresponding frequency (4–7 Hz) band in the dmPFC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B and C</xref>; 4–7 Hz: <italic>t</italic><sub>15</sub>=2.44, p=0.045; 30–60 Hz: <italic>t</italic><sub>15</sub>=2.18, p=0.066, paired <italic>t</italic>-test), consistent with the entrainment of inhibitory neuronal spikes to 4–7 Hz oscillations.

A test day includes a sequence of a target session with no photostimulation (no stim), and target sessions with 4 Hz, 10 Hz, and 40 Hz photostimulation. The order of sessions was similar in all mice. In all the sessions, photostimulation was applied for 2 s every 30 s and overall changes in the animal’s social interactions throughout the session were examined. In the mice expressing ChR2-YFP, 40 Hz photostimulation significantly increased occupancy time in the IZ, compared with no photostimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>; n=7 mice; <italic>t</italic><sub>6</sub> = 3.46, p=0.040, paired <italic>t</italic>-test followed by Bonferroni correction), whereas no significant changes were observed by 4 Hz and 10 Hz photostimulation (4 Hz: <italic>t</italic><sub>6</sub>=0.56, p&gt;0.99; 10 Hz: <italic>t</italic><sub>6</sub>=0.25, p&gt;0.99, paired <italic>t</italic>-test followed by Bonferroni correction).

These results from control experiments exclude the possibility that the increase in IZ occupancy by the 40 Hz photostimulation is simply due to an effect of elapsed time in the test condition. Overall, these results demonstrate that optogenetic inductions of a decrease in dmPFC-BLA 4–7 Hz power and an increase in 30–60 Hz power are sufficient to trigger social interaction behavior.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we compared LFP signals from the dmPFC and BLA during an SI test among wild-type mice, Shank3 KO mice as a model of ASD, and socially defeated mice as a model of depression. Power spectrum analyses revealed that all mouse types tested exhibited prominent increases in dmPFC-BLA 4–7 Hz power and decreases in 30–60 Hz power throughout a target session compared with a no target session. The dmPFC 4–7 Hz power increase was prominent when socially deficient mouse models exhibited social avoidance behavior. In contrast, dmPFC 4–7 Hz power was dynamically reduced when wild-type mice exhibited social approach behavior compared with leaving behavior with opposite moving directions. Replicating the social interaction-related LFP changes by oscillation-like optogenetic stimulation of PV interneurons was sufficient to increase social interaction in socially defeated mice.</p><p>Our results showed that dmPFC 4–7 Hz power is higher during a target session and further increases occur during social avoidance in socially deficient mice. These results may be explained by facts that mice are inherently nervous and anxious against social interaction in a novel test environment and these mental states correlate with increased dmPFC 4–7 Hz power. Indeed, previous observations reported theta (4–10 Hz) power increases in the mPFC-BLA-ventral hippocampal circuit in anxiogenic environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adhikari et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Likhtik et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Padilla-Coreano et al., 2019</xref>). However, our analysis by dividing the test box into several segments could not detect apparent LFP power changes associated with anxiety-related locations.</p><p>Our observation of the increased dmPFC 30–60 Hz power in the no target session appears inconsistent with a report by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Liu et al., 2020</xref> showing that mPFC low gamma power is decreased when mice explore an empty cage in a three-chamber test. However, this inconsistency may be reconciled by a difference in conditions of the social interaction tests. In our study, the mice were first subject to a no target session in which no target mice were presented anywhere. On the other hand, the three-chamber test by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Liu et al., 2020</xref> initially contained both a target mouse and an empty cage at the same time in an experimental environment, a condition which is likely to be more similar to the target session, rather than the no target session, utilized in our study. Therefore, the three-chamber test might already induce overall changes in dmPFC 30–60 Hz power in the test environment, as observed from the target session in our study, which were not detected by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Liu et al., 2020</xref>. In both the three chamber test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Liu et al., 2020</xref>) and the target session in our study, it is consistent that dmPFC 30–60 Hz (or gamma-range) power increases occur when mice approach a target mouse.</p><p>A previous report has demonstrated that PFC 2–7 Hz oscillations entrain coherent activity between the amygdala and ventral tegmental area at the beta band and power changes in these oscillations during stress experiences predicts subsequent depression-like behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kumar et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hultman et al., 2016</xref>). Consistent with their observation that normalization of these interregional oscillations by chemogenetic activation of prefrontal-amygdalar circuit reverses stress-induced behavioral deficits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hultman et al., 2016</xref>), our results demonstrated that dynamic changes in dmPFC-BLA oscillations at the similar frequency band during behavior indeed correlate with social behavior and exogeneous inductions of such oscillations by optogenetic manipulations temporally induced social interaction behavior. An interesting remaining question is how these dynamically changing oscillations are linked with oscillations and coherent activity found in the other brain regions related to stress vulnerability and susceptibility, termed electome factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hultman et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Generally, studies utilizing an SI test have quantified the duration during which mice stayed in an IZ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Golden et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Venzala et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ramaker and Dulawa, 2017</xref>). Our analysis failed to detect pronounced differences in LFP power between periods when mice stayed within and outside the IZ. These results were because animals’ behavioral patterns were not homogeneous across time in the IZ, suggesting a need to identify detailed behavioral patterns on a moment-to-moment basis to more accurately evaluate social interaction-related cortical LFP signals. Thus, we specifically extracted social approach behavior that more precisely represents animals’ psychological states with increased motivation and/or decreased anxiety than simple time spent in the IZ. Based on this identification of a behavioral pattern, we revealed pronounced reductions in 4–7 Hz power associated with social interactions in the dmPFC-BLA circuit.</p><p>Our spike analysis confirmed that dmPFC interneurons exhibited spike patterns phase-locked to 4–7 Hz oscillations. Many previous studies have established that PV interneurons are a crucial cell type for generating cortical low gamma-range (20–60 Hz) oscillations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Whittington et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bartos et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cardin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sohal et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Buzsáki and Wang, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Nakamura et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cao et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Liu et al., 2020</xref>). The PV-interneuron-mediated gamma oscillation in the PFC is enhanced during social interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Liu et al., 2020</xref>) or attenuated in autism mouse models with social deficits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cao et al., 2018</xref>), highlighting the importance of PFC PV interneurons in the expression of social behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Han et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Xu et al., 2019</xref>) through the regulation of low gamma oscillations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cao et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Liu et al., 2020</xref>). These studies utilized a protocol with 40 Hz photostimulation of PV interneurons with the aim of increasing PFC LFP power at the corresponding frequency (i.e. low gamma) band (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cao et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Liu et al., 2020</xref>). Notably, in our study, we initially sought to determine a protocol that could reduce dmPFC 4–7 Hz power to mimic the LFP power changes observed during approach behavior and eventually found that 40 Hz photostimulation selective to PV interneurons was optimal to meet this technical requirement, resulting in a decrease in dmPFC 4–7 Hz and an increase in 40 Hz power. The mechanisms underlying these reciprocal power changes are possibly mediated by a stimulation-induced interference of the entrainment of PV interneuronal spikes by a 4–7 Hz oscillation. Our study demonstrated that such optogenetic manipulations of PV interneurons extend to the BLA circuit and were sufficient to restore social interaction behavior that was reduced in social defeat stress-induced depression mouse models, similar to autism mouse models reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cao et al., 2018</xref>). Here, we note that we did not confirm that the phase-locked dmPFC interneurons observed in this study corresponded with PV-positive interneurons. To address these issues, further confirmation is necessary using techniques to identify cell types of recorded neurons such as optogenetic tagging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Liu et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Accumulating evidence suggests that disruptions in E/I balances are crucial factors contributing to social behavior deficits in autism-like mouse models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rubenstein and Merzenich, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Helmeke et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yizhar et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Selimbeyoglu et al., 2017</xref>). From the aspect of neuronal networks, our results add to a growing body of evidence demonstrating that dynamic changes in LFP oscillatory power regulated by inhibitory neuronal networks at appropriate timings are crucial for social behavior. The neurophysiological signatures found in our study may be helpful for a unified mechanistic understanding of the cellular-based mechanisms and network-based mechanisms underlying sociality and for identifying ASD-related and stress-induced pathophysiology that may lead to the amelioration of social behavior deficits.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and

At least 1 week before beginning the social defeat experiment, all resident CD-1 mice (SLC, Shizuoka, Japan) more than 13 weeks of age were singly housed on one side of a home cage (termed the ‘resident area’; 42.5 cm × 26.6 cm×15.5 cm). The cage was divided into two identical halves by a transparent plexiglas partition (0.5 cm × 41.8 cm×16.5 cm) with perforated holes, each with a diameter of 10 mm. The bedding in the resident area was left unchanged during the preoperative period. First, resident CD-1 mice were screened for social defeat experiments by introducing an intruder C57/BL6J mouse that was specifically used for screening into the home cage during three 3 min sessions on 3 subsequent days. Each session included a different intruder mouse. CD-1 mice were selected as aggressors in subsequent experiments based on three criteria: during the three 3 min sessions, (1) the mouse attacked in at least two consecutive sessions, (2) the latency to initial aggression was less than 60 s, and (3) the above two criteria were met for at least 2 consecutive days out of 3 test days. After screening, an experimental intruder mouse was exposed to social defeat stress by introducing it into the resident area for a 7–10 min interaction. The interaction period was immediately terminated if the intruder mouse had a wound and bleeding due to the attack, resulting in interaction periods of 7–10 min. After the physical contact, the intruder mouse was transferred across the partition and placed in the opposite compartment of the second resident home cage for the following 24 h; this allowed the intruder mouse to have sensory contact with the resident mouse without physical contact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Golden et al., 2011</xref>).

During all surgeries, the animals were anesthetized with isoflurane gas (1–3%), and circular craniotomies were made using a high-speed drill at the indicated coordinates. (i) For LFP recordings without spikes, an electrode assembly that consisted of 3 and 4 immobile tetrodes was stereotaxically implanted above the dmPFC (2.00 mm anterior and 0.50 mm lateral to bregma) at a depth of 1.40 mm and the BLA (0.80 mm posterior and 3.00 mm lateral to bregma) at a depth of 4.40 mm, respectively. For eight wild-type mice and six defeated mice, electrodes were targeted for the dmPFC only. For the other six wild-type mice, five defeated mice, and seven Shank3 KO mice, electrodes were targeted for both the dmPFC and BLA. The tetrodes were constructed from 17-μm-wide polyimide-coated platinum-iridium (90/10%) wires (California Fine Wire), and the electrode tips were plated with platinum to lower the electrode impedances to 200–250 kΩ. Stainless steel screws were implanted on the skull and attached to the cerebellar surface to serve as ground/reference electrodes. For spike recordings, an electrode assembly that consisted of 6 independently movable tetrodes was stereotaxically implanted above the mPFC (1.94 mm anterior and 0.83 mm lateral to bregma) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Okada et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aoki et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nishimura et al., 2021</xref>).

In addition, an electrode assembly for LFP recordings was implanted as described above. Finally, all devices were secured to the skull using stainless steel screws and dental cement. After all surgical procedures were completed, anesthesia was discontinued, and the animals were allowed to spontaneously awaken. Following surgery, each animal was housed in a transparent Plexiglas cage with free access to water and food for more than one week.</p><p>For spike recordings, the tetrodes were advanced to the targeted brain regions over a period of at least one week following surgery. The depth of the electrodes was adjusted while the mouse rested in a pot placed on a pedestal. The electrode tips were advanced up to 62.5 μm per day over a period of at least 10 days following surgery. The tetrodes were then settled into the targeted area so that stable recordings were obtained.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Electrophysiological recording</title><p>The mouse was connected to the recording equipment via Cereplex M (blackrock), a digitally programmable amplifier, which was placed close to the animal’s head. The output of the headstage was conducted to the Cereplex Direct recording system (blackrock), a data acquisition system, via a lightweight multiwire tether and a commutator. For recording electrophysiological signals, the electrical interface board of the tetrode assembly was connected to a Cereplex M digital headstage (blackrock microsystems), and the digitized signals were transferred to a Cereplex Direct data acquisition system (blackrock microsystems). Electrical signals were sampled at 2 kHz and low-pass filtered at 500 Hz. The unit activity was amplified and bandpass filtered at 750 Hz to 6 kHz. Spike waveforms above a trigger threshold (50 μV) were time-stamped and recorded at 30 kHz in a time window of 1.6ms. The animal’s moment-to-moment position was tracked at 15 Hz using a video camera attached to the ceiling. The frame rate of the movie was downsampled to 3 Hz, and the instantaneous speed of each frame was calculated based on the distance traveled within a frame (~333ms). In the following analyses, video frames with massive optical noise or periods that were not precisely recorded due to temporal breaks of image data processing were excluded. All recordings from a behavioral task were performed once so that all the tasks were novel for the mice and no duplications of samples were thus included.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Social interaction (SI) test</title><p>Social interaction tests were performed inside a dark room with a light intensity of 10 lux in a square-shaped box (39.3 cm × 39.3 cm) enclosed by walls 27 cm in height. A wire-mesh cage (6.5 cm × 10 cm×24 cm) was centered against one wall of the arena during both no target and target sessions. Each social interaction test included two 150 s sessions (separated by an intersession interval of 30 s) without and with the target CD-1 mouse present in the mesh cage, termed no target and target sessions, respectively. In the no target session, a test C57BL/6 J mouse was placed in the box and allowed to freely explore the environment. The C57BL/6 J mouse was then removed from the box. In the 30 s break between sessions, the target CD-1 mouse was introduced into the mesh cage. The design of the cage allowed the animal to fit its snout and paws through the mesh cage but not to escape from the cage. In the target session, the same C57BL/6 J mouse was placed beside the wall opposite to the mesh cage. For optogenetic experiments, the duration of a target session was 10 min. In each session, the time spent in the interaction zone (IZ), a 14.5 cm × 24 cm rectangular area extending 8 cm around the mesh cage. The social interaction (SI) ratio was computed as the ratio of time spent in the interaction zone in the target session to the time spent there in the no target session. Social avoidance zones are defined as 9.0 cm × 9.0 cm square areas projecting from both corner joints opposing the cage.</p><p>As control experiments, a C57BL/6 J mouse with a weight of 22 g was used as a target mouse or a plastic toy mouse with a similar size to recorded C57BL/6 J mice was placed in the cage instead of a target mouse.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Optogenetics</title><p>The mice underwent one of the following photostimulation protocols during a target session for 10 min: (1) 40 Hz stimulation with 12.5 ms blue light pulses (472 nm,~3 mW output from fiber) at 40 Hz applied with a periodicity of 30 s, (2) 10 Hz stimulation with 50 ms blue light pulses at 10 Hz applied with a periodicity of 30 s, and (3) 4 Hz stimulation with 125 ms blue light pulses at 4 Hz applied with a periodicity of 30 s. In a representative example shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref> and the analysis in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C and D</xref>, each photostimulation was applied for 10 s.</p><p>For behavioral experiments, a test day for each mouse includes a sequence of a target session with no photostimulation (no stim), and target sessions with 4 Hz, 10 Hz, and 40 Hz photostimulation. The order of these sessions was similar in all mice. Each session lasted for 10 min, during which photostimulation was applied for 2 s every 30 s, and overall changes in the animal’s social interactions throughout the session were examined.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Histological analysis to confirm electrode placement or cannula placement</title><p>The mice were overdosed with isoflurane, perfused intracardially with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) and decapitated. After dissection, the brains were fixed overnight in 4% PFA and equilibrated with 20 and 30% sucrose in phosphate-buffered saline for an overnight each. Frozen coronal sections (100 μm) were cut using a microtome, and serial sections were mounted and processed for cresyl violet staining. For cresyl violet staining, the slices were rinsed in water, stained with cresyl violet, and coverslipped with Permount. The positions of all electrodes were confirmed by identifying the corresponding electrode tracks in histological tissue. Of the eight wild-type mice and six defeated mice in which electrodes were targeted for the dmPFC only, eight and three mice had at least one electrode located in the dmPFC, respectively. Of the six wild-type mice, seven Shank3 KO mice, and five defeated mice in which electrodes were targeted for both the dmPFC and BLA, six, seven, and zero mice had at least one electrode located in the dmPFC, and six, seven, and five mice had at least one electrode located in the BLA, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>LFP analysis</title><p>To compute the time-frequency representation of LFP power, LFP signals were convolved using complex Morlet wavelet transformation by the Matlab at frequencies ranging from 1 to 250 Hz. The absolute LFP power spectrum during each 10 ms time window was calculated. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, z-scores at each frequency band were computed based on the average and SD of LFP power at each frequency band in an entire period including the no target and target sessions. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1F, G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>, the ratio of absolute power during an entire period of a target session to that during a no target session at a 4–7 Hz or 30–60 Hz band was computed. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>, z-scores at each frequency band were computed based on the average and SD of LFP power at each frequency band in an entire period of the target session. When data were obtained from multiple electrodes in a mouse, they were averaged to single values within each mouse.</p><p>Coherence between two electrodes was computed using a Wavelet coherence and cross-spectrum function by the Matlab with a sampling rate of 200 Hz.

For quantification, data were obtained and averaged across all dmPFC-BLA electrode pairs.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Definition of social approach and leaving behavior</title><p>For each location on the animal’s trajectories (bin = 1 s), a cage-oriented moving direction θ was computed as an angle between the animal’s moving direction at the location and a straight line connecting the location of the animal and the center of the cage. Angles <italic>θ</italic>=0° and 180° indicate moving directly toward and away from the center of the cage, respectively. Candidate periods of social approach and leaving behavior were defined when the animals stayed in the half of the box containing the IZ and the cage-oriented moving directions were less than and more than 90°, respectively. If a candidate period lasted for more than 5 s, the first 5 s period was regarded as a social approach and leaving behavior. The periods that were not classified as social approach and leaving behavior were termed the other periods.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Spike unit analysis</title><p>Neurons recorded from all electrodes targeting the dmPFC were included in this analysis. Spike sorting was performed offline using the graphical cluster-cutting software Mclust. Sleep recordings obtained before and after the behavioral paradigms were executed were included in the analysis to assure recording stability throughout the experiment and to identify cells that were silent during behavior. Clustering was performed manually in 2D projections of the multidimensional parameter space (i.e. comparisons between the waveform amplitudes, the peak-to-trough amplitude differences, the waveform energies, and the first principal component coefficient [PC1] of the energy-normalized waveform, each measured on the four channels of each tetrode). Only clusters that could be stably tracked across all behavioral sessions were considered to be the same cells and were included in our analysis. Similar to classification criteria in the PFC reported in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wilson et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tierney et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Homayoun and Moghaddam, 2007</xref>), neurons with baseline spike rates of &gt;10 Hz were classified as putative fast-spiking (FS) interneurons, whereas neurons with baseline spike rates of &lt;10 Hz and spike width of &gt;0.6ms were classified as putative regular-spiking (RS) pyramidal neurons. No priori power analyses were performed to determine sample sizes. Experiments were instead designed to encompass a comparable number of cells as several previous studies of spike-phase computation among prefrontal principal cells (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Karalis et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abe et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Okonogi and Sasaki, 2021</xref>).</p><p>For each cell, the degree of phase locking during a target session was analyzed. For approach or leaving behavior, the phase-spike rate distribution was computed by plotting the firing rate as a function of the phase of 1–4 Hz, 4–7 Hz, 7–15 Hz, 15–30 Hz, and 30–60 Hz LFP traces, divided into bins of 30° and smoothed with a Gaussian kernel filer with standard deviation of one bin (30°), and a Rayleigh r-value was calculated as mean vector length (MVL).</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>All data are presented as the mean ± SEM, unless otherwise specified, and were analyzed using Python and MATLAB. For normally-distributed data, individual data points are displayed in addition to sample mean and SEM or presented in the sourcedata.xlsx. For non-normally-distributed data, data are displayed as distributions, with data points presented in the sourcedata.xlsx. For each statistical test, data normality was first determined by the F test, and non-parametric tests applied where appropriate. Comparisons of two-sample data were analyzed by paired <italic>t</italic>-test and Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic> test. Multiple group comparisons were performed by post hoc Bonferroni corrections. The null hypothesis was rejected at the p&lt;0.05 level.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Supervision, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Supervision, Writing - original draft, Writing - review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>All experiments were performed with the approval of the Experimental Ethics Committee at the University of Tokyo (approval number: P29-7 and P29-14) and according to the NIH guidelines for the care and use of mice.</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec id="s6" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="transrepform"><label>Transparent reporting form</label><media mime-subtype="docx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-78428-transrepform1-v1.docx"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec id="s7" sec-type="data-availability"><title>Data availability</title><p>All data generated or analyzed during this study are included in the manuscript and supporting file; Source Data files &quot;Kuga et al 2022 sourcedata.xlsx&quot; have been provided for main and supplementary Figures.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Nancy Padilla (Reviewer #1); Audrey Brumback (Reviewer #3).</p><p>Comments to the Authors:</p><p>We are sorry to say that, after consultation with the reviewers, we have decided that this work will not be considered further for publication by <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>All reviewers agreed that the topic and results are of interest and have potential impact for the field of social cognition. However, all 3 reviewers pointed out the need for additional experiments with proper control groups would be necessary to appropriately interpret the data. Reviewers also felt there was a need for additional detailed analyses, further clarification/explanation of the methods and more discussion on implications/caveats of the findings.</p><p>Given the enthusiasm for this report, if the authors feel they can address each of the issues raised by the reviewers with additional data, analyses, and revised text, we would be willing to consider a revised version of the manuscript. The editors and reviewers all agreed that addressing each of the additional control experiments and analyses suggested by the three reviewers will be critical to a successful revision. If you choose to go this route, we will evaluate your revised submission as a new manuscript editorially before sending to review. We would endeavor, but cannot guarantee that we will be able to secure the same reviewers.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>Kuga and colleagues utilized two mouse models (Shank3 mutants and socially defeated mice) that show sociability deficits to study associations between 4-7 Hz (lower range of theta band) and 30-60 Hz (low γ) oscillations in dmPFC and BLA and social deficits. They record from dmPFC and BLA in two arenas: one with a novel mouse and an empty arena (open field). They show that on average with the novel mouse there is more 4-7 Hz power in dmPFC and BLA, suggesting an association of 4-7 Hz with the social context. Several metrics suggest that the increase in 4-7 Hz power is associated with social avoidance. Finally, they show that stimulating optogenetically mPFC parvalbumin interneurons at 40 Hz (but not lower frequencies) resulted in lower 4-7 Hz power in dmPFC and BLA and more social exploration. To my knowledge this is the first study linking lower range theta in dmPFC and BLA to social avoidance, which is a strength of the study. Furthermore, the use of multiple models with social deficits strengthens that connection to social avoidance. However, the authors calculate metrics differently in the control group and mouse models making it very difficult to compare controls vs mouse models. In addition, the claim of the authors that dmPFC and BLA 4-7 Hz is linked to social interactions (stated in title and summary) is questionable since there are not enough controls to rule out that anxiety-like behavior in the arena is what is driving the changes.</p><p>Clarifications on the following are necessary to support the claims:</p><p>1. Ample literature links theta oscillations (including the 4-7 Hz range) to anxiety and fear related behaviors in the dmPFC and BLA, as noted by the authors in the introduction. The authors do the social interaction test in a large arena (same size as an open field) therefore the mice will very likely exhibit anxiety-like behavior (thigmotaxis) which will modulate 4-7 Hz in the dmPFC and BLA. Furthermore, the authors used a larger unfamiliar mouse of a different strain, potentially inducing social anxiety. This all brings up the possibility that the changes reported in this manuscript are driven by anxiety-like behavior rather than social interactions (as its claimed in this manuscript). To clarify this the authors should do all the calculations in the empty arena (no target session) to ensure that none of their effects are driven going towards the periphery or by staying in a corner of the field (what they quantify as social avoidance when target is present). For example, what is the difference between 4-7 Hz power during social avoidance vs staying in the same periphery corner in the no target session. Based on the literature these behaviors on the empty arena will likely lead to modulations in theta frequencies, but possibly the modulations are larger when there is a novel mouse in the arena. However, as presented it's not possible to dissociate the findings with potential changes due to anxiety-like behavior.</p><p>2. The authors calculate 4-7 Hz power during social approach vs leaving in the WT mice but in the other two groups they calculate it during time spent in the corner (social avoidance). A central claim of this manuscript (expressed in summary and in lines 216-218) is that the 4-7 Hz patterns are opposite in the social deficit models vs the control. However, the way 4-7 Hz was calculated across groups are not the same, so that claim currently has an important caveat. First, uniformity of calculating metrics will improve the rigor and clarity of the paper. Second, power during both behaviors (social avoidance and social leaving) suggest that 4-7 Hz is associated with not interacting, rather than with social interaction. Assuming that the dissociation from anxiety can be done (point 1), the data support that 4-7 Hz dmPFC and BLA power is associated with social avoidance, not social interactions.</p><p>3. This study normalizes LFP signals within animals making it difficult to understand if the patterns reported only hold with relative measurements only or if 4-7 Hz absolute power across groups differs in the distinct conditions. In addition, only two example power spectra, one with a log scale that makes it hard to see 4-7 Hz, are shown in the paper making it difficult to assess the 4-7 Hz peaks across groups and conditions and to understand why 4-7 Hz was selected as a frequency band. This study will highly benefit from including average power spectra for all conditions and groups.</p><p>4. Given the optoelectric effect that light can have in electrodes which impacts LFPs (see Cardin et al., 2012), it is important to rule out that the power differences reported in mPFC in Figure 6 are not driven by light presentation. The authors only show data from an opsin group, so there is no control group to address this concern.</p><p>5. Given that locomotion can change 4-7 Hz power in the mPFC (see Adhikari et al., 2010) it is important to rule out that the increased in 4-7 Hz power seen in the target session relative to the no target session is not driven by a difference in locomotion.</p><p>6. The manuscript should cite and discuss how the current data can be consolidated with this study by Liu et al., 2020 that stimulated mPFC PV interneurons at γ frequencies and sees changes in sociability. However, they report that low γ in the mPFC increases during a social session compared to empty arena, which is opposite from what the authors currently report. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32832654/</p><p>Recommendation for the authors:</p><p>1. To rule out that the increased in 4-7 Hz power seen in the target session relative to the no target session is not driven by a difference in locomotion, one approach is to see if there is a statistical difference in speed in one session vs the other. Alternatively, if there is a difference in speed, the other approach is to parse the data by speed and only use LFP signals from times in which the animals are moving at the same speed.</p><p>2. Currently, it is not described how the z-scoring of the LFP signal is done. This is very important information that should be clearly explained in the methods for rigor and reproducibility.</p><p>3. Given that the 2 mouse models are using the same control group data (Figures 2-3), the appropriate approach is to plot the 3 groups together, do an ANOVA then post-hoc comparisons that control for multiple comparisons. Currently, the authors are treating the control groups for the two social deficit models as independent, but they are the same data points. I do not think that grouping them adequately would change the conclusions reported but given the multiple comparisons using the same control group, this will be the most transparent and clear way to report the data.</p><p>4. In addition, it should be made clear in the methods the that the same WT group was used as control for both social deficit models, including the rationale. Normally, in social defeat studies control mice experience daily cage changing and handling to control for the daily experience of the defeated mice (see Golden et al., 2011, Krishnan and Nestler 2008 for control details). On the other hand, when using mutant mice, the best controls are wild type littermates.</p><p>5. Given that 40 Hz stimulation altered 4-7 Hz power this suggests that theta-γ coupling is occurring, which is a phenomenon that occurs in both mPFC and BLA (see Stujenske et al., 2014). The paper would be improved by adding discussion of this phenomena and quantifying if coupling exists between the γ band and the 4-7 Hz during the social session and if it’s modulated by social avoidance.</p><p>6. Finally, given that dmPFC and BLA recordings were simultaneous reporting the coherence and directionality of signaling between dmPFC and BLA and how they are modulated between social vs no social conditions would strengthen the claim that dmPFC and BLA circuit is working together.</p><p>7. The methods describe an open field which I assume was used as the no target session, but this is not explicitly stated. If the open field was the no target session, this needs to be clearly stated in the methods.</p><p>8. The manuscript should be revised for typos.

In this manuscript, Nahoko Kuga et al. investigate how neural activity in the dmPFC and BLA is modulated during social interaction. By recording local field potentials from dmPFC and BLA during social interaction, the authors find that the dmPFC and BLA show modulations of 4-7 Hz and 30-60 Hz oscillations during social interaction. In wild type animals, 4-7 Hz oscillation power increases and 30-60 Hz power decreases during social interaction, and this bidirectional modulation is associated with social avoidance behavior. During social approach, however, 4-7 Hz oscillation power decreases. Interestingly, mouse models with reduced social interactions (Shank3 knockout and socially defeated animals) display a further increase in 4-7 Hz oscillation power during social avoidance behavior compared to wild type animals. These new results are interesting, as they confirm the findings from previous studies that theta and low γ bands are modulated during social interaction and social anxiety and further show that the BLA and dmPFC are modulated in a similar manner.</p><p>Several aspects of the manuscript could benefit from additional experiments and controls and further data analysis. While a majority of animals show a positive preference for social targets (Figure 1B), the use of CD1 animals as target animals could lead to more social avoidance, as CD1 animals are substantially larger and may increase more social avoidance behavior than regular C57BL/6J animals. The authors show that 4-7 Hz and 30-60 Hz power is heavily modulated during specific types of social behavior, such as approaching vs. leaving the interaction zone. This suggests that the neural activity changes in Shank3 or socially defeated animals reported in Figures 2 and 3 could simply reflect changes in behavior compositions, as opposed to changes in the underlying neural encoding of these behaviors.</p><p>Specific comments:</p><p>1. Previous studies have already reported modulation of theta and low γ bands during social interaction (Liu et al. 2020 Science Advances), and that 40 Hz modulation of PV neurons can restore social behavior deficits in mouse models with reduced social interaction (Cao et al. 2018 Neuron). An increase in activity of wide-spiking cells and a decrease in activity of fast-spiking cells have also been reported in social anxiety (Xu et al. 2019 Neuron). Some of these studies also used more sophisticated approaches, such as combining in vivo electrophysiology with opto-tagging to identify specific interneuron cell types. The authors should discuss their new findings in relation to these previous studies.</p><p>2. The authors show an increase in 4-7 Hz power and decrease in 30-60 Hz power during social interaction, and that these changes are associated with social avoidance behavior. While a majority of animals show a positive preference for social targets (Figure 1B), the use of CD1 animals as target animals could lead to more social avoidance, as CD1 animals are substantially larger and may increase more social avoidance behavior than regular C57BL/6J animals. The authors could use unfamiliar C57BL/6J mice as target animals. Also, the authors could incorporate an additional control with a toy mouse instead of an empty cage in the experimental setup.</p><p>3. The authors show that 4-7 Hz and 30-60 Hz power is heavily modulated during specific types of social behavior, such as approaching vs. leaving the interaction zone. This suggests that the neural activity changes in Shank3 or socially defeated animals reported in Figures 2 and 3 could simply reflect changes in behavior compositions, as opposed to changes in the underlying neural encoding of these behaviors. The authors could perform more in-depth analyses of the behaviors of Shank3 or socially defeated animals using a similar approach to determine whether and how Shank3 or socially defeated animals display different compositions of behavior in their assays. The authors could also investigate the modulations of 4-7 Hz and 30-60 Hz power during these specific behaviors in Shank3 or socially defeated animals.</p><p>4. Given that the behavior repertoire is diverse across wild-type mice (Figure 1B), the current work would benefit from examining whether the level of social motivation is related to the magnitude of change of dmPFC 4-7 Hz signal in wild type mice. More specifically, this can be addressed by splitting wild-type mice into subgroups with high and low social motivation, followed by examining if the change of dmPFC 4-7 Hz band in the low social motivation subgroup is higher than that of the high social motivation subgroup, and whether it is comparable to Shank3 and socially defeated groups. Alternatively, correlating percent time of social interaction to the change magnitude of dmPFC 4-7Hz through a simple linear regression model would also help enhance the generalizability of the claim overall.</p><p>5. While the authors simultaneously recorded LFP signals from both dmPFC and BLA, the temporal relationship between dmPFC and BLA oscillatory signals was not explored. The impact of the current work can be bolstered through a deeper characterization of their temporal relationship. The simultaneous LFP recording in both regions provide an opportunity to examine the phase relationship of the 4-7 Hz band (and others) during different social epochs (e.g. approaching/leaving the interaction zone) which may shed light on whether PFC-amygdalar communication is involved in social anxiety-related behaviors.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>Here the authors are using optogenetics combined with in vivo recordings of mouse prefrontal cortex and amygdala during social behavior to test the sufficiency of different frequency bands for those social behaviors. Once establishing how the oscillations change during social behavior in wildtype mice, they identify how these oscillations are similar and different in two mouse models of neuropsychiatric disorders with decreased social interactions. In one of the disease models, they use optogenetics to enhance the power of the oscillations and find that it increases social behavior in that model.</p><p>The authors examine modulation of theta and γ power in dorsal medial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) and basolateral amygdala (BLA) during social exploration behavior. The authors performed simultaneous recordings from the dmPFC and BLA during a social interaction test and found increases in theta power and decreases in γ power compared to the non-social interaction trial. Social defeat animals and Shank3 KO mice had similar alterations in their theta frequency bands compared to control mice. Optogenetic manipulation of γ frequency bands increased social exploration behavior in social defeat mice.</p><p>The strengths of the paper include the importance of the question being asked, including the brain regions studied and in studying the potential for convergent biological changes in abnormal behavior arising from different etiologies. Experimentally, a strength is the combination of simultaneous in vivo physiology of two brain regions with optogenetics in awake, behaving mice. These are difficult experiments. A further strength is the nuanced analysis of animal behavior and the measurement of brain oscillations during those phases (i.e. approach vs. leaving).</p><p>The wildtype data are intriguing and interesting, as they help fill in the gaps in our understanding of how and when the prefrontal cortex and amygdala activate during social behavior, and how this is similar and different in disease models that display decreased social interactions.</p><p>There is an over-reliance on multiple t-tests instead of using more appropriate statistical analyses such as ANOVA.</p><p>A barrier to interpreting the results of the disease model work is the lack of appropriate controls. The authors do not use littermate controls for the Shank3 KO vs. wildtype comparisons. Instead, they compare Shank3 KO mice from one line of mice to wildtype mice from another line. It is well-known that different lines of mice can have drastically different behavior and physiology. Second, there are no untreated control animals for any of the social defeat optogenetics experiments, so it is unknown if the effects observed are specific to the disease model or nonspecific effects. There are appropriate eYFP-only controls and no-light controls.</p><p>There are multiple recommendations for improvement:</p><p>For all figures, I recommend showing individual data points for each animal in addition to the mean +/- SEM. There is no clear reason this is done in some graphs but not others.</p><p>Figure S2 – I wonder if performing multiple paired t-test is the correct statistical treatment for the comparisons, since you're dividing the data into multiple different frequency bands in the same animal.</p><p>For the data presented in Figure 1 and S2, it is unclear if the powers measured are for the whole trial or only when the animal is in the &quot;interaction zone&quot;.</p><p>In figure 1E, it is unclear what is being averaged if this is a single mouse. Data are presented as the mean +/- SEM, but it’s unclear what samples are used to calculate this.</p><p>Consider adding a horizontal line to Figures 1 F and G showing where Z = 0. It is unclear what is being used as the baseline for the Z score.</p><p>N=14 mice for the dmPFC recordings and N=6 for the BLA recordings. If all recordings were done with both locations targeted but fewer BLA animals are presented, please indicate why (presumably because many of the BLA recordings were not targeted correctly).</p><p>The order of data presentation in Figure 2 is confusing because it leads the reader to think that the data presented in 2C and D have something to do with the drawing presented in 2B. Based on the text, the drawing in 2B only pertains apparently to the data presented in 2E and F.</p><p>P7, L134-136 – it is unclear if this interpretation is based on the KO mice having lower social behavior than WT mice as a group, or on a per-animal basis.</p><p>The Shank3 KO mice appear to be tested without a WT littermate control group.

For example, p12, L248 says neurons were excluded from further analysis if they didn't show a preference in phase locking for approaching vs. leaving. Then the authors discuss how the remaining FS neurons showed higher theta phase locking during leaving. The confusing part is that then they discuss how RS neurons &quot;did not show such significance&quot;. By definition, the neurons should have been excluded from this very analysis if they didn't show a significant difference between leaving and approaching.</p><p>For Figure S4, I am concerned that doing multiple paired t-tests is not the appropriate statistics for these multiple frequency bands.

What follows is the authors’ response to the first round of review.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>Kuga and colleagues utilized two mouse models (Shank3 mutants and socially defeated mice) that show sociability deficits to study associations between 4-7 Hz (lower range of theta band) and 30-60 Hz (low γ) oscillations in dmPFC and BLA and social deficits. They record from dmPFC and BLA in two arenas: one with a novel mouse and an empty arena (open field). They show that on average with the novel mouse there is more 4-7 Hz power in dmPFC and BLA, suggesting an association of 4-7 Hz with the social context. Several metrics suggest that the increase in 4-7 Hz power is associated with social avoidance. Finally, they show that stimulating optogenetically mPFC parvalbumin interneurons at 40 Hz (but not lower frequencies) resulted in lower 4-7 Hz power in dmPFC and BLA and more social exploration. To my knowledge this is the first study linking lower range theta in dmPFC and BLA to social avoidance, which is a strength of the study. Furthermore, the use of multiple models with social deficits strengthens that connection to social avoidance. However, the authors calculate metrics differently in the control group and mouse models making it very difficult to compare controls vs mouse models. In addition, the claim of the authors that dmPFC and BLA 4-7 Hz is linked to social interactions (stated in title and summary) is questionable since there are not enough controls to rule out that anxiety-like behavior in the arena is what is driving the changes.</p><p>Clarifications on the following are necessary to support the claims:</p><p>1.1. Ample literature links theta oscillations (including the 4-7 Hz range) to anxiety and fear related behaviors in the dmPFC and BLA, as noted by the authors in the introduction. The authors do the social interaction test in a large arena (same size as an open field) therefore the mice will very likely exhibit anxiety-like behavior (thigmotaxis) which will modulate 4-7 Hz in the dmPFC and BLA.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this crucial comment. To address these concerns, we performed additional experiments and analyses as below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1.2. Furthermore, the authors used a larger unfamiliar mouse of a different strain, potentially inducing social anxiety. This all brings up the possibility that the changes reported in this manuscript are driven by anxiety-like behavior rather than social interactions (as its claimed in this manuscript).</p></disp-quote><p>As the reviewer pointed out, we utilized a larger CD-1 mouse as a target mouse in the test, which may induce more anxiety-related or fearful behavior. To reduce the effects of these emotional factors, we performed additional tests using an unfamiliar C57BL/6J mouse with a similar body size as a target mouse (new Figure 1J). In this condition, we found significant changes in dmPFC 4–7 Hz and 30–60 Hz power in the target session, similar to the results from the larger CD-1 mouse as shown in Figure 1F. This result confirms that the dmPFC power changes found in this study are induced by social behavior and are less associated with emotional components such as anxiety.</p><p>In addition, as a control test with no social behavior, we performed additional experiments by placing a plastic toy mouse in the cage as a novel object instead of a real mouse (new Figure 1K). In this condition, we found no significant dmPFC 4–7 Hz and 30–60 Hz power changes between the two sessions. This result confirms that the dmPFC power changes are induced specifically in a condition where mice exhibit social behavior while they are less associated with a novelty.</p><p>These results are presented in Figure 1J and 1K and described in the Results part (Line 168-184).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1.3. To clarify this the authors should do all the calculations in the empty arena (no target session) to ensure that none of their effects are driven going towards the periphery or by staying in a corner of the field (what they quantify as social avoidance when target is present). For example, what is the difference between 4-7 Hz power during social avoidance vs staying in the same periphery corner in the no target session. Based on the literature these behaviors on the empty arena will likely lead to modulations in theta frequencies, but possibly the modulations are larger when there is a novel mouse in the arena. However, as presented it's not possible to dissociate the findings with potential changes due to anxiety-like behavior.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this great idea. To test whether the observed LFP power changes in the target session may be explained by increased anxiety, we performed additional analyses and created new Figure 2.</p><p>Here, the SI test field was divided into social avoidance zones, peripheral areas, and a center area (Figure 2A). In both the no target and target sessions, no significant differences in dmPFC and BLA 4–7 Hz and 30–60 Hz LFP power were observed among these areas (Figure 2B and 2C). These results demonstrate that anxiety-related behavior alone does not induce prominent changes in dmPFC and BLA 4–7 Hz and 30–60 Hz LFP power found in this study. In the Results part, we added a new paragraph to explain these results including statistics and their backgrounds (for more detail, please see Line 185214).</p><p>Based on these new findings, we rewrote the Discussion part related to anxiety induced LFP patterns (Line 471-479).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.1. The authors calculate 4-7 Hz power during social approach vs leaving in the WT mice but in the other two groups they calculate it during time spent in the corner (social avoidance). A central claim of this manuscript (expressed in summary and in lines 216-218) is that the 4-7 Hz patterns are opposite in the social deficit models vs the control. However, the way 4-7 Hz was calculated across groups are not the same, so that claim currently has an important caveat. Firstly, uniformity of calculating metrics will improve the rigor and clarity of the paper.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this constructive suggestion.</p><p>First, to consistently apply the same analyses across the three mouse types, we changed our analysis (from z-scores to %changes) to compare differences between the no target and target sessions in the wild-type mice in Figure 1F and 1G. These results are now fairly comparable to the Shank3 KO and defeated mice in Figure 3B and 3C.</p><p>In addition, similar to socially deficient mice, we newly analyzed how social avoidance behavior affects LFP patterns in the wild-type mice in Figure 4A and found no significant changes in LFP power by social avoidance behavior. This analysis is now comparable to the analyses applied to Shank3 KO and defeated mice. Overall, the new Figure 4 demonstrated clear differences across wild-type mice, Shank3 KO mice, and defeated mice.</p><p>In Figure 5 (not changed from the previous manuscript), we analyzed how social approach behavior affects LFP patterns in wild-type mice. While Shank3 KO mice exhibited less social interaction, they still showed substantial approach behavior (Supplementary Figure 4A). We thus applied the same analysis to Shank3 KO mice by extracting approach behavior, similar to the wild-type mice, and found that they did not show significant differences in dmPFC 4–7 Hz and 30–60 Hz power between approach and leaving behavior (Supplementary Figure 4D). This result suggests that social behavior-related dmPFC activity is not properly regulated in socially deficient mice. These results are added in the Results part (Line 335-340).</p><p>In defeated mice, this analysis was not applicable because most of them did not show sufficient social approach trials (Figure 3A and Supplementary Figure 4A).</p><p>Taken together, we consider that these new sets of additional analyses that are consistently applied across mouse groups and the reorganization of these figures demonstrate comparable differences across the mouse groups.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.2. Secondly, power during both behaviors (social avoidance and social leaving) suggest that 4-7 Hz is associated with not interacting, rather than with social interaction. Assuming that the dissociation from anxiety can be done (point 1), the data support that 4-7 Hz dmPFC and BLA power is associated with social avoidance, not social interactions.</p></disp-quote><p>This is also a crucial point. While our results support that dmPFC 4–7 Hz oscillations dynamically change with social behavior, rather than anxiety as stated above, we could not fully conclude whether they are more strongly related to social interaction or social avoidance. Therefore, throughout the manuscript, we weakened our statement related to “social interaction” and simply described “social behavior”. For example, in the Title and Discussion part, we replaced our statement “social interaction behavior” to “social behavior”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. This study normalizes LFP signals within animals making it difficult to understand if the patterns reported only hold with relative measurements only or if 4-7 Hz absolute power across groups differs in the distinct conditions. In addition, only two example power spectra, one with a log scale that makes it hard to see 4-7 Hz, are shown in the paper making it difficult to assess the 4-7 Hz peaks across groups and conditions and to understand why 4-7 Hz was selected as a frequency band. This study will highly benefit from including average power spectra for all conditions and groups.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this helpful suggestion. Indeed, the previous figure was hard to understand.</p><p>First, we presented new LFP spectrums “without normalization” in Figure 1E top. These spectrums were obtained by averaging over all mice. In addition, we presented all datasets obtained from individual mice in Supplementary Figure 2A. As shown in this figure, absolute LFP power spectrum was variable across individual mice, presumably due to differences in recording conditions (e.g. electrode impedance, recording sites, or individual differences of baseline). In spite of these individual differences, their averages exhibited differences between the two sessions at relatively lower (below 10 Hz) and higher (tens of Hz) frequency bands (Figure 1E, top).</p><p>To further emphasize these differences, we newly created a spectrum representing ratios of LFP power in the target session relative to that in the no target session (Figure 1E, bottom). The spectrum more clearly visualized a significant increase and decrease in dmPFC power at a frequency band of 4–7 Hz and 30–60 Hz, respectively, consistent with our statistical results (Figure 1F). Moreover, Supplementary Figure 3A and 3B demonstrate that these LFP power changes were not observed outside the 4–7 Hz and 30–60 Hz bands.</p><p>These results are now added in the Results part (Line 102-125).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Given the optoelectric effect that light can have in electrodes which impacts LFPs (see Cardin et al., 2012), it is important to rule out that the power differences reported in mPFC in Figure 6 are not driven by light presentation. The authors only show data from an opsin group, so there is no control group to address this concern.</p></disp-quote><p>To address this concern, we performed additional experiments by using control PVCre mice injected with AAV5-EF1a-DIO-eYFP (YFP expression only). We confirmed that photostimulation to these control mice did not significantly change dmPFC power. These results are now presented in Figure 7D and described in the Results part (Line 433-436).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Given that locomotion can change 4-7 Hz power in the mPFC (see Adhikari et al., 2010) it is important to rule out that the increased in 4-7 Hz power seen in the target session relative to the no target session is not driven by a difference in locomotion.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this crucial suggestion. To address this comment, we first compared moving speed between the two sessions and found that overall moving speed was significantly higher in the no target session than the target session. This result is now presented in Supplementary Figure 2D.</p><p>To confirm whether locomotion affects LFP power, we next compared LFP power between running periods with a moving speed of more than 5 cm/s and stop periods with a moving speed of less than 1 cm/s, which occupied 20.2% and 40.6%of entire recording periods, respectively (Supplementary Figure 2E and 2F). Both in the dmPFC and BLA, 4–7 Hz power during stop periods was significantly higher than that during running periods, suggesting that locomotion affects these LFP power changes.</p><p>Therefore, to address the reviewer’s concern, we performed the same analysis (to Figure 1F) by specifically extracting these behavioral patterns with high and low moving speed in Supplementary Figure 2G and 2H. Interestingly, the significant changes in dmPFC LFP power between the two sessions were specifically observed during stop periods, but not running periods. These results confirm that, while 4–7 Hz and 30–60 Hz power in the dmPFC and BLA is higher and lower, respectively, as moving speed is lower, the LFP power changes found in this study were still prominent in the target session when mice stopped. These results are now described in the Results part (Line 146-167).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. The manuscript should cite and discuss how the current data can be consolidated with this study by Liu et al., 2020 that stimulated mPFC PV interneurons at γ frequencies and sees changes in sociability. However, they report that low γ in the mPFC increases during a social session compared to empty arena, which is opposite from what the authors currently report. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32832654/</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this comment. We made an additional paragraph In the Discussion part and described possible explanations as follows:</p><p>“Our observation of the increased dmPFC 30–60 Hz power in the no target session appears inconsistent with a report by Liu et al. (2020) showing that mPFC low γ power is decreased when mice explore an empty cage in a three-chamber test. However, this inconsistency may be reconciled by a difference in conditions of the social interaction tests. In our study, the mice were first subject to a no target session in which no target mice were presented anywhere. On the other hand, the three-chamber test by Liu et al. (2020) initially contained both a target mouse and an empty cage at the same time in an experimental environment, a condition which is likely to be more similar to the target session, rather than the no target session, utilized in our study. Therefore, the three-chamber test itself might already induce overall changes in dmPFC 30–60 Hz power in the test environment, as observed from the target session in our study, which were not detected by Liu et al. (2020). In both the three chamber test (Liu et al., 2020) and the target session in our study, it is consistent that dmPFC 30–60 Hz (or γ-range) power increases occur when mice approach a target mouse.” (Line 480-493)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. To rule out that the increased in 4-7 Hz power seen in the target session relative to the no target session is not driven by a difference in locomotion, one approach is to see if there is a statistical difference in speed in one session vs the other. Alternatively, if there is a difference in speed, the other approach is to parse the data by speed and only use LFP signals from times in which the animals are moving at the same speed.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this constructive suggestion. Our answer to this comment is summarized in Comment #5 above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. Currently, it is not described how the z-scoring of the LFP signal is done. This is very important information that should be clearly explained in the methods for rigor and reproducibility.</p></disp-quote><p>First, in Figure 1F and 1G (one of our main results), we changed our analysis (from z-scores to %changes) to be consistent with Shank3 KO mice and defeated mice as in Figure 3B and 3C.</p><p>As for Figure 2B and 2C, we added a following explanation in the Results part (Line 197-200): “To compare relative changes in LFP power across behavior and sessions, LFP power at each frequency band was z-scored based on the average and SD of LFP power at each frequency band in an entire period including the no target and target sessions.” In addition, we added a following explanation in the Methods part (Line 722-724): “In Figure 2, z-scores at each frequency band were computed based on the average and SD of LFP power at each frequency band in an entire period including the no target and target sessions.”</p><p>As for Figure 4 and 5, we added a following explanation in the Methods part (Line 726-728): “In Figure 4 and 5, z-scores at each frequency band were computed based on the average and SD of LFP power at each frequency band in an entire period of the target session.”</p><p>For LFP power analysis, it is not easy to determine how we take a baseline to normalize datasets as behavioral patterns themselves differ across animals. Here, we tested several periods (i.e. resting periods only, approach periods, and avoidance periods) as baselines and confirmed statistical results became almost similar. After all, for simplicity, we took entire session periods as a baseline.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9. Given that the 2 mouse models are using the same control group data (Figures 2-3), the appropriate approach is to plot the 3 groups together, do an ANOVA then post-hoc comparisons that control for multiple comparisons. Currently, the authors are treating the control groups for the two social deficit models as independent, but they are the same data points. I do not think that grouping them adequately would change the conclusions reported but given the multiple comparisons using the same control group, this will be the most transparent and clear way to report the data.</p></disp-quote><p>According to the suggestion, we combined the comparisons across WT mice, Shank3 KO mice (previous Figure 2), defeated mice (previous Figure 3) in one Figure (new Figure 3). In all analyses, we now applied ANOVA and Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons (all statistical values are described in the manuscript (please see the first paragraph of “Increases in dmPFC 4–7 Hz power during social avoidance in socially deficient mouse models”)). These corrections did not alter our results from the previous manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10. In addition, it should be made clear in the methods the that the same WT group was used as control for both social deficit models, including the rationale. Normally, in social defeat studies control mice experience daily cage changing and handling to control for the daily experience of the defeated mice (see Golden et al., 2011, Krishnan and Nestler 2008 for control details).

Furthermore, the Granger causality spectrum exhibits a significantly higher Granger causality index at the 4–7 Hz band for the direction from the dmPFC to BLA than that for the direction from the BLA to the dmPFC, possibly representing the preferential projection of the dmPFC to the BLA (Gabbott et al., 2005; Bukalo et al., 2015).

Moreover, the Granger causality index at the 4–7 Hz band in the dmPFC-BLA direction was significantly higher than that in the BLA-dmPFC direction during approach leaving behavior, but not during approach behavior (Figure 5G). These results suggest that functional information transfer at the 4–7 Hz band from the dmPFC to the BLA is lowered during social approach behavior, compared with leaving behavior.

In this manuscript, Nahoko Kuga et al. investigate how neural activity in the dmPFC and BLA is modulated during social interaction. By recording local field potentials from dmPFC and BLA during social interaction, the authors find that the dmPFC and BLA show modulations of 4-7 Hz and 30-60 Hz oscillations during social interaction. In wild type animals, 4-7 Hz oscillation power increases and 30-60 Hz power decreases during social interaction, and this bidirectional modulation is associated with social avoidance behavior. During social approach, however, 4-7 Hz oscillation power decreases. Interestingly, mouse models with reduced social interactions (Shank3 knockout and socially defeated animals) display a further increase in 4-7 Hz oscillation power during social avoidance behavior compared to wild type animals. These new results are interesting, as they confirm the findings from previous studies that theta and low γ bands are modulated during social interaction and social anxiety and further show that the BLA and dmPFC are modulated in a similar manner.</p><p>Several aspects of the manuscript could benefit from additional experiments and controls and further data analysis. While a majority of animals show a positive preference for social targets (Figure 1B), the use of CD1 animals as target animals could lead to more social avoidance, as CD1 animals are substantially larger and may increase more social avoidance behavior than regular C57BL/6J animals. The authors show that 4-7 Hz and 30-60 Hz power is heavily modulated during specific types of social behavior, such as approaching vs. leaving the interaction zone. This suggests that the neural activity changes in Shank3 or socially defeated animals reported in Figures 2 and 3 could simply reflect changes in behavior compositions, as opposed to changes in the underlying neural encoding of these behaviors.</p><p>Specific comments:</p><p>1. Previous studies have already reported modulation of theta and low γ bands during social interaction (Liu et al. 2020 Science Advances), and that 40 Hz modulation of PV neurons can restore social behavior deficits in mouse models with reduced social interaction (Cao et al. 2018 Neuron). An increase in activity of wide-spiking cells and a decrease in activity of fast-spiking cells have also been reported in social anxiety (Xu et al. 2019 Neuron). Some of these studies also used more sophisticated approaches, such as combining in vivo electrophysiology with opto-tagging to identify specific interneuron cell types. The authors should discuss their new findings in relation to these previous studies.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this very crucial suggestion. As the reviewer says, the paper by Liu et al. (2020) nicely utilized optogenetic tagging and found of social interaction-related PV interneuronal activity. While we could not use such a sophisticated technique, we discussed how our study is related to these existing papers as follows:</p><p>In the Introduction part: “Recently, LFP oscillations in the PFC have been shown to modulate social behavior. A PFC oscillation at a low γ-range (20–50-Hz) band mediated by interneurons facilitates social interaction (Liu et al., 2020). Consistently, autism mouse models with social deficits exhibit impairments in PFC interneuronal activity (Han et al., 2012) and γ oscillations (Cao et al., 2018). These studies suggest a key role of PFC γ-range signals in the modulation of social behavior.” (Line 60-66)</p><p>In the Discussion part, we made a new paragraph: “Many previous studies have established that PV interneurons are a crucial cell type for generating cortical low γ-range (20–60 Hz) oscillations (Whittington et al., 1995; Bartos et al., 2007; Cardin et al., 2009; Sohal et al., 2009; Buzsaki and Wang, 2012; Nakamura et al., 2015; Cao et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2020). The PV-interneuron-mediated γ oscillation in the PFC is enhanced during social interaction (Liu et al., 2020) or attenuated in autism mouse models with social deficits (Cao et al., 2018), highlighting the importance of PFC PV interneurons in the expression of social behavior (Han et al., 2012; Xu et al., 2019) through the regulation of low γ oscillations (Cao et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2020). These studies utilized a protocol with 40-Hz photostimulation of PV interneurons with the aim of increasing PFC LFP power at the corresponding frequency (i.e. low γ) band (Cao et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2020). Notably, in our study, we initially sought to determine a protocol that could reduce dmPFC 4–7 Hz power to mimic the LFP power changes observed during approach behavior and eventually found that 40-Hz photostimulation selective to PV interneurons was optimal to meet this technical requirement, resulting in a decrease in dmPFC 4–7 Hz and an increase in 40 Hz power. The mechanisms underlying these reciprocal power changes are possibly mediated by a stimulation-induced interference of the entrainment of PV interneuronal spikes by a 4–7 Hz oscillation. Our study demonstrated that such optogenetic manipulations of PV interneurons extend to the BLA circuit and were sufficient to restore social interaction behavior that was reduced in social defeat stress-induced depression mouse models, similar to autism mouse models reported previously (Cao et al., 2018). Here, we note that we did not confirm that the phase-locked dmPFC interneurons observed in this study corresponded with PV-positive interneurons. To address these issues, further confirmation is necessary using techniques to identify cell types of recorded neurons such as optogenetic tagging (Liu et al., 2020).” (Line 519-544)</p><p>In addition, we discussed how our results are comparable to the results by Liu et al. (2020) (Line 480-493). For more detail, please see Reviewer #1 Major comment #6.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The authors show an increase in 4-7 Hz power and decrease in 30-60 Hz power during social interaction, and that these changes are associated with social avoidance behavior. While a majority of animals show a positive preference for social targets (Figure 1B), the use of CD1 animals as target animals could lead to more social avoidance, as CD1 animals are substantially larger and may increase more social avoidance behavior than regular C57BL/6J animals. The authors could use unfamiliar C57BL/6J mice as target animals. Also, the authors could incorporate an additional control with a toy mouse instead of an empty cage in the experimental setup.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this crucial suggestion. It is also raised by Reviewer #1.</p><p>As the reviewer pointed out, we utilized a larger CD-1 mouse as a target mouse in the test, which may induce more anxiety-related or fearful behavior. To reduce the effects of these emotional factors, we performed additional tests using an unfamiliar C57BL/6J mouse with a similar body size as a target mouse (new Figure 1J). In this condition, we found significant changes in dmPFC 4–7 Hz and 30–60 Hz power in the target session, similar to the results from the larger CD-1 mouse as shown in Figure 1F. This result confirms that the dmPFC power changes are induced by social behavior while they are less associated with emotional components such as anxiety.</p><p>In addition, as a control test with no social behavior, we performed additional experiments by placing a plastic toy mouse in the cage as a novel object instead of a real mouse (new Figure 1K). In this condition, we found no significant dmPFC 4–7 Hz and 30–60 Hz power changes between the two sessions. This result confirms that the dmPFC power changes are induced specifically in a condition where mice exhibit social behavior while they are less associated with a novelty.</p><p>These results are presented in Figure 1J and 1K and described in the Results part (Line 168-184).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The authors show that 4-7 Hz and 30-60 Hz power is heavily modulated during specific types of social behavior, such as approaching vs. leaving the interaction zone. This suggests that the neural activity changes in Shank3 or socially defeated animals reported in Figures 2 and 3 could simply reflect changes in behavior compositions, as opposed to changes in the underlying neural encoding of these behaviors. The authors could perform more in-depth analyses of the behaviors of Shank3 or socially defeated animals using a similar approach to determine whether and how Shank3 or socially defeated animals display different compositions of behavior in their assays. The authors could also investigate the modulations of 4-7 Hz and 30-60 Hz power during these specific behaviors in Shank3 or socially defeated animals.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this constructive suggestion.</p><p>First, in Supplementary Figure 4A, we presented additional information about the percentages of stay areas in the two sessions (left) and approach/leaving behavior in the target session (right) in the three mouse groups.</p><p>Second, similar to the wild-type mice in Figure 5, we analyzed how social approach behavior affects LFP patterns in Shank3 KO mice. While Shank3 KO mice exhibited less social interaction, they still showed substantial approach behavior (Supplementary Figure 4A). We thus applied the same analysis to Shank3 KO mice and found that they did not show significant differences in dmPFC 4–7 Hz and 30–60 Hz power between approach and leaving behavior (Supplementary Figure 4D). This result suggests that social behavior-related dmPFC activity is not properly regulated in socially deficient mice. These results are added in the Results part (Line 336-340). In defeated mice, this analysis was not applicable because most of them did not have sufficient social approach trials (Figure 3A and Supplementary Figure 4A).</p><p>Third, similar to socially deficient mice, we newly analyzed how social avoidance behavior affects LFP patterns in the wild-type mice in Figure 4A and found no significant changes in LFP power by social avoidance behavior. This analysis is now comparable to the analyses applied to Shank3 KO and defeated mice. Overall, the new Figure 4 clearly demonstrated differences across wild-type mice, Shank3 KO mice, and defeated mice.</p><p>Taken together, these mouse groups were consistently tested by the same analyses in Figure 3, 4 and Supplementary Figure 4D, demonstrating apparent differences between wild-type mice and socially deficient mice.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Given that the behavior repertoire is diverse across wild-type mice (Figure 1B), the current work would benefit from examining whether the level of social motivation is related to the magnitude of change of dmPFC 4-7 Hz signal in wild type mice. More specifically, this can be addressed by splitting wild-type mice into subgroups with high and low social motivation, followed by examining if the change of dmPFC 4-7 Hz band in the low social motivation subgroup is higher than that of the high social motivation subgroup, and whether it is comparable to Shank3 and socially defeated groups. Alternatively, correlating percent time of social interaction to the change magnitude of dmPFC 4-7Hz through a simple linear regression model would also help enhance the generalizability of the claim overall.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this insightful idea. Such individual differences are also our major research interests.</p><p>Before splitting our mice into subgroups, we first directly applied correlational analyses to all mice. In Supplementary Figure 2C, we plotted the SI ratios of individual wilttype mice against their percentages of dmPFC LFP power changes in the target session. However, we could not find significant correlations between these variables. These results demonstrate that the individual differences in social behavior are not crucially related to the dmPFC power changes at least within the wild-type mouse group tested in our study. These results are now described in the Results part (Line 139-145). Therefore, we did not apply further analyses (e.g. splitting into subgroups) on this dataset.</p><p>To compare with the results from socially deficient mice, we superimposed plots obtained from the Shank3 KO and defeated mice in Supplementary Figure 2C.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. While the authors simultaneously recorded LFP signals from both dmPFC and BLA, the temporal relationship between dmPFC and BLA oscillatory signals was not explored. The impact of the current work can be bolstered through a deeper characterization of their temporal relationship. The simultaneous LFP recording in both regions provide an opportunity to examine the phase relationship of the 4-7 Hz band (and others) during different social epochs (e.g. approaching/leaving the interaction zone) which may shed light on whether PFC-amygdalar communication is involved in social anxiety-related behaviors.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this great idea.

Moreover, the Granger causality index at the 4–7 Hz band in the dmPFC-BLA direction was significantly higher than that in the BLA-dmPFC direction during approach leaving behavior, but not during approach behavior (Figure 5G). These results suggest that functional information transfer at the 4–7 Hz band from the dmPFC to the BLA is lowered during social approach behavior, compared with leaving behavior. These results are added in the Results part (Line 326-335).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>Here the authors are using optogenetics combined with in vivo recordings of mouse prefrontal cortex and amygdala during social behavior to test the sufficiency of different frequency bands for those social behaviors. Once establishing how the oscillations change during social behavior in wildtype mice, they identify how these oscillations are similar and different in two mouse models of neuropsychiatric disorders with decreased social interactions. In one of the disease models, they use optogenetics to enhance the power of the oscillations and find that it increases social behavior in that model.</p><p>The authors examine modulation of theta and γ power in dorsal medial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) and basolateral amygdala (BLA) during social exploration behavior. The authors performed simultaneous recordings from the dmPFC and BLA during a social interaction test and found increases in theta power and decreases in γ power compared to the non-social interaction trial. Social defeat animals and Shank3 KO mice had similar alterations in their theta frequency bands compared to control mice. Optogenetic manipulation of γ frequency bands increased social exploration behavior in social defeat mice.</p><p>The strengths of the paper include the importance of the question being asked, including the brain regions studied and in studying the potential for convergent biological changes in abnormal behavior arising from different etiologies. Experimentally, a strength is the combination of simultaneous in vivo physiology of two brain regions with optogenetics in awake, behaving mice. These are difficult experiments. A further strength is the nuanced analysis of animal behavior and the measurement of brain oscillations during those phases (i.e. approach vs. leaving).</p><p>The wildtype data are intriguing and interesting, as they help fill in the gaps in our understanding of how and when the prefrontal cortex and amygdala activate during social behavior, and how this is similar and different in disease models that display decreased social interactions.</p><p>There is an over-reliance on multiple t-tests instead of using more appropriate statistical analyses such as ANOVA.</p><p>A barrier to interpreting the results of the disease model work is the lack of appropriate controls.
