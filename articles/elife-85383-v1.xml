Tumor-Treating Fields (TTFields) therapy is a treatment modality that has itself emerged over the past decade in active clinical use for patients with glioblastoma and malignant mesothelioma, based on the principle of using low-intensity alternating electric fields to disrupt microtubules in cancer cells undergoing mitosis. There is a need to identify other cellular and molecular effects of this treatment approach that could explain reported increased overall survival when TTFields are added to standard systemic agents. Tunneling nanotube (TNTs) are cell-contact-dependent filamentous-actin-based cellular protrusions that can connect two or more cells at long-range. They are upregulated in cancer, facilitating cell growth, differentiation, and in the case of invasive cancer phenotypes, a more chemoresistant phenotype. To determine whether TNTs present a potential therapeutic target for TTFields, we applied TTFields to malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) cells forming TNTs in vitro. TTFields at 1.0 V/cm significantly suppressed TNT formation in biphasic subtype MPM, but not sarcomatoid MPM, independent of effects on cell number. TTFields did not significantly affect function of TNTs assessed by measuring intercellular transport of mitochondrial cargo via intact TNTs. We further leveraged a spatial transcriptomic approach to characterize TTFields-induced changes to molecular profiles in vivo using an animal model of MPM. We discovered TTFields induced upregulation of immuno-oncologic biomarkers with simultaneous downregulation of pathways associated with cell hyperproliferation, invasion, and other critical regulators of oncogenic growth. Several molecular classes and pathways coincide with markers that we and others have found to be differentially expressed in cancer cell TNTs, including MPM specifically. We visualized short TNTs in the dense stromatous tumor material selected as regions of interest for spatial genomic assessment. Superimposing these regions of interest from spatial genomics over the plane of TNT clusters imaged in intact tissue is a new method that we designate Spatial Profiling of Tunneling nanoTubes (SPOTT). In sum, these results position TNTs as potential therapeutic targets for TTFields-directed cancer treatment strategies. We also identified the ability of TTFields to remodel the tumor microenvironment landscape at the molecular level, thereby presenting a potential novel strategy for converting tumors at the cellular level from âcoldâ to âhotâ for potential response to immunotherapeutic drugs.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>tunneling nanotubes</kwd><kwd>intercellular communication</kwd><kwd>cell communication</kwd><kwd>spatial transcriptomics</kwd><kwd>tumor-treating fields</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000043</institution-id><institution>American Association for Cancer Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AACR-Novocure Tumor-Treating Fields Research Award 1-60-62-LOU</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lou</surname><given-names>Emil</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000048</institution-id><institution>American Cancer Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>10.53354/pc.gr.153691</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lou</surname><given-names>Emil</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100003135</institution-id><institution>Minnesota Ovarian Cancer Alliance</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lou</surname><given-names>Emil</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Dick and Lynnae Koats</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lou</surname><given-names>Emil</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007249</institution-id><institution>University of Minnesota</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>The Mu Sigma Chapter of the Phi Gamma Delta Fraternity</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lou</surname><given-names>Emil</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>The Litman Family Fund for Cancer Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lou</surname><given-names>Emil</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>The Love Like Laurie Legacy</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lou</surname><given-names>Emil</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100013187</institution-id><institution>The Randy Shaver Cancer Research and Community Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lou</surname><given-names>Emil</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund9"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM122787</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Courtemanche</surname><given-names>Naomi</given-names></name><name><surname>Sherer</surname><given-names>Laura A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Cancer-directed treatment using Tumor-Treating Fields spatially modulates the tumor microenvironment at the cellular and molecular levels, decreasing nanotube-based cellular networks of communication while creating a microenvironment more susceptible to immunotherapeutic strategies.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Intercellular communication in the dense and highly heterogeneous tumor matrix is a critical function and hallmark of invasive cancers. Multiple forms of intercellular communication have been well documented and characterized, including gap junctions, extracellular vesicles, and signaling via diffusible growth factors, among others. In the past decade, a unique form of F-actin-based cellular protrusion known as tunneling nanotubes (TNTs) has been shown to mediate direct contact-dependent intercellular communication in many cell types, and particularly, invasive cancer phenotypes.</p><p>TNTs have the ability to physically bridge cells through a spectrum of intercellular distances, with a range of 5â10 Î¼m at extreme short-range to 100â500 Âµm and even longer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gousset et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lou et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Pasquier et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Pasquier et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sartori-Rupp et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Tishchenko et al., 2020</xref>). These ultrafine structures were first characterized in 2004 in PC12 cells, a cell line derived from rat pheochromocytoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rustom et al., 2004</xref>), and are morphologically and functionally distinct from other membranous protrusions such as filopodia or lamellipodia, which aid in motility and attachment to the extracellular matrix (ECM; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Nemethova et al., 2008</xref>). Unlike filopodia and lamellipodia, TNTs are non-adherent to the substratum in cells cultured in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Tishchenko et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rustom et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Desir et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dubois et al., 2020</xref>). TNTs have been identified in many forms of cells, including fibroblasts, epithelial cells, and neurons, but are prominently upregulated in cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lou et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Tishchenko et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Desir et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Desir et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Desir et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cole et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hanna et al., 2019</xref>). The potential for a single TNT to remain stable for hours, combined with its upregulation in cancer phenotypes, indicates that TNTs may be capable of mounting a rapid communication response to external stimuli or insults, including chemotherapeutic drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Tishchenko et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Desir et al., 2018</xref>). However, the mechanism(s) of TNT formation and the role of actin in TNT formation and stability across cell types remain largely unknown.</p><p>Tumor-Treating Fields (TTFields) therapy is a novel therapeutic strategy in clinical use for patients with several forms of advanced cancers, including glioblastomas and malignant pleural mesotheliomas (MPM). It is based on the principle of using low-intensity alternating electric fields to disrupt microtubules in cancer cells undergoing mitosis. These fields apply forces on charges and polarizable molecules inside and around cells. TTFields can disrupt mitosis in malignant cells due to its ability to interfere with mitotic spindle assembly through impairment of microtubule polymerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Giladi et al., 2015</xref>). Microtubules are essential in ensuring that chromosomes attach and segregate correctly during metaphase and anaphase, respectively. The individual subunits of microtubules, known as tubulins, are heterodimers with two distinct protein domains, in which one has a positive end and one has a negative end, creating a dipole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Marracino et al., 2019</xref>). If microtubules are not allowed to polymerize, cell division cannot occur, and this is typically followed by chromosomal abnormalities and mitotic cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Forth and Kapoor, 2017</xref>). Additionally, TTFields application creates a nonuniform electric field during the telophase phase of mitosis due to alignment of the cell in cytokinesis, leading to a process known as dielectrophoresis, which can also result in improper cell division and mitotic death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mun et al., 2018</xref>). Other mechanisms of action have also been demonstrated, including downregulation of DNA damage response, impairment of cancer cell migration, and induction of anti-cancer immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Porat et al., 2017</xref>). Unlike systemic cancer therapies, TTFields delivery is focused on the tumor area, thus minimizing effects on non-malignant cells outside the treated area. Due to differences in geometrical and electrical properties, the TTFields frequency range is deleterious to cancer but not to benign cells and is optimized to a specific tumor type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mun et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Porat et al., 2017</xref>). This technology is currently applied concomitantly with standard-of-care treatment approaches for patients with glioblastoma and mesothelioma, with clinical trials also ongoing in many other forms of metastatic or difficult-to-treat forms of cancer.</p><p>The bulk of studies to date on cellular effects and mechanism(s) of TTFields has focused on disruption of microtubules, leading to decreased cell division. For this study we hypothesized that TTFields also affect formation of F-actin based TNTs in intact cells. We have previously reported that TNTs are significantly upregulated in multiple forms of MPM, which serves as an excellent model system for studying and characterizing cellular structure, function, and dynamics of TNT-mediated intercellular communication of cellular signals. Here, we report the effects of TTFields on TNTs connecting MPM cells in vitro, and on cell-free monomeric and filamentous actin. We also examined differential expression of gene pathways of immune response, proliferative growth, and other hallmarks of MPM in an in vivo animal model in order to elucidate the impact of TTFields on the expression of genes known to be involved in TNT formation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Establishing TTFields application impact on TNT formation in malignant mesothelioma cells and optimizing parameters</title><p>We utilized two mesothelioma cell lines, MSTO-211H (biphasic histologic MPM subtype) and VAMT (sarcomatoid MPM), to investigate effects of TTFields application on TNT formation and function. These two cell lines were used having previously demonstrated that they reliably and reproducibly form TNTs in culture under variable conditions and are thus ideal for in vitro studies. TTFields were applied to cells in vitro using two devices: inovitro, which applies TTFields to cells in culture to which the electrodes from the power supply provide a pre-specified level of intensity and frequency of the alternating electric fields; and inovitro Live, in which the configuration is adapted for continuous administration of TTFields while permitting time-lapse microscopic imaging. We first tested the inovitro Live device to treat MSTO-211H at differing frequencies to establish parameters used to impact TNT formation. Previously, bidirectional application of TTFields has shown increased cytotoxicity relative to unidirectional delivery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kirson et al., 2004</xref>), with highest cytotoxicity for MSTO-211H cells displayed at a frequency of 150 kHz (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mumblat et al., 2021</xref>). Instead, we sought to elucidate the initial impact of TTFields on TNT protrusion formation, which may require differing frequencies than what is demonstrated to be most effective for a cytotoxic effect. Thus, we tested differing frequencies and directional vectors for TTFields application. TTFields intensity was administered at 1.0 V/cm but a frequency of either 200 kHz or 150 kHz was delivered bidirectionally or unidirectionally over a 72 hr period to MSTO-211H cells; these two frequencies were selected for testing because the approved devices for TTFields therapeutic delivery is applied at these frequencies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We found that by 24 hr, unidirectional TTFields treatment at 200 kHz had fewer TNTs than the control (p=0.004) and bidirectional application at 150 kHz (p=0.005). As compared to control, bidirectional application at 200 kHz also had statistically significantly fewer TNTs (p&lt;0.0001). However, unidirectional application at 150 kHz resulted in no significant differences in TNT formation throughout the 72-hr period (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). At times 48 and 72 hours, we also observed the decline in TNTs. As with previous studies, once cells become densely packed, they form fewer TNTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ady et al., 2014</xref>). Together the data indicated that applying TTFields at 200 kHz unidirectionally is more effective at decreasing TNT formation in MSTO-211H cells and we utilized this frequency for the rest of our experiments.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>TNT formation, cell growth, and cell viability of MSTO-211H and VAMT malignant mesothelioma cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) TNT formation in MSTO-211H following continuous TTFields exposure at 1.0 V/cm while varying frequency and field direction. 40,000 MSTO-211H cells were plated in a 35 mm dish and exposed to TTFields treatment at 1.0 V/cm with the above varying parameters; media was changed every 24 hours.

TTFields did not significantly alter the number of TNTs or cells at this intensity in either cell line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3</xref>). Once our experimental set-up was calibrated, we assessed effects of TTFields applied at a more standard intensity of 1.0 V/cm with a 200 kHz frequency bidirectionally to evaluate the potential impact on TNT formation. Although we demonstrated the highest impact on TNT formation with unidirectional fields, we desired to emulate clinical conditions and efficacy as closely as possible and thus utilized bidirectional electric fields. Both cell lines were treated with TTFields over a 72 hr period to assess TNT formation and cell growth, with further assessment for an additional 24 hr after TTFields was discontinued to observe any latent effect or recovery of TNT formation. Over the 72 hr treatment period, we noted a statistically significant difference in TNT formation at 48 hr with MSTO-211H cells, but this difference was not present at 72 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, p=0.018). Additionally, over the 24 hr following treatment stoppage, TNT formation decreased further in both the control and treatment groups and cell density continued to increase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>). In fact, cell growth increased steadily in both treatment and control groups at nearly exponential rates, to reach confluency by the end of the experiments, indicating there was no latent effect on either TNT formation or cell growth from TTFields application. Unlike MSTO-211H, when VAMT cells were subjected to TTFields at 1.0 V/cm, no significant differences were seen between treatment and control groups in either TNT formation or cell growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D and E</xref>). Lastly, we examined TNT formation in MSTO-211H following TTFields exposure at peak frequency threshold of 400 kHz to assess TNT suppression at a frequency substantially higher than what is used clinically (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1âfigure supplement 4</xref>).

However, as reported above, both MSTO-211H and VAMT continued to divide, even when monitored 24 hr following treatment. To confirm that the cells were indeed viable, we next performed cell viability assays at all time points on randomly selected fields of view using NucGreen Dead 480. In all cases, cell viability of both control and treatment groups was &gt;95% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F and G</xref>), demonstrating no induction of cell death in the treated cells. Because TTFields exposure is known to affect cancer progression, we measured DNA fragmentation through the TUNEL assay. To confirm our earlier results with NucGreen Dead 480 and investigate cell viability at 150 kHz, we also repeated cell viability assays with NucGreen Dead 480 at both 150 kHz and 200 kHz at 1.0 V/cm. Knowing that maximum TNT suppression occurred in MSTO-211H at 48 hr, we performed both assays at the 48 hr time point. For both TUNEL and NucGreen Dead assays, we noted minimal cell death with 2.4% and 1.8% mean cell death respectively at 150 kHz and 3.2% and 1% mean cell death at 200 kHz when referenced with a negative and positive control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). As our findings of exponential cell growth and low cell death are in contrast to previous TTFields application studies, we repeated the experiments above at 1.0 V/cm and 200 kHz, but this time plated cells at a much lower density. In concurrence with others, we noted an 80% reduction in cell count in the TTFields-treated group when compared to control by the 72â96 hour time point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1âfigure supplement 5</xref>, p=0.003).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Effect of TTFields exposure on actin polymerization and filament bundling</title><p>There are many unidentified molecular factors in the actin polymerization mechanism that form TNTs, including actin nucleators, elongators, bundlers, and destabilizers. In addition, there are membrane bound proteins involved in the process, and some of these components may differ between cell types. Filamentous actin forms the structural basis of the interior of TNTs. Because we observed a reduction in MSTO-211H TNTs with TTFields at 1.0 V/cm, and noting that tubulin depolymerization and polymerization has been observed to be directly impacted by TTFields treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Giladi et al., 2015</xref>), we next sought to determine what effects TTFields might have directly on actin at the polymer level. To accomplish this, we performed actin sedimentation experiments to examine both polymerization and bundling. Actin monomers in solution were combined with a KCl, MgCl<sub>2</sub>, and EGTA containing buffer to initiate polymerization, and for experimental samples, treated with TTFields at 1.0 V/cm- 200 kHz with the inovitro device. After one hour of incubation, solutions were spun down and run on an SDS-PAGE.

If TTFields did not directly alter actin polymerization, we considered a role for other components of the actin-based protrusion mechanism. As an initial experiment, we analyzed the actin bundling protein fascin to determine whether it was affected by TTFields. Again, there was no difference in the amount of actin bundling between TTFields-treated samples and controls, indicating that TTFields likely affect TNT formation by other factors in this system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and D</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2âsource data 1</xref>).</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>The effect of TTFields application on actin polymerization and actin filament bundling.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>, <bold>B</bold>) Sedimentation assays quantifying actin polymerization.

Demonstrating that TTFields exposure suppresses TNTs in MSTO-211H cells, we leveraged our ability to assess dynamic changes over time through continuous application of TTFields while capturing live-cell reaction during time-lapse microscopy. To do this, we utilized inovitro Live, a device that applies continuous TTFields while inserted into a tissue culture plate, and which is placed in an environmentally controlled microscope chamber. This experimental arrangement permits continuous viewing, imaging, and management of cells undergoing TTFields treatment in real time. Thus, we posited that addition of standard-of-care chemotherapeutic drugs cisplatin (C) and pemetrexed (P) (Alimta) would work at least additively, and possibly synergistically, in combination with TTFields.</p><p>We performed a series of time-lapse experiments with 6 experimental groups: Control, TTFields only (1.0 V/cm, 200 kHz), Cisplatin w/o TTFields, Cisplatin + TTFields, Pemetrexed +Cisplatin w/o TTFields, and Pemetrexed +Cisplatin + TTFields (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>). When TTFields treatments were applied for 72 hr, a downward trend in TNT formation was observed compared to the control group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).

Cell proliferation approximated an exponential growth curve for both the control and TTFields treatment groups, although the TTFields group had lower cell counts by 72 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Next, we examined TNT formation and cell proliferation when the chemotherapeutic drug cisplatin was added at a physiologically relevant concentration (160 nM) to cells in culture.

Cell growth was similar to controls for 0 and 24 hr, but by 72 hr the cell growth of the cisplatin and pemetrexed treatment was suppressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). When TTFields treatment was combined with cisplatin and pemetrexed, TNTs were also suppressed for the duration of the experiment similar to treatment with only cisplatin and pemetrexed.

We thus sought to leverage a spatial genomics approach to determine whether genes that have been associated with TNT formation and maintenance, are differentially expressed in a spatially distributed manner in intact tumors; and also to identify a convergent population of genes that are both differentially expressed following treatment using TTFields and also implicated in TNT biology. Within that context, to characterize alterations induced by TTFields at the genetic and molecular levels, and potential effects in particular on TNT-associated biomarkers, we performed spatial genomic analysis on an animal model of mesothelioma treated with TTFields, or alternately with heat as a sham for a negative control.</p><p>Eight total mice were injected with AB1 mesothelioma cells and assessed for tumor growth until they reached 200 mm<sup>3</sup> in size.

Following TTFields or heat application, the mice were sacrificed, and the tumors were formalin fixed and paraffin embedded. One section from all eight tumors was adhered to a glass slide, as per Nanostring GeoMx instructions, from which a total of twelve regions of interest (ROI) were chosen. Six ROIs were from TTFields-treated tumors, and six from heat sham-treated tumors. These 6 ROIs were further divided into high or low Ki67 positive regions, as a measurement of mitotic index.

(TNC), FST, and HGF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B and C</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). TNC is a glycoprotein involved in the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, and was previously found by our group to be upregulated in TNT promoting conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ady et al., 2014</xref>). TNC expression was 2.5-fold lower in TTFields-treated tumors compared to negative control (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). In contrast, upregulation was most prominent for HLA-DRB, LYZ, COL1A1, and COL1A2. LYZ is associated with neutrophil degranulation and host defense peptides, whereas COL1A1, COL1A2 along with HGF, TNC, and VEGFA are all part of the PI3K pathway, which plays an important role in cancer progression, and has been implicated in TNT regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wang et al., 2011</xref>). Expression of immunogenic markers with implications for efficacy of immuno-oncology therapeutic strategies were also found, and included CX3CR1, which was upregulated in TTFields-treated tumors overall, as well as the aforementioned HLA-DRB, C1R and COL3A1. Markers of angiogenic activity, such as VEGFA, which are also implicated in EMT, hypoxia signaling pathways and cell adhesion and motility, also were notably downregulated. In sum, application of TTFields altered a spectrum of metabolic and molecular signaling pathways that are well established in cell proliferation and division, ancillary pathways associated with construction and maintenance of the tumor matrix, while at the same time upregulating certain immunogenic markers.</p><p>After investigating differential gene expression in mice tumors treated with TTFields vs. control (heat sham), we imaged excised tumors using confocal fluorescence microscopy to identify and characterize TNTs and similar protrusions within the intact tumor specimens. Mice tumors were prepared as described above and sectioned into 15 Î¼m slices, and then mounted, deparaffinized, and stained with Sytox Green 488 and Alexa Fluor 647 Phalloidin as described in Methods below. Z-stacks and images were acquired at 60 x oil immersion. In the control heat-treated native tissue, we observed TNTs, representative samples of which are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1</xref>. The one shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> is in the form of a TNT protrusion in a high Ki-67 expressed ROI, 4.5 Âµm long in the XY plane at 60 X. Analysis of the z-stack at Nyquist sampling using IMARIS 3D revealed an additional TNT protrusion of the same length labeled by Alexa Fluor 647 phalloidin; and both were suspended three-dimensionally within the tissue microenvironment of the sample (<xref ref-type="video" rid="fig6video1">Figure 6âvideo 1</xref>). In TTFields-treated tissue, we similarly identified TNTs, or at least TNT-like protrusions, via analysis of a z-stacked 60 x field of view with high Ki-67 expression measuring approximately 4 Âµm in length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig6video2">Figure 6âvideo 2</xref>). Each of the identified protrusions was consistent in appearance with our previous results identifying TNTs/TNT-like protrusions connecting cells in intact human tumor specimens from mesothelioma patients. The observed differences resulted primarily from a much more densely packed stromatous environment in this animal model. The protrusions were both shorter in comparison to the human version, and also much shorter in length than the TNTs we observed in vitro.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Representative fluorescence images of TNTs in intact mesothelioma tumor from our mouse model.</title><p>BALB/C mice were injected with AB1 mesothelioma cells and resulting tumors were excised, sectioned, and used for NanoString GeoMx spatial profiling, as well as for imaging on a NIKON A1RSi light confocal microscope.

Because the main component of TNTs is F-actin molecules, which have an electrochemically polar nature, we decided to study the effect of TTFields treatment on TNT formation in mesothelioma. In this study, we investigated the ability of TTFields to affect TNT formation and function in MPM, and also evaluated genetic signatures affected by TTFields treatment of MPM in an animal model. We found that TTFields significantly suppressed formation of TNTs in the biphasic (epithelioid plus sarcomatoid) form of MPM represented by the MSTO-211H cell line, when TTFields were applied at standard intensity of 1.0 V/cm, 48 hr after initiation of treatment. No significant differences were seen at 24 hr, nor subsequent to 48 hr, when cell crowding under cell culture conditions naturally leads to fewer TNTs. We found no detectable effect on TNTs with the pure sarcomatoid cell line VAMT. We assessed free actin, in monomeric and filamentous form, and found no detectable differences due to TTFields in this context. Spatial genomic assessment of intact MPM tumors following TTFields detected a notable upregulation of immuno-oncologic biomarkers, with concurrent downregulation of multiple metabolic, cell signaling, and cell growth pathways associated with dysregulation of MPM and other cancers. Some of these signals have also been implicated by our team and others in TNT activity in MPM and similar cell types.</p><p>Previous studies of TNTs have demonstrated disruption of TNTs primarily through knockdown or inhibition of protein complexes that promote actin formation, such as M-sec (TNFaip2), Arp 2/3, and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barutta et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Carter et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hase et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Schiller et al., 2013</xref>). The application of TTFields has already been shown to disrupt mitosis in actively dividing cells via their effect on microtubules (MTs), using a non-pharmacologic approach. Ultimately, intracytoplasmic actin filaments are inextricably linked to microtubule dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Colin et al., 2018</xref>), and yet the role of actin may exceed the role of MTs in cancer-relevant cellular actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bijman et al., 2008</xref>), including local invasion and metastatic potential. What is notable about TNTs is that there are sub-classes characterized by âthinâ and âthickâ variants that vary in composition, including presence and extent of microtubules. MTs are not universally expressed/present in TNTs and furthermore are highly dynamic components. A previous study from our group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jana et al., 2022</xref>) using the same mesothelioma cells (MSTO-211H) reported that co-localization of different cytoskeletal elements revealed a striking difference in the nanotube structure based on geometric width. âThinâ (&lt;700 nm) nanotubes contained only actin, while both microtubules and vimentin intermediate filaments were localized to âthickâ (&gt;700 nm) nanotubes. When grown in standard culture plate conditions, MSTO-211H cells formed thin TNTs that did not harbor MTs and showed a lack of tubulin expression. Within this context, our evaluation of effect of TTFields was focused on actin-based mechanisms.</p><p>Because TNTs are composed of polar actin subunits, a significant disruption of TNTs would suggest that actin is required for nanotube stability. G-actin subunits, the main component of TNTs, contain a distinct polarity. TTFields could be used to force G-actin subunits to align along the electric field instead of polymerizing. However, as there was no effect of TTFields on cell-free forms of actin, our findings suggested a more selective mechanism of TTFields. Indeed, when controlling for other parameters, the maximum suppression of TNT occurring unidirectionally vs bidirectionally may indicate that the orientation of the affected TNT component as well as its identity may play important roles in TNT formation. Thus, further studies unifying the mechanism of TTFields and the ultra-structure of TNTs are needed.</p><p>Preclinical models of TTFields have demonstrated their ability to induce cell death over time. In the current in vitro study, overall cell viability remained above 95% in both the control and treatment groups at both intensities and at all time points when 40,000 MSTO-211H cells were seeded one day before treatment started. However, when MSTO-211H were seeded at a lower density and exposed to TTFields, markedly reduced cell counts were observed at 72â96 hr of exposure, indicating that TTFields cytotoxic effect, at least in vitro, is affected by cell density. Ultimately, TTFields should be used in conjunction with other forms of cancer therapy, such as radiation therapy or chemotherapy to achieve maximum efficacy.</p><p>MPM is an ideal model for in vitro study and characterization of TNTs. It thus proved especially useful here, with additional value and background that MPM cells lines, including MSTO-211H had previously been evaluated after exposure to TTFields. Giladi et al. conducted a study on the optimal inhibitory frequencies and intensities of various cell lines exposed to TTFields. It was found that of the 30 cell lines tested, MSTO-211H was categorized as sensitive to the cytotoxic effects of TTFields (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Giladi et al., 2015</xref>). Such a finding could explain the discrepancy in TNT formation between MSTO-211H and VAMT, suggesting that properties specific to individual cell lines could allow for resistance to TTFields treatment. While optimal inhibitory frequency/intensity of VAMT sarcomatoid MPM was not measured in the study, its behavior under TTFields, specifically a non-significant difference in TNT formation, suggested that it is less sensitive relative to MSTO-211H.</p><p>The precise cellular mechanism(s) and identity of molecular machinery complex(es) necessary for TNT-mediated intercellular trafficking have not yet been identified. It is conceivable that the process mirrors the ones seen in other filamentous membrane-based protrusions, and it is equally conceivable that the process of TNTs may be cell type-dependent. Is actin necessary for the function of TNTs, or just the structure? Does actin polymerization correlate with TNT stability, in addition to function? Answers to these questions could provide insight into specific molecular markers involved in TNT formation as well as targeted therapy options in clinical practice. One idea stems from the role of the Arp 2/3 complex, which serves as a nucleation site for actin filaments by binding to the side of one filament and subsequently acting as a template for another filament, which is added at a 70 degree angle relative to the first filament (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Goode et al., 2001</xref>). While Arp 2/3 has not directly been studied, the Rho GTPase protein family has been observed to localize multiple proteins, including Arp 2/3, that can then serve as potential nucleation sites for actin filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hanna et al., 2017</xref>). Indeed, TTFields application has been shown to activate the Rho-ROCK pathway and promote reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton, which may explain our findings on TNT suppression in MSTO-211H (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Voloshin et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>The use of TTFields performed in vitro may provide insight into TNT biology. However, we sought to move a step beyond that by leveraging an even newer version of the technology that permits tailored treatment of TTFields in vivo to tumors in animal models. The TNTs that we visualized ex vivo were markedly shorter than their in vitro counterparts. These differences in length could be attributed to density of the tissue stroma and sectioning thickness, which reduces the likelihood of long-range cell communication via TNTs. We utilized TTFields technology to treat multiple MPM tumors, then further leveraged a spatial genomics approach to uncover the spatial geography of TTFields effect, and determine what links would exist, if any, between differentially expressed genes and our current and past findings of TNTs in vitro. The findings from spatial genomic analysis overall were highly notable for uncovering classes of immuno-oncologic response genes that were upregulated following TTFields exposure, in comparison to heat sham-treated tumors. The clinical implication for this finding is important because it is not yet established which set of cancer-directed therapies match best with TTFields, and in what sequence (prior to, during, or following each other), to produce best clinical response. Upregulation of factors such as CSF1 (macrophage colony stimulating factor-1, a cytokine responsible for macrophage production and immunoresponse), CX3CR1 (chemokine signaling), and HLA-DRB (lymphocyte trafficking and T cell receptor signaling), with concurrent modulation of the tumor microenvironment (TME) mediated by increased expression of collagens COL1A1, COL1A2, and COL3A1, may induce an inflammatory niche susceptible to cutting edge therapeutic including immune checkpoint inhibitors. Using COL1A1, a modulator of mesenchymal invasive potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Comba et al., 2022</xref>) which we found to be upregulated following TTFields treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5BâC</xref>), provides support in identifying potential drivers of TTFields treatment resistance. Overall, our spatial genomic analysis suggests a possible role for combining TTFields with immunotherapy and/or selective targeted therapies in creating a more drug targeted friendly TME.</p><p>This work builds on evidence from our team dating back to 2010 demonstrating that TNTs and TNT-like protrusions can be imaged in intact tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lou et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lou et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lou et al., 2010</xref>). It also, to our knowledge, provides the first report of spatial mapping and transcriptomic assessment of regions of heterogeneous tumors in tandem with identification of TNTs in intact tissue specimens, providing the potential identification of specific molecular and cellular markers of TNTs. We offer this new method, which we have designated Spatial Profiling of Tunneling nanoTubes (SPOTT), as a potential tool that will be useful for further discovery at the intersection of cellular biology and molecular diagnostics.</p><p>It is the downregulated set of genes that is most prominent in identifying signals that could explain why formation of TNTs in biphasic MPM was suppressed by TTFields. Numerous classes and specific genes involved in cell adhesion and motility or in epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) were downregulated by TTFields-treated MPM, including most prominently Tenascin C (TNC) and vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA). We have previously reported that Tenascin C, a modulator of cell invasive potential, is upregulated in mesothelioma cells primed in cell culture conditions conducive to TNT formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ady et al., 2014</xref>). Furthermore, transition of mesothelioma cells to EMT is strongly associated with a sharp rise in TNT formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lou et al., 2012</xref>). We have previously reported on the intercellular transport of VEGF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lou et al., 2018</xref>), a finding that implicates TNTs in other cancer-provoking processes including angiogenesis. In regards to the Arp2/3 complex, none of these genes were included in the transcriptome atlas we used for this study. RhoA and B expression were assayed, but no differential gene expression was observed. The data signals shown using spatiotemporal analysis produced an overview of a TME that was clearly reconfigured by TTFields treatment, one that has crossover with factors associated with TNT formation and function as shown in vitro. We also observed that TNT formation occurred primarily in high Ki-67 expression ROIs. Although there appears to be less reliance on TNTs for communication within dense stroma, there may be a functional association between in vivo TNTs and increased proliferation within the tumor. Further studies are needed to evaluate the functional capacity of TNTs within tumor tissue and the role of individual factors or groups involved in their formation and function.</p><p>Further, the current report further aligns TNTs with therapeutic targeting strategies that are already in widespread use clinically worldwide, FDA-approved for patients with MPM and glioblastoma, and under active investigation in clinical trials for multiple other forms of cancer. This work identifies TNTs as a potential therapeutic target for TTFields in MPM, and possibly other malignancies as well. An analogous cellular protrusion called âtumor microtubesâ (TMs) has been associated with invasion resistance to treatment with chemotherapy, radiation, and surgery in an animal model of glioblastoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jung et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Osswald et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Osswald et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Weil et al., 2017</xref>). With increasing evidence for the role of TMs in glioblastoma biology, potential effects of TTFields on TMs may account at least in part for the significant improvements in overall survival (4.9 months) when TTFields are added to standard-of-care treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Stupp et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Limitations of this study include uncertainty of factors that are necessary, sufficient, and crucial to formation and maintenance of TNTs both in vitro and in vivo. In this context, it is uncertain as of yet why TNTs in the biphasic (epithelioid and sarcomatoid) MSTO-211H cell line responded effectively to TTFields treatment, but TNTs in the purely sarcomatoid cell line VAMT did not. All inovitro experiments were limited by the maximum size of the 22 mm coverslip used to culture cells for TTFields treatment; and only at this diameter could the coverslip fit into the ceramic dish for TTFields delivery. Thus, a delicate balance existed between plating too high a density of cells approaching confluency versus plating too few of cells such that growth rate was suboptimal.</p><p>In this study, we report novel cellular and molecular effects of TTFields in relation to tumor communication networks enabled by TNTs and related molecular pathways. TTFields significantly suppressed formation of TNTs in biphasic malignant mesothelioma (MSTO-211H). Spatial genomic assessment of TTFields treatment of intact mesothelioma tumors from an animal model sheds new light on gene expression alterations at the transcriptomic level that imply that TTFields may provide synergy with chemotherapy and immunotherapeutic strategies. These results position TNTs as potential therapeutic targets of TTFields and also identify the use of TTFields to remodulate the tumor microenvironment and enable a greater response to immunotherapeutic drugs.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table

All intensity values were expressed in root mean square (RMS) values to illustrate the conventional depiction of alternating current measurements in physics fields. The treated group was exposed to TTFields for 72 hr in both 0.5 V/cm and 1.0 V/cm experiments. For the 1.0 V/cm experiments, the TTFields were shut off at 72 hr, and the cells were incubated for another 24 hr to assess recovery of TNTs. Cells in the control group were not treated with TTFields and were plated as described above and placed in an incubator at 37 Â°C with 5% carbon dioxide for the duration of the experiment. The low-density experiments were run as described above with the exception that only 10,000 cells were plated onto a coverslip, and TTFields application followed 3 hr later.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>TNT analysis and quantification</title><p>Quantification and visual identification of TNTs were performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lou et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rustom et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ady et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ady et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Thayanithy et al., 2014</xref>). Briefly, these parameters included (i) lack of adherence to the substratum of tissue culture plates, including visualization of TNTs passing over adherent cells; (ii) TNTs connecting two cells or if extending from one cell were counted if the width of the extension was estimated to be &lt;1000 nm; and (iii) detection of a narrow base at the site of extrusion from the plasma membrane. Cellular extensions that were not clearly identified with the above parameters were excluded. Still images and time-lapse videos were analyzed using Fiji-ImageJ software. The Fiji-ImageJ Multi-point tool was used to quantify TNTs and cell number following the criteria detailed above; and the TNT index was calculated as the number of TNTs per 100 cells. The X, Y coordinate function was used to calculate the length of TNTs, using a conversion of 0.335 Î¼m/pixel with a 20 x objective.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Time-lapse microscopic imaging with concurrent continuous administration of TTFields using inovitro Live</title><p>An inovitro Live device, provided by Novocure, Ltd (Haifa Israel), was used to apply continuous unidirectional or bidirectional TTFields exposure to cells. One day prior to treatment, 40,000 MSTO-211H cells were plated onto a 35 mm high wall, glass bottom dish (Ibidi, GrÃ¤felfing, Germany), and allowed to adhere overnight. For the unidirectional and bidirectional experiments, the glass bottom dish was coated with Poly-D-Lysine (Millipore Sigma, Burlington, MA) at a concentration of 1 mg/ÂµM for 1 hr then dried for 2 hr prior to plating. The next day, an inovitro Live insert was positioned in the 35 mm dish, and placed in the microscope chamber. The plate was connected to an inovitro Live cable, and a heating element was added on top of the dish cover to minimize condensation from heat generated by TTFields. The cable was then connected to an inovitro Live Generator, and the software controlled the delivery of an electric field in either one (unidirectional) or two (bidirectional) directions at an intensity of 1.0 V/cm and either 150 or 200 kHz. Media was changed every 24 hr, during which TTFields were paused and then resumed once the cells were placed back into the incubator. The cells for the control group were plated as described above and placed in the microscope chamber at 37 Â°C, without TTFields, for the duration of the experiment. Seven Fields of View (FOV) were selected every 24 hr, up to 72 hr and both cell proliferation and TNT formation were quantified.</p><p>As an additional experimental arm, MSTO-211H cells were also treated with cisplatin (160 nM) and pemetrexed (24 nM) in conjunction with TTFields application using pre-treated ibidi plates. During these experiments, images were acquired for 4 hr at 2 min/frame, and this process repeated every 24 hr, up to 72 hr total. Both cell proliferation and TNT formation were subsequently quantified as described above.</p><p>Still images and time-lapse videos were taken on a Zeiss AxioObserver M1 Microscope. In order to deliver TTFields at an intensity of 1.0 V/cm, the microscope chamber temperature was set to 26.5 Â°C. Images were taken on a 20 X PlanApo-Chromat objective with a numerical aperture of 0.8. We used a Zeiss Axio Cam MR camera with 6.7x6.7 Âµm width, and spatial resolution (dx = dy) at 20 X was 0.335 Âµm/pixel. Images were acquired on Zen Pro 2012 software in brightfield.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Cargo and mitochondria transfer</title><p>Cargo Transfer within TNTs was calculated using the Manual Tracking Plugin on Fiji-ImageJ. The X, Y coordinate of each cargo was recorded over time, and exported to a spreadsheet. To calculate velocity of cargo, X and Y pixel measurements were converted into microns using the scale factor 0.335 Âµm/pixel (20 x objective). Then, the distance formula was implemented for Xn and Yn values, where n is any subsequent location of the cargo in relation to the first location, X1 and Y1. This process was repeated for each cargo track to calculate distance. Finally, each distance was divided by the time interval between frames. To track mitochondria, MSTO-211H cells were stained with MitoTracker Orange CMTMRos (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and followed the same experimental setup and analysis as described above.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Actin and fascin purification</title><p>Actin was purified from chicken skeletal muscle by one cycle of polymerization and depolymerization using standard protocols in the field (Spudich et al.). It was then filtered on Sephacryl S-300 resin (GE Healthcare) in G-buffer (2 mM Tris (pH 8.0), 0.2 mM ATP, 0.5 mM DTT, 0.1 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>) to obtain actin monomers, and stored at 4 Â°C. Human fascin-1 was expressed with an N-terminal glutathione s-transferase (GST) tag and a TEV cleavage recognition sequence from the pGV67 plasmid in BL21 DE3pLysS competent cells. Transformants were grown in 1 L of LB broth, induced at OD<sub>600</sub>~0.6 with 0.5 mM IPTG, and shaken overnight (200 rpm, 17 Â°C). To purify fascin, cell pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 500 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT) and sonicated. Lysed cells were centrifuged (~30,000 x <italic>g</italic>, 4 Â°C) for 40 min to isolate the soluble cell components. Samples were rotated with glutathione agarose resin (pH 8.0) for 1 hr at 4 Â°C, washed, and eluted (50 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT, 100 mM glutathione). Eluted fractions were incubated with TEV protease (1.6 ÂµM) for GST tag cleavage and dialyzed into glutathione-free buffer overnight. To remove GST contaminants and TEV protease, samples were filtered through glutathione resin followed by amylose resin. Collected flow throughs were concentrated using centrifugal filters (MilliporeSigma Amicon, MWCO 30 K). Samples were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at â80 Â°C.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Actin polymerization and bundling sedimentation assays</title><p>Actin was polymerized at 37 Â°C in KMEI buffer (50 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM EGTA, 10 mM Imidazole pH 7.0) for 1 hr with and without 1.0 V/cm inovitro device TTFields treatment. Samples were centrifuged at 100,000 x <italic>g</italic> for 30 min at 4 Â°C to separate filaments and monomers. Supernatant and pellet fractions were analyzed via SDS-PAGE (12% acrylamide). Gels were then stained with Coomassie Blue for 1 hr and destained for at least 6 hours (10% ethanol, 7.5% acetic acid). Band intensities were quantified via densitometry using Fiji-ImageJ. For bundling, actin (15 ÂµM) was first polymerized for 1 hr at 37 Â°C in KMEI buffer. The assembled filaments were diluted to 3 ÂµM and added to a solution with fascin (300 nM). After 1 hr with and without 1.0 V/cm TTFields treatment, samples were centrifuged at 10,000 x <italic>g</italic> for 30 min at 4 Â°C to pellet bundled actin. SDS-PAGE and band quantification were carried out as described previously.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Spatial genomics</title><p>Blocks of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) mesothelioma tumors that were treated with sham heat or TTFields were generously provided by Novocure, Ltd for Nanostring GeoMx spatial transcriptomic analysis. In brief, eight female mice (<italic>Mus musculus</italic> species, strain C57BL, aged 13 weeks) were subcutaneously injected with AB1 mouse mesothelioma cells. After tumors formed, mice were treated with heat or TTFields using the inovivo device (Novocure, Ltd) for a total of 14 days: 7 days of treatment, 2 days of rest, and 7 days of additional treatment. The tumors were excised, formalin fixed and paraffin embedded, and sent to our lab. With these tumor blocks, one 5 Âµm section from each tumor was placed on a glass slide for Nanostring GeoMx analysis (Seattle, WA). The slide was incubated with Ki-67 antibodies and the GeoMx Mouse Cancer Transcriptome Atlas panel of 1,812 RNA probes. Regions of interest (ROIs) were chosen, and the unique DNA indexing-oligonucleotide tags were cleaved from the RNA probes within the ROIs. These tags were then sequenced and analyzed with GeoMx DSP software.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Microscopy imaging of intact tumors from our animal model of MPM</title><p>Eight BALB/c mice were injected with murine AB mesothelioma cells, and then treated with either TTFields or heat sham (negative control).Tumors were excised and sectioned into 15 Âµm sections. These sections were mounted on coverslips, deparaffinized, and stained with a nuclear dye (Sytox Green 488, ThermofisherScientific, USA, S7020) and a phalloidin stain (Alexa Fluor 647, Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA, A22287) following permeabilization with 0.1% Triton-X. They were then mounted with Prolong Gold Antifade reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA, P36930) and covered with 1.5 thickness coverslips.</p><p>Fluorescence images were acquired by using an inverted Nikon Ti-E microscope (NIKON A1R SI, Tokyo, Japan) and an MCL NanoDrive Piezo Z Drive stage (Mad City Labs Inc Wisconsin, United States) through a 60 x oil immersion objective lens (NA = 1.4, Plan Apo lambda correction collar, Tokyo, Japan). Samples were excited with 488 nm laser power set to 3.5% and a 638 nm laser with power set to 14.2%. Lasers were scanned with Galvano mirrors at a scanning speed of 0.25 with a zoom setting of 2.392 and a line average of 8. Pinhole diameter was set to 38.31 Âµm and emitted light was passed through a 408/488/561/640 dichroic mirror. Emitted light was then detected by DU4 GaAsP detectors with gain settings of 54 for the blue light detector and 96 for the far-red light detector. Filter cubes from the Chroma series were used for both dyes (99022 and 99023) for Sytox 488 and Alexa Fluor 647, respectively. Images were captured on a Hamamatsu FLASH 4 camera (Hamamatsu Photonics, Hamamatsu City, Japan) with voxel dimensions of 0.108 Âµm in XY and 0.222 Âµm in Z with PMT confocal detectors and using NIKON A1 Elements software (NIKON, Melville, New York, United States) for acquisition. To calculate step size of z stacks and optimal imaging resolution, Nyquist sampling was performed. Images were processed with iterative prediction advanced denoising followed by 3D automatic deconvolution with a theoretical point spread function (based on emission wavelengths of fluorophores used), automatic background subtraction, and spherical aberration correction. Z stacks were then rendered and animated using Imaris (Oxford Instruments, Beijing, China, version 5.42.03).</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><sec id="s4-10-1"><title>inovitro Experiments</title><p>Due to lower sample sizes and skewed distributions of TNTs/cell, heteroscedastic t-tests were performed to assess significance in differences between TNTs/cell.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Wafik El-Deiry as the Senior Editor.

The mechanism of action is thought to be in part due to the impairment of spindle formation during cell division. Here the authors investigate the effects of TTF treatment on tunneling nanotube formation and immuno-oncologic biomarkers and find that TTF treatment may also modulate these processes, supporting additional and novel mechanisms of action underlying the efficacy of TTF therapy.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Data should be provided at additional TTF frequencies.</p><p>2) Data must be supported by an additional means, preferably imaging of TNTs.</p><p>3) Some supporting mechanisms should be provided.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. There are no clear pictures illustrating the effects of TFF on TNTs in cellular or in vivo models.</p><p>2. There are no statistical significances shown in the graphical figures. This should be done using asterisks to indicate the degree of significance.</p><p>3. The biological mechanism is not clear. TTFs have no effect on actin, as shown in figure 2, but there is no tubulin control, which would help to show that the experimental parameters are suitable.</p><p>4. The RNAseq/Spatial profiling shows differentially expressed genes, but their relationship functionally to TNTs should be clearer. Can the authors stain and show the existence of TNTs in their in vivo model?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>General Comments: The authors performed a unique investigation on the effect of TTFields on TNT formation. But there are still questions concerning the findings that they have to address below.</p><p>1. The authors only performed their experiments at 150 and 200 kHz. But TTFields are known to have biological effects between 100 and 500 kHz. Although the authors wanted to recapitulate the clinical scenarios at the approved frequencies of 150 and 200 kHz, this is a weak argument and this reviewer strongly thinks that further experimentations need to be done at 100 kHz, 300 kHz, and 400 kHz. The reason is that there are other protein dipoles that have natural frequencies outside of the 150 and 200 kHz range, and they may have unique biological effects on TNTs or other cellular phenomena.</p><p>2. Is there a difference between unidirectional and bidirectional TTFields at 150 kHz?</p><p>3. The authors tried to recapitulate the clinical scenario in mesothelioma but combining TTFields with cisplatin or cisplatin and pemetrexed. They found that cisplatin and TTFields have a synergistic effect. Interestingly, cisplatin and pemetrexed reduced TNT formation and the addition of TTFields did not reduce TNT further (Figure 3A). So, the biological mechanism is unclear. The authors should test the tubulin interference hypothesis by adding a tubulin inhibitor such as vincristine or paclitaxel.</p><p>4. It is unclear how TNT formation is related to findings from the spatial transcriptomic analysis. There is a suggestion of association but no data to indicate that the two are related.</p><p>5. In spatial transcriptomic analysis, it is unclear how are the regions selected in an unsupervised fashion for analysis. Maybe the authors should show the transcriptomic profiles between the confluent (less TNTs) and non-confluent (more TNTs) regions of the tumor.</p><p>Specific Comments:</p><p>Line 137: Change the wording &quot;â¦ most effective â¦&quot; to &quot;â¦ more effect â¦&quot; because the authors have not tested frequencies outside of 150-200 kHz.</p><p>Line 464-465: The sentence, &quot;Transition of mesothelioma cells to EMT is strongly associated with a sharp rise in TNT formation&quot;, needs a reference.</p><p>Line 465-466: The sentence, &quot;We also reported on the intracellular transport of VEGF, a finding that implicates TNTs in other cancer-provoking processes including angiogenesis&quot;, does not appear in Results and therefore needs a reference.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1) Excessive verbiage takes away from the central message. The manuscript should be substantially shortened, including but not limited to the abstract and discussion.</p><p>2) It is unclear why the authors restricted field delivery to the intensity of 1V/cm. Although 1V/cm is present in the entire treatment area, field intensity can reach 2-3V/cm in the tumor targets. This reviewer wonders if some of the negative data may have been due to the field intensity used being too low (see Point 3).</p><p>3) The authors provided molecular experiments on the effects of TTFields on F-actin polymerization and bundling, which showed no effects. The authors should repeat the experiment by increasing the intensity. Alternatively, TTFields may disrupt TNT through an F-actin-independent mechanism, such as the microtubules, a known target of TTFields. Although small TNTs are mostly F-actin-based structures, larger TNTs contain both F-actin and microtubules. Have the authors considered the size of the TNTs in these cell lines and/or whether microtubules are present in them?</p><p>4) The chemo + TTFields experiments are inconclusive and do not add to the conclusions. Why the number of TNTs are substantially lower at baseline in cultures treated with chemotherapy or chemotherapy + TTFields combinations? Also, the synergy between TTFields and chemotherapy in suppressing proliferation if present at all (not strong correlation) appears not due to the reduction in TNTs, which is a central argument of the study. Also, why the P+C+TTFields culture was discontinued early at 48hrs?</p><p>5) Although the gene expression analysis to identify the effects of TTFields on global gene expression was a reasonable approach, the rationale for geographic analysis was unclear. Do the authors expect that the effects of TTFields on different regions of the tumor vary? If that is the case, the data should be clearly presented to address that hypothesis rather than just a summation of the expression of target genes in the Nano string platform, e.g., were there differences in the expression of genes involved in TNT formation and proliferation in regions that have low or high Ki67 expression?</p><p>[Editorsâ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Treatment with Tumor-Treating Fields (TTFields) Suppresses Intercellular Tunneling Nanotube Formation in vitro and Upregulates Immuno-Oncologic Biomarkers in vivo in Malignant Mesothelioma&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Wafik El-Deiry (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors have responded to reviewers comments and the manuscript is improved.</p><p>The manuscript would be further improved if more statistical analysis can be added to the figures themselves. for example figure 1h would be improved using asterisks and figure 4 has not error bars or asterisks to indicate significance.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This is a revised manuscript from Sarkari et al. describing the effects of TTFields on nanotubes. This reviewer appreciates the effort the authors have put in to address previous critiques. However, most of the previous points are not adequately addressed as detailed below:</p><p>1) The manuscript remains excessively long, including the abstract.</p><p>2) The rebuttal for why the authors didn't think looking into the effects of TTFields on MTs in TNTs would be informative is not convincing. The authors are advancing a new observation that TTFields disrupt TNTs, which are mostly F-actin based. However, in vitro TTFields have minimal effects on cell-free F-actin polymerization. So what is the mechanism of TTFields effects on TNTs in cells? Measuring effects of TTFields on MTs, which are found to be important in certain TNT structures would be a reasonable step (as suggested by all 3 reviewers). Alternatively, the authors should provide some other plausible mechanistic insights into how TTFields disrupt TNTs in cells, rather than essentially stating that determining the mechanism is not the focus. Since this is central to their argument, some mechanistic evidence needs to be provided and should be the focus of the work.</p><p>3) The potential synergy between TTFields and chemotherapy has not been shown. The previous critique has not been addressed. Softening the language does not equal to a substantive address of the weakness of evidence. In addition, the response to the question why the P+C+TTFields culture was discontinued early at 48hrs as stated &quot;We were unable to quantify TNTs and cells from the 72-hour time point for P+C+TTFields due to distortion of the captured image&quot; is not acceptable. This experiment should be repeated and new non-distorted images past 72hrs should be obtained for the analysis.</p><p>4) This reviewer still questions the rationale for the geographic transcriptomics approach in studying the effects of TTFields on TNTs. The explanation and the new Figure 5 provided did not address this question. Figure 5 shows differences in gene expression associated with TTFields treatment in ROI with high ki67 and low Ki67. However, it is unclear if TTFields-treated tumors have more or less Ki67-high or Ki67-low regions compared to the sham heat treated control. Also, was there a difference in TNT formation in ki67-high vs ki67-low regions? Without clear evidence to suggest that these different regions have different ki67 which translate into differences in TNT formation with or without TTFields treatment, this experiment as presented does not add to the central hypothesis of a TTFields-TNT connection.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.85383.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1.

In this study, we demonstrate that TTFields at a frequency and voltage used commonly in the clinical setting can suppress formation of TNTs, but not affect cell-free actin polymerization. We described the fact that, to date, effects of TTFields on tubulin-based intracellular microtubules (MTs) has been provided as the principal mechanism for response. We and others have proposed that this is not an exclusive cellular effect, and our focus for this study is TNTs in general as an effective therapeutic target for this approach. TTFields administered according to the outlined parameters suppressed TNT formation in biphasic mesothelioma cells. In this case, examination of tubulin and by extension microtubules would not be wholly informative because MTs are not universally expressed/present in TNTs and furthermore are highly dynamic components. A study published from our group in 2022 confirmed this fact, using the same mesothelioma cells (MSTO-211H) as in the current study</p><p>[PMID: 35454893; A Jana, K Ladner, E Lou, A Nain, <italic>Cancers</italic> April 2022]. In that study, we reported that close inspection of TNT-forming cancer cells revealed that cytoskeleton localization was dependent on the TNT width (Figure 3G), with both microtubules and intermediate filaments present significantly more often in thick TNTs (Figure 3G). This finding as also been reported by other groups [PMID: 25571977; PMID: 17142745; PMID: 24778759; PMID: 26094971; PMID: 30459350]. We used biophysical assessment (base eccentricity) to distinguish between âthickâ and âthinâ TNTs, with findings that agreed with the previously reported threshold for sizes of TNTs [PMID: 17142745]. Our characterization of colocalization of different cytoskeletal elements revealed a striking difference in the nanotube structure based on geometric width: thinner nanotubes contained only actin, while thicker nanotubes demonstrated localization of both microtubules and vimentin intermediate filaments. When grown in standard culture plate conditions, MSTO-211H cells formed thin TNTs that did not harbor MTs. Because we used this set of conditions in the current study, we would again expect a lack of tubulin expression. Thus, our evaluation of effect of TTFields was centered on actin-based mechanisms.

We have modified the Discussion accordingly to address these points in the revised manuscript.</p><p>[Editorsâ note: what follows is the authorsâ response to the second round of review.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The authors have responded to reviewers comments and the manuscript is improved.</p><p>The manuscript would be further improved if more statistical analysis can be added to the figures themselves. for example figure 1h would be improved using asterisks and figure 4 has not error bars or asterisks to indicate significance.</p><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>This is a revised manuscript from Sarkari et al. describing the effects of TTFields on nanotubes. This reviewer appreciates the effort the authors have put in to address previous critiques. However, most of the previous points are not adequately addressed as detailed below:</p><p>1) The manuscript remains excessively long, including the abstract.</p><p>2) The rebuttal for why the authors didn't think looking into the effects of TTFields on MTs in TNTs would be informative is not convincing. The authors are advancing a new observation that TTFields disrupt TNTs, which are mostly F-actin based. However, in vitro TTFields have minimal effects on cell-free F-actin polymerization. So what is the mechanism of TTFields effects on TNTs in cells? Measuring effects of TTFields on MTs, which are found to be important in certain TNT structures would be a reasonable step (as suggested by all 3 reviewers). Alternatively, the authors should provide some other plausible mechanistic insights into how TTFields disrupt TNTs in cells, rather than essentially stating that determining the mechanism is not the focus. Since this is central to their argument, some mechanistic evidence needs to be provided and should be the focus of the work.</p><p>3) The potential synergy between TTFields and chemotherapy has not been shown. The previous critique has not been addressed. Softening the language does not equal to a substantive address of the weakness of evidence. In addition, the response to the question why the P+C+TTFields culture was discontinued early at 48hrs as stated &quot;We were unable to quantify TNTs and cells from the 72-hour time point for P+C+TTFields due to distortion of the captured image&quot; is not acceptable. This experiment should be repeated and new non-distorted images past 72hrs should be obtained for the analysis.</p><p>4) This reviewer still questions the rationale for the geographic transcriptomics approach in studying the effects of TTFields on TNTs. The explanation and the new Figure 5 provided did not address this question. Figure 5 shows differences in gene expression associated with TTFields treatment in ROI with high ki67 and low Ki67. However, it is unclear if TTFields-treated tumors have more or less Ki67-high or Ki67-low regions compared to the sham heat treated control. Also, was there a difference in TNT formation in ki67-high vs ki67-low regions? Without clear evidence to suggest that these different regions have different ki67 which translate into differences in TNT formation with or without TTFields treatment, this experiment as presented does not add to the central hypothesis of a TTFields-TNT connection.</p></disp-quote><p>In the revised version, we have provided additional clarifications to the figures specified by reviewers, and also edited the text including the abstract as requested.</p></body></sub-article></article>
