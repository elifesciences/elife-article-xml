role in niche determination. Although it is well recognized that development and body size can have strong and predictable effects on many aspects of organismal function, we lack a predictive understanding of ontogenetic or scaling effects on macronutrient intake. We determined protein and carbohydrate intake throughout development on lab populations of locusts and compared to late instars of field populations. Self-selected protein:carbohydrate targets declined dramatically through ontogeny, due primarily to declines in mass-specific protein consumption rates which were highly correlated with declines in specific growth rates. Lab results for protein consumption rates partly matched results from field-collected locusts. However, field locusts consumed nearly double the carbohydrate, likely due to higher activity and metabolic rates. Combining our results with the available data for animals, both across species and during ontogeny, protein consumption scaled predictably and hypometrically, demonstrating a new scaling rule key for understanding nutritional ecology.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>ontogeny</kwd><kwd>macronutrients</kwd><kwd>nutritional ecology</kwd><kwd>intake target</kwd><kwd>growth rates</kwd><kwd>protein requirments</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NSF IOS-1826848</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cease</surname><given-names>Arianne J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006031</institution-id><institution>US-Israel Binational Agricultural Research and Development Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BARD FI-575-2018</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Talal</surname><given-names>Stav</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Protein nutritional requirements decrease predictively with mass throughout ontogeny across the animal kingdom.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Every animal must acquire a proper balance of macronutrients to maximize their performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Simpson and Raubenheimer, 2012</xref>). For all animals, protein is the main building block for growing tissues, and lipids and carbohydrates (non-protein) are the primary energy fuels. Comparative studies show that different animal species have a wide range of unique protein:carbohydrate (and/or lipid) targets that optimize growth, survival, and reproduction, and these are often thought of as species-specific (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Behmer and Joern, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Behmer, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hewson-Hughes et al., 2013</xref>). While a few studies indicate developmental effects on macronutrient intake, we lack a clear understanding about how and why ontogeny or body size affect macronutrient consumption and intake targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ojeda-Avila et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Peters, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wang et al., 2019</xref>). To address this lack, we determined the effect body mass throughout ontogeny on macronutrient (protein and carbohydrate) intake and growth rate for the polyphagous and transboundary migratory pest, <italic>Schistocerca cancellata</italic> (Serville, 1838), the South American locust, and integrated our results with prior studies of this topic in animals.</p><p>Foraging decisions are often driven by the need to balance protein (p) with non-protein (np) energy because these macronutrients make up the vast majority of a consumer’s diet and food sources rarely match the balance needed. The relative macronutrient requirements of individuals across development and the factors that influence these intake targets have profound implications for population dynamics and ecosystems, particularly for herbivores. For example, in many cases, growth and population levels of freshwater invertebrate herbivores are limited by protein (or more specifically, essential amino acid) availability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fink et al., 2011</xref>). In contrast, late instars of grasshoppers and some lepidopteran caterpillars have low protein to carbohydrate targets due to their high energy requirements for adult flight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lee et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Talal et al., 2020</xref>). In these cases, low nitrogen environments which harbor low-protein, high-carbohydrate plants promote outbreaks and devastating locust migratory swarms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cease et al., 2012</xref>). Animals restricted to feeding on foods that diverge from their required p:np balance can experience pronounced performance deficits in development time, mass, reproduction, and survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Behmer and Joern, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Behmer, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Raubenheimer et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Simpson and Raubenheimer, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Talal et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>The Geometric Framework for Nutrition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Simpson and Raubenheimer, 2012</xref>) was developed to study how organisms balance multiple nutrients, and identifying intake targets is a key principle. Most organisms will self-select a balance of nutrients, and this can be tested by giving individuals a choice between two or more foods differing in the ratio of two or more nutrients. Individuals differentially eat the diets to achieve an intake target. Macronutrient targets can vary across species. For example, cats selectively consume and perform better on more protein-biased diets (52p:48np) than dogs, for which a 30p:70np diet is optimal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hewson-Hughes et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hewson-Hughes et al., 2011</xref>). Such variation in nutritional targets can occur even among closely related species, and we are beginning to understand some of these patterns. For example, late-instar juveniles of seven species of congeneric grasshoppers that share the same habitat exhibit widely different species-specific p:np targets that maximize their growth performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Behmer and Joern, 2008</xref>). Domestic dogs are omnivorous while wolves are carnivorous, likely due to the availability of diverse foods domesticated dogs can obtain from humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bosch et al., 2015</xref>). Within arthropods, predators prefer food with relatively more protein than their herbivorous prey, whose food is often lower in protein concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wilder et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Some evidence suggests that intake of protein relative to carbohydrate (and or lipids) may generally decrease through ontogeny. Stable isotope analysis of tooth and skin suggested that mass-specific protein consumption declines during ontogeny in bottlenose dolphins (<italic>Tursiops truncates,</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Knoff et al., 2008</xref>). Similarly, in turtles (<italic>Trachemys scripta</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bouchard and Bjorndal, 2006</xref>), lizards (<italic>Stellagama stellio</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Karameta et al., 2017</xref>), and sturgeons (<italic>Acipenser persicu</italic>s, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Babaei et al., 2011</xref>), food preference, digestive efficiency, and digestive enzymatic activities indicate decreasing mass-specific protein assimilation and need as ontogeny progresses. Decreases in the ratio of p:np in milk through ontogeny also suggest that offspring nutritional requirements shift with age. In northern elephant seals (<italic>Mirounga angustirostris</italic>), the lipid concentration of milk increases by approximately fivefold during 30 days of lactation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Riedman and Ortiz, 1979</xref>), while in humans, the protein concentration of milk decreases as lactation progresses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ballard and Morrow, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bauer and Gerss, 2011</xref>). Tammar wallabies provide milk with a lower p:np ratio to older offspring, even when nursing two offspring simultaneously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nicholas et al., 1997</xref>). A few studies have tested for an effect of ontogeny or body mass on preferred p:np consumption and utilization in invertebrates, but generally only over a short span of the life cycle. A study of brown-banded cockroaches showed that the self-selected ratio of casein:glucose decreased from third to final instar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cohen et al., 1987</xref>). Lepidopteran caterpillars decrease p:np consumption over three instars (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Stockhoff, 1993</xref>). We lack studies of how macronutrient targets are affected across whole-ontogeny or across broad body size ranges of species, and these are necessary to provide an understanding of whether a decline in mass-specific protein intake is a general pattern among animals.</p><p>Macronutrient consumption can also vary in response to environment and activity levels. For example, viral-infected caterpillars shifted toward a new self-selected macronutrient ratio that maximized survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cotter et al., 2011</xref>). During winter months (cold weather), golden snub-nosed monkeys increased their daily non-protein energy intake, probably due to the increased cost of thermoregulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Guo et al., 2018</xref>). Many migratory birds adjust their nutrition to facilitate adequate fat accumulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bairlein, 2002</xref>). In early development, human energy requirements are highly correlated with basal metabolic rate and growth processes (0–6 months) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Butte et al., 2002</xref>). However, later when a child increases their physical activity, energy requirements correlate highly with activity level (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Savarino et al., 2021</xref>). For example, a single high-intensity exercise increases lipid consumption in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Klausen et al., 1999</xref>).</p><p>Based on this literature, we hypothesized that animals would steadily reduce protein consumption during ontogeny because mass-specific growth rate declines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brown et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">West et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">White et al., 2022</xref>), causing a progressive decrease in the consumption of protein relative to carbohydrate. We tested this hypothesis using South American locusts, <italic>S. cancellata</italic>. We predicted that mass-specific protein consumption would decrease strongly during development, in tight correlation with a decrease in mass-specific growth rate and a decrease in the protein:carbohydrate intake ratio, and that these relationships would hold across all animals because growth rate scales hypometrically across animals of different body sizes as well as during ontogeny (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hatton et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Peters, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">West et al., 2001</xref>). To partially test whether our lab results could predict the macronutrient requirements in more ecological-relevant conditions, we also compared intake targets between lab-reared animals with field-collected locusts at one developmental stage.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Protein-to-carbohydrate intake ratio decreased throughout development</title><p>We measured self-selected protein and carbohydrate consumption rates for each developmental stage (instars, adults) of <italic>S. cancellata</italic> using chemical-defined artificial diets (see ‘Materials and methods’ for more information). We found that younger instars (first to fourth) had a protein-biased consumption (selected high protein-to-carbohydrate ratios, p:c) with third-instar nymphs exhibiting the highest p:c of 1.37p:1c (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and D</xref>). In contrast, older locusts became carbohydrate-biased, with adults selecting intake targets of 1p:2.66c (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and D</xref>). Males and females (both unmated) did not differ from each other in relative macronutrient consumption during most of the developmental stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). There were no significant interactions between sex and diet pair on total macronutrient consumption (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). The insignificant effect of diet pair indicates that locusts are tightly regulated to a specific intake target. The mortality was relatively low and was not affected by sex or diet pairs.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Protein and carbohydrate consumptions across different divelopment stages in lab and flield population of <italic>Schistocerca cancellata</italic>.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Self-selected protein to carbohydrate (p:c) consumption rates decreased systematically during ontogeny.

The decrease in mass-specific protein consumption rate was tightly correlated with a decline in specific growth rate, likely explaining the shift in protein requirements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

However, the fact that many other studies have found that measured intake targets optimize fitness suggests that this pattern is a beneficial one (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Raubenheimer and Simpson, 2018</xref>).</p><p>Here it is demonstrated for the first time that protein consumption rates decrease during ontogeny in a predictive way with animal mass. In our experiments with <italic>S. cancellata</italic>, we cannot determine the extent to which the observed pattern is due to developmental or body mass changes, though the observation that the pattern is similar to that seen across species differing in mass suggests that variation in body size is responsible. Thus, protein consumption can be added to the list of traits that scale predictably with body size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Schmidt-Nielsen, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sibly et al., 2012</xref>). The hypometric scaling of protein consumption across species is consistent with the general hypometric scaling of growth rates across animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hatton et al., 2019</xref>). Though ontogenetic slopes of protein consumption on mass were much lower than the cross-species pattern in a few groups, including cats and pigs, it will be interesting to determine whether such variation relates to interspecific variation in the scaling of ontogenetic growth and lifespan.</p><p>Assuming that energy needs and consumption are primarily set by metabolic rate, we would expect that mass-specific non-protein consumption to decrease with both animal mass and age due to the generally observed hypometric scaling of metabolic rates across animal taxa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Harrison et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">White et al., 2022</xref>). In locusts, we demonstrated that carbohydrate consumption scaled hypometrically, but with a slope very close to 1, a much higher mass-scaling exponent than observed for protein consumption (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), but in the range of reported scaling for resting metabolic rate (0.77–1) for orthopterans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fielding and DeFoliart, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Greenlee and Harrison, 2004</xref>). Likely, in locusts, carbohydrate consumption of older individuals is increased due to the increase in mass-specific lipid stores that occurs in older juveniles and adults, as stored lipids are mainly synthesized from ingested carbohydrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Talal et al., 2021</xref>). In addition, we demonstrated a positive correlation between mass-specific carbohydrate consumption rate and specific growth rate, with the highest of both parameters in early development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). This could be explained by the energy cost of new tissue growth and new protein synthesis, which are the highest in early development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Li et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pace and Manahan, 2007</xref>), and match the protein requirements during this period of time.</p><p>An important goal for the field of nutritional ecology is to predict nutritional needs, foraging behavior and strategies, and consequences of nutritional imbalance for animals in the field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Behmer and Joern, 2008</xref>). Relative to the lab population, we measured a 50–90% increase in carbohydrate consumption rates for field-collected fifth- and sixth-instar nymphs. In contrast, protein consumption rates did not vary between lab and field in our study. This may not be true under every ecological condition; for example, poor resource conditions that reduce growth will likely also reduce protein consumption. Nonetheless, these data support the hypothesis that protein consumption rates of animals in good field conditions may be predicted from results with lab-reared animals. There are multiple reasons why carbohydrate consumption in the field may be poorly predicted by laboratory consumption data. Consumption patterns can reflect their past feeding history (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Marmonier et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wiggins et al., 2018</xref>), which was not known in the case of our field-captured animals. In the lab, consumption rates were measured from the first day of the instar, but likely over a later part of the instar in the field-collected animals, potentially affecting the results. Captive animals usually do not need to travel long distances to forage, which can be energetically expensive and cause long-term effects on resting metabolic rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bergman et al., 2001</xref>). Studies of monkeys and apes have demonstrated that decreases in foraging activity in captivity may promote metabolic suppression, diabetes, and obesity (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bellisari, 2008</xref>). Increased energy demands and energy metabolism in field animals may also be due to a past history of consumption of tougher, better chemically defended plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Clissold et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Maskato et al., 2014</xref>). Field animals may be more likely to be coping with pathogens, and immune responses can elevate metabolic rates in insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Catalán et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Freitak et al., 2003</xref>). In addition, adaptation to lab conditions over multiple generations in captivity may reduce metabolic rates and carbohydrate consumption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Garland et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Latorre et al., 2020</xref>). Also, it is important to note that because we only tested one instar in the field, we have not demonstrated that hypometric scaling of protein consumption occurs under field conditions, though this seems likely. Future studies will be necessary to confirm this, and to decipher the mechanisms that elevate metabolic rates and carbohydrate consumption for locusts and other animals in the field.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Conclusions and future directions</title><p>Hypometric scaling of protein consumption is associated with declining specific growth rate during ontogeny and body mass across species in animals, providing a new and useful paradigm for nutritional ecology. Many important questions remain. Is species-level variation in the ontogenetic scaling of protein consumption rate predictable by species differences in growth rates? How useful would age-specific diets be for humans and animal husbandry? Is the hypometric scaling of protein intake related to parallel patterns in the morphology and physiology of digestive and assimilative processes? Does spatial or temporal variation in protein availability play an important role in the biogeography of animal body sizes? Plausibly, higher protein availability favors the ecological success of smaller, faster-growing animals. Finally, rising temperatures and CO<sub>2</sub> levels are predicted to lower the relative availability of protein to carbohydrate in leaves; while it has been shown that this can slow herbivore growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">DeLucia et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kuczyk et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Scherber et al., 2013</xref>), our findings suggest such changes may also select for herbivores with larger body sizes, higher activity, and lower mass-specific protein requirements.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Locust lab culture</title><p>We used South American locusts (<italic>S. cancellata</italic>) from a captive colony at Arizona State University (ASU), 7–10 generations after locusts were collected from La Rioja and Catamarca regions of Argentina.

Supplementary radiant heat was supplied during the daytime by incandescent 60 W electric bulbs next to the cages.

Animals were kept in individual cages with an air temperature of 34°C:25°C (day:night), without access to a radiant heat source. The adult (30 for each sex) intake targets measurements were started on molt day and recorded for 3 weeks. To have sufficient individuals of the same age, in each developmental stage, we monitored for newly molted individuals and randomly collected them on the same day. For the first-instar nymphs, we monitored egg cups daily. When hatching was observed, within a few hours, we inserted the cups into standard colony-rearing cages (45 × 45 × 45 cm metal mesh) to keep the ages of the nymphs as similar as possible. Sexing was performed by identifying the presence/absence of developing ovipositor valves. For early developmental stages (first to third instars), we used a dissecting microscope to visualize these structures (SMZ-168, MOTIC, Schertz, TX).</p><p>During these measurements, individuals were kept in plastic containers with holes drilled in the roof for ventilation which maintained the RH at ~30%. The first- to third-instar nymphs were kept in 11 × 16 × 4 cm cages, and fourth-instar nymphs to adults were kept in 19 × 10.4 × 14 cm containers. Each container had a water tube (refilled once a week), a perch (for successful molting) and two complementary artificial diets. To determine if locusts were arriving at a consistent p:c intake target ratio and not just eating randomly from the two dishes, we provided half the locusts with the choice between 35p:7c and 7p:35c diets, while the other half were provided with the choice between 28p:14c and 7p:35c diets. We randomly placed cages from different diets pair treatments and sex on different shelves. To calculate consumption, we weighed each diet dish two times: (1) after drying and prior to inserting it into the assay boxes and (2) after it was removed from the experimental boxes and re-dried at 60°C for 24 hr. To reduce error during the first-instar nymph experiment, we used small diet dishes (made from 1.5 ml Eppendorf lids) and weighed them with a microbalance (MSA6.6S-000-DM, accuracy of 10<sup>–6</sup> g, Sartorius Weighing Technology GmbH, Goettingen, Germany). For all other instars, we used diet dishes made from an acrylic cylinder (10 × 25 mm) glued to a Petri dish (58 mm in diameter) and weighed them using an analytical balance (accuracy of 10<sup>–5</sup> g, XSE205, Mettler Toledo, Columbus, OH). Locusts were also weighed using the analytical balance. To reduce handling, which increases mortality, we weighed the locusts only after the experiment and used final masses to correct consumption values. To calculate specific growth rate (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ1">Equation 1</xref>) for each instar, we calculated mean initial masses for an extra 20 freshly molted (or newly hatched for first instar) individuals for each instar and sex.<disp-formula id="equ1"><label>(1)</label><mml:math id="m1"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>f</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mspace width="thinmathspace"/><mml:mi>g</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>w</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>h</mml:mi><mml:mspace width="thinmathspace"/><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi>ln</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁡</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi>f</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mspace width="thinmathspace"/><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mspace width="thinmathspace"/><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mspace width="thinmathspace"/><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>v</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mspace width="thinmathspace"/><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mspace width="thinmathspace"/><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>y</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>For comparisons of consumption rate to specific growth rate, we divided consumption rates in grams per day by initial mass at the relevant instar because final (but not initial) mass was a strong determinant of specific growth rate.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Comparing intake targets and metabolic rates between lab-reared and field-captured locusts</title><p>We compared protein and carbohydrate consumption rates of fifth- and sixth-instar lab-reared nymphs (from the intake target experiment) to the field data we randomly collected from similarly aged nymphs in 2019 during the <italic>S. cancellata</italic> outbreak in Gran-Chaco, Paraguay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Talal et al., 2020</xref>). During the days of the experiments, field-collected nymphs were kept at temperatures averaging 32.2 ± 1.94°C (measured with a Hobo logger, Onset, Bourne, MA), without access to a radiant heat source. We assessed macronutrient consumption rates by providing locusts with a choice between a low and a high carbohydrate diet (the same diets as in intake target experiment, see above) for 8 days.</p><p>Comparison of resting metabolic rates was carried out on sixth-instar nymphs that were reared on confined artificial diets varying in protein:carbohydrate ratio (both in the field and in the lab) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Talal et al., 2021</xref>). Since we did not find an effect of dietary protein to carbohydrate ratio on oxygen consumption in either the lab or in the field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Talal et al., 2021</xref>), we pooled the data from the different diet treatment groups to compare resting metabolic rates between lab and field populations by measuring oxygen consumption. We carried out stop-flow respirometry using a FoxBox oxygen analyzer (Sable Systems International, Las Vegas, USA) as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Talal et al., 2021</xref>. Briefly, after inserting the nymph in a metabolic chamber and flushing it with CO<sub>2</sub>-free, dry, air, the chamber was sealed for a period of time, after which a known volume was injected into CO<sub>2</sub>-free, dry air flow (500 ml∙min<sup>–1</sup>) which was flushed through the oxygen analyzer. The metabolic rate (oxygen consumption) was temperature-corrected to 34°C using Q<sub>10</sub> of 2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Talal et al., 2021</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Scaling of protein consumption across animals</title><p>To determine whether the pattern of protein consumption scaled similarly across animals as in locusts, we survey the literature for measures of protein consumption relative to body mass in animals during ontogeny.

We included any study that measured body masses and protein consumption rates over ontogeny, as well as studies with these data for adults. Because temperature has strong effects on metabolic rates and consumption rates, we corrected the data for ectotherms to 37°C using a Q<sub>10</sub> of 2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Clarke and Johnston, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Harrison and Fewell, 1995</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Statistics</title><p>Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 20.0 (IBM) and R Studio (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">R Development Core Team, 2021</xref>). Prior to using parametric analyses, the normality of data was confirmed. For the intake target experiments: to rule out random feeding on different diet pairs, we employed multiple analysis of covariance (MANCOVA), using mass of carbohydrate and protein eaten as dependent variables, diet pair and sex as independent variables, and final body mass as a covariate. Due to some assumption violations, we compared protein and carbohydrate consumption rates as well as p:c ratios, among developmental stages and sexes, using aligned rank-transformed observations on mass-specific values. To test for a significant effect of both developmental stage and sex, we performed ANOVAs on aligned rank-transformed observations according to the general procedure outlined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Feys, 2016</xref> using the software R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">R Development Core Team, 2021</xref>) and the R library ARTool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Matthew and Wobbrock, 2020</xref>).</p><p>To compare self-selected protein and carbohydrate consumption rates of lab-reared to field-collected fifth- and sixth-instar nymphs, we used a Mann–Whitney <italic>U</italic> test (non-normal distribution).

First, a time-calibrated phylogenetic tree with 15,029 leaf nodes was obtained from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://timetree.org/">TimeTree.org</ext-link> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kumar et al., 2022</xref>) with the following query: Schistocerca, Teleostei, <italic>Rattus rattus</italic>, <italic>Gallus gallus</italic>, <italic>Felis catus</italic>, <italic>Sus domesticus</italic>, <italic>Rangifer tarandus,</italic> and <italic>Bos taurus</italic>. ‘Teleostei’ was the most sensible representative taxon for the various fish species from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dabrowski, 1986</xref>, which spanned from salmonids to cyprinids. Using the ape package in R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">R Development Core Team, 2024</xref>), this tree was pruned down to the focal taxon names with the exception that ‘<italic>Oncorhynchus mykiss</italic>’, one of the species analyzed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dabrowski, 1986</xref>, was substituted for ‘Teleostei’ since there was no leaf node corresponding to the latter in the original tree. This substitution is expected to have minimal impact on the analysis given the arbitrary nature of selecting a specific teleost species to represent this deep evolutionary lineage with only a single representative in our pruned dataset. The pruned, rooted tree is depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>. Using the caper package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Orme et al., 2023</xref>), we integrated the phylogenetic information with trait data using the ‘comparative.data’ function. Subsequently, the PGLS model was fitted using the ‘pgls’ function.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Investigation, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Investigation, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Investigation, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Investigation, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media xlink:href="elife-88933-mdarchecklist1-v1.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>All data generated or analyzed during this study are included in the manuscript and supporting files; source data files have been provided for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>—<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>.</p></sec><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Kelly O’Meara and Geoffrey Osgood, our former lab technicians, for helping with organization and logistics.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Christian Rutz as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision letter to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential Revisions:</p><p>Your findings reveal a predicted shift from high protein:carbohydrate consumption to lower protein:carbohydrate intake from the first instar to adulthood in many species – a decline that strongly correlated with a decrease in mass-specific growth rate. Although the reviewers find your work impressive, there are fundamental issues that need to be addressed. Below, we summarise the strengths and weaknesses of your study and provide some recommendations for revision based on the combined assessment of the reviewers; this is followed by more detailed comments from the individual reviews.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>(1) Your study compares behaviour/physiology of laboratory vs. wild locusts. Captivity can change behaviour and physiology of most organisms, making it difficult to establish the relevance of laboratory experiments to what happens in the real world. We like your comparison between field- and laboratory-raised locusts, but this requires some corrections for specific differences between field and laboratory conditions.</p><p>(2) The anticipation that the observed trend in S. cancellata will extend to all animals based on the expectation that growth scales hypometrically across various body sizes and developmental stages adds weight and novelty to your hypothesis.</p><p>(3) Your application of the Geometric Framework (GF) of nutrition, which is a powerful approach for studying effects of nutrition and understanding the rules of compromise associated with balancing dietary unbalances.</p><p>(4) The further step of proposing a new scaling rule based on your study's results and data from the literature on various species.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>(1) The implication of the 'new scaling rule key' as determined from your hypothesis test was not made clear. This lack of clarity is reflected in the apparent lack of depth in the questions outlined in lines 358-363.</p><p>(2) The assumption that field-collected animals have experienced higher stress levels (line 124) needs to be substantiated. Captivity can constitute stress depending on what is being considered. The laboratory locust results were compared independently with field-collected data for late instar nymphs of the same locust species, and the conclusion is drawn that field insects ingested similar protein but 50-90% more carbohydrate (with only 23% increased mass-specific resting oxygen consumption rates). However, numerous uncontrolled variables between the lab and field studies make meaningful conclusions difficult to draw from this observation.</p><p>(3) In the laboratory experiment, an obvious omission is tests of whether locusts did indeed feed non-randomly and converged on a common bi-coordinate intake point under the two separate food-pairing treatments. It appears that you are not estimating &quot;Intake Targets&quot;, as stated throughout the manuscript. According to the geometric framework, the intake target (IT) is estimated as the point in the nutritional landscape under which performance/fitness is optimized. The geometric framework also predicts that animals can reach their intake targets by feeding selectivity when given a choice of diets that differ in nutrient amounts, which is what you did here. However, because the relationship between fitness/performance with diet was not established, in the choice experiments authors seem to be assuming (but not testing) that locusts are reaching their intake target. These methodological issues obscure the interpretation/conclusions presented in the manuscript.</p><p>(4) The data on late-instar field collected locusts do not address the core point of the paper about changes with development, and seem problematic in several ways, e.g., only late instar insects are tested; the previous nutritional history of insects is unknown; rearing temperatures and presumably light regimen were different; insects were not laboratory-adapted so perhaps more stressed when confined; data are not presented across successive days to indicate whether, e.g., the higher carbohydrate intakes reflected redressing of a previously incurred energy deficits early on in the stadium, or whether the differences were sustained across the stadium.</p><p>(5) The comparison between mass-specific protein consumption and specific growth rate may be problematic, as both variables seem to be estimated using final mass. You estimated a mass-specific protein intake for each instar. It is not clear why mass-specific intake and not just intake of protein was used for analysis. While the mass (or size) of an individual may influence food consumption, it seems like the authors calculated mass-specific consumption using each instar's final mass, which would make mass a result of protein consumption (and not the opposite).</p><p>Some specific comments:</p><p>Line 177 – developmental time?</p><p>Line 194 – remove name from parenthesis.</p><p>Line 265 – Protein, but not carbohydrate?</p><p>Lines 348 – 350 – I think it should be captive animals do not need to travel long distances to forage.</p><p>Panel B: correct the typo 'Flield females'</p><p>Lines 72-73 – foods, not diets.

Although the reviewers find your work impressive, there are fundamental issues that need to be addressed. Below, we summarise the strengths and weaknesses of your study and provide some recommendations for revision based on the combined assessment of the reviewers; this is followed by more detailed comments from the individual reviews.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>(1) Your study compares behaviour/physiology of laboratory vs. wild locusts. Captivity can change behaviour and physiology of most organisms, making it difficult to establish the relevance of laboratory experiments to what happens in the real world. We like your comparison between field- and laboratory-raised locusts, but this requires some corrections for specific differences between field and laboratory conditions.</p></disp-quote><p>We have revised our explanation of the purpose of the comparison between lab and field. Because relatively few studies have made such comparisons, our goal was simply to test whether the intake targets measured with lab-reared animals would predict intake targets for field-captured animals. In the discussion, we now describe the many possible reasons that lab and field-results may differ and note that we have not shown that the scaling rules apply in the field.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The anticipation that the observed trend in S. cancellata will extend to all animals based on the expectation that growth scales hypometrically across various body sizes and developmental stages adds weight and novelty to your hypothesis.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Your application of the Geometric Framework (GF) of nutrition, which is a powerful approach for studying effects of nutrition and understanding the rules of compromise associated with balancing dietary unbalances.</p><p>(4) The further step of proposing a new scaling rule based on your study's results and data from the literature on various species.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>(1) The implication of the 'new scaling rule key' as determined from your hypothesis test was not made clear. This lack of clarity is reflected in the apparent lack of depth in the questions outlined in lines 358-363.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the suggestion. We have added material to the discussion regarding how our discovery of this rule may affect our understanding of an organism’s physiology and ecological niche.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The assumption that field-collected animals have experienced higher stress levels (line 124) needs to be substantiated. Captivity can constitute stress depending on what is being considered. The laboratory locust results were compared independently with field-collected data for late instar nymphs of the same locust species, and the conclusion is drawn that field insects ingested similar protein but 50-90% more carbohydrate (with only 23% increased mass-specific resting oxygen consumption rates). However, numerous uncontrolled variables between the lab and field studies make meaningful conclusions difficult to draw from this observation.</p></disp-quote><p>These are good points. We deleted the sentence indicating that field animals likely experienced higher stress levels. We also clarified the purpose of our experiments with field-collected locusts, which was to test whether our intake targets measured for lab-reared locusts could predict those of field-collected locusts; a comparison that has been rarely made. We added material to the discussion to explain some of the many possible explanations for why the field and lab populations differed in intake targets. We also clarified that the fact that metabolic rates were only 23% higher while carbohydrate consumption rates were 50-90% higher in field locusts might be due to the fact that our metabolic rates were measured on resting animals (feeding is well-known to elevate metabolic rates in locusts).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) In the laboratory experiment, an obvious omission is tests of whether locusts did indeed feed non-randomly and converged on a common bi-coordinate intake point under the two separate food-pairing treatments. It appears that you are not estimating &quot;Intake Targets&quot;, as stated throughout the manuscript. According to the geometric framework, the intake target (IT) is estimated as the point in the nutritional landscape under which performance/fitness is optimized. The geometric framework also predicts that animals can reach their intake targets by feeding selectivity when given a choice of diets that differ in nutrient amounts, which is what you did here. However, because the relationship between fitness/performance with diet was not established, in the choice experiments authors seem to be assuming (but not testing) that locusts are reaching their intake target. These methodological issues obscure the interpretation/conclusions presented in the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>As defined by Raubenheimer and Simpson (2018), “the intake target (IT) is a geometric representation of the nutrient mixture that the regulatory systems target through foraging and feeding”. We did the standard procedure for measuring a self-selected intake target, using the statistical approach that is well-established in the GF literature, as documented in the references below. To exclude random feeding patterns, we carried out choice experiments for all developmental stages using two different pairs of diets that would result in locusts achieving different p:c (protein to carbohydrate) ratios if they simply ate randomly during the experiment. The insignificant effects of diet pairs (table 1 – MANCOVA output) confirm that locusts did indeed feed non-randomly and converged on a common bi-coordinate intake point under the two separate food-pairing treatments. We updated the text to make this point clear.</p><p>It is correct that we did not determine whether the intake targets we measured coincide with optimal performance. This is a complex issue because the fitness consequences of larval diet can be measured in many ways, including growth and survival of the larvae, and/or adult reproduction and adult longevity; these traits do not always correlate (Sentinella et al. 2013; Runnagal-McNaull et al. 2013). Therefore, we felt that measuring the fitness consequences of the varied intake targets for each developmental stage was beyond the scope of this paper.</p><p>We have added much of this material and the references to the discussion.</p><p>Clissold, Fiona J, Helena Kertesz, Amelia M.

As we mentioned above, with these uncontrolled conditions, we demonstrated that the two different developmental stages (5<sup>th</sup> and 6<sup>th</sup> nymphal instars) of field-collected locusts had similar protein consumption but strikingly different carbohydrate consumption rates. Comparisons of field experiments and lab data are extremely rare, especially with locust outbreaks which occur infrequently in remote areas (it had been 60 years since the last South American locust upsurge!).

Captivity can constitute stress depending on what is being considered.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a good point. We have deleted this sentence.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Regarding the lab experiment, the one omission is tests of whether locusts did indeed feed non-randomly and converged on a common bi-coordinate intake point under the two separate food-pairing treatments.</p></disp-quote><p>This comment caused us to realize that we had not clearly explained that we excluded random feeding by conducting choice experiments using two complementary diet pairs, and using MANCOVA to confirm that there was no effect of diet pairs (for each developmental stage). This is the standard method to identify an intake target. We have added some additional sentences to the text which will hopefully make this clear.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The data on late-instar field collected locusts do not address the core point of the paper in relation to changes with development, and seem problematic in several ways, e.g., only late instar insects are tested; the previous nutritional history of insects was unknown; rearing temperatures and presumably light regimen were different; insects were not lab-adapted so perhaps more stressed when confined; data are not presented across successive days to indicate whether, e.g., the higher carbohydrate intakes reflected redressing of a previously incurred energy deficits early on in the stadium, or whether the differences were sustained across the stadium.</p></disp-quote><p>As noted above, we have added sentences to the discussion to provide further explanations as to why the field-collected locusts may have differed from the lab-collected animals.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A more formal meta-analysis/comparative biology approach is required before the data in Figure 3 are convincing. How were cases for inclusion sourced (literature search terms), what was the justification for the temperature correction to 37oC, should there be consideration of phylogenetic effects, etc.?</p></disp-quote><p>As we mentioned above, we have added details to the methods on the search procedures. A justification for the temperature correction, and a phylogenetic analysis.</p></body></sub-article></article>
