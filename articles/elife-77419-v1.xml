compromising tissue architecture. But complicated, laborious procedures, or expensive equipment, as well as the use of hazardous, organic solvents prevent the widespread adoption of these methods. Here, we report a simple and rapid tissue clearing method, EZ Clear, that can clear whole adult mouse organs in 48 hr in just three simple steps. Samples stay at room temperature and remain hydrated throughout the clearing process, preserving endogenous and synthetic fluorescence, without altering sample size. After wholemount clearing and imaging, samples processed with EZ Clear can be subjected to downstream applications, such as tissue embedding and cryosectioning followed by standard histology or immunofluorescent staining without loss of fluorescence signal from endogenous or synthetic reporters. Furthermore, we demonstrate that wholemount adult mouse brains processed with EZ Clear can be successfully immunolabeled for fluorescent imaging while still retaining signal from endogenous fluorescent reporters. Overall, the simplicity, speed, and flexibility of EZ Clear make it easy to adapt and implement in diverse imaging modalities in biomedical research.</p></abstract><kwd-group

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Over the past 30 years, the development of confocal microscopes that can image large samples at cellular resolution, combined with powerful increases in computing and the ability to handle large volumes of data, have unleashed an explosion in three-dimensional (3D) visualization of organ structures at both a macro and cellular scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Richardson and Lichtman, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Richardson et al., 2021</xref>). A key to this revolution has been the simultaneous deluge of tissue clearing protocols driven by advances in optical physics and chemical engineering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Richardson and Lichtman, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Richardson et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Tainaka et al., 2016</xref>).

As the depth of light microscopy-based imaging of large samples is usually limited by the scattering of light, advances in tissue clearing allows researchers to examine tissues in their native 3D state by imaging modalities with different volume capacities and resolution, ranging from optical projection tomography, to confocal or multiphoton imaging, to cutting edge lightsheet fluorescence microscopy (LSFM)-based imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Udan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hoog et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahrens et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amat et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ueda et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">KolesovÃ¡ et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Although each of the aforementioned strategies has their own unique merits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Richardson and Lichtman, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Richardson et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Tainaka et al., 2016</xref>), several hurdles remain for the field in terms of developing and adopting a rapid, simple, and robust tissue clearing method. While aqueous-based protocols may preserve fluorescence from endogenous transgenic reporters, and are generally compatible with most existing imaging platforms, they often require either extended incubation periods (days to weeks) or complicated, laborious procedures, as well as special clearing equipment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Richardson et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Tainaka et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ariel, 2017</xref>). For example, hydrogel scaffolding-based CLARITY clearing provides a robust and controllable workflow to clear tissue in an aqueous environment, but the complicated steps and considerable technical investment required represent substantial hurdles that prevent many researchers from adopting this methodology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chung and Deisseroth, 2013</xref>). Moreover, as hydrogel scaffolding is based on covalently conjugating proteins in a polyacrylamide matrix, precise control of tissue fixation with paraformaldehyde (PFA) and thermal crosslinking of polyacrylamide is required. Otherwise, the overall strength and pore size of the hydrogel-tissue matrix varies experiment to experiment during SDS-mediated electrophoretic removal of lipids, limiting reproducible, robust results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Tainaka et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chung and Deisseroth, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gradinaru et al., 2018</xref>). In addition, variations in clearing efficiency for different organ systems based on tissue composition and volume also pose a significant challenge for researchers, as extensive optimization is required to tailor this method to individual research projects.</p><p>In contrast, organic solvent-based clearing methods are simple, fast, efficient, and do not require specialized homemade or commercial equipment. However, challenges in sample handling and imaging tissues in these hazardous, toxic solvents, combined with the rapid decline of endogenous fluorescent signal, limit their applicability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Richardson and Lichtman, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Tainaka et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ueda et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ariel, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gradinaru et al., 2018</xref>). These clearing strategies typically use corrosive and combustible organic solvents to match the refractive index (RI) of dehydrated tissues to minimize light scattering and render tissue optically transparent, which limits downstream imaging to microscope systems with solvent-resistant chambers and objectives. Critically, while samples can be processed for conventional histology and immunostaining following aqueous-based tissue clearing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Neckel et al., 2016</xref>), whether solvent cleared samples can be processed for downstream techniques such as cryosectioning and immunolabeling (or even conventional histology) has not been rigorously explored, potentially limiting the application of these approaches to non-precious tissue samples.</p><p>Here, we present a simple and rapid tissue clearing method, EZ Clear, that effectively renders whole adult mouse organs optically transparent in 48 hrs using three simple steps: lipid removal, washing, and RI matching. EZ Clear combines the advantages of solvent-mediated lipid removal with highly water-miscible tetrahydrofuran (THF) and renders samples transparent in an aqueous, high RI (n=1.518) sample mounting and imaging solution that is compatible with most microscopy platforms. Because samples are submerged in an aqueous environment throughout the entirety of the protocol, no significant changes in sample size occur during tissue processing. Our results demonstrate that EZ Clear processed adult mouse organs (brain, eye, heart, lung, liver, pancreas, kidney, testis, and ovary) not only retained endogenous fluorescence from transgenic reporters to allow 3D whole organ lightsheet imaging, but could also be successfully wholemount immunofluorescently stained while preserving endogenous fluorescent signal. Moreover, samples treated with EZ Clear can also be processed after wholemount imaging for cryosectioning and histology or immunofluorescent staining for further analysis. In summary, EZ Clear is a simple, robust, and easy to adopt whole organ clearing technique that can be applied to various sample volumes and utilized across most common imaging platforms.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Clear mouse organs in 48 hr with three simple steps</title><p>EZ Clear effectively clears adult mouse organs in 48 hr with three simple steps at room temperature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Step 1 is to immerse the fixed sample in the lipid removal solution, which consists of 50% (v/v) THF in sterile Milli-Q water. This formula allows THF to dissolve lipid away from the tissue while the organ remains hydrated in an aqueous environment. Following lipid removal, the sample is incubated in sterile Milli-Q water for 4 hr to wash and remove any residual THF from the tissue. The tissue is then rendered transparent by immersing it in aqueous RI matching and imaging solution (EZ View, RI = 1.518) at room temperature for 24 hr. EZ Clear not only renders the whole brain as transparent as 3DISCO and FAST 3D (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A</xref>), but it also has the shortest processing time (48 hr) and simplest procedure (three steps) of current tissue clearing protocols. Because the sample is maintained in an aqueous environment throughout the entire process, the size of processed samples remains constant throughout the protocol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, n=4 for each condition, one-way ANOVA, size change ratio = 1.072 Â± 0.062). Conversely, other approaches either significantly shrank (Fast 3D: 0.776Â±0.025 and 3DISCO: 0.593Â±0.013) or expanded (X-CLARITY: 1.608Â±0.049) the brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1B</xref>). In addition, endogenous transgenic fluorescent reporter activity is preserved throughout the EZ Clear protocol, as a brain from a <italic>Thy1-EGFP</italic> neuronal reporter line that was processed with EZ Clear retained robust signal within neurons when imaged by lightsheet microscopy across a total imaging depth of 5 mm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1DâF</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). EZ Clear is also compatible with adult mouse organs other than the brain, with excellent transparency evident following tissue processing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). Multiple adult mouse organs (eye, heart, kidney, testis, and ovary) were collected after vascular perfusion with a far-red fluorescently conjugated <italic>Lycopersicon esculentum</italic> (tomato) lectin (lectin-DyLight 649) dye that labels the endothelium. Following perfusion, samples were fixed and then processed with EZ Clear. Wholemount imaging of samples by LSFM demonstrated that the lectin-649 signal was robust and well preserved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>, maximum intensity projection).

Given the aqueous nature of EZ Clear, we first tested whether refractive index matching solution (RIMS) (80% (v/v) Nycodenz, RI = 1.46) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">McCreedy et al., 2021</xref>), or the more affordable alternative sRIMS (80% D-sorbitol, RI = 1.43) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Yang et al., 2014</xref>), were compatible with tissues following lipid removal by EZ Clear. Somewhat surprisingly, EZ Clear delipidated samples immersed in either RIMS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) or sRIMS (data not shown) were not rendered transparent. Thus, we pursued novel aqueous solutions with an RI over 1.50. Previous studies showed that urea can hyperhydrate samples and enhance tissue transparency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hama et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Susaki et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Zhu et al., 2019</xref>). We also noticed that the RIs of aqueous solutions increased linearly as the concentration of urea was increased (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2âsource data 1</xref>). To test the effect of combining urea and Nycodenz on RI and clearing efficiency under aqueous conditions, we gradually increased the urea concentration in RIMS and measured the RI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). As predicted, the RI of the 80% Nycodenz solution was positively correlated with the concentration of urea. While the solution was saturated with 8 M of urea in 80% Nycodenz, the highest RI (RI = 1.518 Â± 0.0003) was obtained with 7 M urea in 80% Nycodenz at room temperature. We then examined sample transparency by comparing brains after lipid removal with EZ Clear, immersed and equilibrated in either PBS (RI = 1.332), RIMS (80% Nycodenz, RI = 1.463 Â± 0.0019), or EZ View (80% Nycodenz and 7 M urea, RI = 1.518 Â± 0.0003) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2BâD</xref>). While the tissue remained opaque in PBS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), the transparency of the EZ Clear lipid removed brain showed only a minor improvement following immersion and equilibration in RIMS for 24 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). However, the EZ Clear lipid removed brain immersed and equilibrated in EZ View solution for 24 hr was comparable to samples cleared using 3DISCO (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>High refractive index imaging buffer EZ View achieves deeper imaging depth and maintains fluorescence stability.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Refractive index (RI) of 80% Nycodenz increases linearly with increasing concentrations of urea (n=3).

Adult mice perfused with fluorescent lectin-649 were euthanized and the brains were collected and then immersion fixed in 4% PFA overnight at 4Â°C. After fixation, labeled brains were treated with EZ Clearâs lipid removal and washing steps, and then equilibrated and imaged in either RIMS or EZ View (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2EâJ</xref>). Imaging by LSFM demonstrated that not only were brains equilibrated in EZ View more transparent than those equilibrated in RIMS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C, D</xref>), but they also featured deeper imaging depths (over 6 mm) through the dorsal-ventral axis of the brain compared to samples equilibrated in RIMS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F, I</xref>). Color-coded depth projection stepping at 1 mm intervals showed that while the signal from lectin-649 starts to scatter 1â2 mm deep into RIMS treated tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>), the signal remains strong and coherent (non-diffuse) at greater depths in the brain equilibrated and imaged in EZ View (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>). Quantitative comparison of the mean fluorescence intensity at depths of 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 mm showed that while fluorescence intensity remained consistent in the EZ View equilibrated samples, mean fluorescence intensity was significantly lower after 4 mm in depth in the brains equilibrated and imaged in RIMS compared to those processed and imaged in EZ View (wholemount brains imaged for each condition n=3, two-way ANOVA and multiple comparisons). We also tested the long-term stability of fluorescence signal of samples stored in EZ View. Mouse brains perfused with lectin-649 were cleared with EZ Clear and stored in EZ View and then imaged 14, 17, 43, and 70 days later (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2L</xref>). Notably, signal intensity showed no significant change through the imaging depth following prolonged storage in EZ View solution (n=3, two-way ANOVA and multiple comparisons). These results demonstrate that EZ View solution attains a high RI and effectively renders delipidated tissues optically transparent while minimizing light scattering while also maintaining fluorescent signal. Critically, EZ Clear samples remain in an aqueous environment throughout the entire clearing and imaging process, and no corrosive or combustible organic solvents, or potentially damaging immersion oils, are required for RI matching and imaging.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Comparison between EZ Clear and Fast 3D</title><p>To further assess the clearing efficiency and sample transparency of EZ Clear, we compared samples cleared by two THF-based clearing methods, EZ Clear and Fast 3D, following administration of a synthetic, exogenous fluorescent dye that labels the endothelium. When Evans blue, a non-cell permeable dye, binds to albumin, it undergoes a conformational shift that produces fluorescence in the far-red spectrum (excitation at 620 nm, emission at 680 nm) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Namykin et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Saria and Lundberg, 1983</xref>). A cost affordable alternative to expensive dyes, such as fluorescent tomato lectin, Evans blue can thus be used to robustly label the endothelium following intravenous administration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Robertson et al., 2015</xref>). Adult mice perfused with Evans blue were euthanized and the brains were collected and fixed in 4% PFA overnight at 4Â°C. The brains were then bisected at the midline along the anterior-posterior axis, and the left hemisphere was cleared with Fast 3D, while the right hemisphere was cleared with EZ Clear. Both hemispheres were imaged independently on a Zeiss Lightsheet Z1 from the dorsal to ventral side with an EC Plan-Neofluar 5x/0.16 air detection objective at a resolution of 1.829 Î¼m laterally and 3.675 Î¼m axially (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3AâF</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref>). The right hemisphere, processed with EZ clear, was equilibrated, and imaged in EZ View solution (RI = 1.518), while left hemisphere, cleared with Fast 3D, was equilibrated, and imaged in Fast 3D imaging solution (RI = 1.512). Although both EZ Clear and Fast 3D effectively rendered the tissue optical transparent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), lightsheet imaging demonstrated that EZ Clear also enabled imaging at depths up to 6.5 mm from dorsal to ventral sides, with focused signal and high contrast (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3AâC</xref>), whereas light scattering increased at deeper imaging depths in the hemisphere processed using Fast 3D (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3DâF</xref>). We further compared fluorescence intensity and contrast between the brains cleared with EZ Clear and Fast 3D. Mouse brains perfused with lectin-649 were either cleared with EZ Clear or Fast 3D (n=3 brains for each condition) and wholemount imaged through the dorsal-ventral axis by LSFM. A quantitative comparison of the mean fluorescence intensity at depths of 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 mm into the brain (dorsal to ventral) showed no significant difference in lectin-649 signal intensity between EZ Clear and Fast 3D cleared samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>, n=3, two-way ANOVA and multiple comparisons). However, while the signal contrast remained high and consistent in EZ Clear processed brains, the lectin-649 signal contrast decreased with imaging depth in Fast 3D samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>, n=3). Lectin-649 signal contrast also remained high and consistent when quantitatively measured in other EZ Clear processed adult mouse organs, including the eye, heart, kidney, testis, and ovary (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>). Thus, in 48 hr and three simple steps, EZ Clear achieves high optical transparency, without sample shrinkage or swelling, it preserves endogenous and synthetic fluorescence, and it is compatible with aqueous-based imaging platforms. Additionally, EZ Clear enables imaging at deeper depths with minimal light scattering compared to other current tissue clearing modalities.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Quantitative comparison of fluorescence intensity and contrast between samples processed by EZ Clear and Fast 3D.</title><p>(<bold>AâF</bold>) Lightsheet imaging of a mouse brain perfused with Evans blue dye and cleared by EZ Clear (right hemisphere, <bold>AâC</bold>) and Fast 3D (left hemisphere, <bold>DâF</bold>) shows that tissue processed with EZ Clear has cleaner signal and less light scattering.

By combining a water-miscible solvent that rapidly infiltrates and dissolves lipids within a tissue, and an aqueous high RI sample mounting medium that minimizes light scattering and renders tissues optically transparent, EZ Clear makes whole organ clearing and high-resolution imaging simple and compatible with a variety of imaging needs.</p><p>EZ Clear has several advantages over other clearing methods. First, unlike electrophoretic-based CLARITY clearing, EZ Clear does not require a significant initial financial investment in specialized equipment. Indeed, its simplicity and robustness make it easy to adopt and apply immediately in any standard molecular biological laboratory. Additionally, samples require minimal attention during processing, and this simple, three-step protocol requires little time and effort, as it yields cleared tissue within 48 hr. THF has been used in other clearing methods, such as 3DISCO and Fast 3D, for tissue dehydration and lipid removal from samples prior to RI matching to render tissue transparent. THF is highly water-miscible, easily infiltrates biological samples, solubilizes lipids, and minimizes fluorescent quenching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">ErtÃ¼rk et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">DÃ­az et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Qi et al., 2019</xref>). However, instead of going through graded series of THF for lipid removal, which dehydrates tissue and can alter sample size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">ErtÃ¼rk et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kosmidis et al., 2021</xref>), we determined that 50% THF prepared in ddH<sub>2</sub>O is not only sufficient for dissolving lipids within tissues, but samples remain hydrated during the entire procedure, which minimizes size changes. This simple, one-step immersion procedure also significantly reduces the amount of THF required for processing each sample. Furthermore, while the RI of water is 1.33, the RI of the soft tissue is estimated to be between 1.44 and 1.56, and the RI of dry tissue is approximately 1.50 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ueda et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Jacques, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Silvestri et al., 2016</xref>). In solvent-based clearing methods (e.g., 3DISCO and BABB), dehydrated and delipidated samples are equilibrated in high RI solvents, such as DBE (RI = 1.56) and BABB (RI = 1.55) to reduce light scattering. In aqueous-based clearing methods, solutions like RIMS (80% (v/v) Nycodenz, RI = 1.46) and sRIMS (80% D-sorbitol, RI = 1.43) are used for mounting and imaging of SDS-mediated delipidated tissue, although they have less than ideal RIs, falling well below the ideal range of 1.52â1.56 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Yang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">McCreedy et al., 2021</xref>). By using an aqueous sample mounting and imaging solution with a high RI (1.518), delipidated samples remain hydrated while being imaged, preserving endogenous fluorescent signals, and making EZ Clear compatible with most fluorescent imaging platforms. Imaging samples in EZ View obviates the use of immersion oil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kosmidis et al., 2021</xref>), further simplifying additional downstream processing and imaging. We also note that EZ View solution can be used as a sample mounting and imaging medium for tissue after cryosectioning and attachment to slides. Finally, we demonstrated that not only are EZ Clear processed samples compatible with wholemount immunofluorescent staining with both passive standard immunofluorescent and iDISCO staining protocols, but they can also be processed for cryosectioning and standard histological staining or immunofluorescent staining, effectively reducing the number of samples required for imaging studies. While whole organ immunostaining and imaging at the macro level is possible with currently established protocols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Renier et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Susaki, 1982</xref>), we propose that initial whole organ imaging with EZ Clear followed by interrogation at the cellular level in thicker sections via cryosectioning and immunohistochemistry-based indirect immunofluorescence allows researchers to maximize the yield of precious tissue samples while minimizing the costs associated with excessive antibody use.</p><p>A shortcoming of the present study is that we have not yet tested EZ Clear on larger samples, or on tissues from other species such as rats, pigs, or humans, nor did we examine mouse tissues from younger ages (e.g., embryos). Future testing on the volume of the lipid removal solution required, and incubation time necessary, scaled to various sample sizes with varying lipid contents will be necessary for further optimization of the technique, but we anticipate that this method will readily work with samples smaller than the adult mouse organs used in the present study.</p><p>In summary, EZ Clear renders adult mouse organs optically transparent in 48 hr in just three simple steps using standard, off the shelf reagents in an aqueous-based tissue clearing methodology. EZ Clear is a simple, robust, and easy to adopt whole organ clearing technique that preserves endogenous fluorescent reporters and is compatible with most common imaging platforms, while offering the additional benefit of preserving samples for further downstream imaging analyses.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource"

(2) Wash: rinsed with sterile Milli-Q H<sub>2</sub>O four times, 1 hr each at room temperature. (3) RI matching: incubated with 5 mL of EZ View sample mounting and imaging solution for 24 hr to render the samples transparent for imaging. The EZ View solution consisted of 80% Nycodenz (Accurate Chemical &amp; Scientific 100334-594), 7 M urea, 0.05% sodium azide prepared in 0.02 M sodium phosphate buffer. To prepare the solution, 52.5 g of urea and 31.25 mg of sodium azide were mixed with 35 mL of 0.02 M sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) in a 250 mL beaker. The solution was stirred and gently heated to 37Â°C on a hot plate until the urea completely dissolved. Then, 100 g of Nycodenz was slowly stirred in until completely dissolved. The final volume of the solution was adjusted to 125 mL with 0.02 M sodium phosphate buffer. The dissolved solution was filtered through a vacuum filtration system (Nalgene vacuum filtration system filter, pore size 0.2 Î¼m, Z370606) and stored at room temperature. The RI of the EZ View solution was measured on a refractometer (Atago, PAL-RI 3850) and the RI was between 1.512 and 1.518. Cleared samples were protected from light, placed on a shaker, and rocked gently at room temperature for 24 hr to render them transparent.

Briefly, after perfusion and fixation, adult mouse brains were incubated in graded series of 20 mL of THF solutions mixed with filtered Milli-Q H<sub>2</sub>O at increasing concentrations of 50, 70, 80, and 100% (v/v), 1 hr each, in a scintillation vial at room temperature. The scintillation vial was covered with foil and placed on an orbital shaker within a vented chemical fume hood. Brains were then immersed in fresh 100% THF overnight, followed by a 1 hr incubation in fresh 100% THF. After removing THF completely, samples were then immersed in benzyl ether (DBE, Millipore-Sigma, 108014) overnight to render them transparent.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>X-CLARITY clearing</title><p>X-CLARITY clearing was performed according to the manufacturerâs instruction (Logos Biosystems). Briefly, after perfusion and fixation, adult mouse brains were immersed in 5 mL of X-CLARITY Hydrogel Solution with 0.25% (w/v) of polymerization initiator VA-044 (Logos Biosystems, C1310X) at 4Â°C for 24 hr. The hydrogel infused brain was then thermo-induced crosslinked for 3 hr at 37Â°C under vacuum (â90 kPa). After the crosslinking reaction, the hydrogel solution was removed and the brain was washed in Ã1 PBS three times, 1 hr each, then once overnight at 4Â°C. The hydrogel infused and crosslinked brain was then cleared in electrophoretic tissue clearing solution (Logos Biosystems, C13001) using the X-CLARITY Tissue Clearing System set at 0.8 A and 37Â°C for 15 hr (Logos Biosystems). After electrophoresis, the brain was washed in 50 mL of Ã1 PBS three times, 1 hr each, then once overnight at room temperature. To render the tissue transparent for imaging, the brains were immersed in sRIMS (70% w/v D-sorbitol in 0.02 M sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4) at 4Â°C until transparent.

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Marianne Bronner as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Timothy C Cox (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Quantification and rigorous assessment across multiple tissue types is required to support the notion that EZClear is a major advance over existing protocols.</p><p>2) Similarities between EZClear and the existing Fast3D protocol have not been clearly portrayed and more credit should be given to the existing work. Further, additional quantitative comparisons between EZ Clear and Fast 3D/3Disco are needed.</p><p>3) In addition to the comparison across multiple tissue types noted in point #1, an extended version of the EZ Clear protocol with immunofluorescent labeling procedures in whole mouse brain tissue should be included along with quantification of fluorescent intensity as a function of depth. For data currently in the manuscript, quantification is also needed to show how the intensity and contrast of the fluorescent labeling changes as a function of depth.</p><p>4) LSFM imaging should be performed in some of the other mouse tissues to demonstrate sufficient clearing for quantification purposes.</p><p>5) New data and quantification are required to test whether fluorescence intensity is maintained, fades or increases following periods of storage in EZ View.</p><p>6) Improper style/grammar issues throughout the manuscript need to be addressed. Further, slang/commercialized terms should be avoided and functional names used instead.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>â The manuscript writing in select portions of the Methods Section could be improved. The verb tense changes and the text appears to be copied from a lab protocol (e.g. end of &quot;Animal Perfusion&quot; and beginning of &quot;EZ Clear protocol&quot;).</p><p>â The text in the graph in Figure 1B is very small and difficult to read.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Major issues to address:</p><p>The true novelty of this method is a little unclear given the similarity between the EZ Clear and Fast3D solutions and procedure. I feel the authors should give more credit to the Fast3D procedure, as it seems clear that the current method is derived from it: both methods use THF for delipidation which is followed by a water wash, and then the samples are submerged in similar chemicals for 'viewing'. The use of a different commercial name (Nycodenz in the EZ View solution) for the same reagent used in Fast 3D (Histodenz) makes it sound more novel than it actually is. The only apparent difference between the EZ Clear and Fast3D approaches is that two minor chemicals (diatrizoic acid and glucamine) are omitted from the Fast 3D viewing solution and a graded series of THF treatments is replaced by a single treatment. However, if these differences are indeed as significant for clearing as the brain hemisphere data imply, then it would greatly benefit the manuscript if the authors could clarify which of the differences between the two procedures confer this advantage or provide some reasonable explanation as to why they see notable differences in the clearing in the one example they show.</p><p>Although one might presume the applicability of this method to be broad, like Fast3D, this would be important to demonstrate. This could be done by looking at more diverse tissue types or more examples of samples processed side by side and imaged with the two methods. This is typically done for other papers reporting clearing methods.</p><p>The majority of the remaining issues, which appear throughout the paper, and particularly in the Methods section, relate to improper style and/or grammar issues, which can be easily addressed. It is strongly recommended that all authors proof read the manuscript during revision as this does not appear to have occurred with the original submission.</p><p>These are listed below largely in the order they appear:</p><p>1. The authors have chosen to name their method &quot;EZ Clear&quot;, understandably for catchiness and simplicity. However, they should avoid using slang terms such as &quot;EZ cleared&quot; when describing the use of this protocol. Simple rewording will address this. It also seems a little unnecessary to have &quot;commercialized&quot; names for each of the three steps (EZ Away, EZ Wash and EZ View) versus 'functional' names: delipidation, water wash, imaging solution. This is not done for other methods unless they are already commercialized.</p><p>2. Line 51: should be 'hydrogel scaffolding-based' not 'hydrogel-scaffolding based'.</p><p>3. Line 64: 'limit its' should be 'limit their' as it is referencing plural.</p><p>4. Line 70: The comment regarding 'the post-processing of samples following organic solvent clearing for histology and immunohistochemistry are yet to be seriously explored' is not strictly true. It is somewhat limited but there are existing protocols to do this for at least BABB cleared specimens (eg. following OPT imaging). They are just not widely utilized.</p><p>5. There are numerous places within the manuscript where the English is poor, including instances where the participle 'the' or another word is missing. In addition, in multiple places throughout the Methods, there are changes in tense and person â where the methods revert to what sounds like a step-by-step lab protocol (ie. instructional vs past tense descriptive). These are basic issues in scientific manuscript writing which raise the concern expressed above about whether many of the authors actually read the entirety of the manuscript before submission.</p><p>6. The first section in the Results is titled &quot;EZ Clear: simple, rapid, and effective&quot;, which sound like commercial brochure material rather than a section of a scientific manuscript. The remaining titles in the results are more appropriate.</p><p>7. There are numerous sentences within the Results that do not belong in the Results but rather either in the Methods or in the Discussion (or essentially duplicate what is said in those sections). For example, the first 9 lines of the Results comprises general statements about the procedure as well as the composition of some of the solutions, which seem more appropriate for the Discussion and Methods, respectively.</p><p>8. On line 94, the beginning of the sentence &quot;Compared to brains fixed in only 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA),&quot; seems a pointless comparison and should be removed.</p><p>9. The title for Figure 2 is not informative or reflective of the full content of the figure and thus needs to be reworded.</p><p>10. On line 382, the words &quot;before tissue was harvested&quot; should be deleted as it is an odd/unnecessary place to state this since the following line states that the &quot;mice were then deeply anesthetized&quot;.</p><p>11. The sentence starting on line 399 (and many subsequent places in the Methods) has altered tense relative to other sentences.</p><p>12. Line 400: please replace &quot;XXX&quot; with actual words.</p><p>13. It is suggested that the composition of each &quot;EZ&quot; solution is listed separately either in a separate section preceding &quot;EZ Clear protocol&quot; or as the lead paragraph to that section as this will simplified the reading of this section. That said, assigning the name 'EZ Wash' to something that is simply MilliQ water seems unnecessary.</p><p>14. Sentence beginning on line 409 is in the wrong tense.</p><p>15. Line 413: &quot;remain&quot; should be &quot;remaining&quot;. &quot;Delipided&quot; is a descriptor (slang term?) â please use better English to describe the processed samples.</p><p>16. From line 414 needs to be reworded to fix English and tense. It is also &quot;7M urea&quot; not &quot;7M of urea&quot;.</p><p>17. Line 418: what 'phosphate' is used in the 0.02M phosphate buffer that is referred to multiple times?</p><p>18. Line 442: fix English â it should not be &quot;was then undergo&quot;.</p><p>19. Line 474: why were measurements done on stitched together 2D images of the brains versus post-scanning where the actual volume can be calculated by any number of software.</p><p>20. Line 496: sentences have a 'protocol' type format/structure -change to standard format.</p><p>21. Line 505 â section title should be changed to &quot;Preparation of cleared samples for cryo-sectioning&quot;.</p><p>The actual quality of the data that is presented is very good. It is just the true novelty, impact and conclusions (and writing style/English) that need to be tightened up.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.77419.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Quantification and rigorous assessment across multiple tissue types is required to support the notion that EZClear is a major advance over existing protocols.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for their comments regarding the addition of quantitative assessment across multiple tissue types. We have expanded our analysis of cleared tissue types to include murine brain, eye, heart, kidney, testis, and ovary with endothelium labeled via perfused lectin649 and included the results in Figure 1. All organs shown in the revised manuscript were processed using the same EZ Clear procedure (3 steps in 48 hours) and can be imaged through their entire volume with no significant difference in contrast across the various imaging depths, as shown in Figure 3H and 3I.</p><p>We have also quantitatively compared the difference between imaging tissues in RIMS and EZ View by measuring the mean fluorescence intensity through the depth of the tissue to show that while samples equilibrated in EZ View maintain fluorescence intensity throughout various imaging depths (0 to 5 mm), the detectable fluorescence intensity of samples equilibrated in RIMS gradually decreased when imaging deeper depths in brain tissue, with significant difference at a depth of 4 mm when compared to samples equilibrated in EZ View (highlighted in revised Figure 2K).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Similarities between EZClear and the existing Fast3D protocol have not been clearly portrayed and more credit should be given to the existing work.

Our rational for using 50% THF for removing lipids while keeping samples hydrated and using urea to adjust the refractive index of the nycodenz solution are novel and did not derivefrom Fast 3D. However, we acknowledge that Fast 3D was published before our work (Nov 22, 2019 vs our posting on BioRxiv on Jan 13, 2022) and more credit should be given. We have included a section in the discussion to clarify and more accurately describe the similarities between EZ Clear and Fast 3D. In addition, we have revised Figure 3 to include a quantitative comparison of how fluorescence intensity and contrast changes as a function of depth between samples processed with EZ Clear and Fast 3D. We did not include the samples processed with 3DISCO because our Lightsheet Z.1 system is not compatible with imaging samples RI-matched with organic solvents, which is also one of the reasons we want to develop EZ Clear.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) In addition to the comparison across multiple tissue types noted in point #1, an extended version of the EZ Clear protocol with immunofluorescent labeling procedures in whole mouse brain tissue should be included along with quantification of fluorescent intensity as a function of depth.

The revised manuscript now includes a wholemount immunostaining protocol validated using adult mouse brains processed with EZ Clear then stained using a standard immunostaining procedure or processed using an IHC procedure adapted from iDISCO (Renier et al., Cell. 2014). In the revised manuscript we quantitatively compare these stained samples to show that not only do the antibodies diffuse through the brains efficiently with both staining protocols (measured laterally and axially), but there are no detectable differences between either protocol in terms of changing in intensity as a function of depth.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) LSFM imaging should be performed in some of the other mouse tissues to demonstrate sufficient clearing for quantification purposes.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this suggestion.
