specific roles of subcellular NAD<sup>+</sup> pools in retinal development, maintenance, and disease remain obscure. Here, we show that deletion of the nuclear-localized NAD<sup>+</sup> synthase nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferase-1 (NMNAT1) in the developing murine retina causes early and severe degeneration of photoreceptors and select inner retinal neurons via multiple distinct cell death pathways. This severe phenotype is associated with disruptions to retinal central carbon metabolism, purine nucleotide synthesis, and amino acid pathways. Furthermore, transcriptomic and immunostaining approaches reveal dysregulation of a collection of photoreceptor and synapse-specific genes in NMNAT1 knockout retinas prior to detectable morphological or metabolic alterations. Collectively, our study reveals previously unrecognized complexity in NMNAT1-associated retinal degeneration and suggests a yet-undescribed role for NMNAT1 in gene regulation during photoreceptor terminal differentiation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>NAD</kwd><kwd>NMNAT1</kwd><kwd>retina</kwd><kwd>retinal degeneration</kwd><kwd>retinal development</kwd><kwd>retinal metabolism</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009455</institution-id><institution>West Virginia University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Bridge Funding</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kolandaivelu</surname><given-names>Saravanan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RO1EY028959</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kolandaivelu</surname><given-names>Saravanan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>NMNAT1, a ubiquitously expressed metabolic enzyme linked to inherited blinding disease, is crucial for the proper differentiation of photoreceptor cells and subsequent survival of multiple cell types in the retina.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD<sup>+</sup>) is a ubiquitous cellular metabolite with a diverse palette of biological functions across all kingdoms of life. In addition to serving a central role in redox metabolism as an electron shuttle, NAD<sup>+</sup> has well-defined roles as a substrate for a host of enzymes including sirtuins (SIRTs), mono- and poly-ADP-ribose polymerases (PARPs), and NAD<sup>+</sup> glycohydrolases (CD38, CD157, and SARM1). Collectively, these roles implicate NAD<sup>+</sup> metabolism in phenomena as diverse as aging, cell proliferation, immunity, neurodegeneration, differentiation, and development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Houtkooper et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cantó et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Nikiforov et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cambronne and Kraus, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Navas and Carnero, 2021</xref>). A relatively recent advance in the field is the notion of compartmentalized NAD<sup>+</sup> metabolism—that regulation of NAD<sup>+</sup> in distinct subcellular compartments dictates function in diverse manners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cantó et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Nikiforov et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cambronne and Kraus, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Navas and Carnero, 2021</xref>). While many aspects of this compartmentalization remain to be explored, it is now known that spatiotemporal NAD<sup>+</sup> regulation plays prominent roles in processes including axon degeneration, circadian regulation, and adipogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cambronne and Kraus, 2020</xref>).</p><p>Among mammalian tissues, the retina appears particularly reliant on proper NAD<sup>+</sup> homeostasis for survival and function. This is suggested by associations between retinal NAD<sup>+</sup> deficiency and pathology in diverse models of retinal dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Williams et al., 2017</xref>) as well as multiple mutations to NAD<sup>+</sup>- or NADP<sup>+</sup>-utilizing enzymes which cause blindness in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bowne et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aleman et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bennett et al., 2020</xref>). Among these enzymes is nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferase-1 (NMNAT1), a highly conserved, nuclear-localized protein which catalyzes the adenylation of nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) or nicotinic acid mononucleotide (NaMN) to form NAD<sup>+</sup>, the convergent step of all mammalian NAD<sup>+</sup> biosynthetic pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Nikiforov et al., 2015</xref>). To date, over 30 NMNAT1 mutations have been linked to the severe blinding diseases Leber congenital amaurosis type 9 (LCA9) and related cone-rod dystrophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Perrault et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Falk et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chiang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Koenekoop et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Coppieters et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nash et al., 2018</xref>). Although NMNAT1 is ubiquitously expressed, and many of these mutations reduce NMNAT1 catalytic activity or stress-associated stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Falk et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Koenekoop et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sasaki et al., 2015</xref>), patients with these disorders rarely report extra-ocular phenotypes, a puzzling observation which is recapitulated by two LCA-NMNAT1 mutant mouse models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Greenwald et al., 2016</xref>). Further puzzling is the existence of two other NMNAT paralogs (Golgi-associated NMNAT2 and mitochondrial NMNAT3), which are detectable in the retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kuribayashi et al., 2018</xref>) but have not been linked to blindness. Importantly, while a crucial role for retinal NAD<sup>+</sup> was recently described through characterization of mice conditionally lacking the NAD<sup>+</sup> pathway enzyme NAMPT in photoreceptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lin et al., 2016</xref>), the significance of nuclear-synthesized NAD<sup>+</sup> in vision—suggested by the fact that NMNAT1 is the only NAD<sup>+</sup>-pathway enzyme to date linked to blindness—remains poorly understood.</p><p>Current results point to multiple, potentially distinct roles for NMNAT1 in the retina—ex vivo studies suggest that NMNAT1 supports sirtuin function to facilitate the survival of retinal progenitor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kuribayashi et al., 2018</xref>), while ablation of NMNAT1 in mature mice results in rapid death of photoreceptors mediated by the neurodegenerative NADase SARM1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sasaki et al., 2020b</xref>). Global deletion of NMNAT1 in mice is embryonically lethal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Conforti et al., 2011</xref>), suggesting non-redundant roles for nuclear NAD<sup>+</sup> synthesis during development. Consistent with this notion, pan-retinal NMNAT1 deletion is shown to cause rapid and severe retinal degeneration in mice shortly after birth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Eblimit et al., 2018</xref>). While these studies suggest diverse functions of retinal NMNAT1 beyond its canonical role in redox metabolism, the degree to which these functions overlap—as well as the mechanistic basis for the severity of NMNAT1-associated retinal dystrophy in animal models and patients—have not been comprehensively explored.</p><p>In this study, we investigate the roles of NMNAT1-mediated NAD<sup>+</sup> metabolism in the retina by generating and characterizing a retina-specific NMNAT1 knockout mouse model. Utilizing histological and transcriptomic approaches, we demonstrate that NMNAT1 deletion causes severe and progressive retinal degeneration affecting specific retinal cell types beyond photoreceptors, and that this severe degeneration likely results from activation of multiple distinct cell death pathways. Comprehensive metabolomics analysis reveals specific metabolic defects in NMNAT1 knockout retinas and suggests impaired central carbon, purine nucleotide, and amino acid metabolism as a cause for severe degeneration. Strikingly, RNA-sequencing reveals a collection of photoreceptor and synapse-specific genes which are downregulated in knockout retinas preceding degeneration. Immunostaining of several of these genes suggests severe impairment of photoreceptor terminal differentiation in the absence of NMNAT1. Overall, our results reveal a previously unappreciated complexity in NMNAT1-associated retinal degeneration, provide possible explanations for the retina-specific manifestations of NMNAT1 deficiency, and propose a yet-undescribed role for NMNAT1 in gene regulation during late-stage retinal development.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Generation and validation of NMNAT1 conditional knockout mouse model</title><p>To establish a retina-specific NMNAT1 knockout model, we crossed mice homozygous for a loxP-targeted <italic>Nmnat1</italic> locus (<italic>Nmnat1</italic><sup>flox/flox</sup>) with transgenic mice expressing Cre recombinase under a <italic>Six3</italic> promoter (<italic>Nmnat1</italic><sup>wt/wt</sup>;<italic>Six3-Cre</italic>), which is expressed throughout the retina at embryonic day 9.5 (E9.5) and shows robust activity by E12.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Furuta et al., 2000</xref>).

H&amp;E-stained retinal cross sections from P0 knockout and control mice reveal no obvious morphological differences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D and H</xref>); however, by P4, knockout retina are markedly thinner than controls and exhibit disrupted lamination and evidence of large-scale cell death in the inner and outer nuclear layers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Degeneration is most severe in the central retina, with a ~45% reduction in central retinal thickness (but unaffected peripheral retinal thickness) in P4 knockout mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>). By P10, knockouts show a ~62% reduction in central retinal thickness and ~27% reduction in peripheral retinal thickness compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>). Degeneration of the entire inner and outer nuclear layers is nearly complete by P30 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>), while remaining inner retinal structures persist until approximately P60 (data not shown). Proper segregation of inner and outer retinal neurons appears disrupted in P4 knockouts, but this segregation is established in P10 knockouts despite severe degeneration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Interestingly, formation of the outer plexiform layer (containing photoreceptor and bipolar neuron synaptic structures) appears disrupted in P4 and P10 knockout retinas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E and F</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>NMNAT1 loss affects survival of major inner retinal neurons</title><p>Histological examination suggests severe photoreceptor degeneration in NMNAT1 knockout retinas but also indicates loss of specific inner retinal neuron populations. To further characterize these effects, we quantified populations of several major inner retinal cell types in our knockout by staining retinal sections with well-characterized antibody markers: retinal ganglion cells were identified by labelling for brain-specific homeobox/POU domain protein 3A (BRN3A), amacrine cells by labeling for calretinin (CALR), horizontal cells by labeling for calbindin (CALB), and bipolar cells by labeling for Ceh-10 homeodomain-containing homolog (CHX10) (<bold>Key Resources Table</bold>). With the exception of calbindin, we performed this analysis at P4 and P10—representing early and late stages of degeneration, respectively—revealing an interesting cell-type-dependent sensitivity to NMNAT1 loss (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). At both tested ages, relative numbers of retinal ganglion cells are not significantly different between knockout and control retinas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–D and M</xref>), while numbers of amacrine cells are unchanged at P4 but reduced by ~51% (95% CI 36–65%) in P10 knockout retinas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E–H and O</xref>). Numbers of bipolar cells are similarly unchanged at P4 but reduced by ~75% (95% CI 62–85%) in P10 knockout retinas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I–L and P</xref>). In P0 knockout retinas—an age at which ganglion, amacrine, and bipolar cell numbers are unchanged (data not shown)—horizontal cell counts are reduced by ~36% (95% CI 18–53%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2N</xref>), and this trend persists in P4 knockout retinas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–B and N</xref>). These results identify retinal bipolar, horizontal, and amacrine neurons as targets of NMNAT1-associated pathology and suggest that horizontal and bipolar neurons are more sensitive to NMNAT1 loss than amacrine neurons. Interestingly, while retinal ganglion cells do eventually degenerate at timepoints past P30 (data not shown), they appear largely agnostic to NMNAT1 loss in the young postnatal retina.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>NMNAT1 loss affects retinal bipolar, horizontal and amacrine cells.</title><p>Representative retinal sections from knockout (-/-) and floxed littermate control (+/+) mice at the indicated ages labeled with antibodies against BRN3A (<bold>A-D, green</bold>), Calbindin (CALB) (<bold>A–B</bold>, magenta) Calretinin (CALR) (<bold>E–H</bold>)<italic>,</italic> and CHX10 (<bold>I–L</bold>).

At P4, this analysis reveals 2976 differentially expressed genes in NMNAT1 knockout retinas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B</xref>), several of which we validated using RT-qPCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1J</xref>). Consistent with the lack of recoverin and rhodopsin staining at this age, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) of P4 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) reveals several large, highly-overrepresented clusters of downregulated photoreceptor-related genes including both recoverin and rhodopsin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2C</xref>). Strikingly, among 815 DEGs in E18.5 knockout retinas, a similar cluster of downregulated genes associated with visual perception and the photoreceptor outer segment was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3B,C</xref>). Combining both RNA-sequencing datasets reveals a group of 365 DEGs in knockout retinas common to both timepoints (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3L</xref>). Importantly, GSEA on this gene set reveals highly overrepresented clusters of photoreceptor and synapse associated genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3M</xref>), and further analysis identifies a core set of 21 photoreceptor-associated genes which are significantly downregulated in E18.5 and P4 NMNAT1 knockout retinas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3N and O</xref>). Notably, this set includes rod-specific (e.g. <italic>Gngt1</italic>), cone-specific (e.g. <italic>Opn1sw</italic>, <italic>Cnga3</italic>) and photoreceptor-specific (e.g. <italic>Prph2</italic>, <italic>Rcvrn</italic>, <italic>Aipl1</italic>) genes of diverse function, many of which have important roles in photoreceptor development and function. Consistent with a specific transcriptional effect on photoreceptors, we confirmed that expression of several well-known ganglion cell, amacrine/horizontal cell, and bipolar cell-specific genes was largely unchanged in NMNAT1 knockout retinas at either tested age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>).</p><p>To further confirm the relevance of our RNA-sequencing results, we immunostained knockout and control retinas with several markers of developing cone photoreceptors: anti-phosducin (PDC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Rodgers et al., 2016</xref>), anti-M-opsin (OPN1MW), and peanut agglutinin (PNA), which labels developing cone outer segments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blanks and Johnson, 1984</xref>). While these markers showed normal cone accumulation and rudimentary outer segment formation in the OPL of P0 and P4 control retinas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E and G</xref>), P0 knockout retinas showed markedly reduced and widely dispersed phosducin-positive cones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>), and P4 knockouts demonstrated a near complete absence of M-opsin expression, mirroring recoverin and rhodopsin at this age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>). Accordingly, knockouts at both ages show significant attenuation of cone outer segment formation as determined by PNA staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F and H</xref>).</p><p>Due to the extent of photoreceptor-specific transcript and protein alterations in knockout retinas, we hypothesized that NMNAT1 is essential for photoreceptor terminal differentiation—the process by which partially committed retinal progenitors initiate photoreceptor-specific transcriptional and morphological programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Swaroop et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brzezinski and Reh, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Daum et al., 2017</xref>). To test this possibility, we probed knockout and control retinas with an antibody against OTX2, a well-characterized transcription factor necessary for photoreceptor terminal differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beby and Lamonerie, 2013</xref>). In P0 and P4 control retinas, OTX2 is enriched in developing photoreceptors in the ONL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and C</xref>, arrowheads) and in developing bipolar neurons in the INL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Consistent with our hypothesis, OTX-positive photoreceptors are absent in P0 knockout retinas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), and P4 knockout retinas display a striking expression of OTX2 throughout the ONL/INL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Finally, to determine whether impaired retinal progenitor proliferation may explain reduced photoreceptor numbers in knockouts, we assessed proliferation at P0 using the well-characterized marker phospho-histone H3 (PHH3), which labels M-phase cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Prigent and Dimitrov, 2003</xref>). This analysis revealed a slight but not significant decrease in PHH3-positive cells in P0 knockout retinas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>) Altogether, these results argue that NMNAT1 is crucial for terminal differentiation—but not early proliferation—of retinal photoreceptors and suggest photoreceptor-specific transcriptional dysregulation as a driver of the severe photoreceptor phenotype in NMNAT1-deficient retinas.</p><p>Beyond affecting photoreceptor-specific gene expression, we also note downregulation of 6 synapse-associated genes (<italic>Stx3</italic>, <italic>Syngr1</italic>, <italic>Cln3</italic>, <italic>Scamp5</italic>, and <italic>Sv2b</italic>) in both E18.5 and P4 knockout retinas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5C,D</xref>), consistent with disruptions to outer plexiform layer formation in P4 knockout retinas on histology and on staining with the synapse marker synaptophysin (anti-SYPH) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Loss of NMNAT1 during retinal development triggers multiple cell death pathways</title><p>As NMNAT1 deficiency drastically impairs the postnatal survival of photoreceptor, bipolar, horizontal, and amacrine retinal neurons, we sought to determine the mechanisms by which these cells degenerate. To this aim, we began by staining retinal sections with an antibody against activated caspase-3 (AC3). While P0 knockout retinas show little AC3 staining compared to controls—consistent with grossly normal retinal morphology at this age—P4 knockout retinas show robust AC3 immunoreactivity in the inner and outer nuclear layers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–D</xref>). As expected, most AC3-immunoreactive (AC3<sup>+</sup>) cells display nuclear chromatin condensation (‘pyknosis’) characteristic of dying cells; however, staining also revealed a population of pyknotic nuclei not immunoreactive to AC3 (AC3<sup>-</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A’–D’</xref><bold>, arrows</bold>). Interestingly, these pyknotic, AC3<sup>-</sup> nuclei were sparsely present in P0 and P4 control retinas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and C</xref>) and to a larger extent in P0 and P4 knockout retinas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B and D</xref>). Quantification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>) reveals a general trend of cell death consistent with our histology and cell-marker investigations: nuclear pyknosis is slightly elevated in P0 knockout retinas compared to controls, peaks at P4 where we observe robust retinal degeneration, and is virtually absent by P10, by which time the majority of outer and inner nuclei in the knockout are lost (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Interestingly, we observe roughly equal amounts of AC3<sup>+</sup> and AC3<sup>-</sup> pyknotic cells in P0 knockout retinas, whereas by P4 AC3<sup>-</sup> pyknotic cells constitute ~30% of pyknotic cells in knockout retinas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). In addition to being present at all tested ages and following the same general trend as AC3+ pyknotic cells, AC3<sup>-</sup> pyknotic cells often appear in distinct clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D'</xref>), distinguishable from the more evenly dispersed AC3<sup>+</sup> pyknotic cells. These results suggest the activation of at least two distinct cell death pathways in NMNAT1 knockout retinas between P0 and P4.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>NMNAT1 loss causes activation of multiple cell death pathways in the retina.</title><p>(<bold>A–D</bold>) Representative retinal sections from knockout (-/-) and floxed littermate control (+/+) mice at the indicated ages labelled with an antibody against active Caspase-3 (AC3).

In general, this phenotype is consistent with several recent studies reporting partial or complete ablation of retinal NMNAT1, which report gross retinal degeneration beginning within the first postnatal week and largely complete by one month of age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Eblimit et al., 2018</xref>). While the present study describes a relatively rapid timeline of NMNAT1-associated retinal degeneration, it furthers the characterization of this phenotype in two important ways: first, by assessing the survival of specific retinal neuron subtypes, and second, by systematically examining retinal cell death pathways triggered by NMNAT1 deletion.</p><p>Examination of specific cell types in NMNAT1 knockout retinas reveals that, while photoreceptors are likely the primary targets of NMNAT1-associated pathology, retinal bipolar, horizontal, and amacrine cells are also significantly affected by loss of NMNAT1 during retinal development, while ganglion cells appear unaffected until later stages. In particular, our results indicate an important distinction between the sensitivity of photoreceptor and non-photoreceptor neurons to NMNAT1 loss: while photoreceptors demonstrate an early and sustained transcriptional downregulation of cell-type-specific genes, near complete abrogation of recoverin and opsin expression, and rapid degeneration, non-photoreceptor cell types show largely unchanged transcriptional signatures, persistent cell-type marker expression, and a more gradual degeneration in NMNAT1 knockout retinas. These results stand partially in contrast to a recent study reporting ex vivo knockdown of <italic>Nmnat1</italic> in retinal explant cultures, which reported thinner INLs but no changes in numbers of HuC/D-expressing amacrine cells or PKCa-expressing bipolar cells in NMNAT1-deficient explants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kuribayashi et al., 2018</xref>). However, this study did report reduced numbers of PNR-positive photoreceptor cells in NMNAT1-deficient explants, and differences may be explained by the fact that <italic>Nmnat1</italic> expression in explants was knocked down relatively late in development (E17.5)—by which time many non-photoreceptor cell types have already differentiated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cepko, 2014</xref>). Alternatively, the relative persistence of non-photoreceptor cells in our model may indicate that degeneration of bipolar, horizontal, and amacrine neurons is a secondary effect of massive photoreceptor death, a possibility potentially supported by evidence of INL degeneration in a photoreceptor-specific NMNAT1 knockout mouse model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wang et al., 2017</xref>). The generation and characterization of retinal cell-type-specific NMNAT1 knockout models is warranted to examine whether this differential sensitivity to NMNAT1 loss is cell-autonomous.</p><p>While we were unable to successfully determine retinal NMNAT1 distribution using our polyclonal NMNAT1 antibody, previously published results showing RT-qPCR of <italic>Nmnat</italic> levels in flow-sorted rod photoreceptors suggest that NMNAT1 is the predominantly expressed NMNAT enzyme in rod photoreceptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kuribayashi et al., 2018</xref>).

Recent results in a mutant NMNAT1 mouse model indicating relative depletion of NAD<sup>+</sup> in the retina but not other tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Greenwald et al., 2021</xref>) are perhaps consistent with such a hypothesis.

Using histological and comprehensive transcriptomic approaches, we demonstrate involvement of caspase-3 associated apoptosis in NMNAT1 knockout retinas characterized by an early and sustained upregulation of <italic>Noxa</italic> and deregulation of several other apoptosis-pathway genes. We extend these results by showing histological evidence of a distinct, caspase-3-independent cell death pathway which constitutes a significant portion of observed cell death and closely follows caspase-3-dependent apoptosis throughout the timepoints tested in our model.</p><p>Interestingly, using a recently validated metabolic marker of SARM1 activity (cADPR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sasaki et al., 2020a</xref>), we do not detect SARM1 involvement at pre- or post-degenerative timepoints in our model.

Indeed, many apoptosis effectors (<italic>Casp3</italic>, <italic>Casp9</italic>, <italic>Apaf1</italic>, <italic>Bcl</italic> family members) active in the developing mammalian retina are subsequently downregulated in mature retinas, necessitating alternative death pathways for handling pathological insults at these ages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Donovan and Cotter, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Doonan et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Donovan et al., 2006</xref>). Considering these results, it is wholly possible that in mature retinas with insufficient expression of necessary apoptotic and/or pyroptotic machinery, NMNAT1-associated retinal degeneration proceeds through SARM1—in such a case, it is important to note that model systems with embryonic or germline deletion or mutation of NMNAT1 are typically more representative of patients with disease-linked mutations in NMNAT1. On the other hand, it cannot be conclusively ruled out that excess cADPR produced by an active SARM1 in our model is rapidly metabolized, and recently described links between SARM1 and both pyroptosis and apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mukherjee et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Carty et al., 2019</xref>) leave open the possibility of cooperation between these cell death pathways in NMNAT1 knockout retinas.</p><p>Our transcriptomics results indicate dysregulation of several pyroptosis and necroptosis-related genes, notably including the entire ‘canonical inflammasome’ (<italic>Casp1</italic>, <italic>Nlrp3</italic>, and <italic>Pycard</italic>), as well as the toll-like receptors <italic>Tlr2</italic> and <italic>Tlr4</italic>, at both timepoints (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).

Intriguingly, we do not detect proteolytic cleavage of gasdermin D—a common marker of pyroptosis—in P4 NMNAT1 knockout retinas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). However, recent results indicate that NLRP3 is, under certain circumstances, capable of being activated independently of gasdermin D (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gutierrez et al., 2017</xref>). Considering a recent report suggesting involvement of the PARP1-associated ‘parthanatos’ cell death pathway in NMNAT1 mutant retinas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Greenwald et al., 2021</xref>), we did not detect accumulation of poly ADP-ribose (PAR) in AC3<sup>—</sup> pyknotic nuclei (data not shown), arguing against involvement of this pathway under these conditions.</p><p>In sum, we show that retinal NMNAT1 loss activates multiple cell death pathways, which contextualizes the degeneration of multiple cell types in our model and may explain the severity of NMNAT1-associated retinal degeneration in this study and others.

Our metabolomics results approximate that NMNAT1 synthesizes ~40% of the total retinal NAD<sup>+</sup> pool, which is generally consistent with a previous model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sasaki et al., 2020b</xref>). In addition, our results strongly suggest that—via specific disruptions to central carbon, nucleotide, and amino acid metabolism—depletion of NAD<sup>+</sup> synthesized in the nucleus disrupts multiple non-nuclear metabolic pathways in the retina. Whether these observations reflect a direct export of nuclear NAD<sup>+</sup> to cytosolic and mitochondrial retinal compartments versus an indirect effect on cytosolic and mitochondrial cellular processes (by way of NAD<sup>+</sup>-dependent gene regulation, for instance) is a topic for further study.</p><p>Impaired glycolytic flux appears to be a more general feature of tissue NAD<sup>+</sup> depletion, as studies reporting NAMPT inhibition or deletion in projection neurons and skeletal muscle myotubes report accumulation of glycolytic metabolites upstream of GAPDH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Oakey et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lundt et al., 2021</xref>). Interestingly, Lundt et al. present evidence of reversed glycolytic flux in NAMPT-inhibited myotubes, an effect which we believe may explain decreased levels of G3P and DHAP in our model. Notably, unbiased LC-MS/MS and GC-MS analyses of rod-photoreceptor-specific NAMPT knockout retinas showed signatures of mitochondrial metabolic defects—which we observe in our model as well—but detected limited evidence of glycolytic impairment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lin et al., 2016</xref>). This suggests that retinal NMNAT1 and NAMPT depletion, despite both lowering total retinal NAD<sup>+</sup> levels, produce distinct metabolic phenotypes.</p><p>Retinal neurons—and retinal photoreceptors in particular—are relatively unique in their dependence on aerobic glycolysis (the ‘Warburg Effect’) during both proliferative and differentiated states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agathocleous et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ng et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chinchore et al., 2017</xref>).

On the other hand, we also identify a collection of metabolic changes in these pathways which are not reported in NAMPT-deficient retinas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lin et al., 2016</xref>), potentially explaining differences in retinal phenotypes between these two models.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>A potential role for NMNAT1 in photoreceptor terminal differentiation</title><p>The tightly coordinated and stereotypical differentiation of retinal neuron subtypes from a common progenitor pool has been extensively studied—complementing classical birth-dating studies, recent investigations have begun to explore the massive epigenetic regulation necessary for the development of the mammalian retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Swaroop et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aldiri et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Raeisossadati et al., 2021</xref>). One of the most surprising findings of the present study is an early and sustained transcriptional downregulation of a subset of photoreceptor- and synapse-specific genes in NMNAT1 knockout retinas. Beyond these transcriptional disruptions, we show near complete absence of several crucial rod and cone-specific proteins in P4 knockout retinas, as well as early and sustained mis-expression of OTX2—a crucial differentiation factor—in the absence of NMNAT1. While NMNAT1 has previously been implicated in gene regulation through direct interaction with SIRT1 and PARP1 at gene promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Song et al., 2013</xref>) and retinal NMNAT1 knockdown was shown to influence apoptotic gene expression by potentially modulating histone acetylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kuribayashi et al., 2018</xref>), no in vivo role for NMNAT1 in retinal developmental gene regulation has yet been described.</p><p>Photoreceptors are among the last retinal cell types to fully develop and are generated in two broad phases: an early cell-fate commitment mediated by several well-characterized transcription factors including NOTCH1, PAX6, and SIX3, and a later phase (‘terminal differentiation’) comprising expression of a host of specialized phototransduction genes and growth of light-sensing cellular structures, mediated in part by the transcription factors OTX2, NRL, and CRX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Swaroop et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brzezinski and Reh, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Daum et al., 2017</xref>). Interestingly, we do not observe transcriptional changes in NOTCH1, PAX6, SIX3, or related genes in NMNAT1 knockout retinas at E18.5. This fact, combined with grossly normal retinal morphology and comparable numbers of PHH3-positive proliferating cells in P0 knockouts, suggests that NMNAT1 is required for terminal differentiation but not early specification or proliferation of retinal photoreceptor cells. Increased abundance of acetyl-lysine in knockout retinas on mass spectrometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2B</xref>) and GO enrichment of several genes associated with DNA methylation, epigenetic regulation, and chromatin silencing in P4 knockout retinas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>) support a potential role for NMNAT1 in the epigenetic regulation of photoreceptor terminal differentiation, a phenomenon recently shown to feature genome-wide methylation, demethylation, and acetylation events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aldiri et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Seritrakul and Gross, 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rhee et al., 2012</xref>). Importantly, although cell markers for bipolar, horizontal, and amacrine retinal neurons suggest proper specification and rapid degeneration of these cells in NMNAT1 knockouts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), more extensive studies focusing on early specification markers are needed before a role for NMNAT1 in the differentiation of these cell types can be ruled out.</p><p>In conclusion, this study presents a comprehensive evaluation of NMNAT1-associated retinal dysfunction and suggests crucial roles for nuclear NAD<sup>+</sup> in the proper development of the mammalian retina. Extending previous results, we demonstrate that retinal NMNAT1 loss during development affects retinal cell types beyond photoreceptors, and we propose a yet-undescribed role for NMNAT1 in photoreceptor terminal differentiation and subsequent survival. While we provide evidence that the early and severe retinal degeneration associated with NMNAT1 loss involves multiple cell types and death pathways, it appears that this severe phenotype stems from two major problems: (1.) metabolic defects likely caused by insufficient NAD<sup>+</sup> for retinal proliferative metabolism, and (2.) gene regulation defects potentially caused by insufficient nuclear NAD<sup>+</sup> in developing photoreceptors. Considering links between metabolic state and differentiation in the retina and recently discovered roles of compartmentalized NAD<sup>+</sup> in non-retinal cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agathocleous et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Agathocleous and Harris, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ryu et al., 2018</xref>), these two problems may not be mutually exclusive. Further study of NMNAT1-associated retinal dysfunction should focus on evaluating the relative contributions of metabolic and genetic deficits to the overall pathology and testing the hypothesis that NMNAT1 functions to integrate energy metabolism and gene regulation, both in the retina and in other cellular contexts.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and

Subsequently, eyes were washed in 1 X PBS and incubated in a dehydration solution (20% sucrose in 1 X PBS) for at least 12 hr at 4 °C. After dehydration, samples were incubated in a 1:1 mixture of 20% sucrose and Tissue-Tek O.C.T. compound (Sakura Finetek, Torrance, CA) for at least 1 hr before being transferred to 100% O.C.T. and flash frozen. 16 µm sections were cut using a Leica CM1850 cryostat (Leica Biosystems, Nussloch, Germany) and mounted on Superfrost Plus slides (Fisher Scientific). For immunofluorescent staining, retinal sections were briefly rinsed with 1 X PBS and incubated in blocking buffer (10% normal goat serum, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.05% sodium azide in 1 X PBS) for 1 hr at room temperature. Following blocking, sections were incubated with the indicated primary antibodies (diluted in buffer containing 5% normal goat serum, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.05% sodium azide in 1 X PBS) overnight at 4 °C. The next day, sections were washed with 1 X PBST and incubated with DAPI nuclear stain (Thermo Fisher Scientific), goat anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor-568 and/or goat anti-mouse Alexa Fluor-488 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) secondary antibodies for 1 hr at room temperature. For antibody information and dilutions, see the <bold>Key Resources Table</bold>. Finally, sections were washed, cover-slipped with Prolong Gold antifade reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and imaged on a Nikon Eclipse Ti laser scanning confocal microscope with C2 camera (Nikon Instruments). Experimental and control sections were imaged using identical laser intensity and exposure settings. All fluorescent images represent maximum intensity z-projections generated using ImageJ with the Bio-Formats plugin (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://imagej.net/Bio-Formats">https://imagej.net/Bio-Formats</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Retinal cell type and caspase-positive cell quantification</title><p>To estimate numbers of pyknotic and caspase-3 positive/negative cells in retinas of knockout and control mice, pyknotic nuclei were manually counted in 212.27 × 212.27 µm<sup>2</sup> regions of maximum intensity projection fluorescent images from the central retina. Once these pyknotic nuclei were identified, the number also labeled with active-Caspase-3 were manually counted. Counts from two technical replicates per animal were averaged, and averages from three animals per genotype are reported. Counts of retinal cell subtypes were estimated by manually counting marker-positive cells in 318.2 × 318.2 µm<sup>2</sup> regions of central retina, averaged between two technical replicates per animal and three animals per genotype. All counts were obtained using ImageJ.

Total RNA was extracted by homogenizing thawed samples with a handheld homogenizer and incubating for 5 min at room temperature. 20 µl chloroform was added to each sample, samples were briefly vortexed, incubated at room temperature for 4 min, and spun at 12,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. The aqueous layers were removed to separate tubes containing 50 µl isopropanol and incubated at room temperature for 10 min with occasional agitation. Finally, samples were again spun at 12,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C, supernatants were removed, and pellets were washed three times with 75% ethanol, dried, and resuspended in DEPC-treated water. Whole-transcriptome sequencing was performed by Macrogen Corp. (Macrogen USA, Rockville, MD) using an Illumina TruSeq Stranded mRNA Library Prep Kit on a NovaSeq6000 S4 to a depth of 100 M total reads per sample. Read quality was verified using FastQC (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/">https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/</ext-link>) and adapters were trimmed using the Bbduk utility of the BBTools package (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/bbmap/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/bbmap/</ext-link>).

Metabolite extracts were analyzed by a Shimadzu LC Nexera X2 UHPLC coupled with a QTRAP 5500 LC-MS/MS (AB Sciex). An ACQUITY UPLC BEH Amide analytic column (2.1 × 50 mm, 1.7 μm) (Waters Corp., Milford, MA) was used for chromatographic separation. The mobile phase was (A) water with 10 mM ammonium acetate (pH 8.9) and (B) acetonitrile/water (95/5) with 10 mM ammonium acetate (pH 8.2) (All solvents were LC–MS Optima grade from Fisher Scientific). The total run time was 11 min with a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min and an injection volume of 5 μl. The gradient elution was 95–61% B in 6 min, 61–44% B at 8 min, 61–27% B at 8.2 min, and 27–95% B at 9 min. The column was equilibrated with 95% B at the end of each run. The source and collision gas was N<sub>2</sub>. The ion source conditions in positive and negative mode were: curtain gas (CUR) = 25 psi, collision gas (CAD) = high, ion spray voltage (IS) = 3800/–3800 volts, temperature (TEM) = 500 °C, ion source gas 1 (GS1) = 50 psi, and ion source gas 2 (GS2) = 40 psi. Each metabolite was tuned with standards for optimal transitions. D4-nicotinamide (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Tewksbury, MA) was used as an internal standard. The extracted MRM peaks were integrated using MultiQuant 3.0.3 software (AB Sciex, Concord, ON, CA).

The study not only shows NMNAT1 is involved in photoreceptor terminal differentiation but also provides evidence that the survival of other cell types depends on this enzyme. It also shows that NMNAT1 deficiency leads to the activation of different cell death pathways and causes metabolic defects in retinal cells.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Marianne Bronner as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors need to experimentally address the potential role of NMNAT1 in retinal progenitor differentiation, with especial consideration of amacrine, photoreceptor and bipolar progenitors. The reviewers share the opinion that the data presented in the manuscript could be the result of defective specification/differentiation and not only linked to degeneration as the authors claim. Thus, staining for progenitor markers and proliferation antigens at embryonic and postnatal stages is required. Any other approach aimed at addressing this issue will be equally valid.</p><p>2) Analysis of cone, amacrine and Müller cell specification/differentiation should also be included as morphological and RNA-seq data suggests possible decrease of their specification/differentiation.</p><p>3) A better description of the knockout efficiency with the Cre-lox system used and its comparison with those used in the other studies to investigate NMNAT1 requirement in the retina is needed.</p><p>4) Statistical analysis of the data should be revised in Figure 1 and added in Figure 5.</p><p>5) A number of different studies have used similar approaches (retina-specific NMNAT1 KO or KD, transcriptomics, and metabolomics) to shed light on NMNAT1 function in the retina. The authors need to clarify what are the knowledge gaps they are trying to fill in and should discuss better their findings in relation to the existing data (i.e. in relation to those of Eblimit et al., 2018 and Kuribayashi et al., 2018).</p><p>6) The authors may also consider rescuing the phenotype of the CKO retina by the administration of NAD or NMN, if experimentally feasible.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>Mutations in the gene nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferase-1 (NMNAT1) causes a specific type of severe and early onset retinal degeneration known as Leber congenital amaurosis type 9. By conditional inactivating the NMNAT1 gene in the mouse eye bud, this study extends on previous reports showing that NMNAT1 is required for postnatal survival of photoreceptors and specific retinal interneurons. Using transcriptomic and metabolomic approaches, the authors provide novel evidence that retinal degeneration is linked to the disruption of carbon, purine and amino acid metabolism and to the activation of distinct cell death pathways, including apoptosis, pyroptosis and necroptosis.</p><p>Although well conducted the study does not consider the possible role of NMNAT1 in retinal progenitor differentiation. This is an important point because the phenotypic characterization of the retina at postnatal development suggest that possibility that amacrine, photoreceptor and bipolar cells might be generated in lower number besides undergoing later degeneration. This point needs to be addressed. Furthermore, the authors fell short of discussing in the details their data in comparison with those of Eblimit et al., 2018, who have use different Cre line to delete NMNAT1 at slightly later stages of development or only in photoreceptors.</p><p>Figure 2. When comparing the number of amacrine and bipolar cells in the control groups, it is clear that both populations undergo an increase in size between P4 and P10. The same comparison in the mutants indeed suggest that bipolar cells degenerate and are lost. However, the number of amacrine cells at P10 is similar to that at P4. The authors conclude that there is also degeneration of amacrine cells but an alternative possibility is that cells are no longer generated and thus the population does not expand as in controls.</p><p>The HandE staining in Figure 1F seems to indicate the presence of cells in the ONL, presumably photoreceptor nuclei that however are strongly decreases at P30. The data in Figure 3 and the related supplementary information indicate a strong decrease of photoreceptor specific-gene expression. Again, the author conclusion is that NMNAT1 is required for postnatal survival of photoreceptors. Although it is clear that part of the phenotype is linked to the activation of cell death pathways, the authors should also consider the possibility that NMNAT1 may be also required for the generation of a proper number of photoreceptors. This needs to be determined. Markers such as Otx2 or Crx could be used to determine if the same number of photoreceptors are generated and then die perhaps because they cannot terminally differentiate or they are simply not generated in the same amount, as it may also happen for amacrine and even bipolar cells. This is particularly important because the Six3-Cre is an early driver and thus NMNAT1 absence could affect progenitor cells. Furthremore, the authors state &quot;In conclusion, this study presents the most comprehensive evaluation of NMNAT1-associated retinal dysfunction to date and suggests crucial roles for nuclear NAD+ in the proper development and early survival of the mammalian retina&quot;. This conclusion at the moment is an overstatement as the development function of NMNAT1 is not addressed.</p><p>The idea that there might be an impact on progenitors is possibly supported by comparing the present results with those obtained by Eblimit et al., 2018 as well as those by Kuribayashi et al., 2018. In both cases knock down of NMNAT1 occurred with a different timing that correlated with less severe phenotypes.</p><p>The authors should also consider discussing their results with those of Eblimit et al., 2018 in more details, given that in the latter the reported use of photoreceptor-specific drivers suggests that reduction of the INL might be secondary to the loss of photoreceptors.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>NMNAT1 is known to be causal to Laber congenital amaurosis (LCA) which is congenital retinal dystrophies that appears at an early age. In this paper, the authors aimed to reveal the roles of Nmnat1 in retinal development by using retina specific conditional knockout mice. Interestingly, the loss of Nmnat1 by Six3-cre resulted in severe perturbation of the retinal development. The authors claimed the degeneration of the photoreceptors, but the results suggested lack of rod differentiation rather than degeneration since no evidence showing rod differentiation in the mice was included. In contrast, interneurons were once differentiated, then disappeared in the postnatal period. Since the special expression pattern of Cre or NMNAT1 in the retina was not available, it made difficult to relate the complex and cell type specific phenotype and Nmnat1. There are several other papers examining the role of Nmnat1 in retinal development in in vitro and ex vivo, precise comparison of the methods and data among the works may give interesting insight.</p><p>This paper describes examination of retinal phenotype of Nmnat1 by using retina specific knockout mice of Nmnat1. The paper contains the results of variety of analyses i.e. histological analysis, transcriptome analysis, and metabolic pathway examination. However, the whole part of this manuscript is descriptive, and did not give mechanisms how NMNAT1 regulates retinal differentiation. The authors claim that the severe photoreceptor degeneration was observed in this mice; however, I think that the phenotype showed lack of rod photoreceptor differentiation but not degeneration.</p><p>1. The Six3-cre mouse was used in this work, but this mouse line is known to show chimeric expression pattern of cre in the retina. i.e. &quot;More detailed analysis of the recombination pattern of Six3-cre in the mature retina suggested it may incompletely excise target genes of interest. JNS 2007, 27, 12707-.&quot;. The authors observed strong phenotype in the central retina but not in the peripheral. Does it correlate with the expression pattern of the Cre protein? They should examine spatial expression of Cre or Nmnat1 in the CKO in retinas of several different developmental stages.</p><p>2. They did not perform any detailed examination of the retinal progenitor cells. Staining of progenitor markers and proliferation antigens of embryonic as well as P0 to P4 retinas may give useful information to understand the phenotype.</p><p>3. The authors claims that they observed photoreceptor degeneration, and NMNAT1 is crucial for the early survival of photoreceptors. If the authors observe the transition of rod photoreceptor that is once differentiation and then disappearance of them, this statement is appropriate. However, since neither Rhodopsin nor Recoverin expressed in the P4 retina, I think that failure of rod differentiation is suitable description to account for this phenotype.</p><p>4. RNA-seq data showed decreased cone related genes. The authors should confirm differentiation of cone in embryonic as well as postnatal retina of the CKO mice.</p><p>5. The retina at P4 showed no OPL, and previous literature indicated that the OPL is established by the interaction of photoreceptor and horizontal cells. Is horizontal cell differentiate in the CKO retina? In addition, how about Mueller glia differentiation in the CKO retina?</p><p>6. The authors observed lack of Synaptophysin, and I wondered postsynaptic formation of horizontal and bipolar cells.</p><p>7. Figure 1D lacks the scale bar, and that made us difficult to examine the panels.</p><p>6. Is it possible to rescue the phenotype of the CKO retina by administration of NAD or NMN locally or systemically?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The authors aimed to disentangle the peculiar and complex aspects of NMNAT1-dependent retinal degeneration, with a particular focus on the underlying metabolic and transcriptional changes, used to hypothesize a mechanistic scenario explaining the pathophysiological picture associated with mutations at this locus. Overall, the paper is very well written and logical and provides a very comprehensive analysis spanning from detailed phenotypic analysis to metabolomics and transcriptomics approaches. This is definitely the major strength of the paper: experimental comprehensiveness and multilevel analysis. Using this approach, in general, the authors managed to provide interesting insights on the putative mechanistic scenario on the basis of the retinal degeneration caused by NAD+ and NMNAT1 deficiencies. Moreover, the cell-specific analysis provided also brings value and specificity to the study. Although the aim was obviously ambitious, the results provided well support most of their conclusions. In spite of this, I do have a major concern about the paper submitted. In general, the authors cite several papers with overlapping data/approaches to those proposed in the submitted manuscript (i.e. Lin et al., 2016, Greenwald et al., 2021, Wang et al., 2017, Lundt et al., 2021; Kuribayashi et al., 2018, Sasaki et al., 2020b). I understand that this is a hot topic in the field, that converging data is understandable, and that independent studies providing similar results are an extraordinary opportunity to validate the strength of the findings. However, I would encourage the authors to better state/define what differentiates some of their findings from those reported in the mentioned papers which used both retina or photoreceptor-specific NMNAT1 ablation, as well as metabolomic and transcriptional profiling of such transgenic animals. Although the authors use a very logical and comprehensive approach (and did a great job in presenting their findings with clarity), in several parts I kind of struggled a bit in recognizing the novelty of what they are bringing, and which kind of knowledge gaps they aim to fill, beyond the rhetoric of scientific writing.</p><p>A second aspect I would like to point out concerns the conclusions drawn by the authors concerning the different sensitivity of the distinct cell populations to the altered NAD+ homeostasis/NMNAT1 knockdown. It is well possible that amacrine, photoreceptor, bipolar cells, and RGCs respond differently to the tested conditions. However, it is also possible that photoreceptor cell degeneration (which occurs relatively early) represents also a cause of the later impairments in the other cell populations, affecting in turn their survival. Definitely, photoreceptors are, among the mentioned cells, those where altered REDOX chemistry (where NAD+ plays a crucial role) can have a bigger impact. I think that in the model proposed, it is not very clear why, the other cell types are affected as well, although later (even at P30 for RGCs). In other words, can we be sure that the degeneration observed in the different cell populations is actually cell-autonomous and not the result of a malfunctioning of one of the cell types? Are the effects on later cell types specific or just a consequence of the earlier impairment in photoreceptors? Maybe the authors could comment on this.</p><p>– Line 60: I found it interesting that retinas are particularly sensitive to NAD+ metabolism perturbations. Although the authors provide several examples in the literature, I would ask them to further comment (also in the paper) on why this tissue should be particularly reliant on NAD+ metabolism compared to the others (that to my knowledge should require a fine-tuned NAD+ homeostasis as well), also considering what they state in lines 71-75.</p><p>– Line 76: The authors define the other NMNAT as isoforms, but they are actually different genes, so I would define them as &quot;other NMNAT genes&quot;, or, in case something is known about their phylogeny, use the more appropriate term paralogs (as I assume they are the results of vertebrate genome duplications).</p><p>– Line 123: what is the general range of knockout efficiency with the Cre-lox system, and what was the efficiency in the other papers that used a similar strategy to investigate NMNAT1 (see above). Can this explain some inconsistencies with some of the other studies?</p><p>– In Figure 1 legend it is not clear how many animals have been used as biological replicates (Figure 1C-J).</p><p>– Figure 1B: t-test is often accepted with 3 biological replicates, yet, theoretically, to assume a normal distribution you need more than 3 datapoints, so I would suggest a Mann-Whitney test (same applies to Figure 2, Figure 4E, J and supplementary figures using t-test, like Figure S3C, Figure S4E).</p><p>– Figure 1H-J: It is not possible in this case to use a t-test, as you would need anyway to correct for multiple comparisons even if you are interested in the KO vs wt comparison at a single specific distance. In this case, the authors should use an ANOVA or, given the consideration above (t-test vs Mann-Whitney test), with a non-parametric equivalent, like Kruskal-Wallis (in both cases corrected for multiple comparisons, as the more comparisons you are interested in, the more likely is to find something significant).</p><p>– Line 156: In this section, some % are given, yet it is not clear how many animals have been used to calculate such numbers. Did the authors use only one animal per timepoint? Even without statistical constraints (this is not the goal here), I would suggest at least 2-3 specimens.</p><p>– Line 332: not necroptosis as well? (See lines 218-221)</p><p>– As far as I see, no statistical analysis has been performed for Figure 5C, E, H. Is there a valuable and specific reason? If not, I would include a statistical significance assessment.</p><p>– Lines 445-452: I am not fully convinced by the explanation concerning the contrasting evidence between the manuscript and Kuribayashi et al., 2018. The current study reports defects in amacrine and bipolar cells in relatively later stages, so I am not sure whether an earlier knockdown can explain these discrepancies.</p><p>– Line 606: although I recognize this study as very well done and comprehensive, I do not think that the authors themselves should define their manuscript as the most… I suggest they change &quot;the most… to date&quot; with &quot;a&quot;. I also would like to remember the authors that yes, their study might be the most comprehensive, but they largely base their study on a plethora of studies using very similar approaches and providing similar advancements in the field.</p><p>– Especially for scientists from different fields, I would spend few words explaining the relationships between the different cell types mentioned (how they are contributing to retinal development and vision, for instance).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.71185.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors need to experimentally address the potential role of NMNAT1 in retinal progenitor differentiation, with especial consideration of amacrine, photoreceptor and bipolar progenitors. The reviewers share the opinion that the data presented in the manuscript could be the result of defective specification/differentiation and not only linked to degeneration as the authors claim. Thus, staining for progenitor markers and proliferation antigens at embryonic and postnatal stages is required. Any other approach aimed at addressing this issue will be equally valid.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for raising this important distinction—in response, we have considerably expanded Figures 2 and 3 to include staining for several proliferation and progenitor markers in ages preceding and succeeding gross retinal degeneration in our model. Phosphorylated histone H3 (Figure 3—Supplement 1), a marker for M phase cells (Prigent and Dimitrov, 2003), Phosducin (Figure 3), a marker of developing cone photoreceptors (Rodgers et al., 2016), and OTX2, a regulator of photoreceptor and bipolar cell terminal differentiation (Beby and Lamonerie, 2013) (Figure 3) reveal severe defects in photoreceptor terminal differentiation but only modest reductions in progenitor proliferation in NMNAT1 knockout retinas. In addition to Phosducin, we examined cone specification in our model using anti-M-opsin and peanut agglutinin (PNA), a lectin which labels developing cone outer segments (Blanks and Johnson). At P4, this suggests cone specification defects equal in magnitude to rod specification defects (which we demonstrated by staining for rhodopsin and recoverin) in knockouts.</p><p>With regards to bipolar cell specification, several attempts at checking the expression of MASH1 a supposed bipolar differentiation marker (Hatakeyama and Kageyama, 2004) and PKC-α (a well-characterized marker of mature bipolar cells) were unsuccessful—the former due to antibody issues, and the latter since PKCa in our model is not detectable until later ages, at which point knockout retinas are nearly completely degenerated. While NMNAT1 may play a role in the terminal differentiation of retinal bipolar cells (supported perhaps by aforementioned OTX2 misexpression in knockouts), we note that CHX10 is involved in bipolar cell differentiation (Hatakeyama and Kageyama, 2004) The fact that we observe equal amounts of CHX10-positive cells in P4 knockout retinas—an age at which we report complete abrogation of M-opsin, rhodopsin, and recoverin expression—suggests that any potential effects of NMNAT1 loss on bipolar specification are at least less severe than those observed for photoreceptor terminal differentiation. We note also that levels of <italic>Mash1</italic> and its partner <italic>Math3</italic> are unchanged in our P4 RNA-sequencing dataset, and <italic>Mash1</italic> is similarly unchanged in E18.5 knockouts.</p><p>While we were unable to specifically probe amacrine cell specification, we have added staining for calbindin, which labels both horizontal and amacrine neurons (Wassle et al., 1998). At P4, quantification of calbindin-positive amacrine cells (identified by their location proximal to the inner plexiform layer) shows no significant change in amacrine cell numbers in knockouts, mirroring our Calretinin analyses. Classical and contemporary birth-dating studies (Cepko, 2014; Cherry et al., 2009; Voinescue et al., 2009) indicate that the vast majority of retinal amacrine cells area born well before P4—an age at which we report no change in calbindin or calretinin-positive amacrine cells in NMNAT1 knockouts. Thus, while we detect an increase in calretinin-positive amacrine cells in wild-type controls between P4 and P10, this observation likely reflects calretinin expression and not amacrine cell specification. For these reasons, we consider it unlikely that NMNAT1 influences amacrine cell differentiation; however, since we have not conclusively ruled out this possibility, we have included a brief discussion of this matter in the main text. A more exhaustive examination of amacrine cell specification in NMNAT1 knockout retinas presents a potential future avenue of study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Analysis of cone, amacrine and Müller cell specification/differentiation should also be included as morphological and RNA-seq data suggests possible decrease of their specification/differentiation.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for the motivation to examine cone terminal differentiation using the aforementioned Phosducin and M-opsin/PNA stains, which revealed severe defects in cone specification in NMNAT1 knockout retinas. Müller glia are among the latest-born retinal cell types (Cepko 2014), and in our wild-type controls are only detectable on staining after ~P8, by which time there is considerable degeneration in knockout retinas. Thus, we do not consider our pan-retinal knockout model to be particularly informative for identifying a role for NMNAT1 in Müller glia development—perhaps a glia-specific NMNAT1 knockout would be better suited for this question.</p><p>We would like to stress that we do not claim that NMNAT1 functions only in the terminal differentiation of photoreceptors. Rather, we attempt to draw a distinction between the phenotypes we observe in photoreceptor cells (early transcriptional reduction in a cluster of visual transduction genes, complete abrogation of opsin and recoverin expression, rapid degeneration) versus non-photoreceptor cells (largely unchanged transcriptional signatures, persistence of cell-type markers, delayed degeneration). We use this distinction to (1.) demonstrate that NMNAT1 loss during retinal development affects cell types beyond photoreceptors, and (2.) propose an especially salient role for NMNAT1 in photoreceptor terminal differentiation, a role which has not to this point been described. We have revised the main text to make this intent clearer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) A better description of the knockout efficiency with the Cre-lox system used and its comparison with those used in the other studies to investigate NMNAT1 requirement in the retina is needed.</p></disp-quote><p>We have included a comparison of our knockout efficiency with that of (Sasaki et al., 2020a) in the main text. Unfortunately, we were unable to accurately determine the knockout efficiencies of the models presented in Wang et al., or Eblimit et al., —the former because the publication does not include this information and the latter because only a non-quantitative immunofluorescent image was provided to demonstrate NMNAT1 knockout. We do note, however, that the <italic>Six3-Cre</italic> mice used in our study have previously been validated by crossing with a transgenic Cre reporter line, which showed uniform <italic>Six3-Cre</italic> expression throughout the retina (Christiansen et al.,). However, the reviewers raise an important point considering potentially lower <italic>Six3-Cre</italic> expression in the peripheral retina—for this reason, we focus our analyses on the central retina and do not believe this possibility to influence the validity of our findings.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Statistical analysis of the data should be revised in Figure 1 and added in Figure 5.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate these comments and apologize for any confusion regarding statistics in Figure 5—we had intended the color coding of the bars to denote significance, opting against including asterisks above the bars for fear that they would be misinterpreted as data points. To make this color coding clearer, we have emphasized the color legend and added a brief comment to the figure legend. We also added asterisks to denote significance in the heatmap in Figure 5G. With regards to using non-parametric significance tests in Figure 1, we have replaced the analysis in Figure 1B with a Mann-Whitney U test and updated the legend accordingly. However, we have opted to keep the multiple t-test analysis in panels H-J because we only intended to compare thicknesses between control and knockout retinas at each individual distance, and we feel that an assumption of normality among retinal thickness measurements is not unreasonable in this instance. While we are careful to correct for multiple comparisons in our large-scale transcriptomics dataset, any detrimental effects of making 8 comparisons versus 1 are minimal, and debate exists as to the overall appropriateness of multiple comparison correction in every case (Althouse 2016). We include all exact p-values in our source data file and have added 95% confidence intervals of these thickness measurements to the main text—importantly, we observe identical trends in retinal thickness throughout many independent immunostaining experiments later in the paper, so we believe that the specific statistical test used in these panels does not influence the conclusions to an appreciable degree.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) A number of different studies have used similar approaches (retina-specific NMNAT1 KO or KD, transcriptomics, and metabolomics) to shed light on NMNAT1 function in the retina. The authors need to clarify what are the knowledge gaps they are trying to fill in and should discuss better their findings in relation to the existing data (i.e. in relation to those of Eblimit et al., 2018 and Kuribayashi et al., 2018).</p></disp-quote><p>To address this concern, we have added several paragraphs in the main text which (1.) better explain any potential inconsistencies between our study and that of Kuribayashi et al., (2.) discuss the possibility of cell-autonomous roles of NMNAT1 in relation to findings of Wang et al., and (3.) better clarify the novelty of our findings. With full respect to the authors of these previous studies, we would like to point out that the mere existence of these publications overestimates the extent to which NMNAT1 knockout retinas have been characterized—Wang et al., provide only a 7-page (omitting references) preprint with a single figure, and Eblimit et al., focus mostly on a disease-linked NMNAT1 mutation (which they demonstrate does not reduce NMNAT1 expression), providing only histological analyses of their various NMNAT1 conditional knockout models. We are grateful to extend some of the findings of Kuribayashi et al., to an in vivo setting, but our in vivo cell-type marker analyses, transcriptomics-guided investigation of cell death and photoreceptor differentiation, and comprehensive metabolomics analyses have not previously been reported in an NMNAT1-deficient animal model.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The authors may also consider rescuing the phenotype of the CKO retina by the administration of NAD or NMN, if experimentally feasible.</p></disp-quote><p>While we appreciate this suggestion and see the potential value of this experiment, uncertainties concerning the timing and proper delivery of NAD to newborn pup retinas argues against the current feasibility of this approach (NMN, meanwhile, is an NMNAT1 substrate and is considerably elevated in our knockout retinas (Figure 5C)).</p><p>In addition to the above changes, we note the following changes in response to individual reviewer comments:</p><p>– Scale bars have been added to figure 1</p><p>– We have changed references of NMNAT1 “isoforms” to “paralogs” or “enzymes” (thank you for catching this)</p><p>– We have added information to all figure legends indicating the number of biological replicates used for each experiment</p><p>– We have changed “the most comprehensive..” to “a comprehensive…” at the end of the Discussion section, and added more details to better contextualize our findings</p><p>References</p><p>Althouse, A.
