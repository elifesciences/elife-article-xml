the ventricular action potential. Mutations in IKs cause long QT syndrome (LQTS), a syndrome with a prolonged QT interval on the ECG, which increases the risk of ventricular arrhythmia and sudden cardiac death. One potential therapeutical intervention for LQTS is based on targeting IKs channels to restore channel function and/or the physiological QT interval. Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are potent activators of KCNQ1 channels and activate IKs channels by binding to two different sites, one in the voltage sensor domain – which shifts the voltage dependence to more negative voltages – and the other in the pore domain – which increases the maximal conductance of the channels (Gmax). However, the mechanism by which PUFAs increase the Gmax of the IKs channels is still poorly understood. In addition, it is unclear why IKs channels have a very small single-channel conductance and a low open probability or whether PUFAs affect any of these properties of IKs channels. Our results suggest that the selectivity filter in KCNQ1 is normally unstable, contributing to the low open probability, and that the PUFA-induced increase in Gmax is caused by a stabilization of the selectivity filter in an open-conductive state.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Travelling through the heart are waves of electrical activity that cause muscle cells to contract and pump blood around the body. The waves are generated by charged ions which flow via tiny channels in and out of the muscle cells. This electrical activity spreads quickly from one cell to the next to make sure all the muscle cells contract at the right time. When these ion channels are compromised, this can lead to heart problems such as long QT syndrome (LQTS).</p><p>In patients with LQTS, electrical activity in the heart does not follow the typical rhythm, which can result in an irregular heartbeat and lead to cardiac arrest. The most common cause of LQTS is mutations in the channel KCNQ1, which allows potassium ions to flow out of heart muscle cells. This outflux of potassium restores the electrical charge inside the cell so that it is ready to receive another electrical wave and contract at the right time.</p><p>Current treatments for LQTS do not target KCNQ1 channels directly and have side effects. An alternative approach could be to use a group of molecules called polyunsaturated fatty acids (or PUFAs for short) which increase the flow of ions that pass through KCNQ1. However, it is not fully understood how PUFAs achieve this.</p><p>Previous research showed that PUFAs activate KCNQ1 via two independent sites: one at the voltage sensor which decides whether the channel is open or closed (Site I), and another at the pore domain ions pass through (Site II). While it is well understood how PUFAs activate the channel at Site I, little is known about the activation mechanism that occurs at Site II.</p><p>To investigate, Golluscio et al. modified egg cells from the frog <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> to express KCNQ1 channels. Experiments investigating the electrical properties of KCNQ1 revealed that the selective filter in the pore domain – which permits potassium but no other ions to pass through – is usually unstable. However, PUFAs help to stabilize this filter, causing KCNQ1 to stay open more often and allow potassium ions to flow out of muscle cells.</p><p>The findings of Golluscio et al. suggest that PUFAs could represent an important therapeutic tool to treat LQTS and potentially other cardiac disorders. However, further studies in heart cells, animals and eventually humans will be required to confirm this conclusion.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>arrhythmia</kwd><kwd>IKs channel</kwd><kwd>PUFA</kwd><kwd>single channels</kwd><kwd>long QT syndrome</kwd><kwd>selectivity filter</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>Xenopus</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000050</institution-id><institution>National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>5R01HL131461</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Larsson</surname><given-names>H Peter</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004411</institution-id><institution>Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>G-21-0031566</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fedida</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PJT-180245</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tieleman</surname><given-names>D Peter</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PJT-175024</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fedida</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000038</institution-id><institution>Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RGPIN-2022-03021</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fedida</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001804</institution-id><institution>Canada Research Chairs</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tieleman</surname><given-names>D Peter</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Polyunsaturated fatty acids activate IKs channels by stabilizing a conductive state of the selectivity filter.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The voltage-gated K<sup>+</sup> channel KCNQ1, also referred to as Kv7.1, is expressed in the heart. Here the channel associates with the accessory KCNE1 subunit, generating the <italic>so-called</italic> slow delayed-rectifier (IKs) current, an important contributor to the repolarizing phase of the ventricular action potential (AP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barhanin et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Sanguinetti et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Nerbonne and Kass, 2005</xref>). Loss-of-function mutations of the KCNQ1/KCNE1 complex are associated with long QT syndrome (LQTS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Splawski et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Tester and Ackerman, 2014</xref>). These LQTS mutations cause a reduction of the channel current, leading to a significant prolongation of the ventricular AP waveform that can be seen on the electrocardiogram as a prolonged QT interval (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Nerbonne and Kass, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). These channel mutations, or dysfunction, increase the risk of developing cardiac arrhythmias, which can lead to sudden cardiac death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Wu and Sanguinetti, 2016</xref>). At present, treatment of LQTS is mainly based on the usage of β-blockers (most used are long-lasting preparations such as nadolol and atenolol) and implantable cardioverter-defibrillators, especially for patients with high risk of sudden death and frequent syncope (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Roden, 2008</xref>). However, both approaches do not shorten the QT interval duration. Restoring the physiological duration of the QT interval could be achieved by increasing the activity of the KCNQ1/KCNE1 channel complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Varshneya et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) activate KCNQ1/KCNE1 channels.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) (Black) Prolonged QT interval in the ECG is due to, for example, loss-of-function mutations of KCNQ1/KCNE1 channels that generate the IKs current that normally contributes to the repolarizing phase of the ventricular action potential (AP).

Each α-subunit is composed of six transmembrane segments, with S1-S4 forming the voltage sensor domain (VSD) and S5-S6 forming the pore domain (PD) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). However, the KCNQ1/KCNE1 channel complex has a very small single-channel conductance and a very low open probability compared to other Kv channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Werry et al., 2013</xref>). The mechanisms behind the small conductance and low open probability are not understood.</p><p>Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), in particular omega 3, are known to exert a protective effect on sudden cardiac death and are recommended in the diet at least twice a week (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fernandez et al., 2021</xref>). PUFAs have been shown to increase IKs currents by a dual mechanism of action, characteristically described as a ‘Lipoelectric mechanism’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Elinder and Liin, 2017</xref>). According to this mechanism, PUFAs can increase IKs currents by shifting the voltage dependence of activation (ΔV0.5) toward negative voltages and increase the maximum conductance of the channel (ΔGmax) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bohannon et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bohannon et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Yazdi et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Larsson et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Wu and Larsson, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>).</p><p>The two PUFA effects (ΔV0.5 and ΔGmax) on KCNQ1 are independent of each other and originate from the binding of PUFA to two different sites, conventionally indicated as Site I and Site II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Yazdi et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Liin et al., 2018</xref>). Site I is found in the VSD, where the PUFA head group interacts with the positive charges in the S4 segment and causes the channel to open at more negative potentials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Liin et al., 2015</xref>). Site II is found in the pore domain, where electrostatic interactions between the PUFA head group and the positively charged residue, K326, facilitate an increase in the maximal conductance of the channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Liin et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E and F</xref>).</p><p>Although previous studies have shown the importance of K326 for PUFA in increasing Gmax through binding at Site II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Liin et al., 2018</xref>), the mechanism by which PUFAs increase Gmax is still not understood. In this study, we use a combination of two-electrode voltage-clamp, single-channel recordings, site-directed mutagenesis, and recent cryoEM structures to gain insight into the molecular mechanism underlying the Gmax effect following PUFA binding at Site II. We propose a novel mechanism where the selectivity filter of KCNQ1 is normally unstable and the binding of PUFA to Site II stabilizes a network of interactions at the selectivity filter, which, in turn, leads to a more open and stable conformation of the KCNQ1 pore and thus an increase in channel open probability.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Lin-Glycine drastically increases the chance of KCNQ1/KCNE1 channel opening</title><p>Lin-Glycine has been shown to increase the Gmax in whole-oocyte recordings of KCNQ1/KCNE1 channels 2.5-fold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bohannon et al., 2020</xref>). To better understand how Lin-Glycine increases Gmax, we here extended our analysis to the single-channel level to study the behavior of KCNQ1/KCNE1 in the absence and presence of Lin-Glycine (20 µM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Representative traces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>) and all points histograms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and D</xref>) suggest that there is no change in single-channel conductance between KCNQ1/KCNE1 in control and with Lin-Glycine. This shows that the Gmax effect is not due to an increase in the single-channel conductance. However, Lin-Glycine caused a decrease in the latency to first opening (in control, 1.78 ± 0.36 s, n = 41 sweeps and after 20 µM Lin-Glycine, 1.03 ± 0.05 s, n = 99 sweeps; p=0.0025) and an increase in the number of non-empty sweeps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). In control, there are a high number of empty sweeps as shown before for KCNQ1/KCNE1 channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Werry et al., 2013</xref>). The average current during the single-channel sweeps was increased by 2.3 ± 0.33 times (n = 4 patches, p=0.006) by the application of Lin-Glycine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>).

The result is a potent activation of IKs channels, with an increase in the maximum conductance by binding to Site II and a shift of the voltage dependence of activation of the channel by binding to Site I. The mechanism of the voltage shift effects at Site I, where the PUFA head group electrostatically interacts with positively charged S4 residues and thereby facilitates channel activation, has been investigated in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Yazdi et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bohannon et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Liin et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Jowais et al., 2023</xref>). However, less is known about the molecular mechanism by which PUFA increases the maximum conductance (Gmax) of the channel following binding to Site II. A positively charged lysine at position 326 was suggested to be critical for PUFA-channel interaction, as mutations of K326 completely abolished the Gmax effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Liin et al., 2018</xref>). We have here shown that the interaction at Site II also involves another residue, the aspartic acid 301, as mutagenesis analysis revealed that the effect of Lin-Glycine on Gmax was abolished when the residue was substituted with a glutamic acid.</p><p>Our single-channel recordings revealed that Lin-Glycine decreases the latency to first opening and increases the Po. The decrease in the latency to first opening is most likely due to the binding of Lin-Glycine to Site I at the VSD and related to the shift in voltage dependence caused by Lin-Glycine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). In addition, our single-channel recordings revealed that Lin-Glycine did not change the single-channel conductance, but instead increased Gmax by increasing the Po of the channel. This increase in Po was mainly due to an increase in non-empty sweeps when Lin-Glycine was applied in comparison to control solutions.</p><p>We tested the hypothesis that the effect of Lin-Glycine involved conformational changes in the selectivity filter following PUFA binding to two residues K326 and D301 at the pore domain. Those residues delimit a small crevice that seems to change in size in different structures with S4 activated or resting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D–F</xref>) and seem to affect PUFA’s ability to increase Gmax. We made several mutations in residues known to stabilize the selectivity filter of potassium channels (Y315F, D317E, T309S, and P320L; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). The Lin-Glycine effect on the Gmax was much reduced in these mutants, suggesting that these residues are necessary for the Gmax effect. To gain further insight into the molecular interactions that could underline the Gmax effect by PUFA binding to Site II, we used the latest KCNQ1 structure with the S4 segment in the resting state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Mandala and MacKinnon, 2023</xref>). The selectivity filter in this structure showed a very different conformation of the pore region and selectivity filter of KCNQ1 compared to the structures with activated VSDs. Clearly, there will be other differences in the pore domain between structures with activated and resting VSDs, for example, the state of the activation gate. Many of the interactions that have been shown to be important for the stability of the selectivity filter are missing in the KCNQ1 structure with a resting VSD. These changes in the selectivity filter can best be seen in our interpolation video between the states with the S4 segments moving from the resting state to the activated state (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). This gave us the idea that the effect of PUFAs in increasing the maximum conductance of the KCNQ1 channel is linked to their ability to stabilize the pore of the channel in a conductive state. It was previously shown that several interactions at the pore region of K<sup>+</sup> channels are important for ensuring channel conductivity. For example, a feature conserved among K<sup>+</sup> channels is the aromatic ring cuff that stabilizes the conducting state and plays a role in C-type inactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Doyle et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Larsson and Elinder, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Pless et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kurata and Fedida, 2006</xref>). This structure is made up of two tryptophan residues (W) and a proline residue (P) that sits in between the two tryptophan residues (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref>). In Shaker and KcsA K<sup>+</sup> channels, the two tryptophans are involved in C-type inactivation and modification of those interactions manipulate the extent of inactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cordero-Morales et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Yang et al., 1997</xref>). In Shaker, breaking the hydrogen bonds between the two tryptophans of the aromatic ring cuff and the aspartic acid and tyrosine at the selectivity filter causes an acceleration of the rate of C-type inactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Pless et al., 2013</xref>). In KCNQ1, the two tryptophans of the aromatic ring cuff correspond to W304 and W305. Another conserved residue in K<sup>+</sup> channels important for the stability of the selectivity filter is P320 (equivalent to P450 in Shaker) that makes up part of the aromatic ring cuff. In the transition between the non-conductive and conductive state of KCNQ1, the proline pulls away from its position close to W304 and W305 and flips outward (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref>). We hypothesize that those hydrogen bonds between W304-D317 and W305-Y315 and the proline interactions are likely absent in the non-conductive conformation of KCNQ1, thereby generating the high number of empty sweeps in control conditions. Occasionally the channel will reform these bonds and interactions and transition into the conductive conformation, thereby generating the non-empty sweeps. We hypothesize that the binding of Lin-Glycine to K326 and D301 at Site II biases the transition toward the conductive conformation, thereby increasing the number of non-empty sweeps and increasing Gmax. We here show that mutations of residues involved in these hydrogen bonds in the selectivity filter greatly reduce or abolish the Gmax effect of Lin-Glycine, as if Lin-Glycine increases the Gmax by stabilizing a conductive state of the selectivity filter through these hydrogen bonds.</p><p>We noticed that the arrangement of the aromatic ring cuff is slightly different between Shaker K<sup>+</sup> channels and KCNQ1 channel. For instance, in Shaker, the proline residue sits in between the two tryptophan residues and stabilizes the aromatic ring cuff (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3A</xref>). In contrast, in KCNQ1 the proline is positioned a little further outward and away from the two tryptophan residues, thus generating a looser arrangement of the aromatic ring cuff (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3B</xref>). This difference might contribute to rendering the pore of KCNQ1 more unstable, resulting in a large number of empty sweeps and the characteristic flickering nature of channel openings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Eldstrom et al., 2021</xref>). In Shaker channels, the aromatic cuff seems more stable since it displays few empty sweeps and less flicker during bursts. This difference in the stability of the aromatic cuff between Shaker and KCNQ1 might explain why the effect of PUFA on Gmax is large for KCNQ1 but not seen in Shaker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Börjesson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Börjesson and Elinder, 2011</xref>) even if the residues involved in the Gmax effect are conserved between these two channels.</p><p>Our single-channel data show that the KCNQ1/KCNE1 switches slowly (&gt;10 s) between conductive and non-conductive states, giving rise to many empty sweeps and few active sweeps. However, once the channel becomes conductive during a depolarization, the channel stays conductive for the remainder of the sweep (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref> for 20 s sweeps), as if VSD activation stabilizes the conductive state. Therefore, we propose a model in which the selectivity filter is stabilized more in the non-conductive state when VSD is resting but stabilized more in the conductive state when VSD is activated. This model is consistent with the cryoEM structures of KCNQ1 with VSD resting displaying a non-conductive selectivity filter and with VSD activated displaying a conductive selectivity filter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Mandala and MacKinnon, 2023</xref>). The KCNQ1 structure with VSD resting was obtained in a low K<sup>+</sup> solution, which in other Kv channels would promote C-type inactivation of the selectivity filter. However, we think it is the resting state of the VSD, and not the low K<sup>+</sup>, that caused the non-conductive selectivity filter in the KCNQ1 structure because a KCNQ1 structure with VSD activated in the low K<sup>+</sup> solution had a selectivity filter that was nearly identical to the KCNQ1 structure in high K<sup>+</sup> with VSD activated (except for fewer K<sup>+</sup> ions in the filter in low K<sup>+</sup> solutions) (see Suppl. Figs. S5C and S5D in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Mandala and MacKinnon, 2023</xref>). Note also the currents from KCNQ1/KCNE1 channels display little external K<sup>+</sup> dependence (a small inhibition in addition to what is expected from changes in driving force) and that KCNQ1 channels are more strongly inhibited by high extracellular K<sup>+</sup> concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abrahamyan et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Larsen et al., 2011</xref>) in contrast to other Kv channels, such as Shaker K<sup>+</sup> channels, which are inactivated more in low K<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Larsson and Elinder, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kurata and Fedida, 2006</xref>). Our studies suggest that the mechanism of PUFAs to increase KCNQ1/KCNE1 maximum conductance relies on the ability of PUFAs to favor the conductive conformation of the selectivity filter: PUFAs promote interactions between residues in the selectivity filter that stabilize the channel pore. Furthermore, we identify a crevice between K326 and D301 that is present in structures of KCNQ1 with activated VSD but not in structures where the VSD is in the resting state. We propose that PUFA binding in this crevice stabilizes the network of interactions that form the conductive form of the selectivity filter. The result is a more stable and conductive pore, which explains the increase in Gmax by PUFAs.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Molecular biology</title><p>KCNQ1 (UniProt: P51787) and KCNE1 (UniProt: P15382) cRNA were transcribed using the mMessage mMachine T7 kit (Ambion).

The stabilization of a conducting state is well supported by single channel analysis, which shows that normally infrequent opening bursts occur more often in the presence of the PUFA. The linkage to PUFA action through the selectivity filter is supported by disruption of PUFA effects by mutation of residues which change conformation in two KCNQ1 structures from the literature. A definitive functional experiment is conducted by single channel recordings with selectivity filter domain mutation Y315F which ablates the Lin-Glycine effect on Gmax. The computational exploration of two selectivity filter structures proposed to interact distinctly with Lin-Glycine is informative. Both mutation results and simulations converge on the proposed selectivity filter mechanism, although other possibilities for Lin-Glycine binding and action might be possible. Overall, the major claim of the abstract is well-supported: &quot;... that the selectivity filter in KCNQ1 is normally unstable ... and that the PUFA-induced increase in Gmax is caused by a stabilization of the selectivity filter in an open-conductive state.&quot;</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.95852.4.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Golluscio et al. address one of the mechanisms of IKs (KCNQ1/KCNE1) channel upregulation by polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). PUFAs are known to upregulate KCNQ1 and KCNQ1/KCNE1 channels through two mechanisms: one shifts the voltage dependence in a negative direction, and the other increases the maximum conductance (Gmax). While the first mechanism is known to affect the voltage sensor equilibrium through a charge effect, the second mechanism is less understood. Using single-channel recordings and mutagenesis at putative PUFA binding sites, they successfully demonstrate that the selectivity filter is stabilized in a conducting state by PUFA binding, and that this is the mechanism by which PUFAs increase Gmax. Their single-channel recordings are straightforward and clearly show that the selectivity filter tends to become conductive upon PUFA binding. Since PUFAs are potential therapeutic reagents for cardiac arrhythmias such as long QT syndrome, their findings are beneficial for future research and applications of these compounds.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.95852.4.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript reveals an important mechanism of KCNQ1/IKs channel gating such that the open state of the pore is unstable and undergoes intermittent closed and open conformations.

The cryoEM structure of KCNQ1 with S4 in the resting state was obtained with lowered K+ relative to the active state. Throughout the results and discussion it seems implied that the change in voltage sensor state is somehow causative of the change in selectivity filter state while the paper that identified the structures attributes the change in selectivity filter state not to voltage sensors, but to the change in [K+] between the 2 structures. Unless there is a flaw in my understanding of the conditions in which the selectivity filter structures used in modeling were generated, it seems misleading to ignore the change in [K+] when referring to the activated vs resting or up vs down structures. My understanding is that the closed conformation adopted in the resting/low [K+] is similar to that observed in low [K+] previously and is more commonly associated with [K+]-dependent inactivation, not resulting from voltage sensor deactivation as implied here. The original article presenting the low [K+] structure also suggests this. When discussing conformational changes in the selectivity filter, I strongly suggest referring to these structures as activated/high [K+] vs resting/low [K+] or something similar, as the [K+] concentration is a salient variable.</p></disp-quote><p>There seems to be some major confusion here and we will try to explain how we think. Note that in the Mandela and MacKinnon paper, there is no significant difference in the amino acid positions in the selectivity filter between low and high K+ when S4 is in the activated position (See Mandala and Mackinnon, PNAS Suppl. Fig S5 C and D). There are only fewer K+ in the selectivity filter in low K+. So, the structure with the distorted selectivity filter is not due to low K+ by itself. Note that there is no real difference between macroscopic currents recorded in low and high K+ solutions (except what is expected from changes in driving force) for KCNQ1/KCNE1 channels (Larsen et al., Bioph J 2011), suggesting that low K+ do not promote the non-conductive state (Figure 1). We now include a section in the Discussion about high/low K+ in the structures and the absence of effects of K+ on the function of KCNQ1/KCNE1 channels.</p><fig id="sa4fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Macroscopic KCNQ1/KCNE1 currents recorded in different K+ conditions.</title><p>Note that there is no difference between current recorded in low K+ (2 mM) conditions and high (96 mM) K+ conditions (n = 3 oocytes). Currents were normalized in respect to high K+.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-95852-sa4-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><p>Note also that, in the previous version of the manuscript, we did not propose that the position of S4 is what determines the state of the selectivity filter. We only reported that the CryoEM structure with S4 resting shows a distorted selectivity filter. It seems like our text confused the reviewer to think that we proposed that S4 determines the state of the selectivity filter, when we did not propose this earlier. We previously did not want to speculate too much about this, but we have now included a section in the Discussion to make our view clear in light of the confusion of the reviewers.</p><p>It is clear from our data that the majority of sweeps are empty (which we assume is with S4 up), suggesting that the selectivity filter can be (and is in the majority of sweeps) in the non-conducting state even with S4 up. We think that the selectivity filter switches between a non-conductive and a conductive conformation both with S4 down and with S4 up. The cryoEM structure in low K+ and S4 down just happened to catch the non-conductive state of the selectivity filter. We have now added a section in the Discussion to clarify all this and explain how we think it works.</p><p>However, S4 in the active conformation seems to stabilize the conductive conformation of the selectivity filter, because during long pulses the channel seems to stay open once opened (See Suppl Fig S2). So, one possibility is that the selectivity filter goes more readily into the non-conductive state when S4 is down (and maybe, or not, low K+ plays a role) and then when S4 moves up the selectivity filter sometimes recovers into the conductive state and stays there. We now have included a section in the Discussion to present our view. Since this whole discussion was initiated and pushed by the reviewer, we hope that the reviewers will not demand more data to support these ideas. We think that this addition makes sense since other readers might have the same questions and ideas as the reviewer, and we would like to prevent any confusion about this topic.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 1</p><p>It remains unclear in the manuscript itself what &quot;control&quot; refers to.
