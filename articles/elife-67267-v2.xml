key role in synaptic plasticity, spatial learning, and anxiety-like behavioral processes. While IGF-1 regulates neuronal firing and synaptic transmission in many areas of the central nervous system, its signaling and consequences on excitability, synaptic plasticity, and animal behavior dependent on the prefrontal cortex remain unexplored. Here, we show that IGF-1 induces a long-lasting depression of the medium and slow post-spike afterhyperpolarization (mAHP and sAHP), increasing the excitability of layer 5 pyramidal neurons of the rat infralimbic cortex. Besides, IGF-1 mediates a presynaptic long-term depression of both inhibitory and excitatory synaptic transmission in these neurons. The net effect of this IGF-1-mediated synaptic plasticity is a long-term potentiation of the postsynaptic potentials. Moreover, we demonstrate that IGF-1 favors the fear extinction memory. These results show novel functional consequences of IGF-1 signaling, revealing IGF-1 as a key element in the control of the fear extinction memory.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>IGF-1</kwd><kwd>extinction of conditioned fear</kwd><kwd>synaptic plasticity</kwd><kwd>infralimbic cortex</kwd><kwd>afterhyperpolarization</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100010198</institution-id><institution>Ministerio de Economía, Industria y Competitividad, Gobierno de España</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BFU2013-43668-P</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fernández de Sevilla</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100010198</institution-id><institution>Ministerio de Economía, Industria y Competitividad, Gobierno de España</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BFU2016-0802-P AEI/FEDER</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fernández de Sevilla</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100010198</institution-id><institution>Ministerio de Economía, Industria y Competitividad, Gobierno de España</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>UE</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fernández de Sevilla</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Insulin-like growth factor-1 activates the prefrontal cortex and improves the extinction of aversive memories.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Conditioned fear is an associative form of learning and memory in which a previous neutral stimulus (called ‘conditioned stimulus’ [CS]; e.g., a tone) comes to elicit a fear response when is associated with an aversive stimulus (called ‘unconditioned stimulus’ [US]; e.g., an electric shock <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">LeDoux, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Maren, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pape and Pare, 2010</xref>). Extinction of conditioned fear is an active learning process involving inhibition of fear expression. It is a decline in conditioned fear responses (CRs) following non-reinforced exposure to the CS. However, fear extinction memory does not erase the initial association between the CS and US but forms a new association (CS–No US) that inhibits expression of the previous conditioned memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Quirk and Mueller, 2008</xref>). Fear extinction depends on specific structures such as the amygdala, the hippocampus, and the prefrontal cortex (PFC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Milad and Quirk, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Orsini and Maren, 2012</xref>). Dysfunctions in the neuronal circuits responsible for fear cause the development of anxiety disorders, including specific phobias and post-traumatic stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pavlov, 1927</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Quirk and Mueller, 2008</xref>).</p><p>The consolidation of the extinction memory has been related to long-term synaptic plasticity and increases in the excitability of pyramidal neurons (PNs) from the infralimbic cortex (IL) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kaczorowski et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Koppensteiner et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Moyer et al., 1996</xref>). The mechanisms of this synaptic plasticity involve NMDA receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Burgos-Robles et al., 2007</xref>), mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hugues et al., 2004</xref>), protein kinase A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mueller et al., 2008</xref>), insertion of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-permeable AMPA receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sepulveda-Orengo et al., 2013</xref>), and protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mueller et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Santini et al., 2004</xref>). Moreover, the excitability of PN from IL is a key determinant for both the acquisition and the extinction of fear, being reduced by fear acquisition and increased by fear extinction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Santini et al., 2008</xref>). Indeed, IL layer 5 PNs (L5PNs) of conditioned fear animals show a higher slow post-spike afterhyperpolarization (sAHP) amplitude and lower firing frequency relative to non-conditioned or extinguished animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Santini et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) is an endogenous polypeptide with plenty of trophic functions, which can be locally synthesized and released by neurons and astrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fernandez and Torres-Alemán, 2012</xref>). Similarly, its receptor (IGF-1R) is widely expressed among all brain cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Quesada et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Rodriguez-Perez et al., 2016</xref>). IGF-1 increases neuronal firing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gazit et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nuñez et al., 2003</xref>) and modulates excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission in the central nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Castro-Alamancos and Torres-Aleman, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nilsson et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Noriega-prieto et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Seto et al., 2002</xref>). Furthermore, IGF-1 regulates different ion channels, such as A-type K<sup>+</sup> channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Xing et al., 2006</xref>) and P/Q-, L-, and N-type voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Blair and Marshall, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Shan et al., 2003</xref>), as well as neurotransmitter receptors activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gonzalez de la Vega et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Savchenko et al., 2001</xref>). However, the role of IGF-1 on the modulation of L5PN of the IL activity and its consequences in the fear extinction memory remain to be clarified.</p><p>Here we have examined the effects of IGF-1 in the excitability and synaptic transmission of L5PN from IL and in the extinction of conditioned fear. Our results reveal that IGF-1 induces a long-lasting reduction of the sAHP amplitude and increases the firing frequency of L5PNs. Furthermore, IGF-1 induces a presynaptic long-term depression (LTD) of both excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic currents (EPSC and IPSCs, respectively) that results in a long-term potentiation (LTP) of the postsynaptic potentials (PSPs). Moreover, we show that IGF-1 facilitates the recall of extinction of fear conditioning when applied intracranially to the IL 30 min before the extinction task. In these animals with the favored extinction by IGF-1, the sAHP is reduced and the excitatory synaptic transmission is depressed. Therefore, we demonstrate for the first time that IGF-1 facilitates the extinction of fear conditioning, increasing the excitability and potentiating the synaptic transmission in L5PN from IL.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>IGF-1 increases the excitability of IL-L5PNs</title><p>Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated K<sup>+</sup> currents that mediate the medium and slow post-spike afterhyperpolarization (mAHP and sAHP, respectively) are crucial in the regulation of neuronal excitability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alger and Nicoll, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Madison and Nicoll, 1984</xref>). We first tested the effect of IGF-1 on different components of AHPs of IL L5PNs. In the current-clamp mode, we recorded mAHPs or sAHPs before and during bath application of IGF-1 (10 nM). IGF-1 reduced mAHP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>) and sAHPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,C</xref>), whereas the fast AHP (fAHP) was unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). The reduction of mAHP and sAHP was abolished in the presence of the antagonist of the IGF-1 receptor, NVP-AEW 541 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–C</xref>). We also checked the effect on neuronal excitability by analyzing the number of action potentials (APs) evoked by increasing current injection steps. We observed that the number of APs evoked by this protocol was higher during IGF-1 perfusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E,F</xref>). Moreover, we compared the properties of AP before and after IGF-1 application. There were no significant differences in parameters, such as AP amplitude, AP threshold, AP half-width, AP time to max rise slope, AP max rise slope, AP time to max decay slope, and AP max decay slope (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A–G</xref>). However, the input resistance was significantly augmented (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2H</xref>), suggesting a reduction of ionic conductance. We next performed voltage-clamp recordings to analyze the effect of IGF-1 on the currents that underlie the mAHP and sAHP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alger and Nicoll, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Storm, 1990</xref>) (<sub>m</sub>I<sub>AHP</sub> and <sub>s</sub>I<sub>AHP</sub>, respectively). IGF-1 decreased <sub>m</sub>I<sub>AHP</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–C</xref>) and <sub>s</sub>I<sub>AHP</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,D,E</xref>), while the fast afterhyperpolarization current remained unaltered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C,D</xref>). We observed a gradual current reduction that reached a plateau 20 min after IGF-1 application in both the <sub>m</sub>I<sub>AHP</sub> and <sub>s</sub>I<sub>AHP</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,E</xref>). However, in the absence of IGF-1, the neuronal depolarization did not modify the AHP currents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Interestingly, we observed a long-lasting reduction of <sub>m</sub>I<sub>AHP</sub> and <sub>s</sub>I<sub>AHP</sub> that remained after the wash-out of IGF-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B,C</xref>) and required the activation of the AHPs by the depolarizing protocol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B,C</xref>). Moreover, the IGF-1-dependent modulation of the <sub>m</sub>I<sub>AHP</sub> and <sub>s</sub>I<sub>AHP</sub> was prevented by the NVP-AEW541 (400 nM, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–E</xref>), indicating that these effects were mediated by the activation of the IGF-1R.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>IGF-1 increases the excitability of IL-L5PNs.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative recordings from IL-L5PNs of hyperpolarizing potentials elicited by an 800 ms depolarizing pulse to study medium and slow AHP in control conditions (ACSF, top) and in the presence of NVP-AEW541 (40 nM, bottom), before (black) and during IGF-1 (10 nM, red) (spikes are truncated).

IGF-1 induced a LTD of IPSCs (72.43% of baseline, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>) that were dependent on IGF-1R activation since this effect was prevented by NVP-AEW541 (99.0% of baseline, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). The IGF-1-mediated depression of the IPSCs was associated with changes in the PPR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>) and coefficient of variation (1/CV<sup>2</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>), pointing to a presynaptic mechanism. Nevertheless, the LTD of the IPSC did not require the evoked IPSCs since IGF-1 was able to induce it when the synaptic stimulation was absent (49.76% of baseline, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>). Interestingly, the IGF-1-dependent depression of EPSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,D</xref>) and IPSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E,H</xref>) was larger in the absence of synaptic stimulation, suggesting that two different mechanisms may be responsible for the LTD. Finally, we studied the effect of IGF-1 on the PSPs. After recording a stable baseline of PSPs, we increased the intensity of stimulus until that ≈21% of the responses recorded during 5 min were suprathreshold and then we added IGF-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I,J</xref>). IGF-1 induced a significant increase in the number of AP 10 and 15 min after its application (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3M</xref>), whereas the properties of these AP were not modified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3L,N</xref>). After returning to the basal intensity of stimulation, a LTP of the PSPs was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>). This PSP potentiation was not present when using the same protocol but in the absence of IGF-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). According to the observed potentiation, IGF-1 application increased PSP amplitude, without modifying the PSP kinetics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J,K</xref>). It is worth mentioning that a shorter period of IGF-1 application (10 min) was enough to induce an LTP of PSPs, which is maintained even after washing IGF-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). Together, our results reveal that IGF-1 induces a presynaptic depression of both EPSCs and IPSCs which triggers an LTP of PSPs.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>IGF-1 facilitates fear extinction</title><p>Since a reduction of the sAHP favors the recall of extinction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Santini et al., 2008</xref>), we next analyzed whether IGF-1 was able to improve it.

Interestingly, both current amplitude correlated with the freezing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>), indicating that the reduction in the currents mediated by IGF-1 facilitates the extinction recall. It is noteworthy that all rat groups that underwent the extinction, except for the Ext-NVP +IGF-1 group, showed a reduced fAHP and mAHP when compared with NAÏVE group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A,B</xref>), which is in agreement with previous results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Santini et al., 2008</xref>). However, we only observed a significant reduction in sAHP from Ext-IGF-1 group compared NAÏVE group, suggesting that in this group of animals the reduction of the sAHP is essential for the better level of extinction recall (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2C</xref>). Moreover, IGF-1-treated group showed an increased AP firing frequency of IL-L5PNs when compared with saline or NVP + IGF-1 groups.

Finally, we also tested whether the excitatory synaptic transmission was depressed by IGF-1 in animals in which IGF-1 facilitated the extinction. For this purpose, we recorded miniature EPSCs (mEPSCs) in IL-L5PNs from all behavioral groups after the last extinction session on day 4. We observed that the mEPSCs frequency of the IGF-1 group was lower than in saline and NVP + IGF-1 groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–C</xref>), with no changes in the mEPSCs amplitude (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,D,E</xref>) suggesting a presynaptic modulation of synaptic transmission by IGF-1.

Our results demonstrate for the first time that IGF-1 applied to IL favors the extinction of conditioned fear memory causing an increase in L5PN excitability and synaptic plasticity through the activation of the IGF-1R. We present new evidence showing that IGF-1 induced a long-lasting increase in excitability and LTP of the synaptic potentials at IL-L5PNs. The former is mediated by a significant reduction in the mAHP and sAHP, whereas the latter results from the interaction between the presynaptic LTD of the EPSCs and IPSCs. Therefore, our results show a novel functional consequence of IGF-1 signaling on animal behavior in the mPFC through the modulation of the extinction of conditioned fear memory.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>IGF-1-induces AHPs reduction leading to enhancement of excitability</title><p>The enhancement of excitability is manifested as a reduced spike frequency adaptation in response to prolonged depolarizing current applications, which results from post-burst AHP reduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Moyer et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sepulveda-Orengo et al., 2013</xref>) modulation of intrinsic excitability is linked with the mechanism of consolidation of learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sehgal et al., 2014</xref>). Specifically, in IL, a reduction of excitability maintains the fear learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Criado-Marrero et al., 2014</xref>) whereas an increase of the excitability regulated the fear extinction learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sepulveda-Orengo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bloodgood et al., 2018</xref>). Interestingly, our recordings from IL-L5PNs of animals treated with IGF-1 showed a long-lasting decrease of mAHP and sAHP currents, which is highly related to behavioral recall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Moyer et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Santini et al., 2008</xref>), suggesting that IGF-1 also modulates the channels responsible for these currents in IL-L5PNs. A previous study demonstrated that the enhancement of the bursting of these neurons after the acquisition of fear extinction is mediated by a reduction of <sub>f</sub>I<sub>AHP</sub> due to the blockade of the M-type K<sup>+</sup> current (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Santini and Porter, 2010</xref>). The reduction in the amplitude and the duration of AHPs from IL-L5PNs caused by IGF-1 resulted in a significant increase in their excitability, as reflected in the increase of their firing frequency. In the present work, we demonstrate that IGF-1 does not modify the <sub>f</sub>I<sub>AHP</sub>, suggesting that the effects of IGF-1 on IL-L5PN firing frequency and recall of extinction are not mediated by the modulation of the M-current. Moreover, the AP characteristics are not affected by IGF-1, suggesting that the IGF-1-mediated increase in IL-L5PNs excitability is mainly produced by the decrease in the mAHP and sAHP currents.

In our study, inhibition of G protein-coupled receptors by GDPβs abolished the IGF-1-mediated reduction of mIAHP, suggesting that the effect of IGF-1 on mAHP is mediated by the activation of metabotropic receptors. One candidate is the mGLuRs, since it has been demonstrated that the activation of mGluR5 increases IL-L5PN excitability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fontanez-Nuin et al., 2011</xref>) and modulates the recall of extinction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fontanez-Nuin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sepulveda-Orengo et al., 2013</xref>) in a similar way to what we describe for IGF-1. However, we cannot rule out the involvement of other GPCRs and a further study is required to analyze the type of metabotropic receptor and the signaling pathway mediating the reduction of the mAHP by the IGF-1. On the other hand, we observed that IGF-1-mediated sAHP reduction is independent of the activation of G-protein-coupled receptors, which suggests that IGF-1 could be directly modulating the activity of some AHP-related ion channels, such as SK channels.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>IGF-1-induces an LTP of the PSPs</title><p>The inhibitory transmission controls the operation of cortical circuits and the modulation of synaptic inhibition plays an important role in the induction of cortical plasticity. In response to glutamate, IGF-1 induces a long-lasting reduction in GABA release from cerebellar Purkinje cells, suggesting that IGF-1 is modulating the glutamatergic transmission in the rat olivo-cerebellar system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Castro-Alamancos and Torres-Aleman, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Castro-Alamancos et al., 1996</xref>). IGF-1 was also shown to modulate GABAergic transmission in the olfactory bulb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Liu et al., 2017</xref>). However, this is the first demonstration of an IGF-1-mediated presynaptic long-lasting depression of fast GABAergic synaptic transmission in the PFC. Although IGF-1Rs may be present in the inhibitory GABAergic terminals, there are no clear data showing a direct action of IGF-1 acting on presynaptic IGF-1Rs. The only evidence suggesting this mode of action was seen in the hippocampus, where IGF-1 can induce the release of GABA to regulate endogenous ACh release, possibly acting via GABAergic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Seto et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>It has been demonstrated that excitatory synaptic transmission is also modulated by IGF-1 in many brain areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Araujo et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Castro-Alamancos and Torres-Aleman, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Maya-Vetencourt et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nilsson et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Seto et al., 2002</xref>). IGF-1 enhances glutamatergic synaptic transmission through a postsynaptic mechanism involving postsynaptic AMPA, but not NMDA, receptors in CA1 PNs from rat hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Molina et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ramsey et al., 2005</xref>). Additionally, IGF-1 increases the expression levels of hippocampal NMDA receptor subunits 2A and 2B in aged rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sonntag et al., 2000</xref>), which may facilitate LTP induction. However, here we show that IGF-1 decreases the efficacy of excitatory synaptic transmission by a presynaptic mechanism. Therefore, our observations contribute to the notion that IGF-1 can decrease the release of neurotransmitters both at excitatory and inhibitory synapses throughout the CNS. The net effect of this modulation by IGF-1 is a long-lasting potentiation of the PSPs indicating a greater impact of the reduction of inhibition compared with the reduction of excitation. Interestingly, we observed that two mechanisms coexist in the development of the LTD of EPSCs and IPSCs following IGF-1 application. The first one is dependent on synaptic activation and is characterized by a fast onset, the plateau being achieved at 10–15 min after IGF-1 application. The second one is independent of synaptic activation and is characterized by a slower onset, achieving the plateau at 40 min after IGF-1 application. However, the increase in the input resistance induced by IGF-1 could also explain the resultant LTP of the PSPs nonetheless of the reduction in the release of neurotransmitters. Since SK channels have been shown to modulate NMDA receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jones et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ngo-Anh et al., 2005</xref>), we cannot discard a putative IGF-1-dependent modulation of SK channels as the source of the potentiation in the synaptic transmission. The resultant LTP of the PSPs and the increase in the input resistance summed to the decrease of the AHPs would result in the increase of the L5PN activity of the IL and its effect on the fear extinction memory.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>IGF-1 facilitates fear extinction memory</title><p>There is a growing body of evidence supporting that fear extinction memory is encoded by IL neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Quirk and Beer, 2006</xref>) that show enhanced responses to extinguished cues during extinction recall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Milad and Quirk, 2002</xref>).

In addition, IL is involved in the recall of this memory since lesions of the IL produce deficits in its retention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Morgan and LeDoux, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Quirk et al., 2000</xref>). In the present study, we infused IGF-1 into IL before the extinction protocol and found that the action of IGF-1 in these neurons induced a significant improvement of fear extinction memory compared to the groups treated with saline or NVP + IGF-1. Consistent with that fact, IGF-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Llorens-Martín et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Trejo et al., 2008</xref>), and most recently also IGF-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2011</xref>), have been related to cognitive function. Injections of IGF-1, IGF-2, or insulin into the amygdala did not affect memories engaging this region. However, bilateral injection of insulin into the dorsal hippocampus transiently enhances hippocampal-dependent memory, whereas injection of IGF-1 has no effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Stern et al., 2014</xref>). IGF-2 produces the most potent and persistent effect as a memory enhancer on hippocampal-dependent memories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2011</xref>). Like insulin, IGF-2 did not affect amygdala-dependent memories when delivered into the BLA. Contextual fear extinction is facilitated when IGF-2 is injected into the dentate gyrus whereas inhibition of physiological IGF-1 signaling, via intrahippocampal injection of an IGF-1 blocking antibody, did not affect fear extinction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2011</xref>). However, a single intravenous injection of IGF-1 before the training of contextual fear extinction increases the density of mature dendritic spines in the hippocampus and mPFC, favoring the memory of extinction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Burgdorf et al., 2017</xref>). All these reports are consistent with the idea that IGF-2 would have a specific role in the hippocampus while IGF-1 could have a selective role in the IL.</p><p>The reduction in the AHP amplitude associated with learning mechanisms is transitory since AHP amplitude initial values are recovered within days when training is finished, indicating an intrinsic plasticity phenomenon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Moyer et al., 1996</xref>). Cohen-Matslish and coworkers showed that the AHP reduction induced by the synaptic activation requires protein synthesis during a specific time-window for its long-term maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cohen-Matsliah et al., 2010</xref>). It has been shown that the acquisition of extinction memory depends on protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Santini et al., 2004</xref>). In our study, we show that IGF-1 favors the acquisition of extinction memory when applied directly to the IL in vivo. Therefore, it is tempting to hypothesize that the slow onset kinetics of AHP reduction that we observed after bath perfusion of IGF-1 in brain slices are suggestive of a mechanism involving protein synthesis, although further experiments would be needed to confirm it. Consistent with our observations in brain slices (plateau of AHP reduction is reached after 30 min), AHP amplitude is reduced in IL neurons from rats where the extinction memory was consolidated (recordings from the test day in IGF-1-treated animals). Moreover, we found that a reduction in AHP amplitude was directly correlated with a reduction in the expression of fear, suggesting that mechanisms favoring a greater AHP reduction would produce an enhancement of the acquisition of extinction memory.</p><p>Following the acquisition of fear extinction memory, there is a preferential shift toward increased intrinsic excitability in IL-amygdala communication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bloodgood et al., 2018</xref>). In our study, we correlate the reduction in AHP amplitude with an increase in IL neuronal excitability. Under these circumstances, this increase in IL neurons’ bursting would activate inhibitory intercalated cells in the amygdala to produce the inhibition of fear expression, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Quirk and Mueller, 2008</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Functional relevance of the IGF-1 modulation in the mPFC</title><p>IGF-1 is actively transported to the central nervous system from plasma through the choroid plexus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carro et al., 2000</xref>), and it is also locally produced in the brain by neurons and glial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Quesada et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Suh et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Rodriguez-Perez et al., 2016</xref>). Interestingly, the uptake of IGF-1 by the brain correlates with frequency-dependent changes in cerebral blood flow in the cortex during information processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nishijima et al., 2010</xref>). Therefore, the levels of IGF-1 in the IL would depend on both its active transport from the plasma, favored by the activity involved in information processing, and in the IGF-1 locally produced by neurons and astrocytes of the IL. Thus, high levels of IGF-1 are expected in the IL because of its high activity during the extinction of fear conditioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Milad and Quirk, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sepulveda-Orengo et al., 2013</xref>). Our results demonstrate that a further increase in the IGF-1 levels due to the exogenous application of IGF-1 in the IL favor the extinction of conditioned fear. In natural conditions, these high levels of IGF-1 could be expected after physical exercises because it is known that IGF-1 uptake from the plasma and IGF-1 levels in the brain are increased after running, reaching the higher levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carro et al., 2000</xref>). Thus, our results could be related to some of the benefits of physical exercise on the brain function by increasing neuronal excitability and favoring synaptic plasticity and learning and memory through the activation of the IGF-1Rs.</p><p>In conclusion, the present findings reveal novel mechanisms and functional consequences of IGF-1 signaling in IL. On one hand, IGF-1 induces a reduction in mI<sub>AHP</sub> and sI<sub>AHP</sub> and increases the excitability of L5PNs of IL. On the other hand, IGF-1 modulates the excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission resulting in a long-lasting enhancement of the synaptic efficacy. Both the synaptic and intrinsic plasticity regulate the neuronal connectivity, which leads to the facilitation of consolidation of fear extinction memory. Altogether, these results strongly support the potential role of IGF-1 as a new therapeutic target for the treatment of anxiety and mood disorders.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>Male Sprague Dawley rats were group-housed in transparent polyethylene cages.

The stimulating electrode was placed at 100 μm below the soma of the recorded neuron (at the level of layer 6), close to the basal dendrites of the recorded IL-L5PNs. Paired pulses (100 μs in duration and 20–100 μA in intensity, 50 ms away) were continuously delivered at 0.33 Hz. EPSCs were isolated in the presence of GABA<sub>A</sub>R (50 μ<sc>m</sc> picrotoxin; PiTX) and GABA<sub>B</sub>R (5 µM CGP-55845) antagonists. IPSCs were isolated adding AMPAR (20 μ<sc>m</sc> <sc>CNQX)</sc> and <sc>NMDAR (</sc>50 μ<sc>m</sc> <sc>D-AP5)</sc> antagonists. In both cases, after 5 min of stable baseline, we superfused IGF-1 for 35 min to check for long-term synaptic plasticity by analyzing the EPSCs and IPSCs peak amplitudes. In current-clamp mode, after a stable baseline of PSPs, the stimulation intensity was increased until suprathreshold responses reached were ≈21% for 5 min. Next, we applied IGF-1 for 15 min and measured the number of APs; afterward, we returned to initial stimulation intensity and measured the amplitude of PSPs to study the effect of IGF-1 on synaptic transmission. Miniature EPSCs (mEPSCs) were recorded at −60 mV in ACSF in the presence of 1 μ<sc>m</sc> TTX, 20 μ<sc>m</sc> PiTX, and 5 µM CGP-55845 to isolate excitatory synaptic transmission.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Conditioned fear</title><p>Rats were anesthetized with ketamine (70 mg/kg i.p.; Ketolar), xylazine (5 mg/kg i.p.; Rompum), and atropine (0,05 mg/kg i.p.; B. Braun Medical S.A) and maintained with isoflurane (2–3% in oxygen). Animals were positioned in a stereotaxic apparatus (David Kopf Instruments, Tujunga, CA, USA) and placed on a water-heated pad at 37°C. The midline of the scalp was sectioned and retracted, and small holes were drilled in the skull. Rats were implanted with a single 26 gauge stainless-steel guide cannula (Plastics One) in the mPFC. Stereotaxic coordinates aiming toward the IL were (AP: 2.8 mm, LM: 1.0 mm, and DV: 4.1 mm) from bregma according to rat brain atlas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Paxinos and Watson, 2007</xref>), with the cannula angled 11° toward the midline in the coronal plane as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Santini et al., 2004</xref>). A 33-gauge dummy cannula was inserted into the guide cannula to prevent clogging. Guide cannulas were cemented to the skull with dental acrylic (Grip Cement) and the incision was sutured. Buprenorphine hydrochloride (75 mg/kg s.c.; Buprex) was administered for post-surgical analgesia. Rats were allowed at least 7 days for surgery recovery. Trace fear conditioning was conducted in a chamber of 25 × 31 × 25 cm with aluminum and Plexiglas walls (Coulbourn, Allentown, PA). The floor consisted of stainless-steel bars (26 parallel steel rods 5 mm diameter, 6 mm spacing) that can be electrified to deliver a mild shock. A speaker was mounted on the outside wall, and illumination was provided by a single overhead light (miniature incandescent white lamp 28 V). The rectangular chamber was situated inside a sound-attenuating box (Med Associates, Burlington, VT) with a ventilating fan, which produced an ambient noise level of 58 dB. The CS was a 4 kHz tone with a duration of 30 s and an intensity of 80 dB. The US was a 0.4 mA scrambled footshock, 0.5 s in duration, which co-terminated with the tone during the conditioning phase. Between sessions, floor trays and shock bars were cleaned with soapy water and the chamber walls were wiped with a damp cloth. An additional Plexiglas chamber served as a novel context for the auditory cue test. This chamber, which was a triangle with a black smooth Plexiglas floor, was physically distinct from the fear conditioning chamber. All the environmental conditions were completely different regarding the fear conditioning test except for the ventilating fan. Before placing rats into this chamber, the chamber floor and walls were wiped with 30% vanilla solution to provide a background odor distinctive from that used during fear conditioning. The activity of each rat was recorded with a digital video camera mounted on top of each behavioral chamber. 30 min before extinction training, saline (NaCl 0.9%), IGF-1 (10 μM; Preprotech), or the IGF-1R antagonist 7-[<italic>cis</italic>-3-(1-azetidinylmethyl)cyclobutyl]−5-[3-(phenylmethoxy)phenyl]−7H-pyrrolo[2,3-]pyrimidin-4-amine (NVP-AEW 541, 40 μM; Cayman Chemicals) plus IGF-1 were infused into the IL. For the infusions, cannula dummies were removed from guide cannulas and replaced with 33-gauge injectors, which were connected by polyethylene tubing (PE-20; Small Parts) to 100 μl syringes mounted in an infusion pump (Harvard Apparatus). Drugs were infused at a rate of 0.5 μl/min for 1 min as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fontanez-Nuin et al., 2011</xref>).</p><sec id="s4-3-1"><title>Non-cannulated animals</title><p>Animals were divided into two groups, the conditioned group (COND) and the extinguished group (EXT). On day 1, rats received three habituation trials (tone-no shock; habituation phase) into two different contexts (context 1: square shock box and context 2: triangle box with soft floor). On day 2, rats received three conditioning trials (tone paired with shock; context 1; condition phase). On day 3, rats of COND group remained in their home cage, whereas rats of EXT group received 20 tone-alone trials (context 2; extinction phase). On day 4, both groups of rats received five tone-alone trials to test for recall of conditioning or extinction (test phase) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-2"><title>Cannulated animals</title><p>Animals were divided into the saline group (SAL) and the different drug groups (IGF-1 or NVP + IGF-1). On day 1, rats received three habituation trials into the two contexts aforementioned. On day 2, rats received three conditioning trials. On day 3, rats were infused with saline or drug 30 min before the beginning of the extinction phase. On day 4, all groups of rats received five tone-alone trials in the same chamber (context 2) to test for recall of extinction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). In all phases of the experiment, the interval between successive tones was variable, with an average of 2 min. All groups were tested on the same day to determine the long-term changes occurring in the mPFC that gate subsequent memory retrieval.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Data analysis</title><p>Data were analyzed using pClamp (Molecular Devices), Excel (Microsoft), and GraphPad Prism 8.3 software. Twenty responses were averaged except when otherwise indicated. The magnitude of the change in peak EPSCs, IPSCs, and PSPs amplitude was expressed as a percentage (%) of the baseline control amplitude and plotted as a function of time. The presynaptic or postsynaptic origin of the observed regulation of EPSCs and IPSCs amplitudes was tested by estimating the PPR changes, which were considered to be of presynaptic origin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Clark et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Creager et al., 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kuhnt and Voronin, 1994</xref>) and were quantified by calculating a PPR index (R2/R1), where R1 and R2 were the peak amplitudes of the first and second synaptic currents, respectively. To estimate the modifications in the synaptic current variance, we first calculated the noise-free coefficient of variation (CVNF) for the synaptic responses before and 40 min after applying IGF-1 in the bath with the formula CVNF = √(δXPSC<sup>2</sup> − δnoise<sup>2</sup>)/m; δXPSC<sup>2</sup> and δnoise<sup>2</sup> (X = E excitatory or X = I inhibitory) are the variances of the peak EPSC or IPSC and baseline, respectively, and m is the mean EPSC or IPSC peak amplitude. The ratio of the CV measured before and 40 min after applying IGF-1 (CVr) was obtained for each neuron as CV after IGF-1 responses/CV control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Clements, 1990</xref>). Finally, we constructed plots comparing variation in M (m after IGF-1 responses over m at control conditions) against the changes in response variance of the EPSC or IPSC amplitude (1/CVr2) for each cell. In these plots, values were expected to follow the diagonal if the EPSC or IPSC depression had a presynaptic origin. Results are given as mean ± SEM (N = numbers of cells). There were no gender differences in our experiments. MiniAnalysis software (SynaptoSoft Inc) and pCLAMP software were used for the analysis of the frequency and amplitude of mEPSCs. See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> for a detailed description of the statistical analyses performed in these experiments.</p><p>The total freezing time during the 30 s tone was measured and converted to a percentage of freezing. Freezing was defined as the cessation of all movements except respiration. The percentage of freezing time was used as a measure of conditioned fear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blanchard and Blanchard, 1972</xref>). The behavioral data were analyzed by manual evaluation of the videos and/or using the ImageJ free software with the plugging developed for this purpose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Shoji et al., 2014</xref>). No differences were observed with both methods. Values are reported as the means ± SEM. See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> for a detailed description of the statistical analyses performed in these experiments.</p><p>Blind experiments were not performed in the study but the same criteria were applied to all allocated groups for comparisons. Randomization was not employed. The sample size in whole-cell recording experiments was based on the values previously found sufficient to detect significant changes in past studies from the lab.</p><p>Statistical analysis was performed using Prism 9 (GraphPad). Prior to any statistical analysis, we assessed normality distribution of our data using Kolmogorov–Smirnov test for normality. Then, we compared data means using t-test or Wilcoxon test for comparisons of two groups. Multiple t-test or ANOVA (one-way or two-way) test for more than two groups for parametric distributions and Mann–Whitney for non-parametric distributions. Specific statistical tests and number of animals are indicated in each figure legend.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by the following Grants: BFU2013-43668-P and BFU2016-0802-P AEI/FEDER, UE (MINECO) to D Fernández de Sevilla.

The authors suggest that IGF1 increases intrinsic excitability of L5P neurons in the infralimbic cortex (IL) by decreasing AHP. In addition, it attenuates both IPSCs and EPSCs by presynaptic mechanisms and facilitates a postsynaptic potentiation. Finally, the authors show that animals injected with IGF1 intracranially exhibit increased extinction of fear memory, and that IL-L5P neurons of these animals have reduced AHP current, increased excitability and decreased mEPSC frequency. The authors concluded that IGF1 regulates the cellular and synaptic processes underling fear memory extinction in the IL cortex.</p><p>1. Throughout the work the authors show that application of IGF1 causes the aforementioned effects, while they did not address the question whether IGF1 has a physiological role in excitability, synaptic transmission and behavioral phenotypes. It is unclear whether inhibition of IGF1R by NVP-AEW541 caused a decrease in mAHP and sAHP. Moreover, from Fig. S1 it looks like that the IGF1R antagonist has an inhibitory effect on fAHP. The authors should analyze the effect of IGF1R antagonist and show statistics for both, electrophysiological and behavioral phenotypes.</p><p>2. The authors show that IGF1 application causes a long-term depression of sAHP, while did not identify the mechanism mediating it. It would be important to identify the channel involved in AHP regulation. Moreover, it would be important to show that block of this channel occludes an increase in I-F ratio. Otherwise, the authors should acknowledge that AHP changes and I-F changes could be mediated by distinct mechanisms.</p><p>3. The authors show that IGF1 increases PSP (Fig. 3I). They increased the intensity of stimulation to get some supra-threshold events in the middle of the protocol. The authors must show that this protocol does not cause a potentiation of PSP by itself, without addition of IGF1.</p><p>4. Previous study found that extinction causes a decrease in fAHP, but not in sAHP in the IL (Santini et al., 2008). In contrast, conditioning up-regulated sAHP in that study. Moreover, a decrease in fAHP by M-channel inhibitor facilitated extinction (Santini and Porter, 2010). How do the authors explain this discrepancy between the results?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This paper examines the effects of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) on intrinsic excitability and synaptic transmission in neurons from the infralimbic cortex and on the extinction of fear memory. The authors report an increase in excitability mediated by the reduction of mAHP and a reduction in excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission. They also show that IGF-1 facilitates the extinction of fear memory.</p><p>This paper is interesting however, there are many issues. First, IGF-1 application is rather artificial and therefore this does not correspond to a natural way of stimulating neurons. In addition, some protocols and measures must be clarified.</p><p>It is not clear what the authors precisely measured when the declare measuring mAHP and sAHP. In contrast with what seems inferred by the authors the medium and slow AHPs can be measured with the same depolarization. In addition, the sIAHP generally peaks at ~0.5-1.0 s while their records display only a current peaking at ~100 ms. So there is no sAHP in the data provided in Figure 1 and 2 and therefore, conclusion about the effect of IGF-1 on sAHP is erroneous.</p><p>Effects of IGF-1 on PSCs. The application of IGF-1 is very long (&gt;30 min) and the test time after application is too short (~15 minutes) to really consider the depression as long-lasting. The authors should consider shorter application times (5 or 10 min) and longer test times (at least 30 min) to know whether the persistent effect is due or not to an incomplete elimination of IGF-1 applied in the bath.</p><p>Does the effect of IGF-1 on intrinsic excitability long-lasting? To test this, brief application of IGF-1 should be used too.</p><p>The rational of the experiment depicted in Fig. 3I en 3J is not clear at all. Please provide details why stimulus intensity is increased during 5 min to obtain 21% of supratheshold responses.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>In this manuscript, the authors explore the involvement of IGF-1 in learning, focusing on fear extinction. They show that IGF-1 modulates network and intrinsic firing properties of L5, increasing firing frequency via inhibition of AHP and affecting network properties by reducing the release probability of presynaptic neurons. In addition, they demonstrate a concomitant increase of the firing probability in the postsynaptic L5 neurons. Intriguingly these effects develop rather slowly, with a plateau reached after ~40 min. They further show that in vivo administration of IGF-1 during the extinction phase results in enhanced fear extinction, correlating with the long-lasting effect, of over 24 h, of AHP inhibition and increased firing.</p><p>Overall these findings are interesting, linking behavioral and neuronal changes. Nevertheless, important experimental data, that were collected during the performed experiments, are not presented, leaving the reader with a partial view (see below in the comments). Moreover, some controls are missing (see below) and the number of cells in the electrophysiological recordings is rather low (n = 4/5/6 in many key figures).</p><p>1. Apart from changes in AHP, were there any additional changes in single AP properties? Did you observe any changes in AP threshold? Kinetics of upstroke or decay? Max amp? Duration? Input resistance?</p><p>The examples shown in Fig 1E depicts similar AHP with repetitive firing. If so, additional alteration in AP properties may be responsible for increased firing following IGF-1 application.</p><p>2. Fig. 1 - AHP amplitudes are presented as deltas, but the reference point is unclear, was it AP threshold? Also, since these are paired recordings, an illustration highlighting the pairs can be useful.</p><p>Were there differences in the time to max AHP? Were there differences between the % change in mAHP and sAHP for each cell? A similar % reduction in both may indicate a common mechanism, while the lack of correlation between mAHP and sAHP may hint that multiple mechanisms are at play. How long did you perfuse IGF-1? (~40 min?) what was the kinetics of this effect?</p><p>3. Fig 1B, D. The variability seems to be lower in the NVP group compare to the ACSF group. Could that be attributed to the variable levels of endogenous IGF-1?</p><p>4. Fig 1E. Did you observe AHP alterations during prolonged firing? the presented examples depict similar AHP levels after each AP and the potential at the end of the pulse is slightly more hyperpolarized after IGF1 addition, in contrast to Fig. 1A. Are there any other parameters that might support enhanced firing?</p><p>5. How many rats were used for each data set? this is not indicated throughout the manuscript.</p><p>6. The slow kinetics of the AHP and synaptic currents response to IGF1, as well as the long-lasting effect observed following IGF-1 washout (in slices and in vivo), should be discussed. Such slow kinetics may suggest the possible involvement of protein synthesis or insertion/endocytosis.</p><p>7. Line 273 - did you mean &quot;did not require depolarization&quot;? Sup Fig 2 depicts sAHP reduction of over 60% without depolarization. The time courses, with or without stimulation, are somewhat different, but the endpoints (after 50 min) are similar (showing maybe even a bit more inhibition without depolarization). Thus, depolarization may facilitate the process, but is not a prerequisite.</p><p>8. Lines 288-290 - &quot;Additionally, this modulation was not observed when the synaptic stimulation was absent (Figure 3D), suggesting that the evoked synaptic responses were required for this LTD of the EPSCs&quot;. This statement is confusing and is not supported by the data. Comparing Fig. 3A and 3D, the endpoints (after 50 min) are similar, with inhibition levels of 30-40%. Thus, synaptic stimulation during IGF-1 application is not required for presynaptic LTD. Despite that, as for the kinetics of AHP, depolarization may in fact facilitate this effect. Thus, two mechanisms may coexist: one that supports EPSC inhibition with synaptic activation, with faster kinetics that plateaus within 10 min of IGF1 application, and another slower process, independent of synaptic activation, which plateaus at 50 min. This point requires further clarification and discussion.</p><p>9. For IPSCs, the kinetics is similar with or without stimulation. But, the level of inhibition after 50 min is doubled without synaptic stimulation. These properties should also be further discussed.</p><p>10. Fig 3I-J - These results are very interesting and important, as mimicking of firing by synaptic activation takes into account changes in multiple presynaptic neurons (excitatory and feedforward inhibition), as well as postsynaptic changes. Indeed, firing in response to current injection into the soma is less physiological. Moreover, SK channels in different cellular locations were shown to confer contradicting effects on EPSPs amplitude and duration, and thus on neuronal excitability (studied by the Stuart lab as well as others). However, valuable information is missing here as well. Did you see changes in PSP duration? changes in feedforward inhibition? AP properties? do you see similar AHP inhibition also with synaptic activation?</p><p>The opposing effects observed in voltage clamp and current clamp modes (reduced EPSP amplitude with increased PSP depolarization) need to be discussed. While one possibility for this can be a change in the input resistance, another may reside in alterations of the interplay between dendritic SK and NMDA channels (see Bock et al. 2019). Also, the mechanism for enhanced firing with synaptic stimulation may be different from increased firing with current injection. In addition to the site of depolarization, synaptic stimulations were given at low freq , as oppose the high frequency firing with prolonged depolarization. While the rate of synaptic stimulation is not specified for the current clamp experiments shown (should be added please), the graphical representations suggest 1 stim/min. What was the duration of IGF-1 application here? The methods section indicates 15 min, but the graph and legend specify 35 min. The kinetics for PSP potentiation seems to be faster, compared to the VC experiments. Any indication of the underlying cause?</p><p>11. Overall the method section is missing some vital information. Was the age of the rats used for behavioral experiments also P20 - P30? were the surgeries performed at P20? with 7 days recovery the behavioral experiments supposedly spanned P28 - 31, correct? what were the intervals between each step of the trials (cond, ext, test)?</p><p>12. Fig 4 - What was the effect of NVP alone? this control is vital. IGF-1R was shown to be fully activated at baseline conditions (Gazit et al. 2016), thus, with NVP and IGF-1, some R might still be functional and activated by IGF1, resulting in partial inhibition by NVP. Moreover, the main conclusion here seems to be drawn from the relatively low levels of fear extinction in the saline group (note the typo - extintion). Comparing the data in Fig 4 to Sup Fig 3, sup Fig 3 illustrates what seems to be further extinction during the extinction phase, as well as during the test phase. Reduction in freezing is missing in the saline group shown in Fig 4. What might reconcile these observations?</p><p>13. Was there a correlation between the sAHP amplitude and freezing behavior? One might expect lower sAHP amp in rats with better extinction levels.</p><p>14. Did you also observe lower levels of mAHP after in vivo application of IGF1/NVP? any effect on fAHP? is it possible to see a further reduction of sAHP with acute bath application of IGF-1 in mice that were pre-treated with IGF-1 during fear extinction? this would reveal the dynamic range of this long-lasting effect.</p><p>15. The variability in mEPSC is large, especially in the IGF-1 group. Recordings from more cells can fix that.</p><p>16. The molecular mechanism is not sufficiently addressed. The authors suggest that SK-, m-currents or mGluR5 might be involved. However, no direct evidence for the specific involvement of these channels is provided, nor any explanation for the slow and long-lasting effect observed.</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;IGF-1 facilitates extinction of conditioned fear&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by John Huguenard (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>1. The authors performed new experiments showing that inhibition of IGF1Rs occludes the effects of exogenously applied IGF1, but does not cause any effect on neuronal/synaptic function and memory extinction. This raises the question whether endogenous IGF1 plays a physiological role in these processes? In the discussion the authors claim that &quot;....IGF-1 appears as a key endogenous molecule in the modulation of the extinction of conditioned fear memory, supporting the role of IGF-1 as a crucial piece in behavioral tasks.&quot; Unfortunately, the results do not support this central claim.</p><p>We would like to ask the authors to modify these claims and to provide some additional discussion on the relevance of the results to some conditions with elevated cerebral IGF1 levels.</p><p>2. The authors performed new experiments showing that inhibition of G protein activation by GDPβs prevents the reduction in mAHP, while had no effect on sAHP (Fig. 2F-G). First, in the Fig. 2G the mAHP seems to be altered as well. The p-value for this comparison is 0.06, and an additional single cell may render GDPβs ineffective at all at preventing the effect of IGF1 on AHP (6 cells per group seems rather low). Second, the authors wrote in their discussion: &quot;In our study, inhibition of G protein-coupled receptors by GDPβs abolished the IGF-1-mediated reduction of mIAHP, suggesting that the effect of IGF-1 on mAHP could be mediated by the activation of mGluR5.&quot; This conclusion is far reaching since there are many other possible mechanisms may explain this effect. The authors should tone down this claim since no evidence on mGluR5 involvement is provided.</p><p>3. Figure 5, which is supposed to present mEPSC data, is missing.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.67267.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the authors resubmitted a revised version of the paper for consideration.

It has been shown that the acquisition of extinction memory depends on protein synthesis (Santini et al., 2004). In our study, we show that IGF-1 favors the acquisition of extinction memory when applied directly to the IL in vivo. Therefore, it is tempting to hypothesize that the slow onset kinetics of AHP reduction that we observed after bath perfusion of IGF-1 in brain slices are suggestive of a mechanism involving protein synthesis, although further experiments would be needed to confirm it. Consistent with our observations in brain slices (plateau of AHP reduction is reached after 30 min), AHP amplitude is reduced in IL neurons from rats where the extinction memory was consolidated (recordings from the test day in IGF-1treated animals). Moreover, we found that a reduction in AHP amplitude was directly correlated with a reduction in the expression of fear, suggesting that mechanisms favoring a greater AHP reduction would produce an enhancement of the acquisition of extinction memory”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8.

These properties should also be further discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>After performing a new analysis, we agree with the reviewer on the coexistence of two mechanisms for the LTD of both the EPSC and IPSC. This possibility is now discussed in the new version of the manuscript accordingly (page 23): “Interestingly, we observed that two mechanisms coexist in the development of the LTD of EPSCs and IPSCs following IGF-1 application. The first one is dependent on synaptic activation and is characterized by a fast onset, the plateau being achieved at 10-15 min after IGF-1 application. The second one is independent of synaptic activation and is characterized by a slower onset, achieving the plateau at 40 min after IGF-1 application”.</p><p>Moreover we included the statistical analysis comparing the inhibition levels in the Figure 3A and 3D for EPSC and Figure 3E and 3H for IPSC (see Supplementary Table 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11. Fig 3I-J - These results are very interesting and important, as mimicking of firing by synaptic activation takes into account changes in multiple presynaptic neurons (excitatory and feedforward inhibition), as well as postsynaptic changes. Indeed, firing in response to current injection into the soma is less physiological. Moreover, SK channels in different cellular locations were shown to confer contradicting effects on EPSPs amplitude and duration, and thus on neuronal excitability (studied by the Stuart lab as well as others). However, valuable information is missing here as well. Did you see changes in PSP duration? changes in feedforward inhibition? AP properties? do you see similar AHP inhibition also with synaptic activation?</p></disp-quote><p>We have shown the lack of effect of IGF-1 in the AP properties and PSP duration (see Figure 3). However we did not study the modulation of the AHP evoked by synaptic activation nor the possible changes in the feedforward inhibition.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12. The opposing effects observed in voltage clamp and current clamp modes (reduced EPSP amplitude with increased PSP depolarization) need to be discussed. While one possibility for this can be a change in the input resistance, another may reside in alterations of the interplay between dendritic SK and NMDA channels (see Bock et al. 2019).</p></disp-quote><p>We have now discussed the possible mechanisms for the PSP potentiation in the manuscript (page 23): “However, the increase in the input resistance induced by IGF-1 could also explain the resultant LTP of the PSPs nonetheless of the reduction in the release of neurotransmitters. Since SK channels have been shown to modulate NMDA receptors (Jones et al., 2017; Ngo-Anh et al., 2005), we cannot discard a putative IGF-1dependent modulation of SK channels as the source of the potentiation in the synaptic transmission. The resultant LTP of the PSPs and the increase in the input resistance summed to the decrease of the AHPs would result in the increase of the L5PN activity of the IL and its effect on the fear extinction memory”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>13. Also, the mechanism for enhanced firing with synaptic stimulation may be different from increased firing with current injection. In addition to the site of depolarization, synaptic stimulations were given at low freq , as oppose the high frequency firing with prolonged depolarization. While the rate of synaptic stimulation is not specified for the current clamp experiments shown (should be added please), the graphical representations suggest 1 stim/min.</p></disp-quote><p>Recordings were done at 0.33 Hz (1 stim each 3-s) and the average response of 20 recordings (1 min) was represented (e.g., Figure 3I).

The methods section indicates 15 min, but the graph and legend specify 35 min. The kinetics for PSP potentiation seems to be faster, compared to the VC experiments. Any indication of the underlying cause?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for noticing this inconsistence. We have now clarified that the duration of IGF-1 application was 35 minutes (see page 8, lines 139 and 141) in both voltage-clamp (VC) and current-clamp (CC). The development over time of PSP potentiation seems to be faster in CC compared to VC, which could be explained because of the increase in the membrane resistance (see page 14, line 262, and Figure supplementary 2H).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>15. Overall the method section is missing some vital information. Was the age of the rats used for behavioral experiments also P20 - P30? were the surgeries performed at P20? with 7 days recovery the behavioral experiments supposedly spanned P28 - 31, correct? what were the intervals between each step of the trials (cond, ext, test)?</p></disp-quote><p>Material and Methods section has been extensively rewritten in the new version of the manuscript. For behavioral experiments, rats underwent surgery at postnatal day 21 (after weaning) and were allowed to recover for 7-9 days. Therefore, behavioral tests were started at postnatal day 28-30 and finished at postnatal day 32-34. This same day (P32-P34), animals were sacrificed, and the electrophysiological recordings were done. The interval between each step of the trial was 24 h. All this information is now stated in the Material and Methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>16. Fig 4 - What was the effect of NVP alone? this control is vital. IGF-1R was shown to be fully activated at baseline conditions (Gazit et al. 2016), thus, with NVP and IGF-1, some R might still be functional and activated by IGF1, resulting in partial inhibition by NVP. Moreover, the main conclusion here seems to be drawn from the relatively low levels of fear extinction in the saline group (note the typo - extintion). Comparing the data in Fig 4 to Sup Fig 3, sup Fig 3 illustrates what seems to be further extinction during the extinction phase, as well as during the test phase. Reduction in freezing is missing in the saline group shown in Fig 4.

Did you also observe lower levels of mAHP after in vivo application of IGF1/NVP? any effect on fAHP? is it possible to see a further reduction of sAHP with acute bath application of IGF-1 in mice that were pre-treated with IGF-1 during fear extinction? this would reveal the dynamic range of this long-lasting effect.</p></disp-quote><p>a.

The authors performed new experiments showing that inhibition of IGF1Rs occludes the effects of exogenously applied IGF1, but does not cause any effect on neuronal/synaptic function and memory extinction. This raises the question whether endogenous IGF1 plays a physiological role in these processes? In the discussion the authors claim that &quot;....IGF-1 appears as a key endogenous molecule in the modulation of the extinction of conditioned fear memory, supporting the role of IGF-1 as a crucial piece in behavioral tasks.&quot; Unfortunately, the results do not support this central claim.</p><p>We would like to ask the authors to modify these claims and to provide some additional discussion on the relevance of the results to some conditions with elevated cerebral IGF1 levels.</p></disp-quote><p>In agreement with the reviewer, we have modified the claim as follows: “Therefore, our results show a novel functional consequence of IGF-1 signalling on animal behavior in the mPFC through the modulation of the extinction of conditioned fear memory”. (page 11, line 215)</p><p>We have also provided an additional discussion of the relevance of our results to elevation of cerebral IGF-1 levels observed after running. We have included the following paragraph: “Functional relevance of the IGF-1 modulation in the mPFC. IGF-1 is actively transported to the central nervous system from plasma through the choroid plexus (Carro et al., 2000), and it is also locally produced in the brain by neurons and glial cells (Quesada et al., 2007; Suh et al., 2013; Rodriguez-Perez et al., 2016). Interestingly, the uptake of IGF-1 by the brain correlates with frequency-dependent changes in cerebral blood flow in the cortex during information processing (Nishijima et al., 2010). Therefore, the levels of IGF-1 in the IL would depend on both its active transport from the plasma, favoured by the activity involved in information processing, and in the IGF-1 locally produced by neurons and astrocytes of the IL. Thus, high levels of IGF-1 are expected in the IL because its high activity during the extinction of fear conditioned (Milad and Quirk, 2002; Sepulveda-Orengo et al., 2013). Our results demonstrate that a further increase in the IGF-1 levels due to the exogenous application of IGF-1 in the IL favour the extinction of conditioned fear. In natural conditions, these high levels of IGF-1 could be expected after physical exercises because it is known that IGF-1 uptake from the plasma and IGF-1 levels in the brain are increased after running, reaching the higher levels (Carro et al., 2000). Thus, our results could be related with some of the benefits of physical exercise on the brain function by increasing neuronal excitability and favouring synaptic plasticity and learning and memory through the activation of the IGF-1Rs”. (page 17, line 352)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The authors performed new experiments showing that inhibition of G protein activation by GDPβs prevents the reduction in mAHP, while had no effect on sAHP (Fig. 2F-G). First, in the Fig. 2G the mAHP seems to be altered as well. The p-value for this comparison is 0.06, and an additional single cell may render GDPβs ineffective at all at preventing the effect of IGF1 on AHP (6 cells per group seems rather low). Second, the authors wrote in their discussion: &quot;In our study, inhibition of G protein-coupled receptors by GDPβs abolished the IGF-1-mediated reduction of mIAHP, suggesting that the effect of IGF-1 on mAHP could be mediated by the activation of mGluR5.&quot; This conclusion is far reaching since there are many other possible mechanisms may explain this effect. The authors should tone down this claim since no evidence on mGluR5 involvement is provided.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer. We have increased the number of experiments studying the effect of GDPβs (n = 8) and data confirms that GDPβs prevents the IGF-1-mediated reduction in mAHP (p = 0.109), while had no effect on sAHP reduction (p = 0.023) (Supplementary Table 1).</p><p>In agreement with the reviewer, we have tone down this claim by replacing it by the following conclusion: “In our study, inhibition of G protein-coupled receptors by GDPβs abolished the IGF-1-mediated reduction of mIAHP, suggesting that the effect of IGF-1 on mAHP is mediated by the activation of metabotropic receptors. One candidate are the mGluRs, since it has been demonstrated that the activation of mGluR5 increases IL-L5PN excitability (Fontanez-Nuin et al., 2011) and modulates the recall of extinction (Fontanez-Nuin et al., 2011; Sepulveda-Orengo et al., 2013) in a similar way to what we describe for IGF-1. However, we can't rule out the involvement of other GPCRs and a further study is required to analyse the type of metabotropic receptor and the signalling pathway mediating the reduction of the mAHP by the IGF-1”.
