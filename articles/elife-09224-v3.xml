Here, we use a single-molecule approach to monitor SpoIIIE translocation when challenged with neutral-backbone DNA and non-hydrolyzable ATP analogs. We show that SpoIIIE makes multiple essential contacts with phosphates on the 5'→3' strand in the direction of translocation. Using DNA constructs with two neutral-backbone segments separated by a single charged base pair, we deduce that SpoIIIE’s step size is 2 bp. Finally, experiments with non-hydrolyzable ATP analogs suggest that SpoIIIE can operate with non-consecutive inactive subunits. We propose a two-subunit escort translocation mechanism that is strict enough to enable SpoIIIE to track one DNA strand, yet sufficiently compliant to permit the motor to bypass inactive subunits without arrest. We speculate that such a flexible mechanism arose for motors that, like SpoIIIE, constitute functional bottlenecks where the inactivation of even a single motor can be lethal for the cell.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.09224.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.09224.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09224.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p><italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> is a bacterium that lives in the soil. When food is in short supply, <italic>B. subtilis</italic> stops reproducing and individual bacterial cells transform into spores that lay dormant until conditions improve. While, <italic>B subtilis</italic> is generally harmless, it forms spores in a similar way to other bacteria that cause diseases such as anthrax.</p> <p>During spore formation, a membrane forms to divide the cell into a large mother cell and a smaller “forespore” cell. Then, a copy of the mother cell’s DNA – which is made of building blocks called bases – moves into the forespore. A group of proteins called SpoIIIE is instrumental in this process as it uses energy from a molecule called ATP to pump the DNA across the membrane at the rapid speed of 5,000 base pairs of DNA per second. SpoIIIE contains six individual protein subunits that form a ring-shaped motor structure that spans the membrane. It belongs to a large family of proteins that are found in all living organisms and drive many vital processes.</p> <p>How does SpoIIIE interact with DNA and how do the individual subunits coordinate their behaviour? Liu, Chistol et al. address these questions by using instruments called optical tweezers, which use a laser beam to hold and manipulate tiny objects. The experiments show that to move a fragment of DNA across a membrane, SpoIIIE only makes contact with one of the two strands that make up the DNA molecule. The experiments suggest that the DNA is handed over from one SpoIIIE subunit to another in a sequential order. This would allow the DNA to remain bound to SpoIIIE at all times as it passes through the membrane.</p> <p>Next, Liu, Chistol et al. measured how SpoIIIE steps along the DNA and found that each subunit takes a small two base pair step when energy is released from a single molecule of ATP. There is an element of flexibility in the system, because SpoIIIE can still move DNA normally even if some subunits cannot use energy from ATP. This provides a fail-safe mechanism that still allows the cells to form spores in the event that one subunit is disabled. Future work will concentrate in understanding how the subunits communicate around the ring to coordinate their sequential use of ATP and their DNA pumping activity.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.09224.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.09224.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>SpoIIIE/FtsK</kwd><kwd>single-molecule</kwd><kwd>step size</kwd><kwd>intersubunit coordination</kwd><kwd>neutral DNA</kwd><kwd>Ring Atpase</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>B. subtilis</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bustamante</surname><given-names>Carlos</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM071552</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bustamante</surname><given-names>Carlos</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM032543</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bustamante</surname><given-names>Carlos</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000015</institution-id><institution>U.S. Department of Energy</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DE-AC02-05CH11231</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bustamante</surname><given-names>Carlos</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The subunits of the SpoIIIE motor contact the 5'→3' strand of DNA in sequence to rapidly translocate the DNA across a membrane.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The ASCE [Additional Strand Conserved E (glutamate)] division of oligomeric, ring-shaped NTPases encompasses a diverse range of enzymes that function as molecular motors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lyubimov et al., 2011</xref>). Within the ASCE division, the FtsK/SpoIIIE family of motors is involved in the fundamental process of DNA segregation prior to cell division. During the <italic><italic>Bacillus</italic> subtilis</italic> sporulation lifecycle, an asymmetric division septum closes around one of the sister chromatids before complete chromosome segregation, trapping about two-thirds of the chromosome in the mother cell compartment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Burton et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Wu and Errington, 1994</xref>). To complete chromosome segregation, SpoIIIE must translocate the DNA from the mother cell into the forespore. SpoIIIE and its closely related <italic><italic>Escherichia</italic> coli</italic> homologue FtsK, contain an N-terminal transmembrane domain that anchors the protein to the division septum, a long unstructured polypeptide linker and a C-terminal-soluble motor domain consisting of subdomains α, β, and γ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barre, 2007</xref>). Subdomains α and β adopt a RecA-like fold containing ATP binding and hydrolysis motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Massey et al., 2006</xref>), while subdomain γ imparts translocation directionality to the motor (sequence dependence) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Besprozvannaya et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Lee et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Löwe et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ptacin et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">2008</xref>). Crystallography and electron microscopy studies indicate that both FtsK and SpoIIIE form homo-hexameric rings, and that double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) is threaded through their central pore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cattoni, et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cattoni et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Massey et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>A distinguishing characteristic of SpoIIIE/FtsK is their enormous translocation velocity (∼5 kbp/s) and their ability to work against high forces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ptacin et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Saleh et al., 2004</xref>). Previous single-molecule studies of these motors focused primarily on investigating the mechanism of sequence recognition and translocation direction reversal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Lee et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Pease et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ptacin et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Saleh et al., 2004</xref>), studying how they strip off DNA-bound proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Lee et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Marquis et al., 2008</xref>), and determining the amount of supercoils introduced in the DNA during translocation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Saleh et al., 2005</xref>). However, many fundamental aspects of these motors’ operation remain poorly understood: How does the motor interact with its DNA track during translocation? What is the motor step size? How does the motor coordinate the activity of its individual subunits? How is the subunit coordination mechanism optimized for the motor’s specific biological task?</p><p>To answer these questions, we used single-molecule manipulation and measurement techniques. Using modified DNA with a neutral backbone, we show that SpoIIIE makes critical electrostatic contacts with the phosphate backbone on the 5'→3' strand in the direction of translocation. This observation indicates that the individual subunits operate in a well-defined sequential order around the ring. To determine the SpoIIIE step size, we challenged the motor to translocate a DNA molecule containing two neutral segments of variable lengths separated by a charged base pair. This hybrid construct revealed the periodicity of motor–DNA interactions, suggesting that each SpoIIIE subunit takes a 2-bp step per ATP hydrolyzed. Experiments where non-hydrolyzable nucleotides were used to probe the intersubunit coordination within the motor suggest that SpoIIIE can tolerate non-consecutive inactive subunits, implying a degree of flexibility in the sequential operation of the motor. Finally, we propose a two-subunit DNA escort model that can rationalize all these data and that correctly predicts the degree of supercoiling introduced by SpoIIIE during translocation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>To monitor DNA translocation by SpoIIIE, we used a single-molecule assay developed previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Smith et al., 2003</xref>). Briefly, a DNA-coated bead was held in an optical trap while a SpoIIIE-coated bead was held on a micropipette (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>); SpoIIIE engaged the DNA when the beads were in close proximity, and translocated the DNA only in the presence of ATP. The DNA was held under constant tension by continuously adjusting the trap position as translocation proceeded. At saturating [ATP] (3 mM) and a low force (5 pN) SpoIIIE translocated DNA at ∼4 kbp/s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>), in agreement with previously reported rates <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Burton et al., 2007</xref>) and <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ptacin et al., 2008</xref>). Control experiments indicate that a single SpoIIIE motor was attached to the DNA tether: (i) Protein concentration was titrated until activity was observed for only one of every ∼5 pairs of beads tested, thus reducing the likelihood that a single bead contained multiple active SpoIIIE motors. (ii) At high forces, SpoIIIE loses its grip on DNA and slips. These slipping events occurred in one fast rip, not in several steps, indicating that a single motor– DNA interaction is disrupted in each case (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09224.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Probing SpoIIIE-DNA interactions with neutral DNA inserts.</title><p>(a) Experimental geometry of the optical tweezers assay.

To investigate how SpoIIIE interacts with its substrate, we designed DNA constructs containing a modified insert with a methyl-phosphonate (MeP) backbone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>), which preserves the base pairing and overall structure of B-form DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Strauss and Maher, 1994</xref>). We first monitored SpoIIIE translocation along a substrate containing a 30-bp double-stranded MeP (dsMeP) insert, several times longer than the expected step size of the motor. Upon reaching the insert, SpoIIIE undergoes multiple slips followed by translocation recoveries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref> inset), revealing that it makes several attempts to cross the neutral segment. Despite these attempts, SpoIIIE failed to traverse the 30-bp dsMeP segment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>), indicating that motor interactions with the negatively charged phosphates are critical for translocation.</p><p>Depending on the step size of the motor, and the manner in which it interacts with the DNA, the motor should be able to easily traverse short dsMeP inserts up to some critical length. To determine this length, we designed dsMeP inserts of varying size and recorded the motor’s ability to cross each insert (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). We found that SpoIIIE can traverse dsMeP segments of 2 bp, 3 bp, and 4 bp with near-100% probability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>), but the traversal probability sharply drops to ∼50% for dsMeP inserts of 5 bp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). Importantly, this sharp reduction in insert crossing probability is accompanied by a dramatic increase in the average traversal time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>). Note that further increasing the dsMeP insert length from 5 bp to 7 bp does not significantly increase the mean traversal time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>). Taken together, these data show that 5 bp is the minimum length of dsMeP required to disrupt processive translocation by SpoIIIE, and indicate that SpoIIIE makes periodic electrostatic contacts with the DNA every 5 bp or less.<fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09224.005</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Monitoring SpoIIIE crossing of contiguous MeP inserts.</title><p>(a) Sample traces of SpoIIIE translocating on DNA with dsMeP inserts of 2 bp (blue), 3 bp (green), 4 bp (magenta), and 5 bp (black). (<bold>b</bold>) Traversal probability for dsMeP inserts of various length.

A slightly higher traversal probability (∼8%) was recorded for the 10-bp dsMeP insert (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). The dynamics of slipping and re-translocation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>, inset) at the neutral insert and the lengthy traversal times for dsMeP inserts of 5 bp or longer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>) suggest that, given a sufficient number of traversal attempts, SpoIIIE can cross even relatively long stretches of dsMeP (10–30 bp). The drop in traversal probability for longer dsMeP inserts suggests that the motor can hold onto MeP DNA for a short amount of time during which it can either step forward, or lose its grip on the neutral DNA. In other words, forward translocation along the MeP insert is in kinetic competition with backward slipping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aathavan et al., 2009</xref>). As a result, to traverse longer MeP inserts, the motor must execute a correspondingly larger number of consecutive productive power-strokes. We hypothesize that other types of motor–DNA interactions (e.g. steric) enable the motor to traverse the neutral insert given an arbitrarily large number of crossing attempts. In support of this idea, the φ29 ring ATPase has been shown to require electrostatic contacts with the DNA every 10 phosphates, but relies on steric, non-specific interactions to exert force and translocate the DNA in-between those electrostatic contacts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aathavan et al., 2009</xref>).<table-wrap id="tbl1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09224.006</object-id><label>Table 1.</label><caption><p>MeP traversal statistics.</p> <p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.09224.006">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.09224.006</ext-link></p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>DNA <bold>construct</bold></th><th>Successful crossings</th><th>Failed crossings</th><th>Total traces</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>ssMeP modification</td><td/><td/><td/></tr><tr><td><italic>30 base 3'→5' MeP</italic></td><td>23</td><td>1</td><td>24</td></tr><tr><td><italic>30 base 5'→3' MeP</italic></td><td>6</td><td>22</td><td>28</td></tr><tr><td>dsMeP Modific<italic>ation</italic></td><td/><td/><td/></tr><tr><td><italic>2 bp dsMeP</italic></td><td>21</td><td>1</td><td>22</td></tr><tr><td><italic>3 bp dsMeP</italic></td><td>16</td><td>0</td><td>16</td></tr><tr><td><italic>4 bp dsMeP</italic></td><td>21</td><td>3</td><td>24</td></tr><tr><td><italic>5 bp dsMeP</italic></td><td>13</td><td>13</td><td>26</td></tr><tr><td><italic>7 bp dsMeP</italic></td><td>3</td><td>9</td><td>12</td></tr><tr><td><italic>10 bp dsMeP</italic></td><td>1</td><td>19</td><td>20</td></tr><tr><td><italic>30 bp dsMeP</italic></td><td>1</td><td>31</td><td>32</td></tr><tr><td>Length o<italic>f</italic> M<italic>eP</italic> Probe S<italic>egment</italic>*</td><td/><td/><td/></tr><tr><td><italic>4 bp dsMeP probe</italic></td><td>7</td><td>16</td><td>23</td></tr><tr><td><italic>3 bp dsMeP probe</italic></td><td>9</td><td>16</td><td>25</td></tr><tr><td><italic>2 bp dsMeP probe</italic></td><td>6</td><td>18</td><td>24</td></tr><tr><td><italic>1 bp dsMeP probe</italic></td><td>33</td><td>4</td><td>37</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn id="tblfn1"><p>All MeP data was gathered under 5 pN of opposing force and [ATP] = 3 mM</p></fn><fn id="tblfn2"><p>*All MeP probe segments carry a 4 bp dsMeP modification upstream of the probe</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>SpoIIIE tracks the 5’→3’ strand in the direction of translocation</title><p>To determine whether SpoIIIE tracks the phosphate backbone of one or both DNA strands, we repeated the above experiment with 30-base inserts where phosphates on either strand were selectively neutralized. 23 out of 24 SpoIIIE molecules traversed the insert containing MeP on the 3'→5' strand in the direction of translocation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>, orange traces), compared to only 6 out of 28 SpoIIIE molecules that crossed the insert with a neutral backbone on the 5'→3' strand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>, magenta traces).

Strand-tracking is inconsistent with a stochastic coordination mechanism in which the six ATPase subunits execute their power-strokes at random. In such a mechanism, the subunit poised to fire is unlikely to be aligned with the tracked strand and will therefore not engage the DNA substrate. Since the DNA is held under constant tension in our experiments, a stochastically coordinated ATPase ring is expected to slip frequently, contrary to our observations.</p><p>Two possible scenarios are consistent with strand–tracking: (i) Subunits hydrolyze ATP and execute their power-strokes sequentially around the ring, such that after every power-stroke the subunit scheduled to fire next is properly aligned to interact with the phosphate backbone of the tracked strand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). In this scenario, the SpoIIIE subunits would fire consecutively (subunit 1 fires, followed by subunit 2, followed by subunit 3, etc). After subunit 1 executes its power-stroke, the helical geometry of the DNA will position the phosphate backbone of the tracked strand in close proximity to subunit 2, depending on the step size of the motor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Massey et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Strick and Quessada-Vial, 2006</xref>). Thus, motor-DNA contacts would proceed from one subunit to the next in an ordinal fashion. (ii) The motor translocates DNA in increments of 10–11 bp, which closely matches the helical periodicity of dsDNA (10.4–10.5 bp/pitch). This mechanism would ensure that after each translocation event, the motor contacts the same strand after traversing one full helical turn along the DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>). Such a mechanism is employed by the φ29 ring ATPase, which translocates DNA in 10-bp bursts and contacts the DNA backbone on the same strand every 10 base pairs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aathavan et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>The data presented above indicate that SpoIIIE makes periodic contacts with the same DNA strand every five base pairs or less and are consistent only with the sequential ATP hydrolysis mechanism outlined in scenario (i).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>MeP stepping stone constructs suggest that SpoIIIE has a step size of 2 bp</title><p>In order to rationalize how SpoIIIE easily traverses 4 bp of neutral DNA, but has difficulty crossing 5 bp of neutral DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>), we considered several motor-DNA contact models. To be consistent with the observation that SpoIIIE tracks only one DNA strand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>), all potential models require that SpoIIIE subunits fire in a well-defined sequential order around the ring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>). Furthermore, since electrostatic interactions with the backbone on one strand are critical for maintaining the motor’s grip on DNA, we reason that at least one electrostatic contact between the motor and the phosphate backbone is needed for SpoIIIE to maintain a stable grip on its DNA substrate. Finally, the pool of potential models can be further narrowed by making an assumption about the state of dsDNA inside the central pore of SpoIIIE during translocation. Although no ring-shaped dsDNA translocase has been co-crystallized with its substrate, it is thought that dsDNA is not significantly distorted within the central pore of ring ATPases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Massey et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sun et al., 2008</xref>). For example, the central channel of the FtsK ring can fully accommodate a single, undistorted B-form dsDNA strand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Massey et al., 2006</xref>). Therefore, we considered models where the helical pitch of dsDNA inside the SpoIIIE channel is similar to that of B-form DNA (10.5 bp/turn). Expanding our models to include a distorted helix similar to A-form DNA (11.0 bp/turn) would require only minor corrections and would not affect the overall predictions of these models.<fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09224.008</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Possible SpoIIIE translocation models capable of crossing 4 bp of dsMeP.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Cartoon illustrating the sequential firing of subunits A–F of SpoIIIE as it approaches a 4 bp insert of dsMeP. (<bold>b</bold>) Possible translocation models (i–v) depicting the interaction between SpoIIIE subunits (A–F) and DNA; in all models subunits fire in a sequential order (A→B→C→D→E→F→A etc).

We disfavor models where SpoIIIE subunit simultaneously contact more than two consecutive phosphate groups on the DNA backbone, and models where three or more consecutive subunits contact the DNA backbone because such models would require large motor/DNA distortions.

Although this E1/Rho-like model requires significant motor/DNA distortions (5 SpoIIIE subunits span an arc of 300° while five consecutive phosphates in dsDNA span an arc of ∼170°), it is in principle consistent with the data from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>.</p><p>While we cannot rule out more complex models that may involve non-consecutive subunits simultaneously contacting the DNA, or stochastic bursts consisting of multiple, rapid consecutive steps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cordova et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Sen et al., 2013</xref>), we favor the more parsimonious models presented here.</p><p>To distinguish among the models proposed above and to determine SpoIIIE’s step size, we challenged the motor with inserts containing a 4-bp MeP segment ('register'), followed by 1 bp of regular DNA ('stepping-stone') that is in turn followed by a variable-length MeP segment ('probe') of 1–4 bp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>). Because SpoIIIE easily crosses up to 4 bp of neutral DNA, the 4-bp register is meant to align the stepping phase of SpoIIIE with the stepping-stone segment. Motors that are not in perfect register with the stepping-stone should not establish electrostatic contacts with DNA and will either slip backward or stall. The motors that successfully traverse the entire insert should land on the stepping-stone in a 'front-foot-first' configuration—wherein only the leading motor-DNA contact is securely established—and should be able to cross a probe segment of length equal to the step size minus 1 bp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>). We found that SpoIIIE traversed a 1-bp neutral probe with near-100% probability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref> orange traces), inconsistent with the 5 subunit contact model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b v</xref> ).

The first three frames illustrate the sequential firing of subunits A, B, and C, all of which maintain at least one anchoring contact with the phosphate backbone. Because subunit D cannot make electrostatic contacts with the backbone, it fails to propel the DNA upon firing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5e</xref>, frame 5). As a result, no other subunit can establish new contacts with the DNA backbone. After subunit E translocates the DNA by 2 bp, subunit F can now latch onto a negatively charged phosphate and continue to translocate DNA. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5f</xref> illustrates how this model copes with a 2-bp MeP probe: subunit F cannot anchor itself onto the DNA, causing the motor to pause and eventually slip (as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>, magenta traces). This two-subunit DNA escort model requires one subunit to execute the power stroke while an adjacent subunit maintains its phosphate contacts during this power-stroke, escorting the DNA through the ring. In this model, the ATPase subunits translocate the DNA sequentially around the ring in a highly coordinated fashion that enables SpoIIIE to track one DNA strand. There is increasing structural evidence for this type of motor mechanism involving 'translocating' subunits and 'escorting' subunits; examples include the <italic>E.coli’s</italic> Rho helicase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Thomsen and Berger, 2009</xref>) and the papillomavirus E1 helicase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Enemark and Joshua-Tor, 2006</xref>).

The density and duration of analog-induced pauses does not depend on external force (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1e–f</xref>), consequently pauses detected at all forces were pooled together. Given the spatio-temporal resolution of our experiments, we could reliably detect pauses longer than 30 ms at 125 –250 μM ATPγS, 50 ms at 375–500 μM ATPγS, and 75 ms at 750–1000 μM ATPγS.

The fact that the characteristic life-time does not depend on ATPγS concentration suggests that all analog-induced pauses are drawn from the same distribution. Furthermore, the single-exponential dependence of the pause duration distribution indicates that the exit from the paused state is governed by a single rate-limiting event—presumably the exchange of an ATPγS molecule with one ATP which is present in saturating concentrations, as proposed for other ring ATPases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chistol et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Sen et al., 2013</xref>).

For example, <italic>n</italic>=1 (green shaded region) corresponds to a sequentially coordinated ring that pauses whenever a single subunit is bound to ATPγS; <italic>n</italic>=2 (blue shaded region) corresponds to a sequentially coordinated ring that pauses when two consecutive subunits are both bound to ATPγS, and so on. The ATPγS pause-density data corrected to account for missed pauses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6d</xref> black symbols) are best described by the model in which two (n<italic>=2</italic>) consecutive analog-bound subunits are required to induce a pause in the motor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6d</xref>, blue-shaded region). In other words, analysis of the pause density indicates that the motor can operate processively with non-consecutive inactive subunits but not with two or more consecutive subunits. This conclusion is further supported by the observation that FtsK hexamers readily bypass individual catalytically inactive ATPase subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Crozat et al., 2010</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Secondary motor-DNA interactions</title><p>We have shown that SpoIIIE translocates DNA by making crucial anchoring contacts with the negatively charged phosphate groups on one DNA strand. Although electrostatic interactions with the backbone of the 5’→3’ strand in the direction of translocation are the principal mode of motor-substrate contact, we surmise that other types of interactions (e.g. steric) play a secondary role in maintaining SpoIIIE’s grip on DNA. This inference explains why we observe small but non-zero traversal probabilities for neutral inserts of 10–30 bp, much longer than the expected motor step size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). Interestingly, SpoIIIE is more likely to traverse 30-bp inserts with a neutral backbone only on the 5’→3’ strand (6 out of 28 molecules) than 30-bp inserts with a neutral backbone on both strands (1 out of 32 molecules) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). To explain this discrepancy, we speculate that during translocation, in addition to the essential electrostatic interactions with the 5’→3’ strand, the SpoIIIE ring may also interact very weakly with charges on the 3'→5' strand. These secondary interactions could be mediated by parts of the motor other than the pore loops which execute the power – stroke.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>MeP is not expected to cause significant DNA distortions</title><p>Prior experiments on MeP DNA have established that certain patterns of neutral and charged bases can introduce large DNA distortions. An asymmetric neutralization of the phosphate backbone whereby one 'face' of the dsDNA helix had its charges removed (e.g. neutralizing bases 1-3 on one strand and bases 3-6 on the other strand) results in DNA bending toward the direction of the neutralized region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Strauss and Maher, 1994</xref>). However, a symmetric neutralization of the phosphate backbone, whereby the phosphates on both strands were uniformly neutralized, resulted in no significant DNA distortions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Strauss and Maher, 1994</xref>).</p><p>We do not expect the MeP DNA constructs used in this study to introduce significant distortions on the double helix for two reasons: (1) Magnesium ions were present in the experimental buffer at a sufficiently high concentration (10 mM), which had been demonstrated to mitigate the effect of DNA distortions due to asymmetric phosphate neutralization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Strauss and Maher, 1994</xref>). (2) In designing the MeP inserts used in this study, care was taken to avoid an asymmetric neutralization of the phosphate backbone. The majority of the experiments with MeP inserts tested in this study utilized dsMeP modifications. Thus, the backbone neutralization was symmetrically distributed and therefore not expected to cause significant DNA distortions. We tested only two single-stranded MeP/DNA hybrid constructs, with 30 consecutive neutralized bases on either strand, covering nearly three full helical turns of the DNA. Because the backbone neutralization was distributed evenly in all directions around the DNA helix, the charge neutralization should be symmetrical, and therefore, it is not expected to introduce significant DNA distortions.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>DNA translocation model</title><p>To rationalize the results of the MeP experiments, we propose a minimal translocation model in which SpoIIIE subunits fire sequentially around the ring, each subunit translocates 2 bp of DNA per power-stroke, at least two consecutive ATPase subunits contact the backbone of one DNA strand, and each subunit contacts two consecutive backbone phosphates. To be consistent with the results of the stepping-stone insert experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c–d</xref>), our two-subunit translocation-escort model requires that subunits fire in a well- defined sequential fashion (A, B, C, D, E, F, A, B, C etc) and a subunit cannot fire multiple times in a row or out of order.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>SpoIIIE does not employ the E1/Rho-like translocation model</title><p>The structures of homo-hexameric helicases E1 and Rho co-crystallized with their single-stranded nucleic acid substrates strongly support a translocation mechanism where five motor subunits contact five consecutive phosphates on the ssDNA/ssRNA backbone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Enemark and Joshua-Tor, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Thomsen and Berger, 2009</xref>), and the hydrolysis of one ATP is coupled to the translocation of one nucleotide. Although an E1/Rho-like mechanism could potentially rationalize how SpoIIIE easily traverses a dsMeP insert of 4 bp but not 5 bp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), such a model predicts that the motor would fail to traverse a stepping-stone construct with a 1-bp MeP probe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b v</xref>).

Magnetic tweezers measurements of DNA supercoiling during translocation ruled out a groove-tracking mechanism for FtsK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Saleh et al., 2005</xref>). Here, we show that SpoIIIE does indeed track one DNA strand by making specific electrostatic contacts with backbone phosphates on the 5'→3' strand in the direction of translocation, a feature reported for other RecA-like NTPases: the φ29 packaging motor, DnaB, and Rho (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aathavan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Itsathitphaisarn et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Thomsen and Berger, 2009</xref>). Unlike the φ29 ATPase, which translocates dsDNA, DnaB, and Rho are single-stranded nucleic acid translocases, and therefore track one strand by default. Interestingly, both SpoIIIE and the φ29 ATPase encircle dsDNA, positioning multiple subunits in close proximity to the dsDNA helix, while they still possess the ability to discriminate one strand from the other. How these dsDNA translocases achieve strand discrimination remains unclear.</p><p>Several studies have demonstrated that certain skewed sequences (i.e. sequences whose presence is biased on the leading vs. the lagging strand) impart directionality to FtsK/SpoIIIE translocation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Besprozvannaya et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cattoni et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Lee et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Levy et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Löwe et al., 2008</xref>). It is tempting to imagine that the strand tracking mechanism presented here could be used by SpoIIIE to read these skewed sequences (i.e. the SpoIIIE Recognition Sequences, SRS). However, the γ domains of SpoIIIE have been shown to be required for reading the SRS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ptacin et al., 2008</xref>) and co-crystal structures of dsDNA with the domain γ reveals it interacting with both DNA strands at the backbone, the major and minor grooves, and individual bases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Löwe et al., 2008</xref>). We consider it unlikely therefore, that SpoIIIE enlists the strand-tracking mechanism described here for SRS sequence recognition.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>The motor-DNA symmetry mismatch should give rise to DNA supercoiling</title><p>The electrostatic interactions between SpoIIIE and the DNA backbone are likely to have two main purposes <italic>in vivo</italic>: (i) They serve a load-bearing function by providing SpoIIIE with the grip necessary to strip-bound proteins off the DNA at the high speeds at which the motor operates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Marquis et al., 2008</xref>); and (ii) They enable the motor to supercoil the DNA during translocation. The later arises from the symmetry mismatch between the angles spanned by two adjacent SpoIIIE subunits and the angle that separates the phosphates contacted by the motor during a 2-bp step. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7a</xref> depicts the SpoIIIE-DNA complex as seen from the N terminus of the motor; in this view, SpoIIIE translocates DNA toward the viewer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Massey et al., 2006</xref>). In the two-subunit DNA escort model, the DNA is handed over from one subunit to the next and, for each 2-bp step, the motor-DNA contacts rotate clockwise around the ring by 60°. However, since B-form DNA has a helical pitch of 10.4 bp/turn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wang, 1979</xref>), the dsDNA backbone rotates clockwise by 69° for every 2 bp. Therefore, after each motor step, a counter-clockwise 9° rotation of the DNA relative to the motor is required to align the phosphate backbone with the next translocating subunit. As a result, the two-subunit escort model predicts that SpoIIIE should introduce one supercoil for every ∼80 bp of DNA translocated. The magnitude and direction of this prediction is consistent with both <italic>in vivo</italic> measurements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Nicholson and Setlow, 1990</xref>) and <italic>in vitro</italic> single-molecule experiments. Indeed, magnetic tweezers experiments revealed that SpoIIIE supercoils DNA by one turn per 100 ± 10 bp of DNA translocated (Jerod Ptacin and Marcelo Nollman, personal communication). It was previously reported that strand tracking by the φ29 ATPase, another ring-shaped dsDNA motor, also leads to DNA supercoiling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Liu et al., 2014</xref>). The results presented here for SpoIIIE suggest that DNA supercoiling may be a general feature of ring-shaped dsDNA motors that track one strand. The amount and direction of supercoiling should depend on the (i) the helical pitch of dsDNA, (ii) the periodicity of motor-DNA contacts (step size), and (iii) the motor’s inter-subunit coordination mechanism.<fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09224.013</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Two-subunit DNA escort model.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Diagram illustrating how SpoIIIE supercoils DNA while tracking the phosphate backbone of one DNA strand.

The authors of that study proposed a sequential DNA escort mechanism in which at least three motor subunits contact the DNA at any given time.

Your submission has been favorably evaluated by Richard Losick (Senior editor), a Reviewing editor, and two reviewers.</p> <p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p> <p>In this paper by Liu et al. the dsDNA translocation mechanism of the hexameric ring ATPase SpoIIIE is investigated. The authors use optical tweezers to monitor the translocation of the enzyme along DNA. In particular they study the bypass of short stretches of DNA with a neutral backbone as well as the influence of non-hydrolyzable ATP analogs. The study clearly shows that SpoIIIE contacts only one strand of the dsDNA during translocation and can traverse up to four consecutive MeP on one strand. However, five consecutive MeP hinder translocation of SpoIIIE. From this they conclude a two-subunit escort mechanism, where typically two adjacent subunits make contacts to the DNA. After stepping of one of the subunits, the DNA is moved by 2 bp providing engagement of an adjacent subunit in the translocation direction and disengagement of the trailing subunit. The experiments are well designed and carefully executed. The manuscript is clearly written and provides a consistent story. However, in contrast to previous studies where e.g. steps of the ring translocase from Phi29 were directly resolved, the present work relies on indirect evidence based on the length of backbone substitutions that can be overcome by the translocase. Though the argumentation of the authors is consistent and is further supported by the evaluation of the density of pauses originating from binding non-hydrolyzable ATP analogs, other and potentially more complex mechanisms cannot be convincingly ruled out. For example, the data does not eliminate another model where each SpoIIIE contacts one bp of dsDNA and five subunits are involved in DNA binding similar to the mechanism proposed for Rho and E1 helicases.</p> <p>Essential revisions:</p> <p>1) There is contradiction in what is said in the subsection “MeP Stepping Stone Constructs Suggest that SpoIIIE Has a Step Size of 2 bp” between the end of the last paragraph and the second paragraph. The authors say that the translocation/escort mechanism of Rho and E1 is similar to what they propose for SpoIIE. However, the two mechanisms are distinct. In Rho and E1, there are 5 consecutive subunits contacting the DNA and the step size is one bp whereas the proposed model of SpoIIIE has two consecutive subunits interacting with DNA. However, the data shown in this study does not eliminate that five consecutive subunits of SpoIIIE interact with the DNA and step size is one bp. The authors rule out this mechanism based on the stiffness of dsDNA (second paragraph). However, one can argue that the SpoIIIE ring can be distorted to enable interactions in a manner seen with Rho and E1.</p> <p>2) Because the current data do not convincingly rule out other models, further support for the model is needed by challenging the model with additional stepping stone constructs. An interesting construct would be a 2 bp stepping stone, i.e. 4bp of neutral DNA followed by 2bp stepping stone and up to 4bp probe segment of neutral DNA. For a 2 bp stepping stone, the translocase should then be able to overcome a probe segment which would be 4 bp in length. A demonstration of this would significantly strengthen the current conclusions, in particular the 2 bp stepping which is in our opinion the most novel conclusion of the paper.</p></body> </sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09224.017</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub> <body><p><italic>[…] The experiments are well designed and carefully executed.

We reasoned that given the geometry of the SpoIIIE ring (300-degree arc for 5 subunits) and that of dsDNA (~170-degree arc for 5 consecutive backbone phosphates), the E1/Rho-like mechanism would require large distortions of the motor and/or dsDNA. However, even if we allowed for large motor/DNA distortions, the results of our study are inconsistent with the E1/Rho-like mechanism. A Discussion section and accompanying figures have now been added to the manuscript.</p> <p>To summarize here, the crystal structures of the homo-hexameric helicases E1 and Rho strongly suggest a nucleic acid translocation mechanism where 5 ATPase subunits each contact consecutive phosphates on the ssDNA/ssRNA backbone and the turnover of one ATP molecule is coupled to translocation by one nucleotide. If SpoIIIE operated via the E1/Rho-like translocation mechanism (Figure 4Bv), it should have successfully traversed a double-stranded MeP insert of 4 bp, but not a dsMeP insert of 5 bp, as shown in the results presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>.</p> <p>How would this translocation mechanism cope with stepping stone constructs containing a 1-bp, 2-bp, 3-bp, or 4-bp MeP probe? <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref> illustrates two possible cases: (i) if the ATPase subunits have to fire in a strictly sequential order, a motor operating like E1/Rho would not cross a MeP stepping stone insert with a 1-bp probe, contrary to our observations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c-d</xref>); (ii) if the same ATPase subunit could fire out of order several times in a row, a motor employing a E1/Rho-like mechanism should traverse a MeP stepping stone insert with a 4-bp probe, inconsistent with our findings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c-d</xref>). We conclude that the results of our experiments rule out a E1/Rho-like translocation mechanism for SpoIIIE. In the revised manuscript we discuss the E1/Rho-like model and added Figure 5Bv and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref> to illustrate its predictions.</p> <p><italic>Essential revisions: 1) There is contradiction in what is said in the subsection “MeP Stepping Stone Constructs Suggest that SpoIIIE Has a Step Size of 2 bp” between the end of the last paragraph and the second paragraph.

The other parallel we wanted to draw is that both SpoIIIE and E1/Rho models have “translocating” subunits and “escorting” subunits, but the actual number of escorting subunits is different (4 escorting subunits in E1/Rho and one escorting subunit in SpoIIIE). We thank the reviewers for pointing this out to us. The ambiguity in wording has been eliminated and now we also highlight the differences between our model and the E1/Rho mechanism.</p> <p><italic>2) Because the current data do not convincingly rule out other models, further support for the model is needed by challenging the model with additional stepping stone constructs.

For example, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Author response image 1</xref>, both the model with a 2-bp step size and the model with a 4-bp step size cannot traverse an insert with a 2-bp stepping-stone followed by a 3-bp MeP probe (but could have traversed the stepping-stone insert if the probe were one base-pair shorter).<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09224.015</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.09224.015">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.09224.015</ext-link></p></caption> <graphic xlink:href="elife-09224-resp-fig1-v3.tif"/></fig></p> <p>In contrast, constructs with a 1-bp stepping-stone have the ability to discriminate between translocation models with 2-bp, 3-bp, 4-bp, and 5-bp step sizes as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>. We did initially consider inserts with a 2-bp stepping-stone, but opted for a design with 1-bp stepping-stone to avoid the sort of degenerate predictions illustrated in the diagram above. In addition, since SpoIIIE can slip under force and re-engage the DNA upstream of the slipping site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>, insert), constructs with a stepping-stone of 1 bp represent the most stringent crossing obstacles because 1 bp is the minimum foothold needed by the motor.</p></body> </sub-article></article>
