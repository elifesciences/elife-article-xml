In contrast, axons fail to regenerate after central nervous system injury, leading to permanent disabilities. Sensory neurons with cell bodies in dorsal root ganglia (DRG) represent one of the most useful models to study axon regeneration. Sensory neurons send a single axon which bifurcates within the ganglion; one axon proceeds centrally along the dorsal root into the spinal cord and the other proceeds along peripheral nerves. Whereas regeneration and functional recovery can occur after peripheral nerve injury, dorsal root injury, or spinal cord injury is not followed by regenerative outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Attwell et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">He and Jin, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mahar and Cavalli, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Tran et al., 2018</xref>). This results in part from a failure of central injury to elicit a pro-regenerative response in sensory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Attwell et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fagoe et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mahar and Cavalli, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Tran et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>The dorsal root injury is a useful model to understand how to promote axon growth into the central nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Smith et al., 2012</xref>). Dorsal root disruption can occur in brachial plexus injuries, leading to paralysis of the affected arm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Smith et al., 2012</xref>). Regeneration following dorsal root crush can occur along the growth-supportive environment of Schwann cells, but stops as the axons reach the transition between the peripheral nervous system and the central nervous system, termed the dorsal root entry zone, where a variety of inhibitory factors block further growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Smith et al., 2012</xref>). However dorsal root axonal growth occurs only at half the rate of peripheral axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Oblinger and Lasek, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Wujek and Lasek, 1983</xref>). The histological difference between dorsal roots and peripheral nerve is not sufficient to alter the rate of axonal regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Wujek and Lasek, 1983</xref>). Rather, the availability of trophic factors and other target derived influences via the peripheral axon were suggested to prevent the upregulation of pro-regenerative genes such as <italic>Jun</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Broude et al., 1997</xref>) or <italic>Gap43</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Schreyer and Skene, 1993</xref>). Interestingly, dorsal root injury causes up-regulation of the pro-regenerative gene <italic>Atf3</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Huang et al., 2006</xref>), but only in large diameter neurons, whereas <italic>Atf3</italic> and <italic>Jun</italic> are upregulated in a majority of neurons after peripheral nerve injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chandran et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Renthal et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Seijffers et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Tsujino et al., 2000</xref>). Spinal cord injury also leads to activation of <italic>Atf3</italic> in large diameter neurons, but this is not sufficient to promote regenerative growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ewan et al., 2021</xref>). Another possibility explaining the slow growth capacity of axons in the injured dorsal root is the contribution of non-neuronal cells.</p><p>Regeneration of axons in peripheral nerves is not cell autonomous. At the site of injury in the nerve, Schwann cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jessen and Mirsky, 2016</xref>) and macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Zigmond and Echevarria, 2019</xref>) contribute to promote axon regeneration. In the DRG, macrophages are involved in eliciting a pro-regenerative response after peripheral but not central injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kwon et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Niemi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Niemi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Zigmond and Echevarria, 2019</xref>), with anti-inflammatory macrophages believed to be more involved in the regenerative process than pro-inflammatory macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Zigmond and Echevarria, 2019</xref>). We recently revealed that satellite glial cells (SGC), which completely surround sensory neuron soma, also contribute to promote axon regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Avraham et al., 2020</xref>). PPARα signaling downstream of fatty acid synthase (FASN) in SGC promote axon regeneration in peripheral nerves, in part via regulating the expression of pro-regenerative genes in neurons, such as <italic>Atf3</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Avraham et al., 2020</xref>). Whether the different regenerative capacities after peripheral or central axon injury result, at least in part from a lack or an altered response of macrophages, SGC or other non-neuronal cells in the DRG microenvironment remains largely unknown.</p><p>To answer this question, we performed a comprehensive single-cell transcriptional profiling of DRG cells after peripheral injury (sciatic nerve crush) and central injuries (dorsal root crush and spinal cord injury). Sciatic nerve crush injures approximately half the axons projecting into the peripheral nerves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Laedermann et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Rigaud et al., 2008</xref>) and dorsal root crush injures all axons projecting into the dorsal root. Dorsal column lesion of the spinal cord damages the ascending axon branches of most large diameter neurons and leaves the descending axon branches in the spinal cord intact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Attwell et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Niu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Zheng et al., 2019</xref>). We found that gene expression changes occurred in endothelial cells, pericytes, Schwann cells, macrophages and SGC after peripheral nerve injury, but also occurred after dorsal root crush and spinal cord injury. However, each cell type responded differently to each injury. We show that SGC fail to activate the PPARα signaling pathway in response to dorsal root crush and downregulate this pathway in response to SCI. Using the PPARα agonist fenofibrate, an FDA-approved compound used to treat dyslipidemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Rosenson, 2008</xref>), axon regeneration after dorsal root crush was increased. These results indicate that the DRG microenvironment respond differently to central and peripheral axon injuries and that manipulating non-neuronal cells could lead to avenues to promote functional recovery after CNS injuries. Our study establishes a resource for understanding the functions of non-neuronal cells in the dorsal root ganglia across different types of injuries. Our data is available on a web-based resource for exploring changes in gene expression in DRG cells after central and peripheral injuries (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://mouse-drg-injury.cells.ucsc.edu/">https://mouse-drg-injury.cells.ucsc.edu/</ext-link>), which will aid the field to study the role of the DRG microenvironment in functional recovery after injury.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Profiling sensory neuron microenvironment following peripheral and central injuries</title><p>Neurons are the largest cells in the DRG but are outnumbered by many non-neuronal cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

To assess the DRG microenvironment response to central and peripheral axon injury, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) of L4, L5 mouse DRG 3 days after sciatic nerve crush injury (SNC), dorsal root crush injury (DRC), or spinal cord injury (SCI) using the Chromium Single Cell Gene Expression Solution (10 X Genomics) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D and E</xref>), as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Avraham et al., 2020</xref>). Contralateral uninjured DRG were used as control and referred thereafter to naive. The sciatic nerve is composed of axons projecting from sensory neurons residing in multiple DRG, and SNC results in ~50% of lumbar DRG neurons being axotomized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Laedermann et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Renthal et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Rigaud et al., 2008</xref>). SNC is followed by activation of a pro-regenerative program that allows functional recovery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">He and Jin, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mahar and Cavalli, 2018</xref>). SCI injures the ascending axons of a subset of large diameter sensory neurons, leaving the descending axon branches in the spinal cord intact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Attwell et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Niu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Zheng et al., 2019</xref>), and is not followed by regenerative outcomes. DRC damages all centrally projecting sensory axons in the PNS, without causing an impassable glial scar, and is followed by a slower regenerative growth compared to SNC that stops as axons reach the scar-free dorsal root entry zone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Oblinger and Lasek, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Smith et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Wujek and Lasek, 1983</xref>), providing an additional model to unravel the mechanisms promoting axon regeneration. The percent of DRG neurons lesioned under the three injury paradigms and the distance of the injury to the DRG may impact the injury responses of the microenvironment.

Comparison of population distribution between the different injury conditions revealed a reduction in the percentage of SGC after peripheral and central injuries, with an increase in the number of macrophages compared to naive condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>).

We then determined the number of differentially expressed (DE) genes in endothelial cells, pericytes, Schwann cells, macrophages, and SGC (FDR ≤ 0.05, FC ≥2). Heat map of differential gene expression in the indicated cell types revealed that the magnitude of gene expression changes was the largest after SNC, but also occurred after DRC and SCI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>), as previously suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Palmisano et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Stam et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>To further investigate how the neuronal microenvironment is affected by the different injuries, we performed cell-cell interaction analysis based on ligand-receptor expression in the different cell types for every injury condition using CellPhoneDB repository (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata2">Figure 1—source data 2</xref>).

Integrity of the peripheral nervous system is maintained by the blood-nerve-barrier (BNB), which shares many structural features with the blood brain barrier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Richner et al., 2018</xref>). An essential component of the BNB cellular architecture is tight junctions (TJ) in the endoneurial vascular endothelium or the perineurium that surrounds the nerve fascicle. Endothelial cells comprise the inner lining of vessels, while pericytes encompass blood microvessels such as blood capillaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Sims, 2000</xref>). Sensory ganglia are highly vascularized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jimenez-Andrade et al., 2008</xref>), with blood vessels in sensory ganglia being more permeable than their counterpart in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kiernan, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Reinhold and Rittner, 2017</xref>) or the nerve (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hirakawa et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jimenez-Andrade et al., 2008</xref>). Unlike in the brain, pericytes do not fully cover the blood vessel in peripheral nerve (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Stierli et al., 2018</xref>). We observed a similar situation in the DRG, with the presence of blood vessel not fully covered by pericytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). We examined changes in gene expression that occurred in endothelial cells and pericytes following peripheral and central injuries (FDR ≤ 0.05, FC ≥2) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>), as the magnitude of gene expression changes was the largest in these cells after SNC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>). t-SNE plots of endothelial cells and pericytes demonstrated different clustering of cells after SNC or DRC, while similar clustering in naïve and after SCI were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and D</xref>). Increased BNB permeability in the nerve is linked to changes in the expression of TJ genes, in particular a reduced expression of ZO-1 (<italic>Tjp1</italic>) in endoneurial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Richner et al., 2018</xref>). We thus examined the expression of tight junction (TJ) as well as adherens junction (AJ) genes. Heat map of TJ and AJ genes indicated that the response of barrier components was affected by SNC differently than DRC, with numerous junction genes being differentially expressed following SNC and DRC compared to naive and SCI condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E and F</xref>). Changes in <italic>Tjp1</italic> and <italic>Tjp2</italic> expression suggest that the BNB may be more permeable after SNC and DRC compared to naive and SCI. KEGG pathway analysis of DE genes in endothelial cells and pericytes further suggest that the BNB may be differentially altered after SNC and DRC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G and H</xref>).

KEGG analysis also revealed that the hedgehog signaling pathway and axon guidance is upregulated specifically after DRC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K</xref>).

KEGG pathway analysis of DE genes (FDR ≤ 0.05, FC ≥2) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata1">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>) revealed upregulation of cell cycle and DNA replication after SNC, while DRC and SCI macrophages mainly showed upregulation of metabolic pathways such as steroid biosynthesis and glycolysis/gluconeogenesis pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Interestingly, macrophages from all injury conditions down regulated genes related to antigen processing and presentation as well as genes involved in phagosome activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>).

Heat map of cytokines and other macrophages polarization markers suggest that macrophages responses to injury in the DRG are complex and may not easily follow the classical pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory polarization scheme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata1">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>). Furthermore, expression of the anti-inflammatory marker gene <italic>Arg1</italic> was only detected after DRC and the pro-inflammatory marker <italic>Nos2</italic> was not detected in any conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>).

Hematopoietic cell lineage pathway, which is involved in the formation of macrophages from myeloid cells, was down regulated specifically after DRC and SCI, but not after SNC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). We next explored cell division in the macrophage cluster. The cell cycle and DNA replication pathways were upregulated only after SNC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Heatmap analysis of the proliferation markers <italic>Mki67</italic>, <italic>Cdk1</italic> and <italic>Top2a</italic> further demonstrated higher expression of proliferation genes after SNC compared to naive macrophages and following central injuries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). qPCR analysis of DRG cells after SNC showed increase in <italic>Mki67</italic> expression compared to naive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). t-SNE plots overlaid with the proliferation marker genes <italic>Mki67</italic>, <italic>Cdk1</italic> and <italic>Top2a</italic> revealed expression mainly in one macrophage subtypes following SNC (~60%) and smaller clusters of proliferating cells after DRC (~20%), SCI (~14%) and in naive condition (~6%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). Validation of the scRNAseq data by immunostaining of DRG sections with the macrophage-specific marker CD68 and the proliferation marker MKI67 further revealed a higher number of CD68 and MKI67-positive cells after SNC and a trend toward an increase after DRC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G–I</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata1">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>). Higher magnification in sections demonstrates co-expression of MKI67 in CD68-positive cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). Image quantification across all conditions demonstrated that 80% of the MKI67 positive cells were also positive for CD68 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J</xref>).

These results suggest that macrophages represent a large proportion of proliferating cells in the DRG after nerve injury. This is consistent with the recent observation that macrophage expansion after nerve injury in the DRG involves proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Yu et al., 2020</xref>). However, whether the proliferating macrophages originate from resident macrophages or from the infiltration of monocytes-derived macrophages remains to be determined.

A trajectory analysis further demonstrates that Imoonglia express a transcriptome that position them between SGC and macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). To validate the scRNAseq results, which showed expression of macrophage/myeloid markers in the Imoonglia cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1E</xref>), we performed a flow cytometry experiment. We found that a subset of genetically labeled SGC (<italic>Fabp7</italic><sup>creER</sup>:<italic>Sun1<sup>GFP</sup></italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Avraham et al., 2020</xref>) express the specific macrophage/myeloid markers CD11B, F4/80 and CD45 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata1">Figure 4—source data 1</xref>). To further confirm the presence of this cell population, we performed co-immunostaining of DRG sections with CD68 and FABP7. We observed co-expression of both markers in a small population of cells with SGC morphology surrounding sensory neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref> upper, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). Macrophages can also be located in close proximity to SGC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref> bottom), suggesting that their localization around sensory neurons can resemble SGC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Avraham et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hanani, 2005</xref>). Examination of the extent of the Imoonglia population in the DRG revealed that this is a rare population, representing ~1% of all DRG cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). Interestingly, the representation of Imoonglia in the DRG increased to ~2.5% after both peripheral and central injuries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). t-SNE plot of Imoonglia cells revealed similar clustering across all conditions, suggesting similar gene expression that is not affected by injury (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>). We then pooled the Imoonglia cluster from all conditions and calculated the expression difference of each gene between that cluster and the average in the rest of the clusters ( &gt; 1.5-fold change p-value &lt; 0.05). We then compared the genes uniquely expressed in Imoonglia (1097 genes) to macrophages (2469 genes) and SGC (2331 genes) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata1">Figure 4—source data 1</xref>). This analysis revealed a higher similarity of Imoonglia cluster to macrophages (863 shared genes) than SGC (61 shared genes) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata1">Figure 4—source data 1</xref>).

KEGG pathway analysis of unique Imoonglia genes (168) and macrophage genes (1600) reveals similarity in immune-related pathways such as antigen processing and presentation, phagosome and hematopoietic cell lineage, while the top expressed pathways in SGC (2265 genes) relate to steroid biosynthesis, peroxisome and fatty acid metabolism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref>). KEGG analysis of the shared Imoonglia/Macrophage genes (863) mainly represented immune pathways while the shared Imoonglia/SGC genes (61) was enriched for metabolic pathways and cell adhesion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata1">Figure 4—source data 1</xref>).

Separate clusters emerged in SGC after SNC and DRC injuries but were similar in naïve and SCI conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). We next determined if the four sub clusters identified in naive conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>) are changing following the different injuries. An unbiased clustering of SGC in all conditions recognized seven different sub clusters, in which clusters 1–4 represent the four clusters found in naive conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig6sdata1">Figure 6—source data 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig5sdata1">Figure 5—source data 1</xref>).

After SNC, cluster 1 (blue) decreased, whereas cluster 6 (light blue) emerged and accounted for 40% of all SGC.

Dot plot analysis further supports sub-cluster changes in SGC following different injuries, revealing the percentage of cells in each cluster together with the level of expression of cluster-specific genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Analysis of DE genes for every subcluster in each injury condition revealed that the majority of gene expression changes occurred following SNC in all subclusters, with the highest changes in subcluster 4 (FDR ≤ 0.05, fold-change ≥2) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig6sdata1">Figure 6—source data 1</xref>).

First, we measured the length of the 10 longest axons, which reflect the extent of axon elongation, regardless of the number of axons that regenerate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>). Second, we measured a regeneration index by normalizing the average SCG10 intensity at distances away from the crush site to the SCG10 intensity at the crush site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>).

These results indicate that the lack of PPARα signaling in SGC after central axon injury contributes to the decreased regenerative ability.

This study provides a map of the distinct DRG microenvironment responses to peripheral and central injuries at the single-cell level and highlights that manipulating SGC in the DRG could lead to avenues to promote functional recovery after CNS injuries.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our unbiased single-cell approach fills a critical gap in knowledge for the field and enables in depth characterization of the molecular profile of cells comprising the neuronal microenvironment in the DRG following acute peripheral and central injuries. Our analysis demonstrates major, yet distinct molecular changes in non-neuronal cells in response to peripheral nerve injury and dorsal root injury, with more limited responses after SCI. It is possible that the percent of DRG neurons lesioned under any injury paradigms may impact the injury response of the microenvironment. Nonetheless, all three injury paradigms are widely used models to study the mechanisms promoting axon regeneration. Our study highlights that manipulating non-neuronal cells could lead to avenues to promote functional recovery after CNS injuries or disease.</p><p>In endothelial cells, pericytes, Schwann cells, macrophages and SGC, gene expression changes were the largest after peripheral injury, but also occurred after dorsal root crush and spinal cord injury. How non-neuronal cells in the DRG sense a distant axon injury remains poorly understood. The mechanisms underlying SGC responses to nerve injury were proposed to depend on early spontaneous activity in injured neurons as well as retrograde signaling and direct bidirectional communication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Christie et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Xie et al., 2009</xref>). DLK was shown to be important for retrograde injury signaling in sensory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Shin et al., 2019</xref>), but whether DLK also regulate SGC response to injury remains to be determined. Macrophages have been proposed to respond to chemokines expressed by injured neurons such as CCL2 for their recruitment to the DRG after nerve injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Niemi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Niemi et al., 2013</xref>) and DLK was shown to regulate the expression of cytokines such as CCL2 in neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hu et al., 2019</xref>). Injured sensory neurons also express colony-stimulating factor 1 (CSF1) in a DLK-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Guan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Wlaschin et al., 2018</xref>), which could contribute to recruit CSF1R expressing macrophages to the DRG. Whether DLK activity in neurons regulate communication to immune cells directly or via SGC will require further investigations. Our observation that SGC express CCL5 after nerve injury suggests that SGC may contribute to recruit macrophages to the DRG.</p><p>The breakdown of the BNB in response to nerve damage can lead to neuronal dysfunction and contribute to the development of neuropathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Richner et al., 2018</xref>). While the impact of physical nerve damage or disease state such as diabetic neuropathy on the BNB are being studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Richner et al., 2018</xref>), whether and how nerve injury affect the BNB in the sensory ganglion is not known. BNB leakage can give blood derived molecules direct access to sensory neurons and promote infiltration of inflammatory cells to engage inflammatory responses. Our results suggest that endothelial cells and pericytes respond differently to peripheral and central injuries, with alteration in expression of tight junction related genes, potentially underlying changes in BNB permeability. Similar to the situation in the nerve, Schwann cells and potentially macrophages may secrete factors such as VEGF and cytokines, altering endothelial cell function. Sympathetic innervation of blood vessels in the DRG following nerve injury, which depends in part on IL-6 signaling, may also underlie the changes observed in endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Ramer and Bisby, 1998a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Ramer et al., 1998c</xref>).</p><p>In the injured nerve, Schwann cells guide regenerating axons to support distal innervation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gomez-Sanchez et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jessen and Mirsky, 2016</xref>). To accomplish these regenerative functions, Schwann cells are reprogrammed to a repair state, which relies in part on the transition from an epithelial fate to a more plastic mesenchymal fate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arthur-Farraj et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Clements et al., 2017</xref>). Our studies highlight that away from the injury site in the DRG, Schwann cells respond to injury in part by regulating the hippo pathway, a central pathway in cellular growth and plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Yu and Guan, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Zhao et al., 2011</xref>). The transcription factor <italic>Yap</italic>, which is regulated by the hippo pathway, is upregulated after nerve injury but downregulated after both central injuries. The Nf2-Yap signaling was shown to play important roles in controlling the expansion of DRG progenitors and glia during DRG development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Serinagaoglu et al., 2015</xref>). These results suggest that Schwann cells in the DRG respond differently to distant peripheral and central axon injuries, and that central axon injury may limit their plasticity. Prior studies demonstrated that glial overexpression of NGF enhances neuropathic pain and adrenergic sprouting into DRG following chronic sciatic constriction in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Ramer et al., 1998b</xref>). Since <italic>Ngf</italic> is downregulated in Schwann cell after all injuries, Schwann cells in the DRG may regulate pain and adrenergic sprouting after injury.</p><p>Macrophages are known to regulate regenerative responses. In the nerve, macrophages function primarily to assist Schwann cells for debris clearance. Nerve resident macrophages in naive conditions share features with CNS microglia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Wang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Ydens et al., 2020</xref>). In the injured nerve, resident macrophages represent only a small subset that secretes chemoattractants to recruit circulating monocytes-derived macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Ydens et al., 2020</xref>). These recruited monocytes-derived macrophages express <italic>Arg1</italic> and represent the main macrophage population guiding nerve repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Ydens et al., 2020</xref>). In the naive DRG, we found that resident macrophages share similar properties with endoneurial macrophages in the nerve. However, <italic>Arg1</italic> expression is only observed after dorsal root crush and not after peripheral nerve injury or SCI. The increase in cell cycle marker after nerve injury suggest that the increase in macrophage numbers in the DRG results largely from macrophage proliferation. The increase in IL-6, which has been associated with nerve regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cafferty et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cao et al., 2006</xref>), is associated only with nerve injury and not central injuries. Immune cells in the DRG may thus not follow a strict classification and complex subtypes exist in naive conditions that are differentially regulated by peripheral and central axon injury.</p><p>Our data also unravels the existence of a small proportion of cells that share expression of macrophage and glial genes, which we named Imoonglia. These cells increase in number after all injuries. Previous studies suggested that after injury some macrophages penetrate into the space between SGC and neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hu and McLachlan, 2002</xref>). Several other studies interpreted the co-localization of SGC and immune markers as evidence that a subset of SGC express an immune cell character in human (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">van Velzen et al., 2009</xref>), rat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Donegan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jasmin et al., 2010</xref>), mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Huang et al., 2021</xref>), and canine ganglion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Huang et al., 2021</xref>). Interestingly, rat SGC express CD45, but unlike in humans, the CD45-positive cells were only present after nerve injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jasmin et al., 2010</xref>). Recent scRNAseq studies further support the presence of a populations of SGC enriched in immune-response genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mapps et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">van Weperen et al., 2021</xref>). Whether immune cells move to a peri-neuronal position and become Imoonglia or whether SGCs transition from a progenitor state to acquire an immune signature in stressful condition such as after nerve injury remains to be tested. Our single-cell profiling, flow cytometry, and immunofluorescence data suggest that Imoonglia represent a specific cell type that is increased after injury and share the spatial arrangement of SGC surrounding sensory neurons. This may be similar to astrocytes in the CNS, which in addition to their homeostatic functions can undergo an inflammatory transcriptional transition following inflammation after acute insults like stroke (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Zamanian et al., 2012</xref>), spinal cord injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Karimi-Abdolrezaee and Billakanti, 2012</xref>), and systemic inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hasel et al., 2021</xref>). It is tempting to speculate that Imoonglia may function in immune surveillance in the DRG and specifically in the case of viral infection. Indeed, SGC were suggested to restrict the local diffusion of viruses such as herpes simplex virus, varicella zoster virus, HIV-1 and haemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus, which belongs to the coronavirus family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hanani and Spray, 2020</xref>).</p><p>SGC have been previously characterized as a neural crest derived uniform glial population that plays a major role in pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hanani and Spray, 2020</xref>). Our single cell analysis reveals that SGC do not represent a uniform population but that several subtypes exist. In addition to the Imoonglia discussed above, we identified four SGC clusters in naive conditions and up to seven clusters after injury. The enrichment of different biological pathways in each cluster suggest that they each have a specialized function. Cluster 3 shares the most similarities with astrocytes and is enriched for PPARα signaling and fatty acid biosynthesis. Cluster 1 and 2 represent the most unique SGC subtypes. Interestingly, cluster 1 is enriched for calcium signaling pathway, which in SGC is known to play a role in pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hanani and Spray, 2020</xref>). It will be important to determine in future studies whether the most unique SGC subtypes (cluster 1 and 2) surround specific neuronal subtypes, or if a mosaic organization exists, with different SGC surrounding the same neuron. The appearance of a specific cluster (cluster 6) after nerve injury suggest that this cluster plays an essential role in nerve injury responses. Cluster six is also enriched for the transcription factor REST, which in astrocyte regulates gliosecretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Prada et al., 2011</xref>). Transcription factor binding site analysis of genes in cluster 6 revealed enrichment for the EMT gene <italic>Zeb1</italic>. EMT is often linked to increased plasticity and stem cell activation during tissue regeneration, suggesting that cluster 6 is related to plasticity of SGC.</p><p>In neurons, axonal PPARγ contributes to the pro-regenerative response after axon injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lezana et al., 2016</xref>) and our recent study suggest that FASN may generate ligands for PPARγ in neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ewan et al., 2021</xref>). We recently demonstrated that in SGC, FASN is required for the activation of PPARα and that PPARα signaling promote axon regeneration in adult peripheral nerves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Avraham et al., 2020</xref>). Here, we showed that this PPARα signaling pathway is not activated in SGC after injury to centrally projecting axons (SCI and DRC). Further, we demonstrate that the FDA approved PPARα agonist fenofibrate increased axon regeneration in the dorsal root, a model of poor sensory axon regeneration. In our previous study, we showed that removing the enzyme FASN, which is upstream of PPARα activation, specifically in SGC, decreases axon growth in the sciatic nerve (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Avraham et al., 2020</xref>). Altogether, these findings suggest that the lack of PPARα activation after DRC contributes to the low regeneration rates of axons in the dorsal root and provide insights into the translational potential of fenofibrate. Indeed, fenofibrate is used clinically to treat lipid disorders, and has unexpectedly been shown in clinical trials to have neuroprotective effects in diabetic retinopathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bogdanov et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Moreno and Cerù, 2015</xref>) and in traumatic brain injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2007</xref>). In mice, fenofibrate was shown to modestly increase tissue sparing following spinal contusion injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Almad et al., 2011</xref>). The neuroprotective role of fenofibrate was also recently observed in a mouse model of paclitaxel chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Caillaud et al., 2021</xref>). The enrichment of biological pathways related to PPARα signaling are largely conserved between rodent and human SGC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Avraham et al., 2021</xref>). Together, these findings support the notion that PPARα activation is a promising therapeutics for neurologic disease and CNS injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mandrekar-Colucci et al., 2013</xref>). The transcriptional profiling of SGC in response to peripheral and central axon injury highlights that manipulating non-neuronal cells could lead to avenues to treat CNS injuries.</p></sec><sec

All experiments were performed in accordance with the relevant guidelines and regulations. All experimental protocols involving mice were approved by Washington University School of Medicine (protocol #20180128). Mice were housed and cared for in the Washington University School of Medicine animal care facility. This facility is accredited by the Association for Assessment &amp; Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care (AALAC) and conforms to the PHS guidelines for Animal Care. Accreditation - 7/18/97, USDA Accreditation: Registration # 43 R-008.</p><p>During surgery, 8- to 12-week-old female C57Bl/6 mice were anesthetized using 2% inhaled isoflurane. Sciatic nerve injuries were performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Avraham et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cho et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cho et al., 2013</xref>). Briefly, the sciatic nerve was exposed with a small skin incision (~1 cm) and crushed for 5 s using #55 forceps. The wound was closed using wound clips and injured L4 and L5 dorsal root ganglia were dissected at the indicated time post-surgery. Contralateral DRG served as uninjured control. For spinal cord injury (SCI), a small midline skin incision (~1 cm) was made over the thoracic vertebrae at T9−T10, the paraspinal muscles freed, and the vertebral column stabilized with metal clamps placed under the T9/10 transverse processes. Dorsal laminectomy at T9/10 was performed with laminectomy forceps, the dura removed with fine forceps, and the dorsal column transversely cut using fine iridectomy scissors. Dorsal root injury was performed similarly as SCI, except that procedures were performed at the L2-L3 vertebral level, and fine forceps used to crush the right L4 and L5 dorsal roots for 5 s.</p><p>L4 and L5 roots are in close proximity anatomically hence both roots were crushed simultaneously where the distance from the crush site to L4 DRG is 4–5 mm and 7–8 mm to L5 DRG. During dorsal root crush, the roots are forcefully squeezed causing the disruption of nerve fibers without interrupting the endoneurial tube.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Mouse strains</title><p>Eight- to 12-week-old male and female mice were used for all experiments, except for scRNAseq experiment, where only C57Bl/6 females were used.

DRG’s were washed in HBSS and incubated with Collagenase for 20 min in 37°C. Ganglia were then mechanically dissociated to a single-cell suspension by triturating in culture medium (Neurobasal medium), with Glutamax, PenStrep and B-27. Cells were washed in HBSS+ Hepes + 0.1% BSA solution, passed through a 70 micron cell strainer. Hoechst dye was added to distinguish live cells from debris and cells were FACS sorted using MoFlo HTS with Cyclone (Beckman Coulter, Indianapolis, IN). Sorted cells were washed in HBSS+ Hepes + 0.1% BSA solution and manually counted using a hemocytometer. Solution was adjusted to a concentration of 500 cell/microliter and loaded on the 10 X Chromium system. Single-cell RNA-Seq libraries were prepared using GemCode Single-Cell 3′ Gel Bead and Library Kit (10 x Genomics). A digital expression matrix was obtained using 10 X’s CellRanger pipeline (Washington University Genome Technology Access Center). Quantification and statistical analysis were done with the Partek Flow package (Build version 9.0.20.0417).</p><p>Filtering criteria: Low-quality cells and potential doublets were filtered out from analysis using the following parameters; total reads per cell: 600–15,000, expressed genes per cell: 500–4000, mitochondrial reads &lt;10%. A noise reduction was applied to remove low expressing genes ≤ 1 count. Counts were normalized and presented in logarithmic scale in CPM (count per million) approach. An unbiased clustering (graph-based clustering) was done and presented as t-SNE (t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding) plot, using a dimensional reduction algorithm that shows groups of similar cells as clusters on a scatter plot. Differential gene expression analysis performed using an ANOVA model; a gene is considered differentially-expressed (DE) if it has an FDR ≤ 0.05 and a fold-change ≥2. The data was subsequently analyzed for enrichment of GO terms and the KEGG pathways using Partek flow pathway analysis.</p><p>A differential trajectory map of single cells was performed using ‘Monocle2’ with standard setting. The algorithm orders a set of individual cells along a path / trajectory / lineage and assign a pseudotime value to each cell that represents where the cell is along that path. This method facilitates the discovery of genes that identify certain subtypes of cells, or that mark intermediate states during a biological process as well as bifurcate between two alternative cellular fates. Partek was also used to generate figures for t-SNE, scatter plot and trajectory analysis representing gene expression.</p><p>Cell-cell interaction analysis was performed based on CellPhoneDB repository (v2.1.6),which was developed for human, the mouse genes were converted to human genes first. Statistical iterations were set at 1,000 and gene expressed by less than 10% of cells in the cluster were removed. Network visualization was performed with Cytoscape (v3.8.2) using the identified significant interactions between the clusters.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Flow cytometry</title><p>Ganglia were enzymatically and mechanically dissociated to a single-cell suspension as described above. For neuronal detection, hoechst dye was added to distinguish live cells from debris. Cells were analyzed on a Attune NxT flow cytometer (ThermoFisher Scientific). For Imoonglia detection, single cell suspensions were incubated for 15 min at 4 °C in Zombie NIR Fixable viability dye (Biolegend) diluted 1:500 in PBS, centrifuged at 420 x g for 5 min and resuspended in anti-CD16/CD32 (Fc Block; Biolegend) diluted 1:50 in FACS buffer (PBS with 2% BSA and 1 mM EDTA) for five minutes at 4°C to block Fc receptors. Cells were then incubated with F4/80-BV605, CD11b-PerCP-Cy5.5, and CD45-BV750 antibodies (all 1:200 dilution) for 10 min at room temperature in FACS buffer, centrifuged at 420 x g for 5 min and resuspended in FACS buffer. Samples were run on a Cytek Aurora spectral cytometer (Cytek). Data was analyzed using FlowJo software (Tree Star).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>TEM</title><p>Mice were perfused with 2.5% glutaraldehyde with 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M Cacodylate buffer, followed by post fix. A secondary fix was done with 1% osmium tetroxide. For Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), tissue was dehydrated with ethanol and embedded with spurr’s resin. Thin sections (70 nm) were mounted on mesh grids and stained with 8% uranyl acetate followed by Sato’s lead stain. Sections were imaged on a Jeol (JEM-1400) electron microscope and acquired with an AMT V601 digital camera.

Next, RNA concentration was determined using a NanoDrop 2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). First strand synthesis was then performed using the High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription kit (Applied Biosystems). Quantitative PCR was performed using PowerUp SYBR Green master mix (Thermo Fisher, Cat #a25742) using 5 ng of cDNA per reaction. Plates were run on a QuantStudio 6 Flex and analyzed in Microsoft Excel. The average Ct value from three technical replicates was averaged normalized to the internal control <italic>Rpl13a</italic>. All primer sequences were obtained from PrimerBank (Harvard) and product size validated using agarose gel electrophoresis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Tissue preparation and immunohistochemistry</title><p>After isolation of either dorsal root or DRG, tissue was fixed using 4% paraformaldehyde for 1 hr at room temperature. Tissue was then washed in PBS and cryoprotected using 30% sucrose solution at 4°C overnight. Next, the tissue was embedded in O.C.T., frozen, and mounted for cryosectioning. All frozen sections were cut to a width of 10 µm for subsequent staining. For immunostaining of DRG and nerve sections, slides were washed 3 x in PBS and then blocked in solution containing 10% goat serum in 0.2% Triton-PBS for 1 hr. Next, sections were incubated overnight in blocking solution containing primary antibody. The next day, sections were washed 3 x with PBS and then incubated in a blocking solution containing a secondary antibody for 1 hr at room temperature. Finally, sections were washed 3 x with PBS and mounted using ProLong Gold antifade (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Images were acquired at 10 x or 20 x using a Nikon TE2000E inverted microscope and images were analyzed using Nikon Elements. Antibodies were as follow: SCG10/Stmn2 (1:1000; Novus catalog #NBP1-49461, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:AB_10011569">AB_10011569</ext-link>), Tubb3/βIII tubulin antibody (BioLegend catalog #802001, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:AB_291637">AB_291637</ext-link>), Fabp7 (Thermo Fisher Scientific Cat# PA5-24949, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:AB_2542449">AB_2542449</ext-link>), MKI67 (Abcam cat# ab15580), CD68 (Bio-Rad Cat# MCA1957 clone;FA-11), GFAP (Agilent, Cat# Z033429-2). Stained sections with only secondary antibodies were used as controls. For Lectin injection, mice were deeply anesthetized by 1.5% isoflurane. A total of 100 µl of Lycopersicon esculentum (tomato) lectin (vector lab; Catalog#DL-1178–1) was used per mouse by injection into the tail vein. Mice were sacrificed after 20 min of injection. Samples were collected following the procedure described above. Twenty µm thickness of DRG cryosections were used for immunofluorescence staining and image was captured under LSM880 confocal microscope.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Data collection and analyses</title><p>Data collection and analyses were performed blind to the conditions of the experiments. Single-cell RNAseq analysis was performed in an unbiased manner using established algorithms.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Quantification and statistical analysis</title><p>Quantifications were performed by a blinded experimenter to injury type and treatment. Fiji (ImageJ) analysis software was used for immunohistochemistry images quantifications. Nikon Elements analysis software was used to trace regenerating axons in the dorsal root sections. Statistics was performed using GraphPad (Prism8) for t-test and one/two-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni’s multiple comparisons test. Error bars indicate the standard error of the mean (SEM). Heatmaps were calculated as fold change of normalized counts compared to naive or as z-scores. The formula for calculating z-score used z = (x-μ)/σ, where x is the expression of the gene in all cells for each condition, μ is the sample mean of the gene in all conditions, and σ is the sample standard deviation in all conditions. Sample was calculated as the average expression of cells in each condition.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Methodology, Validation, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing, Software</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Formal analysis, Methodology, Visualization, Validation, Resources, Conceptualization, Software</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Conceptualization, Software, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Data curation, Methodology, Funding acquisition, Visualization</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Conceptualization, Project administration, Supervision, Investigation, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>All animals were approved by the Washington University School of Medicine Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) under protocol A3381-01.

They make extensive use of single cell transcriptomics, and found dramatic differences in the expression state and regenerative potential.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Profiling sensory neuron microenvironment after peripheral and central axon injury reveals key pathways for neural repair&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Marianne Bronner as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) A more definitive characterization of the immune glia cells, to exclude engulfment as a possibility. This subset of macrophages with glial properties, it could be simply an artifact of macrophages engulfing satellite glial cells.</p><p>2) Demonstrate additional advances in the PPARa findings. Given that PPARa was previously implicated in this effect, additional evidence beyond fenofibrate experiment should be provided. Dorsal column sensory axon regeneration after spinal cord injury would be ideal, but could be very challenging. Or, at least characterizing sensory axon regeneration into DREZ after dorsal root crush. If the results are negative, authors should discuss the limitation of manipulating this pathway alone in the CNS.</p><p>3) Functional validation to address the role of PPARa signaling in satellite glial cells since the it was done with pharmacological manipulation.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>In this manuscript, Avraham et al. report their results of profiling different cell types in DRG from mice with different types of injury. In general, injuries occurred in PNS (sciatic nerves or dorsal roots) trigger more drastic effects on nearly all DRG cell types, comparing to those applied to CNS (spinal cord), albeit with some exceptions. Among these responding cell populations is a subset of macrophage expressing a satellite glial cell (SGC) marker, and an another population of SGCs, although their lineage and role remain unknown. Furthermore, fatty acid biosynthesis and PPARa signaling pathways are up-regulated after sciatic nerve injury, but down-regulated after dorsal root injury (again these observations are not verified and the underlying mechanisms are elusive). Application of a PPARa agonist is able to elevate axon regeneration after dorsal root injury. In general, this manuscript has a large amount of data from bioinformatics analysis but with limited functional verifications. Thus their biological meaning is less clear.</p><p>In Figure 3, the results imply different signaling involvement in DRG macrophages (cell cycle and DNA replication after SNC and steroid biosynthesis and glycolysis/gluconeogenesis pathways after DRC/SCI). Are these results due to differential resident/infiltrated macrophage in DRG after individual injury types?</p><p>It is also intriguing to note that all injuries down-regulate genes related to antigen processing and presentation (Figure 3). This seems an interesting observation as macrophages often exhibit pro-inflammatory responses to injury. These results should be verified with independent methods.</p><p>In Figure 4, the authors describe a subset of macrophages expressing glial markers whose numbers become increased after injury. Is it possible that these might be the macrophages with engulfed SGCs? To test this, perhaps the authors could compare the abundance of these type-specific RNAs or use other independent methods (with transgenic mice with GFP-labeled SGCs to see if any GFP signals are in these macrophages).</p><p>The results in Figure 5 suggest that SGCs represent different cell populations. Again, their biological meaning remains unknown. An obvious possibility is these clusters might reflect their different activation states. It might be useful to apply single cell trajectory analysis to assess their relationship.</p><p>Figure 7, are the regeneration results after PPARa agonist comparable to those after sciatic nerve injury? Such information might provide insights as to its translational potential.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Suggested experiments:</p><p>1) Impact on functional validation will be enhanced significantly if regeneration into and beyond DREZ can be assessed with fenofibrate, especially given the previously published results with SNC.</p><p>2) Figure 3e and 3g have different markers. Validation will be enhanced if selected markers in Figure 3e is confirmed with immunostaining.</p><p>Suggested discussions, clarification or corrections:</p><p>1) Using 1 biological replicate for SNC vs. 2 for other conditions seems unbalanced. Ideally use 2 replicates per condition, and at least discuss implications on using 1 replicate for SNC. For instance, what is the variability among the replicates for data presented in Figure 1f,g?</p><p>2) Authors indicated that the magnitude of expression changes using number of differentially expressed genes. With Supplemental Table 2, the cut off was based on 0.05 p value instead of FDR corrected (FDR step up). With FDR corrected p-value, the numbers become 614 (SRC vs. NAI), 222(SCI vs. NAI) and 1276 (SNC vs. NAI). Please change it accordingly as the multiple comparison is necessary for sequencing data.</p><p>3) Is PPARa pathway enriched in cluster 6 SGCs, which increases after SNC?</p><p>4) The discussion on immune glia cells can be more explicit, even though it is understood that this new cell type may not squarely fit with either macrophages or SGCs. Please discuss if this been implicated in the published literature.</p><p>5) Please clarify if the data on SGCs overlap with those from Avraham et al., 2020 (i.g. same data set)?</p><p>6) &quot;Here we showed that this PPARa signaling pathway is not activated in SGC after central injures.&quot; Is DRC a peripheral or central injury?</p><p>7) For DRC experiment, was DRC only performed for L4, but both L4 and L5 DRG were collected for scRNA seq?</p><p>8) It seems that the least differentially expressed genes are associated with the most abundant cell types sequenced (SGCs and macrophages). Is this due to a higher sample rates, thus more reproducible/reliable data set? And vice versa?</p><p>9) &quot;Whether the different regenerative capacities after peripheral or central injury result in part from a lack of response of macrophages, satellite glial cells (SGC) or other non-neuronal cells in the DRG microenvironment remains largely unknown.&quot; Can also be an altered response.</p><p>10) Even though fenofibrate may have minimal activity towards PPARa, a previous paper on the neuronal role of the γ isoform is relevant and should be discussed: Lezana et al., Dev Neurobiol 2016.

We have performed additional experiments and additional analyses that strongly support the existence of a subset of macrophages with glial properties. We performed a flow cytometry experiment, which shows that a subset of genetically labeled satellite glial cells (Fabp7-creER: Sun1 GFP) express the specific macrophages markers Cd11b, F4/80 and cd45. This new data is presented in new Figure 4E. We also included additional analyses showing that these immune glial cells express progenitor cell markers (Dhh, <italic>Sox2</italic> and Foxd3) (new figure 4C). We have expanded the methods section to clarify that duplicate cells are filtered out from downstream analysis and also plotted total counts in all cell types (Figure 4—figure supplement 1B), further excluding the possibility that these cells are satellite glial cells engulfed by macrophages. We have also added a trajectory analysis demonstrating that immune glial cells express a transcriptome that position them between satellite glial cells and macrophages (new figure 4D). We believe that these additional experiments and analyses strongly support the characterization of this immune glia cell population, which we now have renamed Imoonglia.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Demonstrate additional advances in the PPARa findings. Given that PPARa was previously implicated in this effect, additional evidence beyond fenofibrate experiment should be provided. Dorsal column sensory axon regeneration after spinal cord injury would be ideal, but could be very challenging. Or, at least characterizing sensory axon regeneration into DREZ after dorsal root crush. If the results are negative, authors should discuss the limitation of manipulating this pathway alone in the CNS.</p></disp-quote><p>We understand that it would be interesting to test if fenofibrate can enhance regeneration past the DREZ or even promote some level of axon regeneration in the injured spinal cord. We considered these experiments, and opted to focus on axon regeneration along the dorsal root instead for the following reasons. First, it is extremely unlikely that fenofibrate treatment will enhance axon regeneration in the injured spinal cord. Indeed, the effect of fenofibrate on spinal contusion injury has been tested and proven ineffective to improve recovery (Almad et al. Exp Neurology 2011). Only a modest increase in histological tissue sparing was observed. Second, it has been shown that dorsal root axons regenerating along the root quickly stop at the scar-free DREZ, even after a nerve conditioning lesion (Chong et al., 1999; Zhang et al., 2007; Di Maio et al., 2011). This potent block on axon growth has been attributed to myelin-associated inhibitors and CSPGs. This suggests that fenofibrate, which would only target the satellite glial cells, is unlikely to be sufficient to promote axon regeneration through the dorsal root entry zone. Although various treatments have been found to promote growth past the DREZ and into the spinal cord, these are largely focused on treatments targeting the intrinsic growth capacity of sensory neurons, such as viral delivery of NGF, NT-3, ARTN or GDNF (Smith et al. Trends in Neurosci 2012). Recent studies have shown that combinatorial strategies that target myelin inhibitors and CSPG together with boosting the intrinsic axon growth capacity with GDNF enhanced regeneration of axon past the DREZ (Zhai et al. BioRxiv 2021). These studies highlight the importance of elevating intrinsic growth capacity to pass the DREZ. As we suggested in the Discussion section, fenofibrate could be considered in combinatorial therapies aimed at improving sensory function recovery after SCI. Future studies will be needed to test if targeting satellite glial cell with fenofibrate could synergize with neuron intrinsic approaches to enhance axon regeneration past the DREZ and also increase intraspinal axon regeneration. Such studies are, however, beyond the scope of the current manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Functional validation to address the role of PPARa signaling in satellite glial cells since the it was done with pharmacological manipulation.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this is an important point. We previously addressed the specificity of fenofibrate by demonstrating that PPARα in the DRG is highly enriched in satellite glial cells (Avraham et al. Nat Comm 2020). We showed that PPARα and PPARα target genes are upregulated in SGC but not in neurons after injury (Avraham et al. Nat Comm 2020). We also showed in an in vitro assay that fenofibrate does not promote growth in pure neuronal cultures, further supporting that PPARα is not expressed in neurons (Avraham et al. Nat Comm 2020). Immunostaining for PPARα demonstrated that PPARα is expressed in SGC but not neurons, and that neither injury nor fenofibrate treatment lead to PPARα expression in neurons (Avraham et al. Nat Comm 2020). Furthermore, a transcriptional profiling study of sensory neurons at single cell resolution (Renthal W. et al., Neuron, 2020) confirms that PPARα is not expressed in neurons, neither in naïve conditions nor following sciatic nerve crush injury. In the current study, we performed additional analyses to examine PPARα expression in other cells. First, we plotted all the cells expressing PPARα by cell type and injury condition. This analysis reveals that the majority of PPARα expressing cells are SGC in any injury condition (Figure 7C). Second, we present violin plots of PPARα and selected PPARα specific target genes, which demonstrates higher expression of PPARα in SGC compared to all other cells in the DRG (Figure 7 Supplement figure 1C). Given that fenofibrate is a selective activator of PPARα and does not target other PPAR isoforms (Lee CH, Olson P, Evans RM. Minireview: lipid metabolism, metabolic diseases, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors. Endocrinology. 2003 Jun;144(6):2201-7), we believe that the pharmacological manipulations presented here sufficiently address the role of PPARα signaling in satellite glial cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>In this manuscript, Avraham et al. report their results of profiling different cell types in DRG from mice with different types of injury. In general, injuries occurred in PNS (sciatic nerves or dorsal roots) trigger more drastic effects on nearly all DRG cell types, comparing to those applied to CNS (spinal cord), albeit with some exceptions. Among these responding cell populations is a subset of macrophage expressing a satellite glial cell (SGC) marker, and an another population of SGCs, although their lineage and role remain unknown. Furthermore, fatty acid biosynthesis and PPARa signaling pathways are up-regulated after sciatic nerve injury, but down-regulated after dorsal root injury (again these observations are not verified and the underlying mechanisms are elusive). Application of a PPARa agonist is able to elevate axon regeneration after dorsal root injury. In general, this manuscript has a large amount of data from bioinformatics analysis but with limited functional verifications. Thus their biological meaning is less clear.</p></disp-quote><p>Functional verifications were included in most figures. However, to address this point we have performed additional experiments and validations, as detailed below.</p><p>Figure 3: In addition to the immunofluorescence for macrophage and proliferation markers in DRG sections from all injury conditions, we now validated with qPCR the downregulation of selected cytokines and the upregulation of proliferation markers in macrophages following sciatic nerve crush injury (new Figure 3D).</p><p>Figure 4: In addition to the immunofluorescence of DRG sections showing co-expression of the SGC marker FABP7 and the macrophage marker CD68, we added a flow cytometry experiment of genetically labeled SGC (BlbpCreER:Sun1GFP), labeled with 3 different macrophage specific markers to validate the scRNAseq analysis (new Figure 4E). These new results support the notion that a subset of macrophages express glial properties at the protein level.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Figure 3, the results imply different signaling involvement in DRG macrophages (cell cycle and DNA replication after SNC and steroid biosynthesis and glycolysis/gluconeogenesis pathways after DRC/SCI). Are these results due to differential resident/infiltrated macrophage in DRG after individual injury types?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for highlighting this point. Previous studies have indicated that the number of macrophages increases in the DRG after peripheral nerve injury but not dorsal root injury (Kwon et al. 2012). This increase in macrophages number after nerve injury results in part from proliferation of resident macrophages (Leonhard et al., 2002; Yu et al., 2020) and may also include local myeloid cell proliferation (Yu et al., 2020) and infiltration of a small number of blood-borne myeloid cells (Kalinski et al. 2020). We quantified all ki67 expressing cells in our scRNAseq, which demonstrates that the majority of cells proliferating following all injuries are macrophages, and that the number of proliferating macrophages is highest after sciatic nerve injury (Figure 3 K,L). Our results are consistent with these prior studies and suggest that the different signaling responses result largely from proliferation of macrophages after nerve injury.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It is also intriguing to note that all injuries down-regulate genes related to antigen processing and presentation (Figure 3). This seems an interesting observation as macrophages often exhibit pro-inflammatory responses to injury. These results should be verified with independent methods.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and have performed a qPCR experiment to validate the downregulation of genes regulating antigen processing and presentation associated with class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC II) CD74, H2-Aa and Ctss (new Figure 3D). We also confirmed the downregulation of the cytokines Ccl2, Il1b and Tnf following sciatic nerve crush in qPCR experiments (new Figure 3D).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Figure 4, the authors describe a subset of macrophages expressing glial markers whose numbers become increased after injury. Is it possible that these might be the macrophages with engulfed SGCs? To test this, perhaps the authors could compare the abundance of these type-specific RNAs or use other independent methods (with transgenic mice with GFP-labeled SGCs to see if any GFP signals are in these macrophages).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that it is important to exclude the possibility that immune glial cells simply result from phagocytosis of satellite glial cells by macrophages. We have performed additional experiments and additional analyses that strongly support the existence of subset of macrophages with glial properties. We renamed these cells Imoonglia, to reflect their immune properties and their crescent shape morphology typical of SGC surrounding sensory neurons. First, we performed a flow cytometry experiment to show that a subset of genetically labeled SGC (BLBP-creER: Sun1 GFP) express the specific macrophage markers Cd11b, F4/80 and cd45 (new figure 4E). Second, we included additional analyses showing that these immune glia cells express progenitor cell markers (Dhh, <italic>Sox2</italic> and Foxd3), which are not expressed in macrophages (new figure 4C). Third, we performed a trajectory analysis demonstrating that Imoonglia express a transcriptome that position them between satellite glial cells and macrophages (new figure 4D). Fourth, we expanded the methods section to clarify that duplicate cells are filtered out from downstream analysis and also plotted total counts in all cell types (new figure 4—figure supplement 1B), further excluding the possibility that these cells are satellite glial cells engulfed by macrophages. We believe that these additional experiments and analyses strongly support the characterization of this Imoonglia cell population.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The results in Figure 5 suggest that SGCs represent different cell populations. Again, their biological meaning remains unknown. An obvious possibility is these clusters might reflect their different activation states. It might be useful to apply single cell trajectory analysis to assess their relationship.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion and have performed trajectory analysis to assess the activation state and the relationship of the different SGC subtypes. The results indicate a trajectory starting from cluster 3, to cluster 2, then cluster 1 and finally cluster 4 (new Figure 5E). This is very interesting in light of our comparison of SGC clusters to astrocytes and Schwann cells, showing that cluster 3 most resembles astrocytes while cluster 4 mostly resembles Schwann cells (Figure 5H,I). The trajectory analysis comparing different cell lineage genes suggests that all SGC subtypes present the same activation state (Figure 5E). The biological function of these different SGC clusters awaits further in depth investigations that are beyond the scope of the current manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 7, are the regeneration results after PPARa agonist comparable to those after sciatic nerve injury? Such information might provide insights as to its translational potential.</p></disp-quote><p>It has been shown that dorsal root axonal growth occurs at half the rate of peripheral axons (Oblinger and Lasek 1984; Wujek and Lasek, 1983). In the experiment presented in Figure 7E-G, we observed that fenofibrate treatment almost doubled the length of dorsal root axons, suggesting that activating SGC with fenofibrate can increase axon growth. In our previous study, we showed that deleting the enzyme Fasn, which is upstream of PPARα activation, specifically in SGC, decreases axon growth in the sciatic nerve by about half (Avraham et al. 2020). Altogether, these findings suggest that the lack of PPARα activation after dorsal root crush contributes to the low regeneration rates of axons in the dorsal root. We have edited the text in the Discussion section (p.22) to provide insights into the translational potential of fenofibrate.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Suggested experiments:</p><p>1) Impact on functional validation will be enhanced significantly if regeneration into and beyond DREZ can be assessed with fenofibrate, especially given the previously published results with SNC.</p></disp-quote><p>We understand that it would be interesting to test if fenofibrate can enhance regeneration past the DREZ or even promote some level of axon regeneration in the injured spinal cord.

CD68 in Figure 3G is used to identify macrophages as over +90% of macrophage express CD68 (Figure 3A). The heat map in Figure 3E is focused on macrophage proliferation markers, cell division markers, cytokines and chemokines. This has been highlighted appropriately now.

This is what we aimed for. However, the reason that in this study we included 1 replicate for SNC is the following: we initially combined the 2 replicates for SNC from our previous study (Avraham, et al. Nat Comm 2020) with one new SNC replicate. Combining these two different datasets complicated the analysis, as there was significant batch effect, that likely resulted from the different chemistry of the library kits used (V2 vs. V3). The number of cells captured and the depth of analysis (mean reads per cell) were also different. However, analysis of the enriched biological pathways in the 2 datasets revealed high similarity and was thus suggesting that the biological meaning remains. The variability among replicates for the data presented in Figure 1F,G is shown in Figure 1, Figure supplement 1A.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Authors indicated that the magnitude of expression changes using number of differentially expressed genes.

The PPARα pathway is not specifically enriched in SGC subcluster 6 (new Figure 6J). The expression of the PPARα transcript was observed in all SGC clusters, including cluster 6, with highest distribution in subclusters 2 and 3 (new Figure 7D).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The discussion on immune glia cells can be more explicit, even though it is understood that this new cell type may not squarely fit with either macrophages or SGCs. Please discuss if this been implicated in the published literature.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and have revised the text to better explain what these cells may represent. There is indeed evidence in the literature for the existence of cells with morphology similar to SGC, with close apposition to the neuron and with expression of immune markers. Van Velzen et al. (2009) described the presence of immune markers in human SGC. This was based only on cell localization without co-staining with SGC markers. Jasmin et al. (2010) also found that some SGC express CD45, but unlike in humans, the CD45 positive cells were only present after nerve injury. Donegan et al. 2013 observed that the expression of immune markers (CD45 and ED2) in SGC occurred 2 and 4 days post nerve injury. While some were co-localized with proliferating nuclei, others were not. Huang et al. 2021 also found that a subset of SGC showed CD45 immunoreactivity. A recent comparative analysis of sympathetic and sensory SGC suggests a shared populations of satellite glia enriched in immune-response genes (Mapps et al. BioRxiv 2021). In another single cell based analysis of SGC , a cluster was excluded from further analyses due to relatively high expression of reactive markers, including interferon-related genes (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/doSearch?ContribAuthorStored=Weperen%2C+Valerie+Y+H">van Weperen</ext-link>, Glia 2021). Our analysis, combines scRNAseq, flow cytometry and high-resolution co-immunostaining to provides a more comprehensive characterization of this rare cell type, which we named Imoonglia, to reflect their immune properties and their crescent shape morphology typical of SGC surrounding sensory neurons. What could be the origin of these cells? Our analysis suggests that Imoonglia do not proliferate, but express progenitor markers. Whether immune cells move to a peri-neuronal position and become Imoonglia or whether SGCs transition from a progenitor state to acquire an immune signature in stressful condition such as after nerve injury remains to be tested. It is tempting to speculate that Imoonglia may function in immune surveillance in the DRG. Indeed, SGC play a role in viral infection and may restrict the local diffusion of viruses such as herpes simplex virus, varicella zoster virus, HIV-1 and Hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus belongs to the family of coronavirus (Hanani review 2020).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Please clarify if the data on SGCs overlap with those from Avraham et al., 2020 (i.g. same data set)?</p></disp-quote><p>In this study we generated new sample after SNC, which is distinct from the 2 replicates for SNC from in our previous study (Avraham, et al.

Unlike SCI injury, dorsal root injury damages centrally projecting sensory axons in the PNS, without causing an impassable glial scar. But axons grow at ½ the speed in the dorsal root until they stop at the scar-free dorsal root entry zone (DREZ). This model provides a tool to see if we can increase axon growth capacity without the complication of the glial scar or the DREZ.</p><p>The sentence on p. 22 has been rephrased to “….to centrally projecting axons (SCI or DRC)”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) For DRC experiment, was DRC only performed for L4, but both L4 and L5 DRG were collected for scRNA seq?</p></disp-quote><p>For DRC, both L4 and L5 roots were crushed and both L4 and L5 DRG were collected.

A more reasonable option is that when a cell population has several subpopulations, like we see for SGC, if the subpopulations respond differentially, then the number of DEG will decrease when DEG are calculated for the total SGC (i.e., same gene increase in one subpopulation but decrease in another). To test this possibility, we calculated the DEG for every SGC subpopulation and indeed found that every subtype responds differently (figure 6- Source Data 1), with cluster 4 showing the highest transcriptional changes (now added as new Figure 6E).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) &quot;Whether the different regenerative capacities after peripheral or central injury result in part from a lack of response of macrophages, satellite glial cells (SGC) or other non-neuronal cells in the DRG microenvironment remains largely unknown.&quot; Can also be an altered response.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and have edited this statement, which now reads as ”Whether the different regenerative capacities after peripheral or central injury result in part from a lack or an altered response of macrophages, satellite glial cells (SGC) or other non-neuronal cells in the DRG microenvironment remains largely unknown”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) Even though fenofibrate may have minimal activity towards PPARa, a previous paper on the neuronal role of the γ isoform is relevant and should be discussed: Lezana et al., Dev Neurobiol 2016.
