In rod-shaped bacteria, cell wall elongation is spatially precise yet relies on limited pools of lipid-linked precursors that generate and are attracted to membrane disorder. By tracking enzymes, substrates, and products of peptidoglycan biosynthesis in <italic>Mycobacterium smegmatis</italic>, we show that precursors are made in plasma membrane domains that are laterally and biochemically distinct from sites of cell wall assembly. Membrane partitioning likely contributes to robust, orderly peptidoglycan synthesis, suggesting that these domains help template peptidoglycan synthesis. The cell wall-organizing protein DivIVA and the cell wall itself promote domain homeostasis. These data support a model in which the peptidoglycan polymer feeds back on its membrane template to maintain an environment conducive to directional synthesis. Our findings are applicable to rod-shaped bacteria that are phylogenetically distant from <italic>M. smegmatis</italic>, indicating that horizontal compartmentalization of precursors may be a general feature of bacillary cell wall biogenesis.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>M. smegmatis</italic></kwd><kwd>membrane domains</kwd><kwd>microbiology and infectious disease</kwd><kwd>cell wall</kwd><kwd>peptidoglycan</kwd><kwd>metabolic labeling</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R21 AI144748</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Morita</surname><given-names>Yasu S</given-names></name><name><surname>Siegrist</surname><given-names>M Sloan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U01 CA221230</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Siegrist</surname><given-names>M Sloan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DP2 AI138238</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Siegrist</surname><given-names>M Sloan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R03 AI140259-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Morita</surname><given-names>Yasu S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 AI097191</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gray</surname><given-names>Todd A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004685</institution-id><institution>Universidad Autónoma de Nuevo León</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Honors Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>García-Heredia</surname><given-names>Alam</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008732</institution-id><institution>Uehara Memorial Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Postdoctoral Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kado</surname><given-names>Takehiro</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002322</institution-id><institution>Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Science Without Borders Fellowship (0328-13-8)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Puffal</surname><given-names>Julia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Mycobacteria employ plasma membrane compartments to organize their cell wall synthesis, and the finalized cell wall compartmentalizes the plasma membrane to promote an environment conducive to its own synthesis.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The final lipid-linked precursor for peptidoglycan synthesis, lipid II, is made by the glycosyltransferase MurG in the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane. Lipid II is then flipped to the outer leaflet by MurJ where its disaccharide-pentapeptide cargo is inserted into the existing cell wall by membrane-bound transglycosylases and transpeptidases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zhao et al., 2017</xref>). Early in vitro work in <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> and <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> indicated that a fluid microenvironment might stimulate the activities of MurG and the upstream, lipid I synthase MraY (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Norris and Manners, 1993</xref>). More recent in vivo data has localized <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> MurG to regions of increased fluidity (RIFs, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Müller et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Strahl et al., 2014</xref>), one of three classes of membrane domains that have been described in bacteria to date. In mycobacteria, intracellular membrane domains (IMD, formerly called PMf, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Morita et al., 2005</xref>) can be separated from the conventional plasma membrane (PM-CW, for plasma membrane associated with cell wall) by sucrose density gradient fractionation. The proteome and lipidome of IMD are distinct from those of the PM-CW (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hayashi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Morita et al., 2005</xref>). Reanalysis of our proteomics data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hayashi et al., 2016</xref>) suggested that <italic>Mycobacterium smegmatis</italic> MurG is enriched in the IMD while sequentially acting transglycosylases and transpeptidases associate with the PM-CW. While PM-CW-resident proteins distribute along the perimeter of live mycobacteria, IMD-resident proteins are enriched toward sites of polar cell elongation with additional presence along the sidewalls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hayashi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hayashi et al., 2018</xref>).

As expected for PBPs, the signal from these bands was diminished by pre-treatment with ampicillin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplement 6</xref>). We focused on characterizing PonA1, an essential bifunctional transglycosylase/transpeptidase in <italic>M. smegmatis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hett et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kieser et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Baranowski et al., 2018</xref>).

Although we detected potential breakdown products of the fusion protein by anti-RFP immunoblot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), we found that it, like native PonA1, was active in the PM-CW and distributed along the sidewall in a manner similar to the functional PM-CW marker PimE-GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hayashi et al., 2016</xref>).

These results suggest that lipid II is made in the IMD and transferred to the PM-CW in a MurJ-dependent manner.</p><p>Based on our biochemical data, we hypothesized that lipid II incorporation into the cell wall is laterally segregated from its synthesis. We previously showed that alkynyl and azido <sc>d</sc>-amino acid dipeptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Liechti et al., 2014</xref>) incorporate into lipid-linked peptidoglycan precursors in <italic>M. smegmatis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">García-Heredia et al., 2018</xref>) and that metabolic labeling with alkynyl dipeptide (alkDADA or EDA-DA, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Liechti et al., 2014</xref>) is most intense in regions adjacent to the IMD marker mCherry-GlfT2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hayashi et al., 2018</xref>). We labeled MurG-Dendra2-expressing <italic>M. smegmatis</italic> with alkDADA and detected the presence of the alkyne by copper-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">García-Heredia et al., 2018</xref>). To distinguish extracellular alkynes present in periplasmic lipid II and newly polymerized cell wall from alkynes originating from cytoplasmic lipid II, we selected picolyl azide-Cy3 as our label because of its poor membrane permeability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yang and Hinner, 2015</xref>). Using this optimized protocol, we observed nascent peptidoglycan deposition at the polar tip, whereas MurG-Dendra2 was proximal to this site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Our data suggest that lipid II synthesis is laterally partitioned from the subsequent steps of peptidoglycan assembly. MurJ depletion reduced and delocalized alkDADA-derived fluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3C</xref>), consistent with a gatekeeper role for the flippase in both lateral membrane compartmentalization and flipping across the inner membrane.</p><p>Next, we wanted to understand the significance of membrane architecture for cell wall synthesis.

In <italic>M. smegmatis</italic>, we found that benzyl alcohol reduced the cellular material associated with the IMD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3D</xref>) and altered the distribution of FM4-64, a non-specific lipophilic dye (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>), and of plasma membrane glycolipids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). However, the fluidizer did not alter labeling by N-AlkTMM or O-AlkTMM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>), probes that, respectively, mark the noncovalent and covalent lipids of the outer ‘myco’ membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Foley et al., 2016</xref>). These observations suggest that benzyl alcohol primarily affects the plasma membrane in <italic>M. smegmatis</italic>. MurG-Dendra2 was also less enriched in the IMD fraction following benzyl alcohol treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, top; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplements 3E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">4</xref>) and, in live cells, at the poles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

Nevertheless, it is possible that chemical fluidizers directly disrupt the activity of cell wall synthesis proteins in addition to altering the milieu in which these proteins function.</p><p>The impacts of benzyl alcohol and dibucaine on MurG-Dendra2 localization were subtly different (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s7">Figure 3—figure supplement 7</xref>) as was the time frame for disruption of cell wall synthesis by these chemicals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5</xref>). In model membranes, benzyl alcohol promotes phase separation by further fluidizing disordered regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Muddana et al., 2012</xref>), while dibucaine disrupts phase separation by fluidizing ordered regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kinoshita et al., 2019</xref>). In more-complex cellular membranes, the effects of these compounds may be influenced by the presence of pre-existing mechanisms that establish and maintain membrane organization. For example, the architecture of eukaryotic membranes is influenced by transient links, or pinning, to the cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Fujimoto and Parmryd, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Liu et al., 2015</xref>). In <italic>B. subtilis</italic> and <italic>E. coli</italic>, actin homologs like MreB direct peptidoglycan synthesis along the lateral cell surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Daniel and Errington, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Iwai et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Shi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zhao et al., 2017</xref>). They also organize the membrane into domains of increased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Oswald et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Strahl et al., 2014</xref>) and decreased fluidity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wagner et al., 2020</xref>).

We found that benzyl alcohol delocalized or dampened cell wall assembly in rod-shaped bacteria with divergent envelope composition and modes of growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D,E</xref>). Peptidoglycan synthesis was less affected by benzyl alcohol in coccoid species, which lack MreB or obvious RIFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wenzel et al., 2018</xref>), and in rounded, A22-treated <italic>E. coli</italic>, in which MreB assembly is inhibited (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Thus, membrane organization likely contributes to effective, directional cell wall synthesis in rod-shaped bacteria.</p><p>Mycobacteria lack MreB. How, then, is the IMD partitioned away from the rest of the plasma membrane? In these organisms, the essential tropomyosin-like protein DivIVA (Wag31) concentrates cell wall assembly at the poles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jani et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Melzer et al., 2018</xref>).

Consistent with these data, we found that depletion of the protein reduced both lipid-linked peptidoglycan precursor abundance and alkDADA incorporation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Membrane disruption by benzyl alcohol did not delocalize DivIVA from the polar tips (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s8">Figure 3—figure supplement 8</xref>), and the suppressive effects of benzyl alcohol and DivIVA depletion on precursor abundance and cell wall synthesis were not additive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), suggesting that the perturbations act on the same pathway. Unlike DivIVA depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), benzyl alcohol does not change <italic>M. smegmatis</italic> shape (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Therefore, while we cannot exclude the possibility that spherical morphology in DivIVA-depleted cells indirectly impacts membrane partitioning – for example by mislocalization of curvature-sensing proteins or by altering the spacing between the membrane and cell wall – our results are most consistent with a model in which DivIVA organizes the mycobacterial membrane for optimal cell wall synthesis.</p><p>As lipid II both generates and homes to disordered regions of model membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Ganchev et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jia et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Valtersson et al., 1985</xref>), the effect of DivIVA on precursors suggests that concentrated peptidoglycan synthesis is a cause or a consequence (or both) of IMD/PM-CW partitioning. In other organisms, lipid II production is required for MreB rotation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Domínguez-Escobar et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Garner et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">van Teeffelen et al., 2011</xref>), to recruit MreB to the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Schirner et al., 2015</xref>), and for normal membrane staining by a lipophilic fluorescent dye (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Muchová et al., 2011</xref>), so the precursor might also play an indirect role in compartmentalizing the mycobacterial membrane via its influence on DivIVA. However, we previously found that the IMD is biochemically intact after 8 hr of treatment with <sc>d</sc>-cycloserine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hayashi et al., 2018</xref>), an antibiotic that we have shown to block <italic>M. smegmatis</italic> peptidoglycan precursor synthesis within 1 hr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">García-Heredia et al., 2018</xref>). IMD-resident proteins delocalize, but not until 6 hr of treatment. The persistence of IMD-resident proteins and the time frame of delocalization indicate that concentrated lipid II synthesis is more likely a consequence, rather than a cause, of mycobacterial membrane compartmentalization.</p><p>Our data supported a model in which DivIVA is necessary to maintain membrane partitioning, which in turn supports efficient synthesis of peptidoglycan precursors and their precise incorporation into the cell wall. However, we noted that eukaryotic membrane architecture can also be influenced by transient interactions with external structures like extracellular matrix and cellulose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Fujimoto and Parmryd, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Liu et al., 2015</xref>). Furthermore, biophysical modeling suggests that osmotic pinning of the plasma membrane against the bacterial cell wall can induce microphase separation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mukhopadhyay et al., 2008</xref>). In mycobacteria, co-fractionation of the plasma membrane and cell wall (i.e. PM-CW) upon mechanical cell lysis implies that they are physically connected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Morita et al., 2005</xref>). We wondered whether the peptidoglycan polymer itself might contribute to the membrane partitioning that organizes its synthesis. In <italic>B. subtilis</italic>, for example, enzymatic removal of the cell wall delocalizes membrane staining by a lipophilic fluorescent dye (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Muchová et al., 2011</xref>) and enhances the mobility of membrane domain-associated flotillin proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wagner et al., 2020</xref>). To test this hypothesis in <italic>M. smegmatis</italic>, we spheroplasted bacteria that expressed MurG-Dendra2 or DivIVA-eGFP-ID and mCherry-GlfT2. All fusions were functional (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hayashi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Meniche et al., 2014</xref>). Fractionated lysates from spheroplasted mycobacteria had more diffuse distribution of cellular material and indistinct separation of the IMD and PM-CW fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Consistent with the macroscopic appearance of the fractionated lysate, MurG-Dendra2 was distributed throughout the gradient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3H</xref>). MurG-Dendra2 and the IMD marker mCherry-GlfT2 were also diffusely distributed around the periphery of spheroplasted cells while DivIVA, likely a PM-CW-associated protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hayashi et al., 2016</xref>), remained in foci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C,D</xref>). These experiments suggest that an intact cell wall and DivIVA promote membrane compartmentalization in <italic>M. smegmatis</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, arrows 1 and 3).</p><p>While peptidoglycan biogenesis is well known to vertically span the inner and outer leaflets of the plasma membrane, here we demonstrate in <italic>M. smegmatis</italic> that it is also horizontally partitioned (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, arrow 2). Partitioning of the mycobacterial membrane by DivIVA and the cell wall follows similar logic to that of eukaryotic membranes, which can be compartmentalized by pinning to cytoplasmic structures such as the actin cytoskeleton and to external structures such as the extracellular matrix and cellulose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Fujimoto and Parmryd, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Liu et al., 2015</xref>), and of model lipid bilayers, which can be phase separated by adhesive forces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gordon et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mukhopadhyay et al., 2008</xref>). In mycobacteria, the membrane regions that promote cell wall synthesis are likely segregated by the end product of the pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, arrow 3). The conservation of the cell wall synthesis machinery and elongation-promoting cytoskeletal proteins among phylogenetically distant species predicts that our findings will generally apply to bacilli beyond our mycobacterial model. For rod-shaped species, our model is that the membrane-cell wall axis is a self-organizing system in which directed cell wall synthesis organizes the plasma membrane, and an organized plasma membrane in turn makes cell wall elongation more efficient and precise.</p></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Strain (<italic>M. smegmati</italic>s mc<sup>2</sup>155)</td><td><italic>M. smegmatis</italic></td><td>NC_008596 in GenBank</td><td/><td>Wild-type <italic>M. smegmatis</italic></td></tr><tr><td>Strain (<italic>M. smegmatis</italic>)</td><td>MurG-Dendra2</td><td>This study</td><td/><td>The mutant was generated as described in Supplementary material and methods.</td></tr><tr><td>Strain (<italic>M. smegmatis</italic>)</td><td>mCherry-GlfT2</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hayashi et al., 2016</xref></td><td/><td>See reference for details.</td></tr><tr><td>Strain (<italic>M. smegmatis</italic>)</td><td>PonA1-mRFP</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kieser et al., 2015</xref>;

cell wall. The data convincingly shows that, in mycobacteria, the plasma membrane organizes into distinct functional domains that are important for the synthesis of the cell wall, whose physical structure feeds back to maintain membrane organization. The authors also present data suggesting that this connection between membrane domains and cell wall structure is conserved in diverse rod-shaped bacteria.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;The mycobacterial cell wall partitions the plasma membrane to organize its own synthesis&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Gisela Storz as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As the editors have judged that your manuscript is of interest, but as described below that additional experiments are required before it is published, we would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In the work by García-Heredia et al., the authors took advantage of the fact that membrane domains are easily identified through microscopy and separated biochemically in Mycobacterium to determine whether the cell wall precursor lipid II synthesis is spatially separated from cell wall syntheses via partitions in the plasma membrane. The authors demonstrate that Lipid II is synthesized in the intracellular membrane domains (IMD), next to the polar, conventional plasma membrane associated with cell wall (PM-CW), in which lipid II is flipped and incorporated in the peptidoglycan cell wall. The authors show that this spatial separation of membrane domains is altered, and cell wall synthesizes reduced, when the membrane fluidity is perturbed or when the cell wall-organizing protein DivIVA is depleted. The authors further show that in spheroplast where the cell wall is digested away, the segregation of membrane domains is impaired. The authors propose that this type of membrane segregation is specifically important for directing cell wall synthesis in rod-shaped bacteria. While it remains to be determined whether this experimental asset and reported findings apply to other polar-growing bacteria remains to be determined, this system is interesting and medically relevant in and of itself, and contributes to our poor understanding of the existence and functional relevance of membrane domains in bacteria. However, the manuscript needs to be significantly strengthened to support their conclusions and improved for clarity.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Functionality of fusion constructs. In Figure 1C, it looks like MurG-Dendra2 is mostly in the cytoplasm with some in the IMD fraction. Figure 2A shows PonA1-mRFP as diffusive and cytoplasmic rather than bound on the membrane such as what is found in Figure 2—figure supplement 1A. Additionally, the authors cite Kieser et al. (PMID 26114871) for the functionality test of PonA1-mRFP, which further cites Hett et al. (PMID 20686708). Neither study had proper functionality tests besides growth curves. These inconsistencies raise concerns about the validity of these constructs and therefore the quality of the authors' conclusions. Please perform at least some of the following to confirm the functionality of these fusion proteins in addition to the depletion growth curves:</p><p>a) Western blot to show that in the depletion conditions there is no cleavage of the fluorescent tag of RFP or Dendra2 from MurG or PonA1. Cleavages of the tags would render untagged MurG or PonA to complement functionality and diffusive fluorescence.</p><p>b) Cell phenotype metrics such as length and morphology in addition to growth curves to compare with that of the wild type.</p><p>c) Show that the pole localization pattern of MurG-Dendra2 is not caused by the Dendra2 tag by swapping the tag with other true monomeric fluorescent proteins, and/or by assay untagged MurG in different cell fractions.</p><p>2) Quantifications of results. Most results were shown as representative images. It is unclear how large the sample size is and whether the differences are statistically significant. Some examples are listed below:</p><p>a) Figure 1C: the top gel showed that there are more MurG-Dendra2 in IMD compared to PM-CW. The apparent band density does not automatically translate into the enrichment of MurG-Dendra2 in IMD, especially given that MurG-Dendra2 is also present in the PM-CW fraction as well. Please quantify the amount of MurG in each fraction, normalize to the relative level of these two membrane fractions, and calculate the relative enrichment fold in IMD. The same applies to PonA1 and other IMD/PM-CW markers/proteins used in the study, as long as the protein is present in both fractions.</p><p>b) Figure 2A, Figure 2—figure supplement 1, Figure 3—figure supplement 4 and others: can colocalization or non-colocalization be quantified and averaged across many cells? In some cases, such as mCherry-GlfT2 and MurG-Dendra2 it appears to be clear, but in some other cases such as PonA1-mRFP and PimE-GFP it is not. The intensity-based line-scan can be used as a first level of colocalization analysis but it needs be done and averaged for all cells, not just on a selected few.</p><p>c) Reduced PG synthesis in Figure 2—figure supplement 2, Figure 3B, Figure 3C: can this be shown with quantification as that in Figure 3E using FACS (or just quantify the average fluorescence level of individual cells in microscopic images)? The authors argued that the effect of BA and DivIVA depletion was not additive so some numbers other than just the gel picture would help make the point.</p><p>d) Sucrose density gradient images (Figure 3A, 4A) are impossible to discern for untrained eyes. Quantification is necessary to show the differences.</p><p>3) Conclusions:</p><p>a) In BA- and Dibucaine-treated cells, the authors observed mis localized MurG-Dendra2 and PonA1 and reduced PG synthesis. It is reasonable to expect that membrane protein localizations are perturbed with these membrane-inserting/iron channel binding drugs, but it is difficult to draw the conclusion that reduced PG synthesis is also due to disturbed membrane architecture. Many other alternatives exist. For example, a drug could prevent protein-protein interactions to cause disruption in other enzymes' activities or disable membrane potentials to cause malfunction of membrane proteins. It is known that PG synthesis (and maybe even flipping activity) occur in large protein complexes. Similarly, the difference in the effect of BA-treated cells in different species (Figure 3E) could also be due to reasons other than the membrane domain architecture. These alternatives need to be discussed. Additionally, the working mechanisms of BA and Dibucaine are distinct, and the authors indeed showed that the time points for each treatment are significantly different (Figure 3B). However, the authors treated them the same way as to perturb membrane organization. Further explanations and justifications are needed.</p><p>b) The data set in Figure 3E is encouraging but needs additional support. The authors should further support their proposal that rod-shaped bacteria may rely on membrane fluidity and domain segregation for proper cell wall biogenesis by referencing some previous studies. Specifically, the authors should incorporate into their manuscript the recently published work by Zielinska et al., 2020. This new publication shows that membrane fluidity, which is controlled by flotillins, regulates cell wall synthesis and MreB movement. Along the same lines, the authors should also include earlier references about lipid II segregation to membrane domains and the fact that disrupting cell wall synthesis affects membrane domains (many references are listed in Zielinska et al.).</p><p>c) DivIVA creates/maintains IMD: Depleting DivIVA causes a large change in protein distributions between IMD and PM-CW, but such change could be induced by effects other than the disruption of IMD and PM-CW. For example, the changed cell shape could cause membrane curvature-sensing proteins to mis localize, or the space between the plasma membrane and cell wall being different to alter PG enzyme's activation. Alternatives should be included and discussed.</p><p>d) To truly demonstrate that IMD and PM-CW organization is important for cell wall synthesis, the authors should at least try some experiments in which they switch which domain MurG and DivIVA are by using different membrane tags to target them to the other compartment and see if PG synthesis is altered. Or, are the lipid compositions of the two compartments known? Can the authors artificially increase one over the other and see if the corresponding protein (MurG or DivIVA) goes with it? Most results presented in the study are consistent with the spatially segregated PG synthesis, but far from demonstrating that such spatial segregation is critical for PG synthesis. Conclusions could be rewritten to show that results suggest but not demonstrate.</p><p>e) The spheroplast experiment at the end: It suggests, but does not demonstrate that cell wall is required for membrane compartmentalization. For example, in spheroplasts, the whole gene expression profile also changed. One cannot say that it demonstrates that cell wall is required for gene expression.</p><p>4) Data representation and clarification:</p><p>a) The authors should clearly state at the beginning where IMD and PM-CW are in cells. From Figure 1 and 2 it appears that IMD is at cell pole and PM-CW is along the cell body, which could be misleading. The model in 4E is also not explained in the main text at all.</p><p>b) Figure indexing: It is difficult to go back and forth between different figures with the indexing not following the order of description. For example: Figure 2—figure supplement 1 is referred in Figure 1; Figure 1—figure supplement 2C referred in Figure 2C, Figure 1—figure supplement 2D referred in Figure 3A; Figure 4B before Figure 3C.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.60263.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Functionality of fusion constructs. In Figure 1C, it looks like MurG-Dendra2 is mostly in the cytoplasm with some in the IMD fraction. Figure 2A shows PonA1-mRFP as diffusive and cytoplasmic rather than bound on the membrane such as what is found in Figure 2—figure supplement 1A. Additionally, the authors cite Kieser et al. (PMID 26114871) for the functionality test of PonA1-mRFP, which further cites Hett et al. (PMID 20686708). Neither study had proper functionality tests besides growth curves. These inconsistencies raise concerns about the validity of these constructs and therefore the quality of the authors' conclusions. Please perform at least some of the following to confirm the functionality of these fusion proteins in addition to the depletion growth curves:</p><p>a) Western blot to show that in the depletion conditions there is no cleavage of the fluorescent tag of RFP or Dendra2 from MurG or PonA1. Cleavages of the tags would render untagged MurG or PonA to complement functionality and diffusive fluorescence.</p></disp-quote><p><italic>i) MurG-Dendra2</italic>. Using our in-gel fluorescence assay, we do not find a significant difference between the levels of MurG-Dendra2 +/- endogenous MurG, nor do we detect different-sized bands indicative of cleavage. We have included these results in Figure 1—figure supplement 1.</p><p><italic>ii) PonA1-mRFP.</italic> To test the functionality of the <italic>ponA1-mRFP</italic> construct we have now performed an allele swap (Figure 2—figure supplement 1) and shown that the fusion protein is active (labeled by Bocillin-FL) in the PM-CW (Figure 2—figure supplement 2), similar to endogenous protein (Figure 1C).</p><p>We do find that there are different-sized bands by anti-RFP immunoblot. We have included these data in Figure 2—figure supplement 1, and noted them in the text. Unfortunately, to our knowledge there are no other fluorescent proteins that are suitable for tagging secreted proteins in mycobacteria (based on the literature, conversations with other researchers in the field, and our own experience). Because we cannot currently exclude the possibility that the breakdown products are fluorescent we have tempered our claim.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) Cell phenotype metrics such as length and morphology in addition to growth curves to compare with that of the wild type.</p></disp-quote><p>We do not find significant changes in cell length for strains expressing the fluorescent fusion proteins (Figure 1—figure supplement 2) nor do we observe obvious differences in cell morphology.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c) Show that the pole localization pattern of MurG-Dendra2 is not caused by the Dendra2 tag by swapping the tag with other true monomeric fluorescent proteins, and/or by assay untagged MurG in different cell fractions.</p></disp-quote><p>We previously demonstrated similar localization patterns for other MurG fluorescent fusions (Meniche et al., 2014): MurG-GFP, under its own promoter and in native chromosomal context, and MurG-RFP, expressed episomally under a non-native promoter. Polar enrichment of MurG-RFP was spatially coincident with that of GlfT2-GFP (GlfT2 is an IMD marker, see Hayashi et al., 2016), a finding we were able to recapitulate in this study using MurG-Dendra2 and mCherry-GlfT2 (Figure 1—figure supplement 5, Figure 2, Figure 3—figure supplement 7).</p><p>While the above-referenced MurG fusions are not truly monomeric, we note that native MurG is enriched in the IMD proteome (Hayashi et al., 2016). Likewise we see that membrane-bound MurG-Dendra2 preferentially associates with the IMD (Figure 1C and Figure 1—figure supplement 4).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Quantifications of results. Most results were shown as representative images. It is unclear how large the sample size is and whether the differences are statistically significant. Some examples are listed below:</p><p>a) Figure 1C: the top gel showed that there are more MurG-Dendra2 in IMD compared to PM-CW. The apparent band density does not automatically translate into the enrichment of MurG-Dendra2 in IMD, especially given that MurG-Dendra2 is also present in the PM-CW fraction as well. Please quantify the amount of MurG in each fraction, normalize to the relative level of these two membrane fractions, and calculate the relative enrichment fold in IMD. The same applies to PonA1 and other IMD/PM-CW markers/proteins used in the study, as long as the protein is present in both fractions.</p></disp-quote><p>We have quantified the signal from MurG-Dendra2 and Bocillin-FL and included the data as a new supplementary figure (Figure 1—figure supplement 4).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) Figure 2A, Figure 2—figure supplement 1, Figure 3—figure supplement 4 and others: can colocalization or non-colocalization be quantified and averaged across many cells?

Because of the complexity of the system, and our focus on mycobacteria, we have tried to organize the manuscript in such a way that it systematically addresses each piece of the model in Figure 4E (in the order of arrow 2 -&gt; arrow 1-&gt; arrow 3). In the context of the present manuscript, we view the data in Figure 3E primarily as introducing the idea that there may be a conserved role for the cytoskeleton in membrane partitioning and for setting up the hypothesis that DivIVA fulfills this role in mycobacteria <italic>i.e.</italic> arrow 1 in the Figure 4E model.

While we do not yet know what makes a protein associate with a given membrane compartment in mycobacteria, we think we may have a lead. We have two fluorescent protein fusion constructs for a PM-CW-associated protein (determined in Hayashi et al., 2016). One is non-toxic, localizes around the perimeter of the cell, and, like the native protein, is present and active in the PM-CW. The other is toxic, localizes to the poles, and is present in the IMD. There is a point mutation in the toxic construct that we hypothesize explains the difference in localization. If true, we plan to test whether similar mutations can make other, normally-PM-CW proteins go to the IMD.</p><p><italic>ii) Tuning lipid composition.</italic> The IMD lipidome is distinct from that of the PM-CW (Morita et al., 2005; Hayashi et al., 2016).
