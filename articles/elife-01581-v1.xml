Here we have used a synthetic RNAi system to show that gene copy number is a key factor controlling RNAi for transcripts from endogenous loci, since transcripts from multi-copy loci form double stranded RNA more efficiently than transcripts from equivalently expressed single-copy loci. Selectivity towards transcripts from high-copy DNA is therefore an emergent property of a minimal RNAi system. The ability of RNAi to selectively degrade transcripts from high-copy loci would allow suppression of newly emerging transposable elements, but such a surveillance system requires transcription. We show that low-level genome-wide pervasive transcription is sufficient to instigate RNAi, and propose that pervasive transcription is part of a defense mechanism capable of directing a sequence-independent RNAi response against transposable elements amplifying within the genome.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01581.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01581.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01581.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Genes contain the codes that are needed to make the proteins used by cells. This code is transcribed to make a messenger RNA molecule that is then translated to make a protein. However, other types of RNA called non-coding RNA molecules can disrupt this process by binding to messenger RNA molecules, with matching sequences, before translation begins. This phenomenon, which is known as RNA interference, involves enzymes called Dicer and Argonaute.</p><p>Many cells contain large numbers of non-coding RNA molecules—so called because they are not translated to produce proteins—and many of these are capable of starting the process of RNA interference. However, most do not, and the reasons for this are not understood. Now, work by Cruz and Houseley has provided new insight into this phenomenon by showing that it is related to the number of copies of the gene encoding such RNAs in the genome.</p><p>Yeast cells normally do not have the genes for RNA interference, but Cruz and Houseley used genetically engineered yeast cells containing Dicer and Argonaute. Although most of the messenger RNA molecules in these cells showed no change, the expression of some genes with high ‘copy numbers’ was reduced. Further experiments that involved adding more and more copies of other genes showed that RNA interference could selectively target messenger RNA molecules produced from genes with an increased copy number—particularly if the copies of the genes were clustered in one location in the genome.</p><p>RNA interference is also used to defend against DNA sequences that invade and multiply within a genome, such as viruses and other ‘genetic parasites’. As such, the effect observed by Cruz and Houseley could explain why entire genomes are often continuously copied to RNA at low levels. This activity would allow the monitoring of the genome for the invasion of any genetic parasites that had multiplied to high numbers. Following on from this work, the next challenge will be to understand how gene copy number and location are balanced to achieve a selective RNA interference system.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01581.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01581.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>RNA interference</kwd><kwd>non-coding RNA</kwd><kwd>pervasive transcription</kwd><kwd>copy number</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>088335</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cruz</surname><given-names>Cristina</given-names></name><name><surname>Houseley</surname><given-names>Jonathan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The ability to target transcripts from high-copy regions of the genome is an emergent property of a minimal RNA interference system.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Over the past decade, our understanding of the complexity of the eukaryotic transcriptome has been revolutionized. Genome-wide sequencing studies in many organisms have revealed that protein-coding mRNAs are augmented by a multitude of non-protein coding RNAs (ncRNAs), many produced from regions of the genome traditionally considered to be transcriptionally silent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brummelkamp et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bertone et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cheng et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">David et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Birney et al., 2007</xref>). Functional data for the vast majority of ncRNAs are currently lacking, with only a few examples characterized in any detail; however, the diversity of mechanisms by which these act suggests that ncRNAs have a rich and varied biology that is largely still to be sampled.</p><p>Long ncRNAs which overlap protein-coding genes have the potential to modulate the expression of their cognate coding RNA. Early characterized examples in yeast were thought to work by directly disrupting transcription factor or polymerase binding to the promoter of the coding RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Martens et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hongay et al., 2006</xref>); however, more recent data implicate specific chromatin structure changes in repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gelfand et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hainer et al., 2011</xref>), and many other cases of ncRNAs that alter chromatin modifications have been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Camblong et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berretta et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Houseley et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Pinskaya et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">van Werven et al., 2012</xref>). Chromatin modifications are not necessarily repressive, and ncRNAs that enhance expression of their overlapping coding gene have also been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Uhler et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hirota et al., 2008</xref>). In these examples, chromatin modifications are deposited during transcription, and therefore the act of transcription rather than the ncRNA itself is important. This is not always the case, and in higher eukaryotes multiple <italic>cis</italic>-acting ncRNAs have also been characterized, particularly as functional agents in imprinting. For example, <italic>Air</italic> and <italic>Kcnq1ot1</italic> act in <italic>cis</italic> to deposit repressive chromatin marks and DNA methylation, but these ncRNAs interact with chromatin modifiers and allele specificity is achieved by restriction of the ncRNA to the vicinity of the transcription site, although the importance of the transcription itself remains controversial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Nagano et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Pandey et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Redrup et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Latos et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Genomes are also replete with low abundance and unstable RNA. The vast majority of ncRNAs in budding yeast are unstable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Neil et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">van Dijk et al., 2011</xref>), limiting the potential action of the RNAs themselves, although the transcription of such RNAs can still alter gene expression (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Houseley, 2012</xref>). Such unstable RNAs are also widespread in higher eukaryotes, probably with similar functional roles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chekanova et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Preker et al., 2008</xref>). More mysterious is the pervasive transcription that permeates eukaryotic genomes; the ENCODE project found that almost all the human genome is transcribed at some point, but the products of this transcription are vanishingly rare (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cheng et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Birney et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kapranov et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Goodman et al., 2012</xref>). It appears that regions of the genome which are not actively transcribed for other reasons undergo pervasive transcription; however, it is not known whether this pervasive transcription simply represents transcriptional noise or whether the transcription or RNAs themselves have important but as yet undiscovered functions.</p><p>Systems in which a ncRNA is transcribed antisense to a sense protein-coding RNA are common and have strong regulatory potential (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Han et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Carninci et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Xu et al., 2009</xref>). It has been suggested that, since antisense ncRNAs are perfectly complementary to their cognate mRNA, the two species could form double stranded RNA (dsRNA) that would be a substrate for the RNA interference system (RNAi). During a basic RNAi response, dsRNA is cleaved by the endonuclease Dicer into short interfering RNA (siRNA), of which one strand is then loaded onto an Argonaute protein. The Argonaute–siRNA complex can anneal to complementary sequences in target RNAs, which are then cleaved by the endonuclease activity of Argonaute. RNAi was originally discovered in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> and rapidly linked to the phenomenon of post-transcriptional gene silencing in plants; however, almost all eukaryotes contain Dicer and Argonaute orthologues and therefore have some form of RNAi system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hamilton and Baulcombe, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Strobel, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Surabhi and Gaynor, 2002</xref>). RNAi probably evolved to protect cells against dsRNA viruses, a role which is maintained in plants, insects, and lower eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ding, 2010</xref>) and has recently been described in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Li et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Maillard et al., 2013</xref>). RNAi also forms a potent defense against transposons, and high-copy transposon-derived sequences are excellent targets for RNAi, giving rise to copious siRNAs in most eukaryotes including mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Yang and Kazazian, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Slotkin and Martienssen, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Babiarz et al., 2008</xref>). In addition to degrading transposon-derived and viral RNA, siRNAs can mediate transcriptional repression of target RNAs through chromatin modifications and DNA methylation, although this activity is seemingly much stronger in lower eukaryotes and plants than in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Martienssen et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lejeune et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Zhang and Zhu, 2011</xref>). However, the source of the dsRNA that is processed into siRNA is not always obvious, nor is the mechanism by which cells differentiate host and transposon-derived sequences. siRNA-mediated repression is complemented by PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs), which bind to the Argonaut-related PIWI-domain proteins and enforce transposon repression in the germline of eukaryotes from worms to mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Siomi et al., 2011</xref>). piRNAs are derived from specific genomic clusters, but it is unclear how the transcripts from these clusters are selected for processing into primary piRNAs and many of the processing enzymes remain to be identified (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ishizu et al., 2012</xref>).<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01581.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Frequency of annotated antisense non-protein coding RNAs (ncRNAs) and effects on mRNA abundance.</title><p>(<bold>A)</bold> Schematic of an example sense mRNA-antisense (ncRNA) system.

Efficient generation of siRNAs from endogenous sense-antisense systems (endo-siRNA) has been observed in plants under stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Borsani et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Katiyar-Agarwal et al., 2006</xref>), and mammalian oocytes generate endo-siRNAs that can mediate mRNA knockdown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Tam et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Watanabe et al., 2008</xref>). However, although endo-siRNAs have been detected outside the germline in mammals, they are surprisingly under-represented where sense and antisense RNAs are co-expressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Faghihi and Wahlestedt, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Okamura et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Carlile et al., 2009</xref>), and overall there is a positive correlation between antisense and sense RNA expression in mammalian genomes, which is inconsistent with RNAi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Han et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Katayama et al., 2005</xref>). This raises questions about whether endogenous sense-antisense systems do in fact form dsRNA in vivo and, if so, whether all dsRNA is equivalently accessible to Dicer.</p><p>The tight integration of the RNAi system into the physiology of most eukaryotic cells makes it very difficult to disentangle direct and indirect effects of mutating RNAi components (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ketting, 2011</xref>). To elucidate factors important for the induction of RNAi by endogenous sense-antisense systems, we therefore used a recently described synthetic system in which RNAi is reconstituted in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> by the introduction of Argonaute and Dicer from the related yeast <italic>S. castellii</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Drinnenberg et al., 2009</xref>). <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> is highly unusual in lacking an endogenous RNAi system, allowing maintenance of the symbiotic dsRNA Killer virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Drinnenberg et al., 2011</xref>).

Cells lacking Xrn1 show increased levels of antisense and, unexpectedly, sense RNA, but, as for <italic>MAL32</italic>, we did not detect a significant decrease in full-length RNA in RNAi+ <italic>xrn1</italic>Δ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B</xref>). However, amplification of the locus by cloning on a high-copy plasmid leads to significant degradation of the sense RNA along with the antisense RNA by RNAi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G,H</xref>). Surprisingly, this occurred even in a known mutant that lacks antisense expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Geisler et al., 2012</xref>), but 5′ RACE (Rapid Amplification of 5′ Complementary DNA Ends) experiments revealed that antisense RNA is still produced by this mutant when expressed from a high-copy plasmid, even if it is too heterogeneous for detection by northern blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>). Taken together, these experiments on <italic>MAL32</italic> and <italic>GAL4</italic> demonstrate that increasing gene copy number can make the products of a normal gene susceptible to RNAi.</p><p>One potential confounding factor in these experiments is the copy number of the high-copy plasmids; if the copy number drops in RNAi+ cells, this would provide a trivial explanation for the observed knockdowns. However, Southern blotting revealed that RNAi+ cells contained approximately twofold more plasmid than the controls, which would tend to decrease rather than increase the apparent effect of RNAi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5A,B</xref>). It is likely that RNAi degrades the mRNA for the plasmid-encoded selectable marker and 2µ maintenance genes (2µ genes produce copious siRNA, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5C</xref>), and the plasmid copy number rises to compensate for this. We also wanted to use a different method to confirm the northern blot results. We therefore lysed wild-type and RNAi+ cells containing the <italic>MAL32</italic> and <italic>GAL4</italic> plasmids, precipitated dsRNA using a specific monoclonal antibody (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Schonborn et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gullerova and Proudfoot, 2012</xref>), and assayed total and dsRNA levels by quantitative RT-PCR. <italic>MAL32</italic> mRNA was knocked down approximately 75%, as observed by northern blot analysis, while dsRNA was reduced 11-fold, consistent with specific removal of dsRNA by Dicer. <italic>GAL4</italic> mRNA knockdown was measured at 80% in this assay, again with an 11-fold reduction in dsRNA in the RNAi+ strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s6">Figure 3—figure supplement 6</xref>).</p><p>Increasing gene copy number also increases RNA production. To separate the contributions of RNA abundance and copy number, we analyzed existing genome-wide data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Silva et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Drinnenberg et al., 2011</xref>). If siRNA formation depends only on precursor RNA abundance, a positive correlation should be observed between total RNA abundance and siRNA abundance, and there should be no difference between distributions of single-copy loci and multi-copy loci. We observed little evidence for such a positive correlation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>); however, plots of siRNA versus total RNA abundance for single-copy and multi-copy loci showed strikingly different distributions, with multi-copy loci clearly biased towards higher siRNA production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). To quantify this difference, loci were segregated into eight groups of increasing total RNA abundance and siRNA abundance was assessed for single-copy and multi-copy loci in each group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). siRNA production was significantly higher from multi-copy loci than from single-copy loci in all except the lowest category of RNA abundance. This result was robust to changes in the threshold between low and high copy, and was still observed in a comparison of low to medium copy number, showing that high-copy Ty1 retrotransposons were not distorting the analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). A normalization step is required in these analyses to deal with mapping of sequence reads to multi-copy loci (discussed in detail in ‘Materials and methods’); however, the same differences were observed with no normalization or a different normalization scheme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>). These surprising results show that multi-copy loci produce more siRNA than single-copy loci with equivalent RNA abundance. If this observation is real, the siRNA:total RNA ratio should be predictive of copy number, an important test since this comparison requires no copy number normalization. As predicted, the 1% of genome with the highest siRNA:total RNA ratio is massively enriched for multi-copy loci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), and when this ratio was plotted across a chromosome, an obvious correlation was observed between regions of high-copy number and regions with high siRNA:total RNA abundance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). These analyses clearly demonstrate that selectivity towards the products of multi-copy loci is an emergent property of a minimal RNAi system.<fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01581.014</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Multi-copy loci are preferentially targeted by RNA interference (RNAi).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Short interfering RNA (siRNA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Drinnenberg et al., 2011</xref>) and total RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Silva et al., 2002</xref>) abundance for loci with copy number &lt;2 (left, single-copy) or ≥2 (right, multi-copy).

Dicer was present in cytoplasmic foci, but also showed a diffuse cytoplasmic staining (compare the indicated wild-type and RNAi+ cells) and, under wide-field imaging, appeared to be present in the nucleus. However, super-resolution images of the same cells showed nuclear exclusion of Dicer; therefore, if Dicer is present in the nucleus, it is at low levels. dsRNA staining in these cells revealed many cytoplasmic foci, presumably Killer virus dsRNAs that are known to be incompletely cleared by RNAi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Drinnenberg et al., 2011</xref>), but did not show unambiguous nuclear staining.</p><p>As an alternative, we asked whether the spatial configuration of gene copies within the nucleus could affect siRNA formation; such an effect would provide strong evidence for the formation of dsRNA in the nucleus.

Here we have demonstrated that RNAi has an innate preference for the products of high-copy sequences, probably because RNA from high-copy sequences forms dsRNA more efficiently. It has long been known that cells can recognize and silence high-copy DNA, which would form a basic defense against uncontrolled amplification of transposable elements (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Takahashi et al., 2002</xref>). This of course requires a mechanism to count copy number, or at least differentiate high- and low-copy regions, which has remained mysterious. Our data show that RNAi provides such a mechanism by selectively targeting the products of high-copy loci.</p><p>The production of siRNA from high-copy DNA, which would be the basis of such a counting mechanism, absolutely requires that all DNA is transcribed; if this does not occur, transposable elements that remain transcriptionally silent would be invisible to the system. Pervasive transcription, the general background of very low level RNA produced across the genome, ensures that the vast majority of the genome is transcribed, and therefore that no region remains completely silent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cheng et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Birney et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kapranov et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Goodman et al., 2012</xref>). The extent to which mammalian genomes are pervasively transcribed has been controversial; however, many of the questions revolve around whether the pervasive transcripts represent defined functional products or whether much of the detected RNA represents random transcriptional noise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">van Bakel et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Clark et al., 2011</xref>). For a general surveillance function, it does not really matter whether pervasive transcription is formed of many discrete transcripts or occurs at random since either process should be sufficient to generate dsRNA. If a large proportion of pervasive transcription does represent random noise, this would be actively advantageous; random transcription would be sequence independent, and therefore transposable elements could not become fully silent by mutating individual promoter sequences. We suggest that the primary function of pervasive transcription lies in ensuring the whole genome is transcribed to allow identification and suppression of transposable elements; this does not conflict with the idea that some proportion of these transcripts may have additional functions.</p><p>We propose that hybridization kinetics explains the dependence of RNAi on copy number (shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). The rate of formation of dsRNA from single stranded sense and antisense RNA is proportional to the concentration of each strand of RNA, and so is inversely proportional to the square of the reaction volume. Technically, the reaction volume is the non-excluded volume of the cell; however, this assumes a uniform distribution of RNA throughout the cell. In reality the RNA is far from evenly distributed, so some small volumes may have very high concentrations of RNA and, within these volumes, the rate of dsRNA formation will be dramatically higher than in the bulk of the cell. Single-copy loci cannot simultaneously transcribe sense and antisense RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Silva et al., 2002</xref>) so, although such a locus can give rise to a mixed population of sense and antisense RNA in the cytoplasm over time, in the vicinity of the transcription site only one sense of RNA should ever be present, assuming efficient RNA export. Annealing of sense and antisense RNA must therefore occur in the relatively large non-excluded cytoplasmic volume of the cell, which will be inefficient except for very highly expressed RNA. In contrast, at multi-copy loci the simultaneous production of sense and antisense RNA from many closely spaced sites can lead to high concentrations of sense and antisense RNA around the transcription site, causing efficient duplex formation and hence efficient RNAi.<fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01581.024</object-id><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Proposed mechanism for RNA interference (RNAi) on high-copy loci.</title><p>The rate of double stranded RNA (dsRNA) formation, the required first step in RNAi, is highly dependent on local RNA concentration. Single-copy loci cannot simultaneously transcribe sense and antisense RNA, allowing RNA export to occur before the strands meet and requiring hybridization to occur in the relatively large cytoplasmic volume. In contrast, sense and antisense RNA can be simultaneously transcribed from different parts of a multi-copy locus and, therefore, if the copies are closely juxtaposed in the genome or in 3D space, the local concentration of sense and antisense RNA around the transcription sites should be high, favoring dsRNA formation.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01581.024">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01581.024</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-01581-fig9-v1"/></fig></p><p>This mechanism predicts that dsRNA formation should occur in the nucleus, but we were not able to detect Dicer in the nucleus by immunofluorescence. This reflects the situation in higher eukaryotes where Dicer is largely cytoplasmic, but recent experiments in Drosophila and mammalian cells have detected small quantities of nuclear Dicer, particularly associated with chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sinkkonen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cernilogar et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gullerova et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Doyle et al., 2013</xref>). Low but functional levels of Dicer may therefore be present in the nucleus of RNAi+ cells and able to generate siRNA. Alternatively, the dsRNA may be exported and processed in the cytoplasm. To our knowledge, there is no clear evidence for or against export of dsRNA by normal pathways; certainly these would not be too large or too structured to pass through nuclear pores compared, for example, with pre-ribosomes.</p><p>One notable prediction of this mechanism is that clustering of multi-copy transcription sites would be a particularly efficient way to increase the local density of sense and antisense RNA. All the systems we have described in this paper are clustered: rDNA repeats are arranged in tandem, telomeres are known to cluster together at various points in the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Van Roessel et al., 2002</xref>), and high-copy 2µ plasmids exist in a discrete focus that is vital for copy number maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akten et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Presente et al., 2002</xref>). The comparison of siRNA formation from clustered and dispersed <italic>TRP1</italic> loci provides experimental evidence for this effect since, for a given quantity of sense and antisense RNA, the clustered system produces more siRNA. Although the clustered system also produces read-through transcripts, these would not have a higher hybridization rate than the non-read-through RNAs as the hybridization rate depends on the frequency of collisions between molecules. Intriguingly, Tf2 retrotransposons in <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> are clustered by the action of centromere protein B (CENP-B), which also silences these elements through histone deacetylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cam et al., 2008</xref>). This clustering would allow cells to produce siRNA against the Tf2 elements through pervasive transcription, although multiple mechanisms silence Tf2 retrotransposons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Yamanaka et al., 2012</xref>), providing an extra defense against retrotransposon activation. Similarly, gypsy retrotransposons in Drosophila are known to cluster (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gerasimova et al., 2000</xref>), which may again facilitate siRNA production. Hence, the clustering of transposable elements by factors such as CENP-B would facilitate their recognition by RNAi and allow for selective RNA degradation.</p><p>Mammalian germline cells are replete with small RNAs including endogenous siRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Watanabe et al., 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Tam et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Song et al., 2011</xref>), and siRNAs in sperm and oocytes show a pronounced bias towards high-copy sequences that would be effectively explained by the selectivity of the RNAi system towards the products of high-copy loci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Watanabe et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Song et al., 2011</xref>). However, it remains unclear how some dsRNA precursors of siRNAs are generated, particularly for retrotransposons that are primarily expressed only on the sense strand. We suggest that pervasive transcription would provide sufficient antisense RNA for this role, just as we observed for high-copy GAL cluster sequences in yeast.</p><p>In comparison to the germline, the response of mammalian somatic cells to dsRNA is distinctly muted. dsRNA could be processed into siRNA, be altered by RNA editing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hogg et al., 2011</xref>), or could activate the interferon response leading to apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gantier and Williams, 2007</xref>). However, transgenic mice expressing a hairpin dsRNA construct produce minimal siRNAs, little edited RNA, and show no phenotype that might indicate cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Nejepinska et al., 2012a</xref>). Nonetheless, siRNAs produced from LINE-1 retrotransposons have been detected in cell culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Yang and Kazazian, 2006</xref>), and high-copy transfected plasmids expressing a sense-antisense RNA pair do produce detectable siRNA in HEK293 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Nejepinska et al., 2012b</xref>). This shows that a basic siRNA response with an apparent bias towards high-copy sequences is functional in mammalian somatic cells.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Yeast strains, plasmids and culture conditions</title><p>Yeast deletion strains (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>) were created by standard methods using the oligonucleotides in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>.

Total RNA levels were multiplied by copy number to correct for the division of reads amongst copies that occurs during mapping, or alternate normalization was applied in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref> (see below for the reasoning underlying this copy number normalization methodology). The copy number for each bin was determined by splitting the complete genomic sequence into overlapping 20 bp segments at 1 bp intervals and re-mapping to the genome with reads allowed to align to all perfectly matching sequences, producing a measure of the number of genomic sequences matching each 100 bp bin. Little difference was seen if one mismatch was allowed (data not shown).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Read count normalization for multi-copy sequences</title><p>Multi-copy loci are problematic for standard high-throughput sequencing mapping pipelines and are commonly discarded. Reads mapping to a non-unique genome sequence are usually assigned at random to one copy in the genome, therefore the total reads are divided evenly amongst the copies and the apparent abundance of RNA matching each copy is effectively divided by the copy number. In order to assess total RNA abundance (as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B</xref>), we multiplied all total RNA read counts by the copy number to obtain the real total RNA abundance. However, we decided that the siRNA abundance should be analyzed per producing locus because each copy in the genome was analyzed separately for comparison with single-copy loci (i.e., we quantified how many siRNA reads an individual copy of a multi-copy locus produced, not how many the combined copies produced). We therefore did not multiply the siRNA read counts by the copy number. Such normalizations clearly have the potential to introduce systematic biases, and we therefore repeated the analysis in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> either with no copy number normalization or with both total and siRNA read counts multiplied by copy number (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). We found that although the distributions changed somewhat, the majority of total RNA abundance categories had higher siRNA levels for multi-copy loci irrespective of the copy number normalization applied. We note that the alternative copy number analysis in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C,D</xref> did not require any normalization; indeed, any copy number normalization would simply cancel out in the calculation of the siRNA:total RNA ratio, therefore any systematic bias that might be introduced by copy number normalization would have no effect.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Simon Andrews, Felix Krueger, Laura Biggins and Anne Segonds-Pichon for Bioinformatics support, Simon Walker for microscopy support, David Bartel for strains, Robin Allshire, Wolf Reik and Sarah Elderkin for comments, and Alex Murray and Tim Hore for critical reading.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor and 3 reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This study employs the so-called RNAi+ <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> strain generated in the Bartel lab (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Drinnenberg et al 2009</xref>) that is transformed with <italic>S. Castellii Dicer</italic> and <italic>Ago</italic> genes. This original study suggested that this RNAi+ yeast would be a good model system to explore RNAi gene silencing mechanisms. It is clear that this is the case as this new study makes excellent use of this strain. What is shown here is that endogenous convergent transcription (especially mRNA sense and ncRNA antisense arrangement) generates siRNAs in RNAi+ cells but this does not correlate with reduced mRNA abundance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Also repetitive sequences (Y′ RNA and rRNA) generate abundant siRNAs and show significant RNAi dependent RNA degradation. Some of these data are however predicted from the original Drinnenberg et al study. New results are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> showing in two test gene cases (<italic>MAL32</italic> and <italic>GAL4</italic>) that forced sense antisense expression of these genes on multicopy transformed plasmids generate both siRNAs and also show clear gene silencing. These results lead to the key observation that it isn't the overall level of expression (sense antisense) that is critical but rather it is the fact that expression comes from multicopy genes (rather than one highly expressed gene). This point is initially made from bioinformatic analysis of the RNAi+ transcriptiome (Drinneneberg et al) where multicopy genes generate more siRNA than single copy rather than simply correlating with totals RNA levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5 fig6">Figures 5 and 6</xref> then validate the bioinformatics very clearly. The integrated single copy <italic>MAL32</italic> expressing high level sense and antisense transcription due to the use of strong convergent arranged promoters does not generate as much siRNA as multicopy low expressed <italic>MAL32</italic>. Also sense antisense ncRNAs expressed on multicopy plasmids generate significant amounts of siRNA. Finally some evidence was provided that siRNAs from high-copy <italic>GAL10</italic> constructs (making sense and antisense RNAs) can generate siRNA that silence another <italic>GAL10</italic> gene in trans.</p><p>Overall the three reviewers of this paper while aware of the somewhat artificial nature of the RNAi+ <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> strain consider that the experimental benefit of this system has been put to excellent use and has allowed significant new insight in RNAi mechanism to be obtained. The key additional experiments that we feel are necessary to make a revised manuscript acceptable for publication by <italic>eLife</italic> are as follows.</p><p>1) The actual copy number of the 2µ plasmids transformed into the RNAi+ strain should be directly measured by Southern blotting</p><p>2) The <italic>Castellii</italic> Dcr1 gene should be knocked out to show loss of the high-copy number silencing observed for <italic>MAL32</italic> and <italic>GAL4</italic>.</p><p>3) The location of dsRNA and <italic>Dicer</italic> in the transformed RNAi+ cells should be directly visualised (J2 antibody for dsRNA and Tagged <italic>Dcr1</italic>/anti <italic>Dcr1</italic>) to show either chromatin or cytolasmic association. See Schönborn, J. et al. NAR 19, 2993-3000, 1991; Gullerova and Proudfoot NSMB 19, 1193-1201 2013 for J2 antibody.</p><p>4) Better quantitation of RNAi effect on mRNA levels and level of dsRNA is required. This can be achieved by RTqPCR and for dsRNA level of J2 dsRNA immunoprecipitation.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01581.028</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) The actual copy number of the 2µ plasmids transformed into the RNAi+ strain should be directly measured by</italic> <italic>Southern blotting</italic></p><p>We have included a southern for 2µ copy number as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3–figure supplement 5</xref>. We have also shown a northern blot for the <italic>MAL32</italic> high-copy plasmid in which the plasmid signals are clearly visible. Both analyses show that the copy number does not decrease in the RNAi+ strain – it actually increases, an observation we discuss in the text.</p><p><italic>2) The</italic> Castellii <italic>Dcr1 gene should be knocked out to show loss of the high-copy number silencing observed for</italic> MAL32 <italic>and</italic> GAL4<italic>.</italic></p><p>We decided to combine this with changing the genetic background of the RNAi+ strain. We cloned Dcr1 and Ago1 onto single copy plasmids and introduced these into BY4741 cells (the original background is W303), along with the high-copy plasmids. The result for <italic>MAL32</italic> is very clear, showing that both genes are required for knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3–figure supplement 3</xref>). However, in this genetic background <italic>GAL4</italic> is only expressed very weakly from the high-copy plasmid; the RNA forms dsRNA efficiently as expected and this is removed by Dicer, although this does not lead to a clear knockdown. The <italic>GAL4</italic> knockdown was the weakest we observed in the original experiments, and RNAi knockdowns in this new strain are not as strong as in the original strain (60% in new strain vs. 80% in the original strain for the <italic>MAL32</italic> mRNA). Combined with the confounding effect of the increased plasmid copy number in RNAi+ cells, the <italic>GAL4</italic> knockdown becomes too weak to test the importance of Dicer. We do not think that this compromises the conclusions of the paper.</p><p><italic>3) The location of dsRNA and</italic> Dicer <italic>in the transformed RNAi+ cells should be directly visualised (J2 antibody for dsRNA and Tagged</italic> Dcr1<italic>/anti</italic> Dcr1<italic>) to show either chromatin or cytolasmic association.

We could not convincingly detect Dicer in nuclei, and the dsRNA signal is dominated by strong cytoplasmic signals, most likely from Killer virus RNAs. Although RNAi should technically clear Killer virus, the analysis performed by the Bartel lab shows that this clearance is far from complete. We have used a different approach to improve confidence in nuclear formation of dsRNA; if dsRNA forms in the nucleus then the juxtaposition of transcribing copies should be important, and we demonstrate that this is true for the <italic>TRP1</italic> gene in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>. We have referred to both of these experiments in the Discussion.</p><p><italic>4) Better quantitation of RNAi effect on mRNA levels and level of dsRNA is required. This can be achieved by RTqPCR and for dsRNA level of J2 dsRNA immunoprecipitation</italic>.</p><p>We have added a number of additional results here. Firstly, we have added quantification for the effect of RNAi on endogenous <italic>MAL32</italic> and <italic>GAL4</italic> mRNA along with full length northern blot images that show degradation patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3–figure supplement 2</xref>). We have also performed the J2 immunoprecipitations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s6">Figure 3–figure supplement 6</xref>) – these show a clear loss dsRNA in the RNAi strain, and confirm the Northern blot results for mRNA knockdown.</p></body></sub-article></article>
