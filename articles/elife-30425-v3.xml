couplons) comprising plasma and sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane calcium channels are important determinants of the heart's performance. Nevertheless, our knowledge about the properties of ECC couplons is limited by the lack of appropriate experimental and analysis strategies. We designed CaCLEAN to untangle the fundamental characteristics of ECC couplons by combining the astronomer's CLEAN algorithm with known properties of calcium diffusion. CaCLEAN empowers the investigation of fundamental properties of ECC couplons in beating cardiomyocytes without pharmacological interventions. Upon examining individual ECC couplons at the nanoscopic level, we reveal their roles in the negative amplitude-frequency relationship and in β-adrenergic stimulation, including decreasing and increasing firing reliability, respectively. CaCLEAN combined with 3D confocal imaging of beating cardiomyocytes provides a functional 3D map of active ECC couplons (on average, 17,000 per myocyte). CaCLEAN will further enlighten the ECC-couplon-remodelling processes that underlie cardiac diseases.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>calcium signalling</kwd><kwd>cellular cardiac physiology</kwd><kwd>excitation contraction coupling</kwd><kwd>realtime confocal microscopy</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Saarland University, Medical Faculty</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HOMFORexcellence</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tian</surname><given-names>Qinghai</given-names></name><name><surname>Guo</surname><given-names>Jia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFB 894/TP A19</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lipp</surname><given-names>Peter</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>TRR 152/TP P17</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lipp</surname><given-names>Peter</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The fusion of astronomy and cellular cardiology reveals the 3D arrangement and the firing reliability of active excitation-contraction coupling sites in beating cardiac myocytes.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cardiac myocytes are the functional cellular units of the heart, whose contractile properties largely determine the pumping performance of the heart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bers, 2002</xref>). During cellular action potentials, voltage-operated L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (LTCCs) in the plasma membrane evoke a brief Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx that is amplified by ryanodine receptors (RyRs) in the membrane of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). This process is referred to as Ca<sup>2+</sup>-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> release (CICR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bers, 2002</xref>). It is generally accepted that LTCCs and RyRs are clustered on their respective membranes and oppose each other strongly to build up the functional excitation-contraction coupling (ECC) unit, the so-called ECC couplon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Soeller et al., 2007</xref>). For each heartbeat, reliable communication between these partners ensures robust functional coupling of the plasma and SR membranes and enables synchronized activation of ECC couplons throughout the myocyte, a prerequisite for optimal contractility of the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wier and Balke, 1999</xref>). Many processes contribute to the dynamics of Ca<sup>2+</sup> cycling in cardiomyocytes, including the opening of LTCCs, the activity of the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ATPase (SERCA) and the functional state of RyRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bers, 2008</xref>).</p><p>The adrenergic hormone system is a major regulator of minute-by-minute cardiovascular function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dorn, 2010</xref>) and evokes activation of the cAMP/protein kinase A signalling pathway, resulting in the phosphorylation of key proteins of ECC, including LTCCs, phospholamban, and RyRs. Ultimately, the system results in an increased cellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient and in cellular force production, fostering the mechanical output of the heart and thus providing a positive inotropic response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bers, 2002</xref>). In addition, β-adrenergic stimulation in vivo exerts a positive chronotropic effect, highlighting the importance of understanding the force-frequency response as an important physiological mechanism regulating cardiac output (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anderson et al., 1973</xref>). As part of the negative force-frequency relationship found in small rodents (e.g., rat and mouse), the amplitude of the global Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient decreases with increasing stimulation frequency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sipido et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gattoni et al., 2016</xref>). Several different processes might contribute to this behavior, including a decreased SR-Ca<sup>2+</sup> content, a decreased number of ‘participating’ ECC couplons and decreased Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from individual ECC couplon sites, all of which are able to diminish the global, cellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient. Whether and to what degree the reliability of couplons' firing adds to the latter contributor remains elusive.</p><p>The current knowledge of RyR cluster behavior has substantially increased following the advent of confocal microscopy, which enables the study of spontaneous, local Ca<sup>2+</sup> release signals, the Ca<sup>2+</sup> spark (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cheng et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lipp and Niggli, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cheng and Lederer, 2008</xref>). Although ECC couplon sites represent a subset of Ca<sup>2+</sup> spark sites and they share similar properties, their mode of occurrence–i.e., evoked vs. spontaneous, synchronized vs. uncoordinated—disallows direct transfer of Ca<sup>2+</sup> spark properties onto those of the couplon site. Localized Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients from ECC couplons occur in a synchronized manner through the action potential and in great numbers (more than ten thousand within a few tens of milliseconds) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bers, 2002</xref>). The analysis of spontaneous Ca<sup>2+</sup> sparks will not capture the properties of ECC couplons following electrical orchestration because spontaneous openings of RyRs might be under the control of different sets of environmental parameters, and because they lack the signal transduction component of translating the electrical action potential into Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel opening and into localized Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx. These complex processes substantially determine a majority of the properties of ECC couplon sites and thus contribute to shaping the global Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient.</p><p>The number and arrangement of LTCC and RyR clusters can be determined by appropriate immunohistochemistry. However, relating conclusions from such preparations to the physiological distribution of electrically evoked and functional ECC couplons (e.g., by co-localization analysis) is rather difficult and often based on many assumptions. One of the most striking problems is that microscopic approaches to studying co-localization, even with super-resolution techniques, are still too coarse to identify functional coupling between these two partners reliably during normal ECC. In addition, fixation artefacts, such as shrinking of the preparation or alteration of the nanoscopic arrangement of proteins, might affect the aforementioned analysis. Thus, it clearly follows that approaches allowing for a robust in situ analysis (i.e., in the living naive cell during normal ECC) are eagerly anticipated not only to provide a full appreciation of the physiological 3D distribution of active ECC couplons but also to reveal pathophysiological alterations therein.</p><p>The spontaneous firing of individual Ca<sup>2+</sup> release clusters, that is Ca<sup>2+</sup> sparks, can technically be monitored by laser-scanning microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cheng et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cheng and Lederer, 2008</xref>). However, the firing of thousands of synchronized but ultra-fast and highly dynamic ECC couplons renders it almost impossible to investigate the behavior of individual ECC couplons during physiological ECC in the absence of pharmacological or experimental interventions such as high Ca<sup>2+</sup> buffer concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cleemann et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Woo et al., 2002</xref>). Moreover, the low number of photons per pixel during the brief pixel dwell time (effective dwell time down to 50 ns in 2D over time scanning) and the concomitant high Poissonian noise from the detection device (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Tian et al., 2012a</xref>) further veil the behavior of individual ECC couplons. Microscopic characterization of individual ECC sites in the global population of ECC couplons is akin to the observation of an individual star in a galaxy. We thus considered employing the astronomical CLEAN algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Högbom, 1974</xref>) to enable mapping of active ECC couplon sites, gain novel insights into the mechanism of cardiac ECC, and present a unique approach to mapping active ECC couplons in intact cardiomyocytes with unprecedented accuracy in the absence of any pharmacological intervention. Herein, we provide a fundamental analysis of the behavior of these ECC couplons and ECC reliability during electrically evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients. We also describe their behavior during the negative Ca<sup>2+</sup> amplitude-frequency relationship and during β-adrenergic stimulation. Moreover, for the first time, we present a full 3D mapping of firing couplons during normal ECC.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>ECC couplon mapping and reliability of firing in mouse atrial myocytes</title><p>As previously reported, mouse atrial myocytes display a complex pattern of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals during normal ECC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1Aa</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Mackenzie et al., 2001</xref>). Ultrafast confocal imaging (147 frames/second) allows for the monitoring of such complex Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals. Nevertheless, despite the chance to capture individual time points that display apparent initiation sites of local Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals (i.e., firing ECC couplons; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1Aa</xref> – panel 13.7 ms), these are solely ‘eager sites’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Mackenzie et al., 2001</xref>), whereas ECC couplons firing later disappear in the evolving global Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal (see panels in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1Aa</xref> later time points). Robust de-noising with a specialized ‘CANDLE’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Coupé et al., 2012</xref>), algorithm, which simultaneously removes Poissonian and Gaussian noise, did not significantly improve this situation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1Ab</xref>). To improve on this scheme, we designed the CaCLEAN algorithm combining the astronomer´s CLEAN approach and known approximated diffusion properties of Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions (for a detailed description see Materials and methods section and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). The CaCLEAN method enabled us to identify active ECC couplons in each of the recorded frames (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; for display reasons, we applied a slight blurring to the data; for the original CaCLEAN data, please see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). When we rebuilt the fluorescence images based on these active ECC couplon maps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), they resembled the original fluorescence very closely (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

To this end, we performed model calculations of the putative fluorescence signal from an individual firing couplon and varied its distance to the plane of focus (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4A</xref> and top row in B). We added recording noise (second row in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4B</xref>) and fed the data through our CaCLEAN approach; the resulting maps of ECC couplon activity are depicted in the bottom row of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4B</xref>. The peak CaCLEAN signal displayed a decreasing magnitude with an increasing distance to the plane of focus, resulting in an apparent z-resolution of approximately 1 µm under our recording conditions (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4C</xref>).</p><p>In addition to the z-axis resolution, we addressed the xy-resolution in three different ways. First, we simulated two local Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5Aand B</xref>) with various distances between their centres. These events were convoluted with noise levels also observed in our original recordings and passed through the CaCLEAN algorithm. From these data, we concluded that the CaCLEAN algorithm is able to resolve local transients whose centres are 1 µm apart (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5C</xref>). In rat ventricular myocytes, the mean distance between RyR clusters was reported to be 1.02 µm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Soeller et al., 2007</xref>). Second, we simulated a Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient with gridded Ca<sup>2+</sup> release (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplement 6Aa and b</xref>). After adding realistic recording noise (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplement 6Ac</xref>), these data were passed through the CaCLEAN algorithm and couplon maps were generated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplement 6Ad</xref>). Superimposing the calculated maps with the original simulate maps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplement 6B</xref>) demonstrated a good correlation between these two data sets. Finally, we generated a single Ca<sup>2+</sup> release image with a descriptive model, as shown in the Materials and methods section, and distributed 1000 copies of such events randomly inside the circumvent of a typical ventricular myocyte (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s7">Figure 1—figure supplement 7A,B andC</xref>). The data were passed through the CaCLEAN algorithm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s7">Figure 1—figure supplement 7D</xref>). Superimposing the centres of Ca<sup>2+</sup> release with the CaCLEANed couplon map (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s7">Figure 1—figure supplement 7E</xref>) demonstrated that the CaCLEAN algorithm neither generated any false positive ECC couplons nor lost any Ca<sup>2+</sup> release events. On the basis of these tests in both the xy-plane and z-axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>), we believe that the CaCLEAN algorithm can reproduce the physiological 3D distribution of active ECC couplons throughout rat ventricular myocytes.</p><p>Interestingly, the relationship between the CaCLEAN signal and the z-position was non-linear (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>), resulting in an augmented functional ‘rejection’ of ‘out of focus’ Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals and improved sectioning, as displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>. We investigated the single-pixel Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients at the centre of an identified ECC couplon (pixel 1, red, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1Ea</xref>), beside the centre pixel (pixel 2, yellow, 0.215 μm away from the central pixel, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1Ea</xref>) and further away from the central pixel (pixel 3, blue, 0.43 μm away from the centre pixel, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1Ea</xref>). Although the pixel Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals were comparable at all positions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1Eb and C</xref>), the resulting CaCLEAN transients displayed a very strong preference for the ‘in focus’ signals over those transients alongside the ECC couplon site (more than 10-fold difference in the peak intensity). Signals from positions located far from the couplon site were not considered (data not shown). Rebuilt fluorescence transients from the couplon map closely resembled the de-noised original data (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1Ec and e</xref>), indicating that CaCLEAN identified all active couplon sites contributing to the cellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient.</p><p>Next, we further scrutinized the CaCLEAN approach. We first rebuilt three Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients from the same Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient (as depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1Ab</xref>) with variable Poissonian noise and Gaussian noise comparable to that observed during our recording, re-calculated their particular CaCLEAN maps as depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2Aa-c,</xref> and superimposed the three maps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2Ad</xref>). Because the three maps were RGB-color-coded, a perfect match between all three maps is indicated in white. As depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2Ad and e</xref>, we found a very good match (correlation coefficient = 0.84 ± 0.008; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2Af</xref>) between the three masks, supporting the high reproducibility of CaCLEAN calculations. Compared with the very good match between the active ECC couplon maps displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, the result was distinctly different when we analysed two consecutive Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients recorded under steady-state electrical pacing conditions (labelled rCaT1 and rCaT2 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2Ba and b</xref>). In the superimposed cellular overview (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2Bc</xref>), as well as in the detailed magnified panels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2Bd</xref>, rightmost panel), it became obvious that the pattern of active ECC couplons was rather different between two consecutive Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients (average correlation coefficient 0.47 ± 0.025; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2Bf</xref>) despite superimposable global Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2Be</xref>). We identified 342 active ECC couplons in the first transient and 352 in the second but only 215 that participated in both Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients, indicating a re-fire rate of only 62.8%. We further superimposed active ECC couplon maps from consecutive Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients and observed a surprisingly low re-firing rate between consecutive Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>, merge of three Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients). The firing probability of ECC couplons across four consecutive Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients demonstrated that only approximately 10% of couplons were always active (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). These reliable couplons were probably the eager sites described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Mackenzie et al., 2001</xref>).

To address this relationship, we performed a series of experiments employing rat ventricular myocytes for which both phenomena are well established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dorn, 2010</xref>). In cardiac myocytes, physiological augmentation of global Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients, for example following β-adrenergic stimulation, are envisaged to occur by various mechanisms, including modulation of the SR-Ca<sup>2+</sup> load, LTCC-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx or the number of recruited ECC sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bers, 2008</xref>). Rat ventricular myocytes display a well-known negative force-frequency relationship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anderson et al., 1973</xref>), resulting, in part, from a decreased amplitude of the global Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient with increasing stimulation frequency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sipido et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gattoni et al., 2016</xref>). We thus recorded and characterized confocal Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients with stimulation intervals of between 600 ms and 100 ms in the absence and presence of 10 nM isoproterenol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>, respectively). The resulting global Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients displayed the expected negative amplitude-frequency relationship, as depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3Ca</xref>. Isoproterenol substantially increased the Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient amplitudes, particularly at low stimulation frequencies. The CaCLEAN algorithm generated ECC couplon maps for individual Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients at stimulation intervals of 600 ms and 150 ms, as depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> for control conditions and in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> in the presence of 10 nM isoproterenol.

The resulting average densities of active ECC couplons of the control myocytes were 653 ± 148 per 1000 μm<sup>2</sup> (electrical stimulation @ 1.7 Hz; 600 ms intervals) and 310 ± 146 (electrical stimulation @ 6.7 Hz; 150 ms intervals) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3Cb</xref>, filled symbols). Isoproterenol increased the density of active ECC couplons (803 ± 35 per 1000 μm<sup>2</sup> [@1.7 Hz] and 409 ± 185 [@6.7 Hz; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3Cb</xref>, open symbols]). Under both conditions, the density of recruited ECC couplons dropped monotonically, albeit with a different quantitative relationship (τ<sub>ctrl</sub>=107 ms vs. τ<sub>iso</sub>=80 ms). In addition to the changes in ECC couplon density, isoproterenol promoted the released Ca<sup>2+</sup> content of each active couplon at low stimulation frequencies by more than 3-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3Cc</xref>). The full width at half maximum (FWHM) of these couplons also displayed small increases following isoproterenol stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3Cd</xref>). Both the Ca<sup>2+</sup> release amplitudes of individual couplons and their FWHM also followed similar monotonic decay patterns with increasing stimulation frequency.</p><p>In a detailed quantitative investigation, we analysed the temporal behavior of ECC couplon firing across multiple Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients (inter-CaT, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3Ce</xref>) and the spatial properties within the same Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient (intra-CaT, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3Cf</xref>). We interpret the inter-CaT and intra-CaT coefficients of variation (CV) as the results of the firing reliability of ECC couplons because smaller values for CV result from ‘more homogeneous’ active ECC couplon maps. Thus, increases in CV are indicative of decreased reliability. Our data clearly demonstrated a decreasing firing reliability with increases in the stimulation frequency. For the low, physiological stimulation frequencies, application of 10 nM isoproterenol was able to increase temporal and spatial reliability significantly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3Ce and f</xref>). Interestingly, again at the highest pacing frequency, β-adrenergic stimulation was unable to increase reliability. These ECC couplon maps closely resembled the expected distribution of ECC couplons in healthy ventricular myocytes with periodic distances of 1.7 μm, as verified by a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3Da</xref>). The FFT power of these periodic distances in the couplon maps is comparable to the immunostaining results of RyRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). These data also indicate that our analysis is not strongly influenced by ‘out-of-focus’ Ca<sup>2+</sup> sources that would disturb and weaken the periodicity, that is, the power of the spatial frequency. Interestingly, the power of the characteristic spatial frequency decreases with decreasing stimulation interval (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3Db</xref>), most probably because the failure rate of ECC couplons is increasing, while the value for the characteristic periodic distance was decreasing at the highest stimulation frequency, probably because of substantial increases in the diastolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3Dc</xref>). It was noteworthy that neither of the two latter relationships was altered in the presence of 10 nM isoproterenol (open symbols in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3Db and C</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>3D reconstruction and functional mapping of active ECC couplons in electrically paced ventricular myocytes</title><p>The abovementioned results demonstrate our ability to map and reconstruct the distribution of active ECC couplons in naive living cardiac myocytes in two dimensions without pharmacological intervention. In the final series of experiments, we considered extending this approach in space and generating a three-dimensional (3D) map of active ECC couplons to reconstruct their spatial distribution in an intact ventricular myocyte. To this end, we followed the principle protocol detailed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>. For each plane, we recorded the upstroke of a single electrical stimulation, calculated the CaCLEAN couplon map (exemplified in panels 1–5 of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) and surface rendered the stacked maps. A typical distribution of active couplons is depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, in which the cross-striation arrangement of couplon sites can be recognized easily. To emphasize this feature, we performed a spot segmentation, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4Bb</xref>. Here, the cross-striation of the ECC couplon arrangement is even more obvious. To further investigate the 3D arrangements of ECC couplon sites within the myocytes, we cut the rendered surface open at the two planes indicated by the grey frames and rotated the resulting surface model clockwise into the paper plane to observe the resulting object as indicated by the stylized eye in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4Ba</xref>. <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref> illustrates the individual steps leading to the 3D surface rendering. The cuts were placed over one of the two typical nuclei of a ventricular myocyte, which can be recognized as the large free space in the middle, labelled ‘N’ in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4Bc</xref>. A thorough analysis of the resulting surface-rendered representation indicates strings of couplons emanating deep into the inner space of the cell, as highlighted by the dashed yellow vertical lines in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4Bc</xref>. We interpret those arrangements as couplons decorating T-tubular membrane systems. To facilitate three-dimensional visualization of this panel, we have redrawn the rendering and color-coded the depth of the individual ECC couplons according to the color wedge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4Bd</xref>).

Nevertheless, the detailed properties of such fundamental Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals have not been elucidated to date because of several major obstacles: (1) the speed of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> release process itself (in the millisecond range [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cheng et al., 1993</xref>]); (2) the close proximity of numerous ECC couplons (less than 1 μm in a typical myocyte [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hou et al., 2015</xref>]); (3) the fast diffusion of Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions (in the range of tens of μm<sup>2</sup>/s); and (4) the sheer amount of synchronized ECC couplons (many thousands in a typical myocyte) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bers, 2008</xref>). Substantial noise during ultra-fast Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging adds further complexity to the challenge of identifying active couplons and analyzing their behavior during electrically evoked cellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.30425.019</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>CaCLEAN-derived couplon distributions for typical rat ventricular myocytes (paced at 1 Hz).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Under control conditions and (<bold>B</bold>) in the presence of 10 μM Verapamil (10 min after application) to reduce the number of operating L-Type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels substantially.

Because the intrinsic signal distribution is very difficult to derive with an interferometer, a thorough deconvolution has been employed instead (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Pety, 2007</xref>). The CLEAN algorithm was introduced in the 1970s to perform such a deconvolution on images created in radio astronomy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Högbom, 1974</xref>). Briefly, the algorithm assumes that an image consists of a number of point sources for the radio signal. The algorithm iteratively finds the highest value in the image and subtracts a small representation of this point source convolved with the point spread function (called ‘dirty beam’ in radio astronomy) of the observatory until the radio signal has ‘disappeared’ below a set threshold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Pety, 2007</xref>).</p><p>The activity of individual ECC couplons in cardiac myocytes shares substantial similarity with the imaging process in radio astronomy: (1) the global Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient is the result of a large number of active ECC sites; (2) the underlying cardiac couplon serves as the point source; (3) the flux of Ca<sup>2+</sup> from these ECC couplons serves as the signal-emitting process; and (4) the Ca<sup>2+</sup> diffusion process can be readily approximated by the convolution of a light point source with the point spread function. On the basis of these analogies, we developed a novel and unique tool to investigate the behavior of individual ECC couplons in intact cardiomyocytes by combining our understanding of subcellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> diffusion and the classical CLEAN algorithm from radio astronomy. The results presented in this report strongly suggest that the proposed algorithm is remarkably powerful in deconvolving and identifying active ECC couplons and in determining minute differences in their resulting Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals and behaviors such as firing reliability.</p><p>Mouse atrial myocytes, with their complex and irregular membrane invaginations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kirk et al., 2003</xref>), served as a test for evaluating CaCLEAN. ECC couplons are restricted to regions in close proximity to such membrane invaginations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kirk et al., 2003</xref>). Indeed, an overlay of the CaCLEAN-derived couplon positions and the plasma membrane revealed strong structural similarity between these two data sets (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Although Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients in the vicinity of couplon sites can still have substantial amplitude (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1Ea</xref>), the CaCLEAN algorithm helps to discriminate positions at ECC couplon sites from those even a short distance away from such ECC centres (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1Ec</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplements 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">5</xref>). Thus, CaCLEAN also serves functionally as a ‘deconvolution’ algorithm. Moreover, the CaCLEAN algorithm displays substantial robustness because it generates virtually identical couplon maps from the same underlying Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient convoluted with random but different noise simulating our recording parameters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) and from simulated Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplement 6</xref>).</p><p>To identify individual active ECC couplons, the CaCLEAN algorithm ought to provide spatial resolution in the x,y and z directions. As depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, the two parameters for the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dye diffusion and the definition of ACO are rather critical. We determined the optimal values for these two parameters (60 μm<sup>2</sup>/s for Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dye diffusion and 30 μm<sup>2</sup>/s for ‘Analytical CLEAN Object’ [ACO]) yielding the best resolution. For all three optical axis, we determined a resolution of 1 µm, a value that matched the average distance between putative ECC couplon sites well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Soeller et al., 2007</xref>). Several additional physical factors, such as the resolution of the objective, the pixel dimension of the camera and the binning used in the data recording, also contribute to the resolution of the CaCLEAN algorithm. Any manoeuvres that improve the signal-to-noise ratio of the recorded data, such as the use of Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensors with superior properties, will also help to improve the resolution of CaCLEAN.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.30425.020</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Effects of varying the ACO and diffusion constants on the characteristics of the detected couplon sites.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold> and <bold>B</bold>) Couplon maps with variable ACO or diffusion constant, respectively.

This method has been previously used in rat atrial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Woo et al., 2002</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">, 2005</xref>) and ventricular myocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zahradníková et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Janiek et al., 2012</xref>) to identify and investigate the properties of ECC couplon sites. Our results in atrial myocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1Dc</xref>) are in line with previous findings indicating that ECC is restricted to subplasmalemmal regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Woo et al., 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Mackenzie et al., 2001</xref>). The report by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Woo et al. (2005</xref>) in rat ventricular myocytes went a step further and compared their experimental results to data obtained by modeling the behavior of individual RyR clusters during ECC. This strategy allowed for a molecular interpretation of the measured ‘Ca<sup>2+</sup> spikes’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Janiek et al., 2012</xref>). Our results from rat ventricular myocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3Ce and f</xref>) also depicted the described variability of ECC in ventricular myocytes and extends these findings to the negative amplitude-frequency relationship in small rodents. Nevertheless, these approaches relied on patch clamping the cells and using excessive concentrations of a slow Ca<sup>2+</sup> buffer that might alter L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels and/or RyR gating. By contrast, CaCLEAN is able to identify ECC couplons in intact ventricular myocytes with a low concentration of a fast Ca<sup>2+</sup> buffer, the Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor.</p><p>The CaCLEAN algorithm assumes both symmetrical Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dye diffusion and ACO; thus, barrier structures such as mitochondria or the SR itself might result in asymmetrical Ca<sup>2+</sup> diffusion. The symmetrical ACO does not represent a substantial problem because it is used as an almost nanoscopic component for de-composing the Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal in a highly iterative manner (10<sup>−4</sup> of the amplitude of the local Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient), but the initial steps in CaCLEAN are challenged by this assumption (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Here, the algorithm calculates a theoretical diffusion pattern based on the previous fluorescence distribution (assuming symmetrical diffusion). The severity of this simplified description of the diffusion process depends on (i) the temporal resolution and (ii) the magnitude of asymmetry. Because an a priori estimation of inhomogeneous diffusion is essentially impossible, a high temporal resolution appears to be the only way to minimize this effect.</p><p>We were particularly surprised to find that despite indistinguishable global Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients, the subcellular patterns of firing ECC couplons were substantially different between individual global Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Therefore, we posited whether the modulation of the reliability might be an important contributor to variations in the global Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal. In rat cardiac myocytes, the negative force-frequency relationship is established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gattoni et al., 2016</xref>), and it was speculated that a number of processes contribute to this negative relationship, including modulation of the Na<sup>+</sup>/Ca<sup>2+</sup> exchanger activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Yao et al., 1998</xref>) and the SR Ca<sup>2+</sup> content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Maier et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Endoh, 2004</xref>). We found that concomitant to the decreasing amplitude of the global Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3Ca</xref>, filled symbols), the density of participating ECC couplons substantially decreased with increasing stimulation frequency, as did the amplitude and size of the resulting local Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3Cc and d</xref>). At stimulation frequencies above 10 Hz, the density of active ECC couplons dropped to virtually zero, indicating that the ECC mechanism was no longer able to follow such high pacing frequencies. Interestingly, we found in our studies that this cut-off frequency or stimulation interval coincided well with the time of RyR refractoriness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Poláková et al., 2015</xref>). We were able to identify the reliability of ECC couplons that participate in the global Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient as a contributor to the negative Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient amplitude-frequency relationship (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3Ce and f</xref>). The coefficients of variance for both spatial and temporal reliability were increased two- to four-fold. These findings indicated that spatially synchronized recruitment of ECC couplons following electrical stimulation, an important prerequisite for optimized contractile output of the individual myocyte, was substantially de-synchronized or failing with increasing stimulation frequency. In addition, the reliability of ECC couplon recruitment from transient to transient faded as the pacing increased. From these findings, we conclude that the failure of spatially synchronous couplon recruitment and recruitment failures between transients are indeed substantial contributors to the ever-decreasing amplitude of global Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients with increasing stimulation frequency.</p><p>Interestingly, β-adrenergic stimulation not only caused more ECC couplons to contribute to the global Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient but also caused the global Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient to be more homogeneous (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), and it is noteworthy that the reliability of consecutively recruiting ECC couplon sites from transient to transient was substantially increased. β-Adrenergic stimulation results in multiple phosphorylation events, including phosphorylation of LTCCs, phospholamban phosphorylation with the de-inhibition of the SERCA pump and direct RyR phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bers, 2002</xref>). Phosphorylation of LTCCs evokes an increased Ca<sup>2+</sup> trigger for RyR-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Catterall, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Reuter, 1983</xref>), whereas phospholamban phosphorylation leads to an increased SR-Ca<sup>2+</sup> load that fosters RyR sensitivity towards cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Tada and Toyofuku, 1998</xref>). Moreover, direct RyR phosphorylation also renders the RyRs more sensitive to cytosolic and/or trigger Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Marx et al., 2000</xref>). Ultimately, all of these processes work in synergy and increase the reliability and recruitment of formerly ‘silent’ couplons during β-adrenergic stimulation.</p><p>The three-dimensional distributions of RyRs and LTCCs have been studied extensively (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hou et al., 2015</xref>), but to our knowledge, we present the first data on functional 3D maps of active, firing ECC couplons in living ventricular myocytes. We believe that such 3D functional mapping of ECC couplons in naive cardiac myocytes under steady-state stimulation conditions represents a milestone, and will enable further studies investigating the degree and mechanisms of distribution changes under physiological conditions. Furthermore, these findings can be the basis for further advancements in our understanding of structural and functional changes or maladaptation of ECC during very early states of cardiac diseases in which minute alterations in the RyR–LTCC relationship occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gómez et al., 1997</xref>). It is accepted that most cardiac diseases are accompanied by deterioration of ECC, amongst other mechanisms, by T-tubular remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wei et al., 2010</xref>). Our functional 3D mapping of active ECC couplons demonstrated strings of coupling sites, most likely alongside T-tubular membrane structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4Bc and d</xref>), and thus represents a promising step toward studying the relationship between such functional structures in greater detail.</p><p>The CaCLEAN algorithm fuses the techniques of classical radio astronomy to knowledge about the biophysics of the cardiac ECC process to empower the identification, mapping and characterization of fundamental ECC coupling sites (couplons) in individual Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients from intact cardiac myocytes without pharmacological intervention. As such, we have been able to construct, for the first time, 3D maps of the distribution of active ECC couplons for naïve cardiac myocytes. Experimental results from such analyses will further advance our understanding of the physiological, as well as the pathophysiological, behavior of these essential building blocks and their contribution to clinical conditions such as cardiac arrhythmia. Moreover, our approach will also be applicable to Ca<sup>2+</sup> signalling in other cell types such as neurons, where the properties of fundamental Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals such as those at synapses appear to be instrumental to their cellular and network processing of information.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell isolation</title><p>Isolation of mouse atrial and rat ventricular myocytes was performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Reil et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Tian et al., 2012b</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Confocal imaging</title><p>For Ca<sup>2+</sup> dye loading of cardiomyocytes, 1 μl Ca<sup>2+</sup> Fluo-8/AM, from a stock solution (1 mM in DMSO complimented with 20% Pluronic F-127) was diluted in 1 ml tyrode solution (140 mM NaCl, 5.4 mM KCl, 1.8 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 mM HEPES, 10 mM glucose, pH 7.35).

For every ‘pure’ Ca<sup>2+</sup> release image, the highest pixel was identified and used as the initial centre of the CLEAN ACO.

The algorithm used the ECC couplon maps from the CaCLEAN algorithm to reconstruct the upstroke phase of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient. We employed the resulting data to scrutinize the accuracy of the CaCLEAN algorithm. Briefly, the rebuilding process comprised two components: 1) the residual from the previous frame of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient, which was calculated with the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dye diffusion constant (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf23"><mml:mi>D</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>); and 2) the diffusion of the newly release Ca<sup>2+</sup> within the current frame, which was calculated by convoluting the counting information (including the spatial information and the number of steps) of the CLEAN process with the ACO itself. In addition, to account for the function of the SERCA pump, 1.5% of both the residual and newly released Ca<sup>2+</sup> was subtracted from the current frame (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf24"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>F</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mi>F</mml:mi><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mi>F</mml:mi><mml:mo>⋅</mml:mo><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mo>⋅</mml:mo><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>, where <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf25"><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.00219</mml:mn><mml:mo>/</mml:mo><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>).

For faster processing, CaCLEAN's kernel loop was programmed in C and interfaced to MatLab/MEX. For better visualization, the images with superimposed centres were slightly smoothed with a GCV-based algorithm (using a smooth parameter s = 0.3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Garcia, 2010</xref>). Imaging data were imported into MatLab R2014a with custom code based on the LOCI bio-format tools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Linkert et al., 2010</xref>). The appropriate short image series carrying the upstroke phase of each resulting Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient was extracted with custom code in MatLab. The resulting stacks data were de-noised with custom MatLab functions based on the ‘CANDLE’ de-noising algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Coupé et al., 2012</xref>). A reference image containing the camera offset and the basal fluorescence was calculated by averaging two or three frames (14 or 21 ms) prior to electrical stimulation. The image was subtracted from all subsequent frames. Finally, the preprocessed data were passed to the proposed CaCLEAN algorithm. After CaCLEANing, the results containing meta-data were automatically saved in the ‘.mat’ file format. The results can be simultaneously exported in the ‘tiff’ format. All these procedures were integrated and programmed into a single command in MatLab that ran in batch mode without user intervention. Before the execution of the program, all parameters were set by a graphical user interface-based dialog.</p><p>The resulting couplon maps were segmented with a built-in watershed algorithm in MatLab. The segmented ECC couplon masks were further refined with a cell mask, and the regions below 5% of the local maximum (in the surrounding 1.5 μm) were rejected. Such segmentation of release sites was performed on every CaCLEAN map. For the experiments involving rat ventricular myocytes, six consecutive Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients were used to calculate the coefficient of variation (CV) between successive Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients (referred to as temporal CV; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3Cc</xref>). The CV of couplons within the same Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient was calculated from all segmented couplon sites within the same Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient of the cell (referred to as spatial CV; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3Cd</xref>).

The standard deviation of the Gaussian noise was 5.93, and the device gain was estimated to be 2.7. The measured Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient was de-noised with the CANDLE algorithm (see above) and further referred to as the ‘original data’ transient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). To vary the Poissonian noise component, the Gaussian noise was kept fixed, and the device gain was changed to 5, 10, 15 and 20, respectively. The real photon flux for each pixel was then calculated, and Poissonian noise was generated on the basis of the photon flux of each pixel. Subsequently, the resulting ‘noisy’ image stack was multiplied by the appropriate gain value to ‘simulate’ real recordings. The resultant fluorescence transients were then subjected to CaCLEAN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). To evaluate the effect of varying Gaussian noise, the device gain was kept fixed, and Gaussian noise was generated with its standard deviation changed to 0, 10, 20, 30 and 40, respectively.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Anna Akhmanova (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Michael Stern (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The study by Tian and colleagues introduces and evaluates an interesting new approach to reconstruct the spatial and temporal distribution of Ca<sup>2+</sup> release sites in living cells. The approach (CaCLEAN) uses the CLEAN algorithm of radio astronomy convolved with a Ca<sup>2+</sup> diffusion model to localize and characterize Ca<sup>2+</sup> release events in cardiac myocytes under normal excitation-contraction coupling (ECC) conditions.</p><p>The significance of the new technique is that it makes possible for the first time, analysis of triggered calcium signaling events at thousands of closely spaced ECC couplons in intact muscle, thus providing a new window on mechanisms of physiological ECC. The authors describe a variety of tests to validate the technique, and apply it to study the bases for the negative Ca<sup>2+</sup> amplitude-frequency effect and the effects of β-adrenergic stimulation. By revealing the behavior of individual Ca<sup>2+</sup> release units under different conditions, the technique has the potential to distinguish changes in local Ca<sup>2+</sup> flux amplitude and the probability and reliability of localized Ca<sup>2+</sup> release events. The technique provides a powerful new tool to study mechanisms underlying physiological and pathophysiological behavior of the heart, and may have broader application to a wide variety of calcium signaling events in other cell types as well.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>All three reviewers agreed that the CaCLEAN technique is innovative and potentially powerful, and will interest a broad community of researchers in the area of calcium signaling. However, the reviewers found the current description and validation of CaCLEAN inadequate. As described the technique is semi-empirical, choices of key parameters are not experimentally constrained, and there are not enough data to evaluate the technique's accuracy in identifying the true locations of Ca<sup>2+</sup> release events. To address these issues, the following essential concerns must be adequately addressed before the paper can be accepted.</p><p>1) CaCLEAN needs additional validation before it can be accepted as ground truth about calcium release events. The performance of the algorithm depends highly on underlying assumptions of parameters and the choice of diffusion coefficients. More confidence is needed that the location of release sites is an unbiased estimate of their true location, and that the presence or absence of a spark at a given location is not influenced by variations in dye loading, light intensity etc.</p><p>a) The resolution limits of the CaCLEAN technique and implications for interpretation of results need to be discussed more quantitatively. What proportion of the CaCLEAN sites are individual as opposed to overlapping couplons? Thresholding is used in the CLEAN iterations to avoid false positives, but how does the choice of threshold affect the number of missed events (i.e., couplons)?</p><p>One approach to give a more complete description of the accuracy and limits of the technique would be to simulate dye images of large numbers of closely localized simultaneous sparks at known locations, and determine how precisely and accurately those locations are recovered by the CaCLEAN process. Ideally this would involve a 3D reaction-diffusion model, but this may not be practical for a variety of reasons, including the time required, and the lack of consensus on a single calcium model with buffering for the myocyte.</p><p>As a reasonable compromise, one could generate a single spark image using existing spark models, and linearly superimpose a large number of copies with various centers to see if CaCLEAN can recover the centers. This would address the major question of whether clustering and overlapping of the fluorescence patterns cause any systematic bias in CaCLEAN, even though it would not take into account all the nonlinear buffering interactions among sources. This should be do-able, preferably with the sparks placed in 3 dimensions and then &quot;imaged&quot; with the confocal PSF.</p><p>In this way one could specify a range of critical conditions (couplon spacing, S/N ratio, assumed values for CLEAN thresholding and diffusion coefficients) required for the algorithm to generate an accurate map, and to place quantitative limits on its accuracy. Such information will be essential to validate the technique and to enable others to use it properly.</p><p>b) As a further consistency check, it would be useful to use the algorithm to reconstruct release sites in quiescent myocytes that exhibit spontaneous sparks. Raw frame data for that analysis should be readily available (perhaps from frames between stimulations). This test should allow a visual comparison between observed sparks and ECC release sites which would provide a consistency check as well as demonstrate the small subset of couplons that are engaged in spontaneous activity.</p><p>c) The algorithm assumes symmetrical diffusion, raising the question of how the reconstruction would be affected by diffusion barriers closed to couplons, e.g., mitochondria. Ideally this would be addressed by using appropriate simulated data, but if this is beyond the scope of the current study, a brief discussion of such potential effects should be included.</p><p>2) Better quantification in several places is needed.</p><p>a) Regarding the proximity of Ca<sup>2+</sup> release sites to the plasma membrane in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, the text refers only to a &quot;very good correlation.&quot; A quantitative measure should be included.</p><p>b) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, the masks show a &quot;very good match&quot; while in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> the pattern of couplons is &quot;rather different.&quot; Important information could be gleaned by measuring the probability of firing for each couplon over multiple stimuli, revealing the location of couplons that are highly reliable vs. those that are not. Are the most reliable couplons the first to fire? The number of cells analyzed should also be stated.</p><p>c) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D-E</xref>, Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals are measured at different distances from entry sites, but they are not strictly comparable because they are recorded in the vicinity of different entry sites. It would be more informative to compare responses at variable distances from the same entry site, and to average several examples if possible.</p><p>3) The algorithm, and in particular the ACO, needs to be more clearly described. How is the ACO generated, what is the equation for it, and how are the particular choices of ACO parameters justified? Is the ACO amplitude or size the more important variable? How does the choice of ACO parameters (amplitude, diffusion coefficient) affect the lateral spatial resolution?</p><p>4) The application of CaCLEAN to understand the negative amplitude-frequency relationship is a potential strength of the paper. Early on the authors mention decreased SR Ca<sup>2+</sup> content and a decreased number of participating couplons as possible causes, but their respective contributions are not fully resolved here. A decreased number of couplons certainly contributes (Figure 3Cb), but are the Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient amplitudes of active couplons constant or do they decline with frequency? One way to address this would be to calculate the mean and s.d. of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal time course from the entire ensemble of couplons at low and high driving frequencies, and plot the average F vs. time to illustrate any changes. Multiplying this waveform by the number of active couplons may then demonstrate whether these changes are sufficient to account for the observed Ca-frequency relationship.</p><p>In the Abstract, the negative amplitude-frequency relationship is attributed to decreased firing reliability at higher frequencies. However, it is not clear whether release reliability (as defined by the temporal and spatial CV) tells us anything more than the decline in the total number of active couplons.

As described the technique is semi-empirical, choices of key parameters are not experimentally constrained, and there are not enough data to evaluate the technique's accuracy in identifying the true locations of Ca<sup>2+</sup> release events. To address these issues, the following essential concerns must be adequately addressed before the paper can be accepted.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for their thorough and positive comments and the very constructive criticism. We have taken all point on board and have revised the manuscript accordingly. Please find our point-by-point response to the reviewers´ comments below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) CaCLEAN needs additional validation before it can be accepted as ground truth about calcium release events. The performance of the algorithm depends highly on underlying assumptions of parameters and the choice of diffusion coefficients. More confidence is needed that the location of release sites is an unbiased estimate of their true location, and that the presence or absence of a spark at a given location is not influenced by variations in dye loading, light intensity etc.</p><p>a) The resolution limits of the CaCLEAN technique and implications for interpretation of results need to be discussed more quantitatively. What proportion of the CaCLEAN sites are individual as opposed to overlapping couplons? Thresholding is used in the CLEAN iterations to avoid false positives, but how does the choice of threshold affect the number of missed events (i.e., couplons)?</p><p>One approach to give a more complete description of the accuracy and limits of the technique would be to simulate dye images of large numbers of closely localized simultaneous sparks at known locations, and determine how precisely and accurately those locations are recovered by the CaCLEAN process. Ideally this would involve a 3D reaction-diffusion model, but this may not be practical for a variety of reasons, including the time required, and the lack of consensus on a single calcium model with buffering for the myocyte.</p><p>As a reasonable compromise, one could generate a single spark image using existing spark models, and linearly superimpose a large number of copies with various centers to see if CaCLEAN can recover the centers. This would address the major question of whether clustering and overlapping of the fluorescence patterns cause any systematic bias in CaCLEAN, even though it would not take into account all the nonlinear buffering interactions among sources. This should be do-able, preferably with the sparks placed in 3 dimensions and then &quot;imaged&quot; with the confocal PSF.</p><p>In this way one could specify a range of critical conditions (couplon spacing, S/N ratio, assumed values for CLEAN thresholding and diffusion coefficients) required for the algorithm to generate an accurate map, and to place quantitative limits on its accuracy. Such information will be essential to validate the technique and to enable others to use it properly.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers that the resolution limits of CaCLEAN are really important and should be thoroughly evaluated. We address this issue in three different ways.</p><p>1) We simulated two local Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5A and B</xref>) with various distances between their centers. These events were convoluted with noise levels also observed in our original recordings and passed through the CaCLEAN algorithm. From these data we concluded that the CaCLEAN algorithm is able to resolve local transients whose centers are 1 µm apart (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5C</xref>). In rat ventricular myocytes the mean distance between RyR clusters was reported to be 1.02 µm (Soeller C, et al., PNAS 2007, 104:14958). The new figures are included and appropriately referenced in the main text.</p><p>2) Following the reviewers´ suggestions, we simulated a Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient with gridded Ca<sup>2+</sup> release (Figure 1—figure supplement 6Aa and b). After adding realistic recording noise (Figure 1—figure supplement 6Ac) these data were passed through the CaCLEAN algorithm and couplon maps were generated (Figure 1—figure supplement 6Ad). Superimposing the calculated maps with the original simulate maps (Figure 1—figure supplement 6B) demonstrated that a good correlation between these two data sets. The new figure has been added and appropriately referenced in the main text.</p><p>3) As suggested by the reviewers, we generated a single Ca<sup>2+</sup> release image with a descriptive model, as described in the Materials and methods section (“Simulation of the upstroke phase of a Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient with random Ca<sup>2+</sup> release sites”), and distributed 1000 copies of such events randomly inside the circumvent of a typical ventricular myocyte (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s7">Figure 1—figure supplement 7A, B and C</xref>). This new figure was added and appropriately referenced in the main text. The resulting data was passed through the CaCLEAN algorithm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s7">Figure 1—figure supplement 7D</xref>). Superimposing the centers of Ca<sup>2+</sup> release centers with the CaCLEANed couplon map (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s7">Figure 1—figure supplement 7D</xref>) demonstrated that CaCLEAN algorithm did neither generate any false positive ECC couplons and nor lose any Ca<sup>2+</sup> release events. Based on these tests in both xy- and z-axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>), we believe that the CaCLEAN algorithm can reproduce physiological 3D distribution of active ECC couplons throughout rat ventricular myocytes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) As a further consistency check, it would be useful to use the algorithm to reconstruct release sites in quiescent myocytes that exhibit spontaneous sparks. Raw frame data for that analysis should be readily available (perhaps from frames between stimulations). This test should allow a visual comparison between observed sparks and ECC release sites which would provide a consistency check as well as demonstrate the small subset of couplons that are engaged in spontaneous activity.</p></disp-quote><p>We completely agree with the reviewers. Unfortunately, our recording conditions and the physiological occurrence of spontaneous events do not allow this task to be fulfilled. We have to use robust laser power (30 ~ 70 mW on the input, distributed over 2500 simultaneous excitation spots) to gain sufficient signal-to-noise ratio. Such high excitation levels are not tolerated by the myocytes over extended period of times, we therefore designed an experimental regime (custom build soft- and hardware) in which the myocytes are only illuminated for brief periods of time (around 100 ms) as detailed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> and the Materials and methods section of our manuscript. In this way, we do not record any data other than the upstroke phase of all Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients. Furthermore, the physiological frequency of Ca<sup>2+</sup> sparks is rather low (100 events/s per cell, around 1.5 events/s per imaging plane; Cheng H, et al., Science 1993, 262:740). To reconstruct a meaningful ECC couplon map from intact myocytes, it would need hours or continuous recording to gather sufficient Ca<sup>2+</sup> sparks (e.g. at least 1 sparks/μm<sup>2</sup> with an optimal density of around 3 sparks/μm<sup>2</sup>). Such extended recording times appear not accomplishable, at least to our knowledge. We have tried to illustrate this in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref> based on our own experiments.</p><fig id="respfig1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.30425.024</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption/><graphic mime-subtype="jpeg" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-30425-resp-fig1-v3"/></fig><p>To reconstruct a good representation of release sites in quiescent myocytes, it would need 8000 ~ 10000 Ca<sup>2+</sup> sparks per cell, i.e. at least 3 sparks/μm<sup>2</sup>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c) The algorithm assumes symmetrical diffusion, raising the question of how the reconstruction would be affected by diffusion barriers closed to couplons, e.g., mitochondria. Ideally this would be addressed by using appropriate simulated data, but if this is beyond the scope of the current study, a brief discussion of such potential effects should be included.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers and have included an additional paragraph discussing this specific issue in the seventh paragraph of the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Better quantification in several places is needed.</p><p>a) Regarding the proximity of Ca<sup>2+</sup> release sites to the plasma membrane in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, the text refers only to a &quot;very good correlation.&quot; A quantitative measure should be included.</p></disp-quote><p>A quantitative measure, structural similarity index (SSIM) (Wang et al., IEEE Transactions on Image Processing 2004, 13:600), has been included as a new figure panel (Figure 1Dd) and references in the main text. We calculated the SSIM for structures that appear different by nature, such as the plasma membrane and the ECC couplon map. In other cases when comparing two sets of data that by nature are same, we always use the correlation coefficient.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, the masks show a &quot;very good match&quot; while in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> the pattern of couplons is &quot;rather different.&quot; Important information could be gleaned by measuring the probability of firing for each couplon over multiple stimuli, revealing the location of couplons that are highly reliable vs. those that are not. Are the most reliable couplons the first to fire? The number of cells analyzed should also be stated.</p></disp-quote><p>A quantitative analysis of the correlations has been included as new panels in Figure 2Af and 2Bf. A probability map indicating the probability of firing for each couplon has been generated and included as a new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>. From this, the reliability of the couplons can be deducted. However, due to the limited speed of imaging devices when compared to the physiological process, it is for us not feasible to readily resolve the firing order of the couplons during a specific Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient. A previous report has characterized the property of coupling sites in atrial myocytes utilizing line scanning at 10.000 lines/s (Mackenzie et al., J Physiol 2001, 530: 417).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D-E</xref>, Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals are measured at different distances from entry sites, but they are not strictly comparable because they are recorded in the vicinity of different entry sites. It would be more informative to compare responses at variable distances from the same entry site, and to average several examples if possible.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested by the reviewers, we have generated an entirely new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> employing indeed adjacent pixels of the very same ECC couplon site (detailed in Figure 1Ea). The corresponding text has also been modified accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The algorithm, and in particular the ACO, needs to be more clearly described. How is the ACO generated, what is the equation for it, and how are the particular choices of ACO parameters justified? Is the ACO amplitude or size the more important variable? How does the choice of ACO parameters (amplitude, diffusion coefficient) affect the lateral spatial resolution?</p></disp-quote><p>We have totally re-organized the Materials and methods section and have added several new paragraphs following the suggestions of the reviewers including a description of ACO.</p><p>In addition, we include a new paragraph discussing the choice of ACO values (Discussion, fifth paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The application of CaCLEAN to understand the negative amplitude-frequency relationship is a potential strength of the paper. Early on the authors mention decreased SR Ca<sup>2+</sup> content and a decreased number of participating couplons as possible causes, but their respective contributions are not fully resolved here. A decreased number of couplons certainly contributes (Figure 3Cb), but are the Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient amplitudes of active couplons constant or do they decline with frequency? One way to address this would be to calculate the mean and s.d. of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal time course from the entire ensemble of couplons at low and high driving frequencies, and plot the average F vs. time to illustrate any changes. Multiplying this waveform by the number of active couplons may then demonstrate whether these changes are sufficient to account for the observed Ca-frequency relationship.</p></disp-quote><p>Following the reviewers´ suggestions, we further analyzed the behavior of individual couplons. The amplitude and size of active couplons do significantly decline with increasing frequencies, as shown in the new figure panel Figure 3Cc and d.</p><p>To estimate the contribution of couplon CLEAN signal strength and density to the observed negative Ca-frequency relationship we calculated the couplon signal mass in analogy to spark masses (signal strength * FWHM) and eventually multiplied by the couplon density (/1000µm). The resulting relationship reflected the expected negative frequency relationship as depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2</xref>. We refrained from including this into <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> because it did not add substantial new information apart from a similar trend (cmp. to Figure 3Ca). The exact relationship majorly depends on the specific interpretation of the “couplon amplitude” (Figure 3Cc).</p><fig id="respfig2"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.30425.025</object-id><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption/><graphic mime-subtype="jpeg" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-30425-resp-fig2-v3"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In the Abstract, the negative amplitude-frequency relationship is attributed to decreased firing reliability at higher frequencies. However, it is not clear whether release reliability (as defined by the temporal and spatial CV) tells us anything more than the decline in the total number of active couplons. This should be clarified.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers that it would be more comprehensive to provide additional details on this rather important and interesting aspect of our study in the Abstract. According to <italic>eLife</italic> rules the Abstract is limited to 150 words. Its current length is already 150 words. We have slightly turned the phrasing down to accompany also additional mechanisms contributing to the negative Ca-frequency relationship. It now reads “[…]stimulation <italic>including</italic> a decreasing and increasing firing reliability, respectively.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
