leukemia (AML). Clinically active investigational FLT3 inhibitors can achieve complete remissions but their utility has been hampered by acquired resistance and myelosuppression attributed to a ‘synthetic lethal toxicity’ arising from simultaneous inhibition of FLT3 and KIT. We report a novel chemical strategy for selective FLT3 inhibition while avoiding KIT inhibition with the staurosporine analog, Star 27. Star 27 maintains potency against FLT3 in proliferation assays of FLT3-transformed cells compared with KIT-transformed cells, shows no toxicity towards normal human hematopoiesis at concentrations that inhibit primary FLT3-mutant AML blast growth, and is active against mutations that confer resistance to clinical inhibitors. As a more complete understanding of kinase networks emerges, it may be possible to define anti-targets such as KIT in the case of AML to allow improved kinase inhibitor design of clinical agents with enhanced efficacy and reduced toxicity.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03445.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03445.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03445.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Major advances in cancer therapy have improved the treatment options for many patients. However, many cancer treatments are toxic or have severe side effects, making them difficult for patients to tolerate. One cause of these side effects is that many cancer therapies kill both normal cells and cancer cells. Developing cancer therapies that are more targeted is therefore a priority in cancer research.</p><p>Acute myeloid leukemia is a type of blood cancer that has proven difficult to treat without causing serious side effects. This cancer is very aggressive and only about 1 in 4 patients are successfully cured of their cancer. At present, physicians treat acute myeloid leukemia with chemotherapy, which kills both the cancer cells and some of the patient's healthy cells.</p><p>Many patients with acute myeloid leukemia have mutations in the gene encoding an enzyme called Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3). This mutation makes the enzyme permanently active, and patients with the mutation have a greater risk of their cancer recurring or death. Scientists have recently discovered that treatments that inhibit the FLT3 enzyme can be effective against cancer. However, the drugs investigated so far also interfere with the patient's ability to produce new blood cells, which can lead to infections or an inability to recover from bleeding. Therefore, no new drugs have yet been approved for general use.</p><p>Warkentin et al. suspected the reason for the adverse effects of FLT3 inhibitors is that these drugs also inhibit another enzyme necessary for blood cell production. Previous work showed that inhibiting one or the other of the enzymes still allows blood cells to be produced as normal: it is only when both are inhibited that production problems arise. Warkentin et al. therefore looked for a chemical that inhibits only the FLT3 enzyme and found one called Star 27. Tests revealed that this inhibits FLT3 and prevents the growth and spread of cancerous cells but does not impair blood cell production. Additionally, Star 27 continues to work even when mutations arise in the cancer cells that cause resistance to other FLT3 inhibitors.</p><p>The findings demonstrate that when it comes to drug development, it is sometimes as important to avoid certain molecular targets as it is to hit others. Understanding the network of enzymes that FLT3 works with could therefore help researchers to develop more effective and safer cancer treatments.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03445.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03445.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>staurosporine</kwd><kwd>protein kinase</kwd><kwd>leukemia</kwd><kwd>FLT3</kwd><kwd>KIT</kwd><kwd>chemical synthesis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shokat</surname><given-names>Kevan M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005189</institution-id><institution>Leukemia and Lymphoma Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>LLS TRP 6081-12</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shah</surname><given-names>Neil P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001384</institution-id><institution>Samuel Waxman Cancer Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shokat</surname><given-names>Kevan M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NIHGMS R012R01EB001987</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shokat</surname><given-names>Kevan M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NCI R01 CA166616-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shah</surname><given-names>Neil P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Anti-targets are proteins that cause problems when inhibited along with an intended target and our novel chemical strategy affords unprecedented selectivity in the context of FLT3 vs. KIT inhibition for treatment of a devastating blood cancer.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Kinase inhibitors are among the fastest growing new class of therapeutics for treating cancer, with 25 new kinase inhibitors approved by the FDA in the last 14 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mullard, 2014</xref>). Since these agents almost exclusively target a kinase's highly conserved ATP binding pocket, achieving selectivity is problematic. A limiting feature of kinase inhibitors is that their ability to target multiple wild-type kinases in normal tissues limits the doses that can be used to target the mutant kinase in the tumor tissue. The key question, in light of the complex kinase networks in all cells, is which anti-targets should be avoided, in order to limit toxicity in normal tissues. Our work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kung et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dar et al., 2012</xref>) and that of others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahmad and Eisen, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Wilhelm et al., 2006</xref>) have highlighted the potent effects of multi-targeted kinase inhibitors, revealing unexpected effects when several kinases are inhibited rather than each one individually (synthetic lethal effects as well as positive epistatic effects). By understanding the synthetic lethal effects on normal cells and developing selective inhibitors which avoid even a small number of ‘off-target’ kinases, we believe that clinical agents with an improved therapeutic index can be developed.</p><p>One disease where this anti-target (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dar et al., 2012</xref>) concept is particularly needed is AML, a rapidly fatal blood cancer comprising 2% of cancer deaths in the United States in 2013 and a disproportionate number of new cases (ca. 19,000, 30%) and deaths (ca. 10,500, 44%) relative to all leukemias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Leukemia and Lymphoma Society, 2014</xref>). FDA-approved chemotherapy has not advanced beyond general cytotoxic agents, and no highly active therapies have been approved in over 30 years. The cure-rate for AML remains approximately 25%. Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) is a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) regulating hematopoietic differentiation that is mutated in 30–35% of AML cases, making it the most frequently mutated gene in AML (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mizuki et al., 2000</xref>). 25% of AML patients present with juxtamembrane (JM) domain duplications termed <underline>i</underline>nternal <underline>t</underline>andem <underline>d</underline>uplications (FLT3-ITD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kindler et al., 2005</xref>). The ITD mutation is thought to render FLT3 constitutively active by disrupting an autoinhibitory function of the JM domain. Patients with FLT3-ITD mutations have significantly increased relapse rates and shortened survival, thus illustrating a major unmet therapeutic need.</p><p>FLT3-ITD was recently validated as a therapeutic target in AML (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Smith et al., 2012</xref>). Several targeted FLT3 tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have been investigated; however, none have advanced beyond Phase III clinical trials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Smith and Shah, 2013</xref>). The FLT3 TKI AC220 (Quizartinib) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chao et al., 2009</xref>) achieves substantial reduction in leukemic blasts initially in a high proportion of patients and is the most kinome-wide selective clinical candidate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Zarrinkar et al., 2009</xref>). However, in spite of its promising selectivity, which is remarkably confined to inhibition of the Class III/PDGFR family of RTK's, AC220-induced myelosuppression represents a major dose-limiting toxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Galanis et al., 2012</xref>; Smith and Shah). As a result, while many patients achieve clearance of bone marrow (BM) blasts, most experience incomplete recovery of normal blood counts (CRi) and remain at risk of complications such as life-threatening infection or bleeding.</p><p>The Class III family of RTKs (comprising FLT3, KIT, CSF1R, PDGFRα, and PDGFRβ) are important regulators of normal hematopoiesis. In 1995, Lemischka and coworkers showed that mice lacking function of either Flt3 or Kit maintained overall normal populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mackarehtschian et al., 1995</xref>). However, mice lacking both Flt3 and Kit function had a dramatic reduction of hematopoietic cell numbers, ca. 15-fold white cell depletion, reduction of lymphoid progenitors, and postnatal lethality. We propose that KIT is an anti-target (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dar et al., 2012</xref>) in the context of pharmacologic inhibition of FLT3<italic>.</italic> Thus, normal mature hematopoietic populations can be maintained in the context of either Flt3 or Kit inhibition alone but not dual Flt3/Kit inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bershtein et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>This synthetic lethal toxicity relationship between FLT3 and KIT for maintaining normal hematopoietic populations may explain the adverse side effects of the current kinase targeted drugs in clinical development. In a recent single agent Phase II trial, PKC412 failed to achieve a single complete remission (CR). When combined with cytotoxic agents PKC412 showed some promise, achieving a 25% CR rate, but responses were primarily incomplete recovery of peripheral blood counts (CRi, 20%) with over 90% of patients developing grade 3/4 myelosuppression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Strati et al., 2014</xref>). While AC220 monotherapy impressively demonstrated a 50% CR rate in a Phase II trial, these consisted primarily of CRi (45%) with few real CRs with complete recovery of blood counts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cortes et al., 2013</xref>), correlating with the similar potency of these agents for both FLT3 and KIT. A recent study showed increased selectivity of the clinical agent crenolanib for FLT3 over KIT and reinforced the correlation between target inhibition, and anti-target avoidance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dar et al., 2012</xref>), which lead to lowered toxicity towards normal hematopoiesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Galanis et al., 2014</xref>). However, the potency of crenolanib for KIT remains too high (IC<sub>50</sub> = 67 nM for p-KIT inhibition in TF-1 cells; 65% inhibition at 100 nM, in vitro) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Galanis et al., 2014</xref>). This is likely insufficient to fully minimize clinically relevant myelosuppression, as a recent interim analysis reported only a 17% (3/18 patients) composite CR rate in AML patients, with 2/3 of these responders achieving only CRi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Collins et al., 2014</xref>). These findings highlight the need for new clinical candidates that better minimize KIT and other Class III RTK inhibition.</p><p>While avoiding inhibition of the presumed anti-target, KIT, is one chemical challenge toward inhibitor design, the emergence of on-target resistance is another clinical challenge. We (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Smith et al., 2012</xref>) and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wodicka et al., 2010</xref>) have identified the acquisition of secondary FLT3 kinase domain (KD) mutations that cause drug resistance as another limitation of current clinically active FLT3 inhibitors. Mutations at the activation loop residue D835 are particularly clinically problematic. These mutations are proposed to bias the kinase toward the constitutively <italic>active</italic> conformation by disrupting a hydrogen bond from D835 to S838, and thus limit the efficacy of Type II inhibitors such as AC220. We have recently proposed that a Type I inhibitor, which binds to the active kinase conformation, would circumvent these mutations that confer resistance to AC220 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Smith et al., 2012</xref>). New small molecule therapies have been reported to bypass these particular mutations, including crenolanib (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Galanis et al., 2014</xref>), a Type I inhibitor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lee et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Smith et al., 2014</xref>), but the CR rate of crenolanib remains modest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Collins et al., 2014</xref>). Moreover, it is likely that a repertoire of drugs will be necessary to combat emerging resistance.</p><p>We propose herein a solution to the FLT3/KIT selectivity problem designed to avoid myelosuppression and also retain potency against drug-resistant mutations. The staurosporine scaffold has been utilized pharmacologically for 30 years, and staurosporine analogs have been proven to be potent FLT3 inhibitors (PKC412, CEP701) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Strati et al., 2014</xref>), though clinical activity of these compounds has been modest, perhaps caused by lack of potent FLT3 inhibition due to dose-limiting toxicity in vivo. The lactam ring C7 position remains virtually unexplored for modulating selectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wood et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bishop et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Heidel et al., 2005</xref>). We recently reported that C7-substituted staurosporine analogs, we term ‘staralogs’, are potent and selective inhibitors of engineered analog-sensitive (AS) kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lopez et al., 2013</xref>). For example, when C7 (R<sub>1</sub>) equals isobutyl (Star 12), AS Src kinase is potently inhibited but WT kinases remain unaffected. However, we also observed that Star 12, in a panel of 319 kinases, weakly inhibits only one WT kinase, FLT3 (57% inhibition at 1 µM; KIT, CSF1R, PDGFRα/β all inhibited &lt;10%). Thus, the C7-alkyl group of Star 12 may allow for weak but selective inhibition of FLT3 over the anti-target KIT, which contributes to myelosuppression when FLT3 is also inhibited. Although substitution of an isobutyl group at C7 reduced potency, we hypothesized that combining the FLT3/KIT selectivity of Star 12 and the potency features of PKC412 would generate an optimal FLT3 inhibitor also capable of targeting emerging mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03445.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Purified kinase assays comparing SAR of staralogs.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) PKC412 (N-benzoylstaurosporine) potently inhibits all Class III/PDGFR family hematopoietic stem cell kinases.

The C7 substituent points toward the gatekeeper (GK) residue of the kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lopez et al., 2013</xref>), and FLT3 and KIT possess Phe and Thr gatekeepers, respectively. We chose an unbiased selection of groups easily derived from the chiral pool, and tested these derivatives in a radiolabeled purified kinase assay, finding that the alanine-derived methyl group provided the most potent inhibition. Synthesis of C7 analogs was further expedited by testing the fully aglyconic derivatives (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, entries 1–8). Replacement of the sugar moiety of PKC412 with a pendant amine has proven to be a means to reduce the chemical synthetic burden of carbohydrate synthesis while simultaneously maintaining potency.

(a) Electronics: we calculate that PKC412 maintains a partial positive charge at its lactam C7 position, matching the partial negative charge of KIT's Thr GK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–C</xref>), while Star 27's C7 methyl renders its lactam relatively neutral (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D–F</xref>), reducing this affinity interaction. (b) Sterics: staralogs with no C7 substitution maintain a flat lactam for binding to the hinge region, adjacent to the GK. Based on crystallographic data from KIT's active conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gajiwala et al., 2009</xref>), a simple steric argument may explain why Star 27's C7 methyl group prevents binding to KIT's restricted ATP binding pocket while PKC412 potently binds (data not shown). Conversely, FLT3's active site is hypothetically large enough to accommodate the 17.4 Å<sup>3</sup> van der Waal's volume of methyl (vs. 1.17 Å<sup>3</sup> for H).

MLN518 was indicated to have similar IC<sub>50</sub>s for FLT3 and KIT phosphorylation (220 and 170 nM, respectively). While MLN518 showed promise with reducing FLT3-ITD+ blasts in primary patient-derived samples, exposure of the drug to the BM of healthy individuals at a dose necessary for primary FLT3-ITD+ CFU reduction, led to severe depletion of healthy hematopoietic colony formation at 1 µM.</p><p>The most direct evidence exists for FLT3/KIT as a synthetic lethal toxic pair, however, other Class III RTKs may exhibit synthetic lethal effects in terms of dose-limiting toxicity when treating FLT3-driven disease. Another Class III RTK, CSF1R, has been shown via the knockout ‘toothless’ rat model (tl = csf1r<sup>−/−</sup>) to be important to osteoclastogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2011</xref>), colon development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Huynh et al., 2013</xref>), and for normal macrophage and dendritic cell (DC) production and maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Stanley et al., 1997</xref>). Perhaps most importantly, tl rats have been reported with a 32% platelet loss, and this thrombocytopenia was not reversed by BM transplant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Thiede et al., 1996</xref>). Star 27 exhibits a large selectivity window with a &gt;16,500/1 CSF1R/FLT3 IC<sub>50</sub> ratio (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), which may provide a clinical benefit. However, more work is needed to determine the synthetic lethal toxicity of CSF1R since other reports suggest an opposite and more complicated role for it in hematopoiesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dai et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>Our focus on the staurasporine scaffold maintains the beneficial aspects of PKC412's potency against drug-resistant FLT3 mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Since both staralogs are Type I inhibitors, they are not expected to suffer from the Type II-resistance model at the GK (F691L) and especially activation loop (D835) mutations observed in the clinic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Smith et al., 2012</xref>). The reduced potency of Star 27 against FLT3 relative to PKC412 in Ba/F3 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>) is mitigated by the more relevant comparison in human cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) as well as the predicted increase in maximum tolerated dosing for clinical candidates avoiding the KIT anti-target. Robustness against emergent mutations is a desirable feature of PKC412 but its pan-Class III RTK inhibition (especially KIT) is likely a major limitation addressed here. Remarkably, the addition of a single methyl group (CH<sub>3</sub>) likely caused the observed decrease in toxicity.</p><p>The strategy reported here for gaining selectivity for FLT3 inhibition over KIT and other Class III RTKs may have importance in other hematopoietic pathology as well. FLT3 has been shown to be important for classical DC maintenance and necessary for inflammatory DCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ramos et al., 2014</xref>). Consequently, FLT3 has been proposed to be a drug target for autoimmunity and inflammation, particularly atherosclerosis. The staralog, CEP701, has been investigated in this context but it is expected that its promiscuity, particularly among KIT and CSF1R, will hamper clinical development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dai et al., 2002</xref>). Star 27 should enable a reduction in FLT3-associated inflammation and autoimmunity while allowing KIT and CSF1R to compensate with classical DC maintenance. Furthermore, the generality of our electrostatic Phe GK inhibition coupled with Thr GK avoidance model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1 fig5">Figures 1D, 5</xref>) may guide future medicinal chemistry efforts, while our in vivo study shows any promiscuity seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> does not compromise Star 27's efficaciousness in a well-validated in vivo model of hematopoiesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Davidson and Zon, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">de Jong and Zon, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">He et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Recent clinical experience with targeted inhibition of mutated kinases in cancer suggests that efficacy is driven by maximal pathway inhibition. In the case of vemurafenib, &lt;80% pathway inhibition in BRAF (V600E) mutant melanoma afforded no tumor shrinkage, while &gt;90% inhibition showed profound clinical benefit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bollag et al., 2010</xref>). The challenge is that inhibitors of the oncogene also exhibit off-target effects on closely related kinases that inevitably lead to dose limiting toxicities. The goal of advancing improved molecular-targeted therapies is to identify the key anti-targets that drive toxicity and develop agents that avoid these effects. Our work highlights the synthetic lethal toxicity of an anti-target (KIT) when the oncogenic kinase (FLT3) is inhibited. As more complete understanding of kinase networks emerge it may be possible to delineate the anti-targets to avoid in numerous disease settings to allow improved kinase inhibitor design that can lead to greater ability to inhibit the disease causing pathway activation while avoiding systemic toxicities.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Inhibitors</title><p>PKC412 was purchased from Selleckchem (Houston, TX).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Chemical synthesis</title><p>Staralogs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) were synthesized according to precedent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lopez et al., 2013</xref>).

Kinase reactions were initiated by the addition of 100 µM cold ATP supplemented with 2.5 µCi γ32P ATP per well and allowed to proceed at RT. At 15 min, 3 µL of the reactions were spotted onto phosphocellulose sheets (P81, Whatman) and subsequently soaked in wash buffer (1.0% [vol/vol] phosphoric acid) at least five times for 5 min each.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Charles Sawyers (Senior editor), a Reviewing editor, and 3 reviewers.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The reviewers all found your manuscript to be interesting and significant. Some criticisms were also noted, however. Both Reviewers 1 and 2 expressed an interest in seeing a broader selectivity analysis for STAR27, and Reviewer 3 raised some valid points about the cellular models used to mimic in vivo hematopoiesis and whether they accurately predict in vivo toxicity, or lack thereof (see specific comments below). We would be interested in receiving a suitably revised manuscript that addresses these comments.</p><p><italic>Reviewer 1 major comment</italic>:</p><p>Overall, I think the rationale for the development of a FLT3-selective inhibitor (STAR27) is sound and the authors have been successful in achieving this goal. The level of biological characterization of STAR27 is appropriate and this reagent will likely prove useful for comparing the consequences of FLT3 versus FLT3/KIT inhibition. I believe that the impact of this work is sufficient enough to warrant publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. My only suggestion is that the authors discuss what the likely kinome-wide profile of STAR27 is. The Shokat Lab has shown that bisindolyl lactams with large substituents can be very selective for Ala or Gly gatekeeper-containing kinases. In this case, they are complementing the Phe residue of FLT3 with a small methyl residue in order to obtain selectivity for FLT3 over KIT (and other kinases that contain Thr or Val residues). This could potentially greatly increase the number of off-targets that this inhibitor acts upon. As STAR27 does not seem to be toxic, any off-targets do not seem to be too detrimental but it would nice if the authors speculated on how promiscuous STAR27 is based on their experience with other STAR analogs.</p><p><italic>Reviewer 2 major comment</italic>:</p><p>It would have been nice to compare PKC412 and the new compound in at least a few additional kinase assays covering members outside the presented class III RTKs.

The broad kinome selectivity reveals that Star 27 is particularly able to distinguish between the Class III RTK family, of which FLT3 and KIT are members. This broad selectivity screening supports our electrostatic model (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), explaining Star 27’s selectivity for Phe gatekeepers (GK) and avoidance of Thr GKs. As Reviewer #1 noted, the methyl subsituent on Star 27 is not large enough to limit binding to the broader kinome.</p><p>Reviewer 2 major comment:</p><p><italic>It would have been nice to compare PKC412 and the new compound in at least a few additional kinase assays covering members outside the presented class III RTKs.

These sorts of studies would increase the strength of these findings</italic>.</p><p>To assess toxicity and efficacy in vivo we initiated a collaboration with Prof. Leung, from the University of Hong Kong, who has developed a recently validated zebrafish model for studying FLT3-ITD-driven AML, and recapitulates findings in the clinic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">He at al, 2014</xref>). Zebrafish have been shown to be an excellent in vivo model of hematopoiesis (see Davidson et al, 2004; de Jong et al, 2005; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">He et al, 2014</xref>). We tested Star 27 head-to-head with PKC412 in WT animals, and assessed toxicity at both 3 days post fertilization (dpf, gross qualitative effect on heart and tail morphology; new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4A-I</xref>), and 30 hours post fertilization (hpf, staining as a quantitation of KIT-associated myelopoiesis; new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4J-M</xref>). These studies showed clear myelosuppression in PKC412 treated animals with no toxicity in Star 27 treatment groups compared to vehicle treated animals. To assess therapeutic efficacy we treated embryos injected with FLT3-ITD with both drugs. Both drugs greatly converted both “intermediate” and “severe” binned neutrophilic blast groups to “normal” embryos at 30 hpf, consistent with their equipotency in our other models of AML (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4N-Q</xref>). Prof Leung and Dr He have been added as authors.</p><p><italic>What is the data that Kit inhibition is responsible for the hematopoietic toxicity</italic>?</p><p>KIT inhibition alone is not toxic, but in the context of KIT + FLT3 inhibition, both genetic evidence (double knockout—Lemischka, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mackarehtschian et al, 1995</xref>) and our pharmacological data with Star 27 reveal the synthetic toxicity of inhibition of these two kinases.</p><p><italic>Dasatinib inhibits Kit at clinically relevant concentrations, as does imatinib, without severe cytopenias.

Unfortunately this particular donor cell harvest did not yield enough blasts to score the experiment with sufficient statistical power. We have not been able to secure another donor in time for resubmission. Therefore we will not be able to include this requested experiment.</p></body></sub-article></article>
