Despite their importance, many fundamental aspects of chytrid developmental and cell biology remain poorly understood. To address these knowledge gaps, we combined quantitative volume electron microscopy and comparative transcriptome profiling to create an ‘atlas’ of the cellular and molecular basis of the chytrid life cycle, using the model chytrid <italic>Rhizoclosmatium globosum</italic>. From our developmental atlas, we describe the transition from the transcriptionally inactive free-swimming zoospore to the more biologically complex germling, and show that lipid processing is multifaceted and dynamic throughout the life cycle. We demonstrate that the chytrid apophysis is a compartmentalised site of high intracellular trafficking, linking the feeding/attaching rhizoids to the reproductive zoosporangium, and constituting division of labour in the chytrid cell plan. We provide evidence that during zoosporogenesis, zoospores display amoeboid morphologies and exhibit endocytotic cargo transport from the interstitial maternal cytoplasm. Taken together, our results reveal insights into chytrid developmental biology and provide a basis for future investigations into non-dikaryan fungal cell biology.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>chytrid</kwd><kwd>lipid</kwd><kwd>apophysis</kwd><kwd>zoospore</kwd><kwd>development</kwd><kwd>Rhizoclosmatium globosum</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000270</institution-id><institution>Natural Environment Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NE/L002582/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Laundon</surname><given-names>Davis</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010663</institution-id><institution>H2020 European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>772584</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cunliffe</surname><given-names>Michael</given-names></name><name><surname>Thomas</surname><given-names>Seth</given-names></name><name><surname>Bird</surname><given-names>Kimberley</given-names></name><name><surname>Chrismas</surname><given-names>Nathan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Three-dimensional cell modelling, lipid analysis, transcriptomics, and live-cell imaging reveal biological insights in to the key stages of the chytrid fungus life cycle.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The chytrids (phylum Chytridiomycota) are a major, predominantly unicellular fungal lineage of ecological importance. For example, some chytrid species are the causative agents of the global amphibian panzootic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fisher and Garner, 2020</xref>) and virulent crop pests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">van de Vossenberg et al., 2019</xref>), whilst others are algal parasites and saprotrophs in marine and freshwater ecosystems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Frenken et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Grossart et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Klawonn et al., 2021</xref>). Chytrid zoospores contain large amounts of intracellular storage lipids that are consumed by grazing zooplankton, making them responsible for a significant form of trophic upgrading in aquatic ecosystems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kagami et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kagami et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kagami et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Rasconi et al., 2020</xref>). Chytrids are also important from an evolutionary perspective as they retain cellular traits from the last common ancestor of branching fungi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) that are now absent in hyphal fungi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Berbee et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Nagy et al., 2018</xref>), as well as traits from the common ancestor of animals and fungi in the Opisthokonta (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Medina et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Prostak et al., 2021</xref>). This makes chytrids powerful models to explore the origin and evolution of innovations in fungal cell biology and the wider eukaryotic tree of life. To help fully appreciate chytrids in terms of their ecological and evolutionary contexts, it is necessary to resolve their core cell biology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Laundon and Cunliffe, 2021</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Chytrids are a major fungal phylum with a dimorphic life cycle.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Chytrids (phylum Chytridiomycota) are a major fungal lineage, many members of which exhibit cellular characteristics retained from the last common ancestor of branching (rhizoidal and hyphal) fungi (star).

The cell body component of the thallus develops into the zoosporangium from which the next generation of zoospores are produced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Any biological life cycle inherently represents a temporal progression, yet the chytrid life cycle can be categorised into four distinctive contiguous life stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Berger et al., 2005</xref>). The first stage is the motile ‘zoospore’ which lacks a cell wall, does not feed, and colonises substrates or hosts. Even though zoospores are metabolically active, they are transcriptionally and translationally inactive, with dormant ribosomes containing maternally derived mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Medina and Buchler, 2020</xref>). The second stage is the sessile ‘germling’ which develops immediately after zoospore settlement following flagellar retraction (or sometimes detachment), cell wall production (encystment), and initiation of rhizoid growth from an initial germ tube. The third stage is the vegetative ‘immature thallus’ which is associated with the highest levels of rhizoid development and overall cellular growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Laundon et al., 2020</xref>). The cell plan of the immature thallus can be divided into three parts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>): the cell body which is ultimately destined for reproduction (zoosporogenesis), the rhizoid for attachment and feeding, and (in some chytrid species) a bulbous swelling between the cell body and rhizoid termed the ‘apophysis’, the function of which is currently poorly understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Laundon and Cunliffe, 2021</xref>). The final life stage is the reproductive ‘mature zoosporangium’, which appears once the immature thallus has reached maximum cell size and the cell body cytoplasm is cleaved into the next generation of zoospores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).</p><p>Representative model strains have an important role to play in understanding the biology of chytrids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Laundon and Cunliffe, 2021</xref>). <italic>Rhizoclosmatium globosum</italic> is a widespread aquatic saprotroph and the strain <italic>R. globosum</italic> JEL800 has emerged as a promising model organism in laboratory investigations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Laundon et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Roberts et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Venard et al., 2020</xref>) due to an available genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mondo et al., 2017</xref>), easy axenic culture, and amenability to live-cell fluorescent microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Laundon et al., 2020</xref>). <italic>R. globosum</italic> JEL800 exhibits an archetypal chytrid cell plan (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) and rapid life cycle, making it a powerful model system to interrogate chytrid cellular development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Laundon et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Laundon and Cunliffe, 2021</xref>).</p><p>The chytrid life cycle has so far been characterised with largely descriptive approaches (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Berger et al., 2005</xref>) with only a few quantitative studies focusing on specific processes, such as rhizoid morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dee et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Laundon et al., 2020</xref>) and actin formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Medina et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Prostak et al., 2021</xref>). These important studies provide a foundation on which to develop a quantitative approach to understand the biology of the chytrid cell plan and the drivers of the transitions between the life stages. To investigate the cellular and molecular underpinnings of the chytrid life cycle and associated cell biology, we studied the four major life stages of <italic>R. globosum</italic> by combining quantitative volume electron microscopy and transcriptomics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), with the addition of supplementary targeted live-cell fluorescent microscopy and lipid analysis. The aim of our approach was to quantify the cellular traits that define the major chytrid life stages and identify the biological processes that take place during the developmental transitions between them. As such, we have created a developmental ‘atlas’ with <italic>R. globosum</italic> for the archetypal chytrid life cycle, which in turn generated specific avenues for targeted investigation of important biological processes, namely lipid biology, apophysis function, and zoosporogenesis.</p><p>By culturing <italic>R. globosum</italic> and sampling the populations at different stages through their temporal development (0 hr zoospore, 1.5 hr germling, 10 hr immature thallus, and a 24 hr mixed population including mature zoosporangia) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), we examined chytrid populations with both 3D reconstructions by serial block face scanning electron microscopy (SBF-SEM) and mRNA sequencing. We used single-cell SBF-SEM reconstructions (n = 5 cells per life stage) to quantify the cellular structures at each life stage and population-level transcriptomic analysis of significant Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway categories (n = 3 populations per life stage, differentially expressed genes [DEGs]) to summarise the major biological differences between the life stages through temporal development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). As these stages represent key time points in the progression of the linear temporal chytrid life cycle, pairwise comparison of transcriptomes from contiguous life stages achieved an account of the major putative biological transitions (e.g. germling vs. zoospore, immature thallus vs. germling). Our findings provide insights into chytrid developmental processes and serve as a resource from which to resolve the biology of this ecologically and evolutionary important fungal lineage.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A cellular and molecular atlas of <italic>R. globosum</italic> development</title><p>The orientation, subcellular localisation, and morphology of the cellular ultrastructure determined with SBF-SEM of the <italic>R. globosum</italic> zoospore, germling, and immature thallus life stages are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">5</xref>, with the volumetric transition from zoospore (20.7 ± 1.7 µm<sup>3</sup>, mean ± SD) to germling (33.0 ± 2.0 µm<sup>3</sup>) to immature thallus (1116.3 ± 206.2 µm<sup>3</sup>) exceeding an order of magnitude.

There was no observed significant molecular signature associated with elevated protein synthesis in zoospores, and relative to the mRNA present in the zoospore life stage, the germling transcriptome showed a downregulation of ribosome and ribosome biogenesis KEGG categories (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Only two other KEGG categories were downregulated in germlings relative to the mRNA present in zoospores. These were linked to peroxisomes and ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), both of which are associated with lipid metabolism (discussed further below).</p><p>Following encystment, the germling stage marks the origin of a complete cell wall, Golgi apparatuses (three out of five replicates), and peripheral bodies, that is, vesicular structures bound to the cell periphery putatively associated with cell wall deposition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A, C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>), as well as the beginning of rhizoid growth from a posterior germ tube. Transcriptome analysis indicated that the germling exhibits a greater range of active processes compared to the zoospore, with upregulation of primary and secondary metabolism (e.g. amino acid and secondary metabolite biosynthesis), feeding and energy release (e.g. carbon metabolism and tricarboxylic acid cycle), and the activation of transcription and translation (e.g. spliceosome and aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis) KEGG categories (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). A similar pattern is shown when comparing KEGG categories downregulated in immature thalli relative to germlings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). In the germling stage, we also show upregulation of genes associated with proteasome activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Taken together, these data characterise the transition from zoospore to germling with the activation of diverse biological processes including central metabolic pathways, cellular anabolism, and feeding.</p><p>Compared to the germling, immature thalli devoted a smaller volumetric proportion to the cell wall (IT 2.4% ± 0.3% vs. G 7.6% ± 1.2%, p &lt; 0.01) and peripheral bodies (IT 0.3% ± 0.1% vs. G 1.7% ± 0.3%, p &lt; 0.01) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A, D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5</xref>). Similarly, nuclei (IT 4.8% ± 2.5% vs. G 12.2% ± 0.5%, p &lt; 0.01) and mitochondria (IT 7.0% ± 0.1% vs. G 9.1% ± 0.7%, p &lt; 0.001) occupied a smaller volumetric proportion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A, D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5</xref>). Conversely, immature thalli displayed larger glycogen stores (IT 9.4% ± 2.0% vs. G 1.3% ± 0.4%, p &lt; 0.01) and vacuole fractions (IT 13.0% ± 1.8% vs. G 7.6% ± 0.9%, p &lt; 0.001) than germlings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A, D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5</xref>).</p><p>The immature thalli transcriptomes showed the upregulation of KEGG categories including endocytosis and phagosomes relative to germlings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). Within these categories were genes related to microtubules and actin, including actin-related proteins-2/3 (ARP2/3), suggesting that the immature thalli are associated with higher cytoskeletal activity compared to germlings. Some immature thallus replicates were multinucleate (1.8 ± 1.3 nuclei per cell), indicating the onset of nuclear division (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), which is supported by the upregulation of cell cycle and DNA replication KEGG categories relative to germlings. The apophysis (12.2 ± 6.0 µm<sup>3</sup>) was observed at the immature thallus stage (discussed further below). Overall, these data characterise the biological shift from germling to immature thallus, a transition from initiating general metabolic activity to intracellular trafficking and the start of zoosporogenesis.</p><p>As anticipated, the SBF-SEM reconstructions showed that the zoospore is wall-less unlike the germling and immature thallus stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Single-cell fluorescent labelling of chitin (the primary wall component) however showed that precursory material is produced by zoospores at the posterior pole near the flagellum base (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) suggesting that cell wall production is initiated to some extent during the free-swimming zoospore stage of the <italic>R. globosum</italic> life cycle. In a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Laundon et al., 2020</xref>), we identified 28 candidate genes for glycosyltransferase (GT2) domain-containing proteins putatively involved in chitin synthesis in <italic>R. globosum</italic> and searched for their mRNA sequences in the transcriptome data. There was no clear pattern of differential abundance of mRNA sequences of these genes between the life stages overall, however mRNA from five putative chitin synthase genes were abundant during the zoospore stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref> Source Data). Nine genes were only found upregulated in the immature thallus relative to the germling, six of which had &gt;5-fold change increase in abundance. Six genes were not recovered in any the transcriptomes. Interestingly, a putative β-1,6-glucan synthase gene (ORY39038) identified in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Laundon et al., 2020</xref>, as having a possible role in wall formation in <italic>R. globosum</italic> was downregulated in germlings relative to mRNA abundance in the wall-less zoospore stage. Together, this suggests that cell wall formation is a dynamic process throughout the chytrid life cycle, with alternative synthesis enzymes employed at different stages.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Changes in lipid and lipid-associated cell structures occur with transitions between life stages.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Fluorescent labelling of <italic>Rhizoclosmatium globosum</italic> shows distinct shifts in lipid structures across the chytrid life cycle and cell wall.

Individual zoospores possessed 1.2 ± 0.1 pg, germlings 2.2 ± 0.3 pg, and immature thalli 904.5 ± 201.0 pg of lipid per cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>), however lipid composition as a percentage of dry mass (Z 74.8% ± 11.8% vs. G 69.5.0% ± 11.5% vs. IT 61.0% ± 3.3%) was similar across the life stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref>).

Likewise, glycolipids were present in both zoospores (40.7% ± 27.1%) and immature thalli (40.6% ± 27.3%), but below detection in germlings. Conversely, polar lipids were below detection in zoospores yet present in germlings (51.7% ± 27.5%) and immature thalli (74.0% ± 3.4%).</p><p>Comparison of the zoospore and germling transcriptomes suggest that the zoospores contain increased abundance of mRNA of genes in KEGG categories associated with peroxisome activity and ABC transporters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Most of the genes identified under the peroxisome category are putatively involved in lipid oxidation and acyl-CoA metabolism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata1">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>), and therefore likely involved in the catabolic processing of the lipid globule. Lipid reductases were also detected, which have previously been identified with phospholipid anabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lodhi and Semenkovich, 2014</xref>) and suggest increased phospholipid synthesis for membrane production. ABC transporters are also involved in lipid transport into peroxisomes from lipid stores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Tarling et al., 2013</xref>). With the quantification of lipids discussed above, these results suggest that glycolipid, and potentially sphingolipid, catabolism from storage lipid utilisation from the globule, possibly via the peroxisome, and polar lipid anabolism are taking place during the transition from zoospore to germling.</p><p>We also observed the upregulation of genes associated with fatty acid degradation and peroxisomes in the immature thallus stage compared to the germling stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>) coinciding with new lipids being produced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). The genes were associated with similar acyl-CoA pathways as the zoospore peroxisome category, in addition to alcohol and aldehyde dehydrogenation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata1">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>). Interestingly, although the peroxisome category was also upregulated in immature thalli, the associated genes were not identical to those in zoospores. Many similar acyl-CoA metabolic signatures were shared (16 genes), but with the addition of alcohol and isocitrate dehydrogenation and superoxide dismutase activity. This suggests that in immature thalli lipid production is driven by an interplay of fatty acid degradation and lipid anabolism, illustrating that some aspects of lipid catabolism and conversion in zoospores are bidirectionally repurposed for anabolism in immature thalli.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Intracellular trafficking in the apophysis between the rhizoids and cell body</title><p>The apophysis is ubiquitous across the Chytridiomycota (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">James et al., 2006</xref>), but the function of the structure is poorly understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Laundon and Cunliffe, 2021</xref>).

Such vacuoles were found in every replicate (2.0 ± 0.7 vacuoles per replicate). The zoospore vacuoles contained electron-dense cargo similar to lipids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). The prominence of this proposed engulfment across replicates indicates the possibility that endocytosis is a mode by which resources are trafficked from the maternal cytoplasm into developing zoospores post-cleavage, and that zoospore development does not cease once cleavage has been completed. Notably, developing zoospores did not yet display a detectable ribosomal cluster, as in the free-swimming zoospores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), indicating that this structure is formed later in zoospore development than captured here. The only KEGG categories higher in free-swimming zoospores than in the mature zoosporangia samples were associated with ribosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6J</xref>).

Historically called the ‘nuclear cap’, ribosome clusters have been observed in zoospores throughout the Chytridiomycota (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Koch, 1961</xref>) and in the closely related Blastocladiomycota (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lovett, 1963</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lovett, 1963</xref>, showed in <italic>Blastocladiella</italic> (Blastocladiomycota), as we show here with <italic>R. globosum</italic>, the ribosome cluster dissipates during the transition between the free-swimming zoospore and germling stages causing the release of the previously contained ribosomes throughout the cell. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lovett, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lovett, 1963</xref>, related the <italic>Blastocladiella</italic> zoospore ribosome cluster and subsequent dissipation with the biological activity of the cell during the zoospore-germling transition, proposing the role of the cluster was to maintain the ribosomes through the zoospore stage and to spatially isolate the ribosomes to prevent translation occurring until when the cluster dissipates (i.e. the germling stage) and protein synthesis is initiated. Subsequent investigations into transcription and translation in chytrids and the Blastocladiomycota established that these processes are inactive in zoospores which contain maternally provisioned mRNA and dormant ribosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barstow and Lovett, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jaworski, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">LéJohn and Lovett, 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lovett, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Schmoyer and Lovett, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Silva et al., 1987</xref>).</p><p>Our transcriptome data add molecular detail to understanding the biology of the zoospore-germling transition, with KEGG categories related to ribosome maintenance downregulated and categories associated with translation and biosynthesis upregulated in the germling life stage compared to zoospore mRNA. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Rosenblum et al., 2008</xref>, detected high levels of transcripts associated with posttranslational protein modification in <italic>Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis</italic> (<italic>Bd</italic>) zoospores, but low transcriptional activity. Taken together, the chytrid zoospore represents a sophisticated and well-adapted life stage specialised for dispersal to new growth substrates or hosts rather than general metabolism, which is only initiated by the release of the ribosome cluster at the germling stage once favourable conditions are found. The germling stage is characterised by major cell plan remodelling, including rhizoid growth, and concomitant activation of diverse metabolic pathways. Similar upregulation of metabolic pathways has been observed at the transcriptional level associated with conidial germination in dikaryan fungi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sharma et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Zhou et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, we detected the upregulation of proteasome genes in the germling relative to the zoospore mRNA content, which are also necessary for dikaryan germination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Seong et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Wang et al., 2011</xref>). A previous study into flagellar retraction in <italic>R. globosum</italic> showed that the internalised flagellum is disassembled and degraded in the germling stage, at least partially by proteasome-dependent proteolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Venard et al., 2020</xref>). Our finding of increased proteasome-associated mRNA may likewise be associated with flagellar degradation and the recycling of redundant zoospore machinery in the germling.</p><p>The immature thallus displayed increased cellular and molecular signatures associated with the reproductive cell cycle, intracellular trafficking, and protein processing. A key structural development was the vacuolisation of the cell body. Highly vacuolated dikaryan cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">El Ghaouth et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gow and Gooday, 1987</xref>) are associated with diverse cellular processes including general homeostasis, protein sorting, cell cycling, and intracellular trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Veses et al., 2008</xref>), any of which could at least partially explain the high vacuolisation of immature chytrid thalli. Noticeable in the context of chytrid cell biology however is the increased mRNA for actin-driven cytoskeletal genes, including those assigned to the Arp2/3 complex. The role of actin in vacuolisation and endocytosis has been demonstrated in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Eitzen et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gachet and Hyams, 2005</xref>), similar to our observations here in <italic>R. globosum</italic>. Arp2/3-dependent actin dynamics drive crawling α-motility in some chytrid zoospores when moving freely in the environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fritz-Laylin et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Medina et al., 2020</xref>) and the presence of animal-like actin components that have been lost in multicellular fungi makes chytrids useful models to investigate the evolution of the fungal cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Prostak et al., 2021</xref>). Although <italic>R. globosum</italic> zoospores do not crawl, the immature thallus has actin patches, cables, and perinuclear shells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Prostak et al., 2021</xref>). Here, we show that, for a non-crawling chytrid, actin-associated gene transcripts are increased in immature thalli and that this life stage is associated with high vacuolisation and possible endocytosis, which together could be associated with the early onset of zoosporogenesis.</p><p>We did not find any differences in molecular signatures related to cell wall synthesis between the different life stages at the higher categorical level in <italic>R. globosum</italic>, instead we observed individual differentially transcribed genes suggesting that the process is dynamic and complex. Higher levels of putative chitin synthase gene transcripts (e.g. ORY39038) in wall-less zoospores was coupled with the detection of precursory cell wall material at the base of the <italic>R. globosum</italic> flagellum. <italic>Bd</italic> transcriptomes also suggest some chitin synthases to be more abundant in zoospores than in sessile thalli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Rosenblum et al., 2008</xref>). Chitin synthase activity has been shown to be associated with the <italic>Blastocladiella emersonii</italic> zoospore membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dalley and Sonneborn, 1982</xref>). Initiation of cell wall synthesis warrants further study and may explain why early chemical inhibition induces phenotypic disruptions to normal development in chytrids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Laundon et al., 2020</xref>). This emphasises the need to include the wall-less zoospore stage in investigations into chytrid cell wall biology.</p><p>This study has highlighted the complexity of lipid dynamics across the <italic>R. globosum</italic> life cycle. Our data show that the volume of the lipid globule, total lipid by volume, and lipid as a percentage of dry mass remain unchanged between zoospores and germlings, yet we observed a shift in lipid type, moving from sphingolipids and neutral glycolipids (likely storage triacylglycerides) to polar lipids (likely membrane-associated phospholipids) between zoospores and germlings. Similarly, during the <italic>B. emersonii</italic> zoospore-germling transition glycolipids decrease and phospholipids increase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dalley and Sonneborn, 1982</xref>). Previous research has characterised fatty acid profiles in chytrids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akinwole et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gerphagnon et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Rasconi et al., 2020</xref>) and shown differences between chytrid zoospores and sessile thalli of the same species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Taube et al., 2019</xref>). As the Nile Red emission spectrum undergoes a red shift in increasingly polar environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bertozzini et al., 2011</xref>), we propose that our live-cell data do not quantify the structural degradation of the lipid globule per se but rather biochemical polarisation as neutral storage lipids are catabolised and polar phospholipids are synthesised. The larger volumetric proportion of glycogen stores in developing zoospores over mature free-swimming zoospores also indicates that glycogen catabolism between the two stages contributes to the zoospore energy budget during motility as previously proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Powell, 1979</xref>).</p><p>Another novel aspect of our study shows that changes in lipid profiles are apparently coupled with subcellular ultrastructure in <italic>R. globosum</italic>. The enzymatic function of LRM-associated microbodies as lipolytic organelles has been previously proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Powell, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Powell, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Powell, 1976</xref>), where evidence suggests that enzymatic activity increases following germination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Powell, 1976</xref>). From our data, this organelle may have bidirectional function and be associated with lipid production (anabolism and conversion) as well as catabolism. A key component of the LRM is the enigmatic chytrid rumposome, which was larger in zoospores than germlings. Previous hypotheses have proposed that this organelle is associated with environmental reception and signal transduction in flagellar regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dorward and Powell, 1983</xref>). An enlarged rumposome in motile zoospores would support a flagellar role, but its retention in germlings implies additional functions, unless there is a prolonged delay in its degradation. The bulk of lipids in immature thalli during anabolism were intravacuolar and comparable intravacuolar inclusions have been identified in chytrid and dikaryan fungi in the past (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Beakes et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bourett and Howard, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lösel, 1990</xref>). Intravacuolar lipid droplets have been previously investigated in yeast but in a catabolic capacity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">van Zutphen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Vevea et al., 2015</xref>). Although de novo storage lipid synthesis is associated with the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Vevea et al., 2015</xref>), the vacuoles identified here may cache and aggregate nascent globules as part of the lipid anabolic pathway.</p><p>The function of the chytrid apophysis has long been overlooked, despite its ubiquity in the Chytridiomycota (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Powell, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Powell and Gillette, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Taylor and Fuller, 1980</xref>). Here, we provide evidence that the apophysis acts as a junction for dynamic intracellular trafficking from the multiple branches of the rhizoid network into the central cell body. The localisation of high endomembrane activity in the apophysis and subsequent passage through the annular pore in the pseudo-septum into the cell body implicates this structure as a possible sorting intermediary consolidating the rhizoid network. The ability of multicellular dikaryan fungi to translocate assimilated nutrients through their hyphal network from the site of uptake is sophisticated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">van’t Padje et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Whiteside et al., 2019</xref>), and the observed analogous endomembrane flow from feeding rhizoids to the cell body in chytrids is perhaps not surprising. However, the localisation of high endomembrane activity to the functionally delineated apophysis and through the pseudo-septum into the cell body implicates this structure as a specialised junction.</p><p>The pseudo-septation of the apophysis and rhizoids from the cell body is evidence for functional compartmentation (i.e. feeding vs. reproduction) within the thallus of a unicellular fungus. Comparable structures are also present in other chytrid species (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barr, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Beakes et al., 1992</xref>). Division of multicellular dikaryan fungi by septa, where continuity between distinct cytoplasmic compartments is maintained by septal pores, is integral to multicellularity, cellular differentiation, and resilience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bleichrodt et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bleichrodt et al., 2012</xref>). The origin of hyphal septa was a major innovation in fungal evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Berbee et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Nagy et al., 2020</xref>) occurring at the node shared by hyphal and rhizoidal fungi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Berbee et al., 2017</xref>). The role of the apophysis-cell body pseudo-septum (or an analogous structure) in chytrids in delineating functionally dedicated subcellular compartments may represent an evolutionary precursor to dikaryan septa differentiation and multicellularity. Therefore, investigating the chytrid apophysis is not only important for understanding intracellular trafficking biology in the phylum, but also the evolution of multicellularity more widely across the fungal kingdom.</p><p>Our quantitative reconstructions of individual developing zoospores in the zoosporangium and comparison with their free-swimming counterparts have added to understanding the underpinning biology of chytrid zoosporogenesis. Perhaps our most striking finding is the amoeboid morphology of developing zoospores, potentially resulting from endocytotic engulfment, and trafficking structures, suggesting that developing zoospores assimilate material from the maternal cytoplasm post-cleavage. Although dikaryan sporogenesis is complex and diverse, it typically involves the septation of hyphal cytoplasm via cell wall synthesis and dikaryan spores are therefore incapable of such engulfment activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cole, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Money, 2016</xref>). Phagocytosis has not been observed generally in the fungi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Yutin et al., 2009</xref>), however in representatives of the basal Opisthosporidia, wall-less endoparasites such as <italic>Rozella</italic> (Cryptomycota) and <italic>Aphelidium</italic> (Aphelida) have been shown to consume host cytoplasm material via phagocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Powell et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Karpov et al., 2014</xref>). Nucleariid amoebae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Yoshida et al., 2009</xref>), choanoflagellates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Laundon et al., 2019</xref>), and various animal cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bayne, 1990</xref>) also exhibit analogous endocytotic engulfment behaviour as we provide evidence for here in chytrid zoospores. Chytrid zoosporogenesis warrants further study, however the apparent conservation may indicate that such engulfment behaviour to assimilate subcellular cargo during sporogenesis of wall-less zoospores existed in the last common ancestor of branching fungi and was lost in dikaryan fungi as spores became walled.</p><p>In conclusion, our characterisation of the <italic>R. globosum</italic> life cycle has revealed changes in cell structure and biological processes associated with chytrid development, some of which show analogies in dikaryan fungi and others in ‘animal like’ cells. As important saprotrophs, parasites, and pathogens, our findings provide information into the cellular processes that underpin the ecological importance of chytrids. In addition, our characterisation of a fungus that retains cellular characteristics from the last common ancestor of branching fungi is a step forward in reconstructing the putative biology of this organism.

ROIs were removed from the resin blocks and remounted on aluminium pins, which were aligned using scanning electron microscopy (Zeiss GeminiSEM) on a Gatan 3View serial block face microtome and imaged.</p><p>Stacks of chytrid cells were acquired at 75 nm z-intervals with an XY pixel resolution of 2 nm (zoospore, germling, and developing zoospore inside a mature zoosporangium), 4 nm (immature thallus), and 8 nm (mature zoosporangium). Although XY pixel size differed between life stages, 2–4 nm resolutions were above the minimum sampling limits for quantitative comparison of reconstructed organelles. Due to the lack of replication (i.e. only one cell was assessed, n = 1), the mature zoosporangium life stage was only considered qualitatively. Acquired stacks were cropped into individual cells (n = 5 biological replicates) and imported into Microscopy Image Browser (MIB) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Belevich et al., 2016</xref>) for reconstruction. Prior to segmentation, images were converted to 8-bit, aligned, contrast normalised across z-intervals using default parameters, and then were processed with a Gaussian blur filter (sigma = 0.6). Stacks were segmented using a combination of manual brush annotation and the semi-automated tools available in MIB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Briefly, flagella, lipids, microbodies, nuclei, ribosomal clusters, rumposomes, peripheral bodies, striated inclusions, vacuoles, and vesicles were segmented manually using interpolation every three to five slices where appropriate; the discharge plug, endomembrane, glycogen granules, Golgi apparatuses, and mitochondria were masked by coarse manual brushing and then refined by black-white thresholding; and cell boundaries were segmented using the magic wand tool. All models were refined by erosion/dilation operations and manually curated. Models were also refined by statistical thresholding at size cut-offs for each structure consistent across all life stages (either 500 or 1000 voxels).</p><p>Structures were volumetrically quantified within MIB. For visualisation of reconstructed cells .am model files were resampled by 33% in XY and imported as arealists into the Fiji (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>) plugin TrakEM2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cardona et al., 2012</xref>), smoothed consistently across life stages, and exported as 3D.obj meshes for final rendering in Blender v2.79. All quantification was conducted on unsmoothed models scaled by 50%. Flagella and rhizoids were excluded from quantification as they are not a component of the cell body, and their total length were not imaged in this study. The unassigned cytosol fraction was defined as the total volume of assigned organelles subtracted from the total cell volume and is inclusive of small structures such as ribosomes, vesicles, and small endomembrane and glycogen objects that could not be confidently assigned and were conservatively excluded. Only endomembrane not considered to be predominantly structural (i.e. an organelle or cell-compartment boundary) was reconstructed in the endomembrane category.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>RNA extraction</title><p>RNA was extracted from the cell pellets using the RNeasy extraction kit (74004, Qiagen) following the manufacturer’s instructions with minor modifications. Cell pellets were thawed in 600 ml RLT lysis buffer containing 10 μl/ml of 2-mercaptoethanol and lysed at room temperature for 5 min with periodic vortexing. Cell debris was removed by centrifuging at 8000 RCF for 1 min, before the lysate was recovered and passed through a QIA shredder (79656, Qiagen). An equal volume of 100% ethanol was added to the homogenised lysate before being transferred to a RNeasy extraction column. RNA was then extracted following the manufacturer’s protocol and included an on-column DNase digestion step using the RNase-Free DNase (79254, Qiagen). RNA was quantified using both a NanoDrop 1000 spectrophotometer (Thermo) and the RNA BR assay kit (Q10210, Invitrogen) on the Qubit four fluorometer (Invitrogen). RNA quality was assessed using the RNA 6000 Nano kit total RNA assay (5067–1511, Agilent) run on the 2100 Bioanalyzer instrument (Agilent).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Sequencing and bioinformatics</title><p>Sequencing was carried out using Illumina NovaSeq 6000 technology and base calling by CASAVA, yielding 20,122,633–23,677,987 raw reads by Novogene (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.novogene.com">https://www.novogene.com</ext-link>). Raw reads were filtered for adaptor contamination and low-quality reads (ambiguous nucleotides &gt; 10% of the read, base quality &lt; 5 for more than 50% of the read) resulting in 19,665,560–22,917,489 clean reads. Reads were mapped against the JEL800 genome using HISAT2 before DEGs between life stages were determined using DESeq2 as part of the Novogene pipeline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Love et al., 2014</xref>). Transcriptomic profiles were highly conserved between replicates within each of the three life stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). All further analyses were performed in house in R v3.6.1 (R Core Team) using output from the Novogene analysis pipeline. Shared genes between life history stages were displayed using UpSetR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Conway et al., 2017</xref>). Volcano plots of DEGs were produced using ggplot2 based upon a conservative threshold of log2FoldChange &gt; 0, padj &lt;0.05. Gene Ontology (GO) and KEGG enrichment analysis was carried out using the enricher function in the R package clusterProfiler v3.12 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Yu et al., 2012</xref>) with a threshold of padj &lt;0.05. Differentially expressed KEGG categories and GO categories (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplements 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">5</xref>) were plotted using the dotplot function. For the purposes of this study, analysis and discussion of KEGG pathways was favoured over GO categories as KEGG pathways allow for a more process-oriented interpretation of activity between the life stages.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Confocal microscopy of subcellular structures</title><p>Cell structures were labelled in a 24 hr mixed population with 5 µM calcofluor white (chitin), 1 µM Nile red (neutral lipid), and 5 µM FM1-43 (membranes). Cells were imaged under a 63× oil immersion objective lens with a Leica SP8 confocal microscope (Leica, Germany). Image acquisition settings were as follows: for cell wall excitation at 405 nm and emission at 410–500 nm (intensity 0.1%, gain 20); for lipids excitation at 514 nm and emission at 550–710 nm (intensity 0.1%, gain 50); and for membranes excitation at 470 and 500–650 nm (intensity 5%, gain 50). All life stages were imaged under identical acquisition settings. Cell wall and lipid images are maximum intensity projections at 0.3 µm z-intervals and membrane images are single optical sections. Confocal images are considered qualitatively.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Live-cell widefield microscopy</title><p>Time-lapse imaging of the development of fluorescently labelled subcellular structures was optimised for LED intensity and dye loads that did not interfere with normal cellular development relative to a no-dye control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E–G</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Population-level development (n = 5 population [biological] replicates) was imaged using an epifluorescent Leica Dmi8 microscope (Leica, Germany) with a 20× objective lens, and single-cell development with a 63× oil immersion lens. Cell structures were labelled as above, with the exception of 1 µM FM1-43 (membrane). Image acquisition settings were as follows: for cell wall excitation at 395 nm and emission at 435–485 nm (intensity 10%, FIM 55%, exposure 350 ms); for lipids excitation at 575 nm and emission at 575–615 nm (intensity 10%, FIM 55%, exposure 1 s); for membranes excitation at 470 and 500–550 nm (intensity 10%, FIM 55%, exposure 2 s); and bright field (intensity 15, exposure 150 ms). Images were captured using a CMOS Camera (Prime 95B, Photometrics); 500 μl of diluted zoospore suspension was applied to a glass bottom dish and cells were allowed to settle in the dark for 15 min. After this, the supernatant was removed and 3.5 ml of dye-containing PmTG was added to the dish and imaged immediately. To prevent thermal and hypoxic stress during the imaging period, the dish was placed into a P-Set 2000 CT stage (PeCon, Germany) where temperature was controlled at 22°C by an F-25 MC water bath (Julabo, Germany), and the dish was covered by an optically clear film which permits gas exchange. Single images were taken at 15 min intervals for a total of 18 hr for population-level development, and 50 µm z-stacks (2 µm z-intervals) at an interval of 10 min for a total of 14 hr for single-cell development. Lipid degradation in live, settled zoospores was likewise imaged using 100 µl zoospore suspensions labelled with Nile Red in glass bottom dishes. For comparison, labelled zoospores fixed in 0.2% formaldehyde were also imaged to control for photobleaching. Cells were imaged at 30 s intervals for 2 hr. To visualise endomembrane trafficking in the apophysis, 100 µl of 24 hr mixed PmTG cultures stained with 10 µM FM 1–43 were likewise imaged in glass bottom dishes under a 63× oil immersion objective at 30 s intervals for 30 min.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Image analysis for live-cell microscopy</title><p>Developmental time series of fluorescently labelled subcellular structures were analysed with a custom workflow based around scikit-image 0.16.2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">van der Walt et al., 2014</xref>) run with Python 3.7.3 implemented in Jupyter Notebook 6.0.3. Briefly, cells were segmented using the bright-field channel by Sobel edge detection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kanopoulos et al., 1988</xref>) and Otsu thresholding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Otsu, 1979</xref>). This mask was used to quantify normalised intensity in the fluorescence channel. Every cell in the population was analysed individually, and then the data aggregated at the population level. For lipid tracking during single-cell development, images from the lipid channel were converted to maximum intensity projections and lipid globules were automatically detected using differences of Gaussian (DoG) detection in the Fiji plugin TrakMate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Tinevez et al., 2017</xref>). Tracking of the initial lipid globule was conducted using a simple LAP tracker. Lipid tracking is only considered qualitatively.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Lipid extraction and quantification</title><p>Lipids (n = 3 pellet [biological] replicates) were extracted using the Bligh and Dyer method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bligh and Dyer, 1959</xref>). Lyophilised culture pellets were submersed in a 2:1:0.8 (v/v/v) methanol (MeOH), dichloromethane (DCM), and phosphate buffer (PB) and sonicated for 10 min in an ultrasonic bath before being centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 2 min. The supernatant was collected, and the pellet was re-extracted twice. The combined supernatant was phase separated via addition of DCM and PB (giving an overall ratio of 1:1:0.9 (v/v/v)) and centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 2 min. The lower solvent phases were extracted prior to washing the remaining upper phase twice with DCM. The three lower solvent phases were collected and gently evaporated under oxygen-free nitrogen (OFN) in a water bath held at 25°C (N-EVAP, Organomation, Berlin, MA). The initial lipid extracts were weighed to quantify total lipid biomass before being dissolved in 9:1 (v/v) DCM:MeOH and loaded onto preactivated silica gel (4 hr at 150°C) columns for fractionation. Lipid fractions were separated by polarity via washing the column with one volume of DCM, followed by one volume of acetone and two volumes of MeOH. Each fraction was collected separately, evaporated to dryness under OFN and weighed. Due to the small sample size, lipid data is only considered qualitatively.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>All data were tested for normality and homogeneity assumptions using a Shapiro and Levene’s test respectively (threshold p &gt; 0.05). If assumptions could be met, then differences between zoospore, germling, and immature thallus volumetric proportions were assessed using ANOVA followed by Tukey’s HSD post hoc testing or, if not, then by a Kruskal-Wallis followed by a Dunn’s post hoc test. If a structure was entirely absent from a life stage (e.g. no cell wall in the zoospore stage), then the life stage was eliminated from statistical analysis to remove zero values and the remaining two life stages were compared using a <italic>t</italic>-test or Mann-Whitney U test depending on assumptions, and then the removed life stage qualitatively assigned as different. The differences between cell bodies and apophyses in the immature thallus life stage, and between mature zoospores and developing zoospores, were compared using either a paired <italic>t</italic>-test or a Mann-Whitney U test depending on assumptions.

The data presented include beautiful and informative 3D reconstructions of all four key life stages of this species, as well as transcriptional profiling of matched samples and analysis of lipid compositions. The data were collected from multiple biological replicates and represent a clearly important resource for the community. With this work, the goal of the authors is to link structural descriptions of chytrid morphology with molecular understanding: this is something that the field needs. The authors describe results in three areas that are very interesting to the field. Unfortunately, the evidence provided for these findings does not always support their conclusions. Additionally, discussion of the literature is insufficient as previous work provides crucial context for interpreting the data presented.</p><p>1. Zoospores in several chytrids have been shown to be transcriptionally and translationally inactive, this means that the distribution of transcripts are maternally allocated. Although the authors do cite two papers on the topic in the discussion, this is a fundamental concept that might not be in the mind of non-specialist readers and the authors need to introduce and discuss from the beginning (see PMID: 4412066, 1259436, 3571161), as it provides key context for their finding that germlings have a wider range of transcriptional activity as this is consistent with Rg also being transcriptionally silent in the zoospore state. Finally, the language used to describe transcripts found in zoospores (the manuscript refers to them &quot;expressing&quot; particular genes) is confusing given this context.</p><p>2. The authors correlated structural changes observed with general KEGG pathway profiles obtained from transcriptomics. Unfortunately it is hard to pin down exactly what the authors are trying to say about this data because their observations are not placed with precision in the context of what is already known about chytrid development, and KEGG pathways are too broad to be very informative. Drawing inferences about chytrid biology from broad KEGG categories and link them to structural observation is not possible with more detailed molecular analysis. This comes up multiple times: (i) Correlation between an increase in endomembrane structures in a compartment and enrichment of KEGG categories of protein processing and ER etc is not enough to link these endomembrane systems with ER. This requires more direct evidence. (ii) High dynamic activity and endomembrane density in the apophysis is not evidence enough by itself to support the claim of the &quot;apophysis acting as a cellular junction that regulates intracellular traffic.&quot; (iii) Although different lipid composition between zoospore and germling, and differences in KEGG categories of peroxisome activity on the other suggest important lipid metabolic changes, these correlations are is not hard enough evidence for the authors to call this process as a &quot;biological characteristic&quot; of the transition from zoospore to germling.</p><p>3. The claim that zoospores inside the sporangium undergo phagocytosis is not sufficiently supported by the data presented. To date there is only one case in which it a fungus undergoes a process akin to phagocytosis (i.e. Rozella), and finding a phagocytic fungus would be a very exciting result. Unfortunately, the authors provide no direct evidence to support this specific claim as (i) there are many ways one could imagine to explain the shapes seen in the EM data (perhaps the zoospores are squeezed around the objects), and classic work on Allomyces and Blastocladiella zoosporogenesis indicates that cleavage vesicles can be orderly or very irregular before they align in continuous plates (sometimes concomitant with formation of ribosome aggregates), and that these cleavage planes are nearly complete, but not complete yet. (ii) The genes discussed are not specific to phagocytosis, but are used for a wide variety of other functions. Moreover, the authors appear to equate endocytosis and phagocytosis, and although there is some overlap in the proteins used for these processes, they are not equivalent.</p><p>4. Although the author's findings about the complex endomembrane system in Rg apophysis is interesting, the details of the images provided do not support their interpretation of it being a &quot;distinct subcellular structure&quot;. Such claims require detailed imaging of the &quot;pseudo-septum&quot;, similar to what has been shown for &quot;plasmodesmata&quot; in Entophlyctis and Blastocladiella.</p><p>Each of the insufficiently supported claims (see above) should be revised. Additionally, the authors should help the reader understand which findings are new in the paper, and which are confirming findings found in the literature as some of these topics have been discussed previously in the literature. Relatedly, it would be useful for the authors to compare their results to those from other species, for example translational activity in dikaryotic spore germination is fleeting and superficial. Are there any genes expressed by both systems? What assumptions have to be met to be able to compare a Dykarian spore with a zoospore?</p><p>The Materials and methods should include all details necessary for a peer to be able to replicate their experiments. This is not the case in the current version of the manuscript.</p><p>Editorially, the authors may want to consider reorganizing the manuscript. There is so much information included in each figure, it makes it difficult to appreciate and understand their content. For example, figure 2 includes the overview of all of 3D reconstruction, analysis of the volumetric analysis of that reconstruction, an overview of the gene expression experiments, comparisons between stages of expression data, and KEGG analysis of the datasets.</p><p>Additional points that should be addressed:</p><p>Sometimes &quot;life cycle&quot; and &quot;cell cycle&quot; are used interchangeably (see abstract and page 4 line 90), but then cell cycle is used in the most common way (i.e. cell division).</p><p>Please provide catalog numbers in methods.</p><p>Please provide RCF for centrifugation (RPM is not enough to determine force).</p><p>Line 561: can you clarify &quot;Sub samples from cell pellets were diluted 1:1000, fixed in 0.2% formaldehyde, and&quot; Does this mean the samples were partially thawed and refrozen?</p><p>Further details needed (or a reference): Line 568: and embedded in either agar or Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) gel&quot;.</p><p>Line 584: &quot;Due to the lack of replication, the mature zoosporangium was only considered 585 qualitatively.
