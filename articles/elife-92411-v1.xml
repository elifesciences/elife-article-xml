(HCN4) channel. LRMP prevents cAMP-dependent potentiation of HCN4, but the interaction domains, mechanisms of action, and basis for isoform-specificity remain unknown. Here, we identify the domains of LRMP essential for this regulation, show that LRMP acts by disrupting the intramolecular signal transduction between cyclic nucleotide binding and gating, and demonstrate that multiple unique regions in HCN4 are required for LRMP isoform-specificity. Using patch clamp electrophysiology and Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET), we identified the initial 227 residues of LRMP and the N-terminus of HCN4 as necessary for LRMP to associate with HCN4. We found that the HCN4 N-terminus and HCN4-specific residues in the C-linker are necessary for regulation of HCN4 by LRMP. Finally, we demonstrated that LRMP-regulation can be conferred to HCN2 by addition of the HCN4 N-terminus along with mutation of five residues in the S5 region and C-linker to the cognate HCN4 residues. Taken together, these results suggest that LRMP inhibits HCN4 through an isoform-specific interaction involving the N-terminals of both proteins that prevents the transduction of cAMP binding into a change in channel gating, most likely via an HCN4-specific orientation of the N-terminus, C-linker, and S4-S5 linker.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>HCN channels</kwd><kwd>LRMP</kwd><kwd>IRAG</kwd><kwd>FRET</kwd><kwd>pacemaking</kwd><kwd>electrophysiology</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35GM137912</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bankston</surname><given-names>John R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM140004</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Proenza</surname><given-names>Catherine</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000050</institution-id><institution>National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01HL088427</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Proenza</surname><given-names>Catherine</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000968</institution-id><institution>American Heart Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>830889</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Peters</surname><given-names>Colin H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000968</institution-id><institution>American Heart Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>19POST34380777</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Peters</surname><given-names>Colin H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A combination of patch clamp electrophysiology and FRET determine critical interactions between HCN4 channels and the ER resident protein LRMP and suggest a possible mechanism for reduced cAMP sensitivity.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Hyperpolarization-activated, cyclic nucleotide-sensitive (HCN) ion channels are biophysical anomalies. Despite being structurally related to voltage-gated K<sup>+</sup> channels — which are activated by membrane depolarization and are highly selective for K<sup>+</sup> over Na<sup>+</sup> — HCN channels activate in response to membrane hyperpolarization and pass a mixed Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> current. In addition, binding of cyclic nucleotides, particularly cAMP, to a conserved C-terminal cyclic nucleotide binding domain (CNBD) potentiates HCN channels by shifting the voltage-dependence of activation to more depolarized potentials, speeding activation, and slowing deactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">DiFrancesco and Tortora, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Wainger et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p>While the details of intramolecular transduction between cAMP binding and channel gating have yet to be fully elucidated, some key aspects are known: (1) the unbound CNBD is inhibitory — truncation of the CNBD potentiates channel activation, similar to cAMP binding to the intact CNBD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Wainger et al., 2001</xref>); (2) the slowing of channel deactivation in response to cAMP binding occurs through a separate mechanism from the shift in activation voltage dependence, and cannot be replicated by truncation of the CNBD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Wicks et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Sunkara et al., 2018</xref>); and (3) transduction of the signal for the cAMP-dependent shift in channel activation, but not deactivation, requires interactions of a ‘a cAMP transduction centre’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Porro et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Wang et al., 2020a</xref>) comprised of portions of the C-linker (which connects the CNBD to the transmembrane domain), the N-terminal HCN domain (HCND), and the S4-S5 linker.</p><p>The inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptor-associated proteins, IRAG1 and LRMP/IRAG2 (lymphoid restricted membrane protein), are a family of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) transmembrane proteins that are isoform-specific regulators of HCN4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Peters et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Peters et al., 2022</xref>). IRAG1 and LRMP act by modulating the cAMP sensitivity of HCN4. However, they have opposing effects: IRAG1 causes a gain-of-function by shifting HCN4 activation to more depolarized membrane potentials in the absence of cAMP. In contrast, LRMP causes a loss-of-function by inhibiting cAMP-dependent potentiation of HCN4 activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Peters et al., 2020</xref>). IRAG1 and LRMP share some sequence homology, particularly in their coiled-coil motifs, and both have been found to regulate IP<sub>3</sub> receptor calcium release channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Schlossmann et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Geiselhöringer et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Prüschenk et al., 2021</xref>). However, the interaction domains, mechanisms of action, and basis for isoform-specificity for their regulation of HCN4 remain unknown.</p><p>In this study, we focused on LRMP and investigated the interaction domains and mechanism by which it inhibits the cAMP-dependent shift in HCN4 activation. Our previous study showed that LRMP acts differently from TRIP8b, a neuronal protein that also prevents the cAMP-dependent shift in HCN channel activation. TRIP8b acts by directly antagonizing cAMP binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Santoro et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Zolles et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bankston et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Saponaro et al., 2018</xref>). In contrast, LRMP doesn’t inhibit cAMP binding to the CNBD, as indicated by the preserved cAMP-dependent slowing of deactivation in the presence of LRMP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Peters et al., 2020</xref>). Furthermore, TRIP8b regulates all HCN channel isoforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Zolles et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Santoro et al., 2011</xref>), whereas LRMP is specific for the HCN4 isoform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Peters et al., 2020</xref>). These observations suggest that LRMP regulates HCN4 by interfering with an isoform-specific step in the signal transduction pathway that links cAMP binding to the shift in activation voltage-dependence.</p><p>We tested this hypothesis using a combination of patch clamp electrophysiology and FRET. We found that the initial N-terminal 227 residues of LRMP associate with the N-terminus of HCN4 and that the intact HCN4 N-terminus is required for channel regulation by LRMP. Furthermore, we show that two HCN4-specific residues in the C-linker, P545 and T547, are critical for isoform-specific regulation of HCN4 by LRMP. Finally, we found that addition of the HCN4 N-terminus along with mutations in the C-linker and S5 transmembrane segment are sufficient to confer LRMP regulation to HCN2. These results are consistent with a model in which LRMP inhibits HCN4 via the cAMP transduction centre (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Weißgraeber et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Porro et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Wang et al., 2020a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Saponaro et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Kondapuram et al., 2022</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The N-terminus of LRMP is necessary and sufficient to regulate HCN4</title><p>We previously showed that LRMP significantly reduces the cAMP-dependent depolarizing shift in HCN4 activation without any effect on the voltage dependence in the absence of cAMP, and that it does not regulate HCN1 or HCN2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Peters et al., 2020</xref>). We next sought to identify a subdomain within LRMP that is responsible for this regulation. We began with a truncated LRMP construct with a Citrine fluorescent protein replacing the C-terminal ER transmembrane and lumenal domains (LRMP 1-479Cit; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–D</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). We found that LRMP 1-479Cit inhibited the cAMP sensitivity of HCN4 to an even greater degree than the full-length LRMP (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). This more pronounced effect may be due to improved expression of this tagged construct compared to the untagged full-length LRMP, which was detected by co-transfection with GFP, or it may be that removal of the ER-transmembrane segment increased the proximity between LRMP and HCN4 by allowing LRMP to diffuse freely in the cytosol. A key feature of LRMP in our original study is that it does not prevent binding of cAMP to the CNBD of HCN4. This was also the case for LRMP 1-479Cit, as indicated by the significant slowing of deactivation by cAMP even in the presence of LRMP 1-479Cit (p=0.0310; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). These results indicate that the ER transmembrane and luminal domains of LRMP are not required for regulation of HCN4 and they support the idea that LRMP limits cAMP potentiation of HCN4 by interfering with a downstream step in the cAMP signal transduction pathway.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The cytosolic region of LRMP regulates HCN4 but does not antagonize cAMP binding.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Exemplar current recordings from HCN4 in the absence or presence of 1 mM cAMP and/or LRMP 1-479Cit.

Truncation of residues 1–62 led to a partial LRMP effect where cAMP caused a significant depolarizing shift in the presence of LRMP, but the activation in the presence of LRMP and cAMP was hyperpolarized compared to cAMP alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C and F</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). In the HCN4 Δ1–130 construct, cAMP caused a significant depolarizing shift in the presence of LRMP; however, the midpoint of activation in the presence of LRMP and cAMP showed a non-significant trend towards hyperpolarization compared to cAMP alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D and F</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). Finally, truncation of the first 185 residues, which removes most of the non-conserved region of the HCN4 N-terminus, completely abolished LRMP regulation of the channel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E and F</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>); when LRMP was present, cAMP caused a significant depolarizing shift in the HCN4 Δ1–185 activation, and the midpoint of activation in the presence of both LRMP and cAMP was not significantly different from the midpoint in the presence of cAMP alone. These results suggest that the multiple subdomains within the non-conserved N-terminus of HCN4 are necessary for functional regulation by LRMP.</p><p>We also investigated LRMP regulation of two C-terminal truncations in HCN4: HCN4 S719X, which removes the C-terminus distal to the CNBD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Liao et al., 2012</xref>), and HCN4 V604X, which additionally removes the CNBD (shown schematically in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). We found that truncation of the distal C-terminus (HCN4-S719X) reduced but did not eliminate LRMP regulation of HCN4. In the presence of both LRMP and cAMP, the activation of HCN4-S719X was still significantly hyperpolarized compared to the presence of cAMP alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B and C</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). While cAMP caused a significant (~7 mV) shift in HCN4-S719X activation in the presence of LRMP, this was less than half the shift in the absence of LRMP (~18 mV). HCN4-V604X, which truncates the channel between the C-linker and CNBD, shifts channel activation to more depolarized potentials and completely prevents cAMP-dependent regulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D and E</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>), similar to the effects of the homologous HCN2-V526X mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Wainger et al., 2001</xref>). LRMP did not alter the gating of HCN4-V604X in the absence of cAMP, and the lack of cAMP binding obviously prevented the investigation of any LRMP inhibition of cAMP-dependent potentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D and E</xref>). While these results do not preclude a contribution of the C-terminus to modulation of HCN4 by LRMP, the persistent regulation when the distal C-terminus is truncated indicates that this region is not required.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>The HCN4 C-terminus is not the primary site for functional regulation by LRMP.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of HCN4 showing truncation sites (<italic>red dotted lines</italic>) of the distal C-terminus and CNBD (TMD: Transmembrane domain).

Since LRMP interacts with the HCN4 N-terminus and disrupts cAMP-dependent potentiation downstream of the cAMP binding site, we hypothesized that it may act via this cAMP transduction centre. Although the sequence of the transduction centre is highly conserved among HCN channel isoforms, the overall conformation of the region differs subtly between the known HCN channel structures of HCN1 and HCN4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Lee and MacKinnon, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Saponaro et al., 2021</xref>).

Mutation of these two residues to the cognate HCN2 amino acids, rendered the HCN4-P545A/T547F channel completely insensitive to LRMP, although it responded to cAMP with an ~10 mV shift in activation voltage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B and C</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>), indicating that the unique residues in the HCN4 C-linker are important for LRMP regulation.

However, differences between isoforms underlie nuanced physiological functions of ion channels in tissues and present the opportunity for the design of drugs with higher specificity. Our present results reveal how subtle — and seemingly inconsequential — differences between isoforms in the same channel family can confer important differences in regulation. In the specific case of LRMP regulation of HCN4 channels, our data identify unique features of HCN4 that render its cAMP sensitivity particularly malleable, and thus could contribute to its unique function in the sinoatrial node of the heart.</p><p>Although LRMP prevents the cAMP-dependent shift in HCN4 activation, LRMP does not act by preventing cAMP from binding to the channel. Instead, we show here that the N-terminal domains of LRMP and HCN4 are required for both physical interaction and regulation. Our data further show that LRMP acts by disrupting transduction between cAMP binding and the shift in voltage-dependence in a manner that depends on HCN4-specific residues in multiple domains, including the C-linker, S5, and C-terminus.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>An intramolecular transduction centre between the C-Linker, HCND, and S4-S5 linker links cAMP binding to shifts in activation</title><p>Recent studies indicate that binding of cAMP to the C-terminal CNBD is transduced to a shift in HCN channel activation via an intramolecular cAMP transduction centre formed by interactions between the C-linker, N-terminal HCND, and S4-S5 linker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Weißgraeber et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Porro et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Wang et al., 2020a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Saponaro et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Kondapuram et al., 2022</xref>). There are multiple individual interactions within the transduction centre which have been described in detail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Porro et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Kondapuram et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Elbahnsi et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Wang et al., 2020a</xref>). While most of these interactions are conserved among HCN channel isoforms, there are some isoform-specific differences that likely contribute to the unique sensitivity of HCN4 to LRMP and to other regulators that act to modify the cAMP response. Most notably, the S4-S5 linker of HCN4 adopts a different conformation compared to HCN1. Since the residues in the S4-S5 linker are completely conserved across HCN channel isoforms, we speculate that subtle differences in the sequence of nearby areas of the C-linker and S5 of HCN4 underlie the unique S4-S5 conformation of HCN4.</p><p>Despite often being grouped as the two cAMP-sensitive HCN isoforms, it is clear that cAMP signal transduction in HCN4 and HCN2 differs in several regards. The cAMP-dependent shift in HCN4 (~14 mV) is smaller than in HCN2 (~20 mV; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). Transduction of cAMP binding is sensitive to divalent cations in HCN4 but not HCN2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Saponaro et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Peters et al., 2023</xref>). And, the cAMP-dependent shift in activation can be disrupted in HCN4 by regulatory factors such as cyclic-dinucleotides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Lolicato et al., 2014</xref>) as well as LRMP and IRAG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Peters et al., 2020</xref>). While there is not yet a structure available for HCN2, it is possible that differences in the orientation of the S4-S5 linker and the transduction centre makes HCN4 channels more sensitive to these perturbations in its cAMP signal transduction compared to HCN2.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Proposed model: LRMP disrupts cAMP regulation of HCN4 activation at the cAMP transduction centre</title><p>In our proposed model for how LRMP disrupts the cAMP-dependent shift in HCN4 activation, LRMP is tethered to HCN4 via an interaction between the N-terminals of the two proteins. Within HCN4, the interaction with LRMP occurs via the distal N-terminus, which is not resolved in channel structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Lee and MacKinnon, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Saponaro et al., 2021</xref>) and is completely divergent between HCN channel isoforms. In contrast, the conserved HCND does not appear to participate in binding of LRMP; however, it is known to be an important component of the cAMP transduction centre (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Porro et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Kondapuram et al., 2022</xref>). It is also worth noting that the N-terminus of HCN4 is 260 amino acids long, compared to 140 and 209 in HCN1 and HCN2. Given the evolutionary and metabolic costs of maintaining long unique domains in these highly conserved proteins, it is possible that they serve other isoform-specific regulatory roles that await future discovery.</p><p>We found that truncation of the HCN4 N-terminus abolishes regulation by LRMP without affecting cAMP-dependent regulation. This finding was further corroborated by FRET experiments showing interactions between LRMP and the HCN4 N-terminus, but not the highly conserved CNBD. While these results do not preclude a modest role of the distal HCN4 C-terminus in LRMP regulation ― as suggested by the partial LRMP regulation of the HCN4-2 and HCN4-719X channels ― they clearly indicate that the N-terminus is critical for LRMP regulation of HCN4. Furthermore, the distal HCN4 C-terminus was not required to confer LRMP sensitivity to HCN2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E and F</xref>), suggesting that HCN4-specific residues in this region are not responsible for isoform-specific regulation by LRMP.</p><p>Most significantly, we were able to confer LRMP sensitivity to HCN2 by introducing only the HCN4 distal N-terminus and mutating five residues in the C-linker and S5 regions to the cognate HCN4 residues. It is highly unlikely that LRMP directly contacts the residues in S5, and our FRET experiments did not reveal an interaction with the C-linker/CNBD either (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Thus, our data support a model in which LRMP interacts with the N-terminus of the HCN4 and prevents cAMP regulation of the channel allosterically, via effects on the unique transduction centre. We propose that the isoform specificity arises both from the unique distal N-terminal interaction site and from the unique orientation of the transduction centre in HCN4.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Potential physiological implications</title><p>The first half of LRMP’s cytosolic domain (residues 1–230) that make up the N-terminus of the protein is necessary and sufficient to interact with and regulate HCN4. Because the C-terminus of LRMP is embedded in the ER, the N-terminal region of LRMP would naturally be in closer proximity to HCN4 in the plasma membrane. LRMP also interacts with and regulates Ca<sup>2+</sup> release through inositol triphosphate (IP<sub>3</sub>) receptors in the ER membrane, likely via a site in the coiled-coil region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Prüschenk et al., 2021</xref>). Together these results suggest the intriguing possibility of coordination between the activity of IP<sub>3</sub>Rs and HCN4 and the formation of ER-plasma membrane junctions in cells where LRMP and HCN4 are co-expressed. For example, in sinoatrial myocytes HCN4 and SR Ca<sup>2+</sup> release, including through IP<sub>3</sub> receptors, are both known to regulate pacemaking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">DiFrancesco, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Peters et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Capel et al., 2021</xref>).

It is important to acknowledge that this technique cannot resolve the atomic details of the interaction, which would ideally be addressed in the future by a co-structure of the proteins or at least their interaction domains. Other limitations of the approach are that the FRET efficiency measurement depends on the relative expression of each fragment, the affinity of the interaction, the orientation of the fluorophores, and the distance between the two fluorophores. This may explain why longer LRMP (LRMP 1-230Cit) and HCN4 (HCN4 1-260Cer) fragments showed lower FRET efficiency than did smaller fragments within these domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Also, the approach may miss interactions that involve complex tertiary structures where binding involves multiple regions of the protein. Despite these limitations, our FRET and functional results together are consistent with the model that the N-terminals of HCN4 and LRMP directly interact.</p><p>Unfortunately, the available HCN4 structures do not resolve the distal N-terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Shintre et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Saponaro et al., 2021</xref>), and the structure of LRMP has yet to be resolved. This lack of structural information hindered our decisions about specific cut sites for LRMP and HCN4 constructs and restricts our ability to predict the precise residues that are involved in the described interactions. For example, we found that LRMP interacts with isolated fragments representing each half of the HCN4 N-terminus. This could be explained by a diffuse interaction composed of multiple contacts, or our cut site overlapping a contiguous interaction site. The partial disruption of LRMP regulation of the HCN4 Δ1–62 and Δ1–130 deletion constructs suggests that multiple or diffuse interactions are likely. Similarly, we found that LRMP residues 1–108 and 110–230 both interacted with the HCN4 N-terminus in FRET assays, but neither fragment alone was able to regulate the channel. As with the HCN4 N-terminus, this difference could be explained by multiple important regions and/or our cut site overlapping the functionally relevant site. Ultimately, these questions will require a structure of the LRMP-HCN4 interaction interfaces.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Summary</title><p>Overall, these data support a model for LRMP regulation of HCN4 where LRMP interacts with the HCN4 N-terminus to allosterically disrupt cAMP signal transduction between the C-linker, N-terminus, and S4-S5 linker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Porro et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Wang et al., 2020a</xref>). The specific regulation of only the HCN4 isoform by LRMP is determined by both the non-conserved distal N-terminus and non-conserved residues in the C-linker and S5 of HCN4, which may result in a unique orientation of the cAMP transduction centre in HCN4. While a potential physiological role for LRMP regulation of HCN4 remains unknown, our data show that LRMP is a useful biophysical tool to study the intramolecular signal transduction between cAMP binding and the shift in HCN4 activation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell line (<italic>Homo-sapiens</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">HEK-293</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">ATCC</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">CRL-1573</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell line (<italic>Homo-sapiens</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">HEK-HCN4</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Dr. Martin Biel;

HCN2 was subcloned from pcDNA4 into pcDNA3.1 for this study. Other constructs were synthesized by Twist Biosciences (South San Francisco, CA) or using site-directed mutagenesis either in-house or by Applied Biological Materials (Richmond, Canada). The HCN4 Δ1–62, HCN4 Δ1–130, and HCN4 Δ1–185 deletion clones were made using a site-directed mutagenesis kit (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA) and a codon-optimized HCN4 plasmid in the pTwist-CMV-WPRE-Neo vector synthesized by Twist Biosciences.</p><p>For FRET experiments, recombinant fusions of mHCN4 and mLRMP were constructed by introducing Cerulean (CER) or Citrine (CIT) fluorescent proteins using PCR-based cloning. The C-termini of HCN4 constructs were tagged with CER, while the C-termini of LRMP constructs were tagged with CIT. Because there are no structures of LRMP or the or the N-terminus of HCN4, and because much of the experimental design was carried out prior to Alphafold’s structural predictions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Jumper et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Varadi et al., 2022</xref>), the specific cut sites were determined empirically. We tried a number of fragments and the ones used in this study were of similar sizes and expressed well in our system. The sites we chose relative to the predicted coiled-coil on LRMP can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>.</p><p>All clones used in this study are the murine sequences of LRMP and HCN4. All new constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing (Barbara Davis Center BioResource Core at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus; ACGT, Wheeling, IL; or Plasmidsaurus, Eugene, OR).

HEK 293 cells from which new cell lines were established and HEK HCN4 cells were negative for mycoplasma infection. Testing for mycoplasma infection was performed at the Molecular Biology Core Facility in the Barbara Center for Childhood Diabetes at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus. None of the cells are on the list of commonly misidentified cell lines.</p><p>HEK 293 cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA) were grown in a humidified incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub> in high glucose DMEM with L-glutamine supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 µg/mL streptomycin. Cells were transfected 48 hr prior to experiments and were plated on either protamine-coated glass coverslips (for patch clamp experiments) or poly-d-lysine coated glass-bottom dishes (for FRET experiments).</p><p>Patch clamp experiments were performed in either transiently transfected HEK293 cells, an HCN4 stable line in HEK293 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Zong et al., 2012</xref>), or eight new stable cell lines in HEK293 cells: HCN2, HCN4, HCN4 Δ1–62, HCN4 Δ1–130, HCN4 Δ1–185, HCN4 Δ1–200, HCN2 A467P/F469T (HCN2 AF/PT), and HCN4 P545A/T547F (HCN4 PT/AF). Stable cell lines were made by transfecting HEK293 cells with the respective plasmids using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, Waltham, MA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Forty-eight hours post-transfection, 200 µg/mL of G418 disulfate (Alfa Aesar, Haverhill, MA) or Hygromycin B (InvivoGen, San Diego, CA) was added to the cell culture media in place of pen-strep to select for stably transfected cells. Single-cell clones were tested using whole-cell patch clamp and the clonal lines that exhibited the largest and most consistent currents were grown into stable cell lines. Control experiments of HCN4 in the absence of LRMP were conducted alongside recordings in the presence of LRMP to ensure that stably expressed channels had consistent properties over the time course of the study.</p><p>Transient transfection of HCN4 constructs and/or LRMP was performed using Fugene6 (Promega, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Transfections of all constructs that did not include fluorescent tags were performed with the addition of eGFP (at a LRMP to GFP ratio of 4:1) as a co-transfection marker. All data were collected from a minimum of 3 transfections per condition. The N-values listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1 table2 table3">Tables 1–3</xref> represent the number of individual cells that were patch-clamped for a given condition.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Patch clamp electrophysiology</title><p>Cells were plated on sterile protamine-coated glass coverslips 24–48 hr prior to experiments. Cells on coverslip shards were transferred to the recording chamber and perfused (~0.5–1 mL/min) with extracellular solution containing (in mM): 30 KCl, 115 NaCl, 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1.8 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 5.5 glucose, and 5 HEPES. Transiently transfected cells were identified by green fluorescence.</p><p>Patch pipettes were pulled from borosilicate glass to a resistance of 1.0–3.0 MOhm when filled with intracellular solution containing (in mM): 130 K-Aspartate, 10 NaCl, 1 EGTA, 0.5 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 5 HEPES, and 2 Mg-ATP. One mM cAMP was added to the intracellular solution as indicated. All recordings were performed at room temperature in the whole-cell configuration. Data were acquired at 5 KHz, and low-pass filtered at 10 KHz using an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Molecular Devices, San Jose, CA), Digidata 1440 A A/D converter and Clampex software (Molecular Devices). Pipette capacitance was compensated in all recordings. Membrane capacitance and series resistance (Rs) were estimated in whole-cell experiments using 5 mV test pulses. Only cells with a stable Rs of &lt;10 MOhm were analyzed. Data were analyzed in Clampfit 10.7 (Molecular Devices).</p><p>Channel activation was determined from peak tail current amplitudes at –50 mV following 3 s hyperpolarizing pulses to membrane potentials between –50 mV and –170 mV from a holding potential of 0 mV. Normalized tail current-voltage relationships were fit by single Boltzmann equations to yield values for the midpoint activation voltage (V<sub>1/2</sub>) and slope factor (k). Deactivation time constants were determined using a single exponential fit to tail currents recorded at –50 mV following a pulse to –150 mV. All reported voltages are corrected for a calculated +14 mV liquid junction potential between the extracellular and intracellular solutions.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>FRET hybridization assays</title><p>HEK293 cells expressing HCN4-CER and LRMP-CIT fusion proteins were examined 48 hr after transfection using a Zeiss LSM 710 confocal laser scanning microscope. An area of 500–2,500 µm<sup>2</sup> was selected from the overall field of view. Images were taken through a 40×water objective. CER and CIT were excited with separate sweeps of the 458- and 514 nm laser lines of an argon laser directed at the cell with a 458/514 nm dual dichroic mirror. Relative to full power, the excitation power for the imaging sweeps was attenuated to 1% for CER and 0.5% for Citrine. Bleaching was performed by using multiple (20–60) sweeps of the CIT laser at full power. Bleaching was usually complete within 1–2 m. Emitted light was collected between 449 and 488 nm for CER and 525 and 600 nm for CIT. With this setup, there was no contamination of the relevant CER signal from the CIT. For each experiment, the photomultiplier tube gain was adjusted to ensure that the maximum pixel intensity was not &gt;70% saturated. Fluorescence intensity was then measured by drawing regions of interest (ROIs) around the cytoplasmic portion of the cell in ImageJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Schneider et al., 2012</xref>). Masks were occasionally used to eliminate bright fluorescent puncta within the cell (this was a rare occurrence in the CER signal).

Normality was tested using the Shapiro-Wilk test. The log of the deactivation time constant at –50 mV was used for statistical analysis to ensure the data were normally distributed. To prevent biasing of the results, all data were included except for cells showing large changes in leak or access resistance during the recording, or those for which the access resistance was &gt;10 MΩ at any point during recording. Tests for differences in the average midpoint of activation for a given HCN channel construct in the presence of LRMP and/or 1 mM cAMP were performed with a 2-way ANOVA. The main independent variables were the absence or presence of LRMP and the absence or presence of 1 mM cAMP in the pipette solution. Differences in the effects of cAMP in the absence or presence of LRMP were analyzed using an interaction term between the main independent variables. For FRET experiments, the recordings of Cerulean tagged HCN4 1–125 and HCN4 125–260 co-expressed with free Citrine were pooled as a control group. p&lt;0.05 was used as the cut-off for a significant effect.

When it states Citrine, does it mean just free Citrine, and &quot;LRMP 1-230&quot; means LRMP fused to Citrine which is an &quot;LF&quot; construct? Why not simply call it &quot;LF&quot;? If there is no Citrine fused to &quot;LRMP 1-230&quot;, this figure would not make sense to me.</p></disp-quote><p>We have clarified the labelling of this figure and specifically defined all abbreviations used for HCN4 and LRMP fragments in the results section on page 14.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Related to the above point- Why is there very little FRET between NF and LRMP 1-230? The FRET distance range is 2-8 nm which is quite large. To observe baseline FRET for this construct more explanation is required. Even if one assumes that about 100 amino are completely disordered (not extended) polymers, I think you would still expect significant FRET.</p></disp-quote><p>FRET is extremely sensitive to distance (to the 6th power of distance). The difference in contour length (maximum length of a peptide if extended) between our ~260aa fragment and our ~130 aa fragments is on the order of 450Å (45nm), So, even if not extended it is not hard to imagine that the larger fragments show a weaker FRET signal. In fact, we do see a slightly larger FRET than we do in control (not significant) which is consistent with the idea that the larger fragments just do not result in a large FRET.</p><p>Moreover, this hybridization assay is sensitive to a number of other factors including the affinity between the two fragments, the expression of each fragment, and the orientation of the fluorophores. Any of these factors could also result in reduced FRET.</p><p>We have added a section on the limitations of the FRET 2-hybrid assay in the discussion section on page 20.

In 5 previous reports from 4 different groups of HCN4 with cAMP in HEK 293 (Fenske et al., 2020; Liao et al., 2012; Peters et al., 2020; Saponaro et al., 2021; Schweizer et al., 2010), the average expected range of the data is 26.6 mV and 39.9 mV for 95% (mean ± 2<italic>SD) and 99% (mean ± 3</italic>SD) of the data, respectively. As the reviewer mentions the expected range from these papers is slightly larger in the absence of cAMP. The average SD of HCN4 (with/without cAMP) in papers are 9.9 mV (Schweizer et al., 2010), 4.4 mV (Saponaro et al., 2021), 7.6 mV (Fenske et al., 2020), 10.0 mV (Liao et al., 2012), and 5.9 mV (Peters et al., 2020). Our SD in this paper is roughly in the middle at 7.6 mV. This is likely because we used an inclusive approach to data so as not to bias our results (see the statistics section of the revised manuscript on page 9). We have removed 2 data points that meet the statistical classification as outliers, no measures of statistical significance were altered by this.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>This problem is spread throughout the manuscript, and the measured mean effects are indeed always at the limit of statistical significance.

They have been expanded slightly (-75 to -145 mV for all HCN4 channels and -65 to -135 mV for all HCN2 channels). The size of the mean value marker has been reduced slightly. Exact midpoints for all data are also found in Tables 1-3.</p><p>The GV curves in Figure 1B (previously Fig. 1A) are averages with the ± SEM error bars smaller than the symbols in many cases owing to relatively high n’s for these datasets.

The presence of bulky hydrophobic residues (very different nature compared to T) in the equivalent position of HCN1 and HCN2 also favours this hypothesis. In this light, it will be also interesting to see whether a single T547F mutation is sufficient to prevent the LRMP effect.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that testing this hypothesis would be very interesting. However, it is challenging. Any mutation we make that is involved in cAMP transduction makes measuring the LRMP effect on cAMP shifts difficult or impossible.</p><p>Our simple idea, now clarified in the discussion, is that if you look at the regions involved in cAMP transduction (HCND, C-linker, S4-S5), there are very few residues that differ between HCN4 and HCN2. When we mutate the 5 non-conserved residues in the S5 segment and the C-linker, along with the NT, we are able to render HCN2 sensitive to LRMP. Therefore, something about the small sequence differences in this region confer isoform specificity to LRMP. We speculate that this happens because of small structural differences that result from those 5 mutations. If you compare the solved structures of HCN1 and HCN4 (there is no HCN2 structure available), you can see small differences in the distances between key interacting residues in the transduction centre. Also, there is a kink at the bottom of the S4 helix in HCN4 but not HCN1. This points a putatively important residue for cAMP dependence in a different direction in HCN4. We hypothesize in the discussion that this may be how LRMP is isoform specific.</p><p>Moreover, previous work has shown that the HCN4 C-linker is uniquely sensitive to di-cyclic nucleotides and magnesium ions. We are hypothesizing that it is the subtle change in structure that makes this region more prone to regulation in HCN4.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewing Editor (recommendations for the Authors):</bold></p><p>(1) Exemplar recordings need to be shown and some explanation for the wide variability in the V-half of activation.</p></disp-quote><p>Exemplar currents are now shown for each channel. See the response to Reviewer 3’s public comment 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The rationale for cut sites in LRMP for the investigation of which parts of the protein are important for blocking the effect of cAMP is not logically presented in light of the modular schematics of domains in the protein (N-term, CCD, post-CCD, etc).</p></disp-quote><p>There is limited structural data on LRMP and the HCN4 N-terminus. The cut sites in this paper were determined empirically. We made fragments that were small enough to work for our FRET hybridization approach and that expressed well in our HEK cell system. The residue numbering of the LRMP modules is based on updated structural predictions using Alphafold, which was released after our fragments were designed. This has been clarified in the methods section on pages 5-6 and the Figure 2 legend of the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Role of the HCN4 C-terminus. Truncation of the HCN4 C-terminus unstructured Cterminus distal to the CNBD (Fig. 4 A, B) partially reverses the impact of LRMP (i.e. there is now a significant increase in cAMP effect compared to full-length HCN4). The manuscript is written in a manner that minimizes the potential role of the C-terminus and it is, therefore, eliminated from consideration in subsequent experiments (e.g. FRET) and the discussion. The model is incomplete without considering the impact of the C-terminus.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment as it was a result that we too readily dismissed. We have added discussion around this point and revised our model to suggest that not only can we not eliminate a role for the distal C-terminus, our data is consistent with it having a modest role. Our HCN4-2 chimera and HCN4-S719x data both suggest the possibility that the distal C-terminus might be having some effect on LRMP regulation. We have clarified this in the results (pages 12-13) and discussion (page 19).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) For FRET experiments, it is not clear why LF should show an interaction with N2 (residues 125-160) but not NF (residues 1-160). N2 is contained within NF, and given that Citrine and Cerulean are present on the C-terminus of LF and N2/NF, respectively, residues 1-124 in NF should not impact the detection of FRET because of greater separation between the fluorophores as suggested by the authors.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a fair point but FRET is somewhat more complicated. We do not know the structure of these fragments and it’s hard to speculate where the fluorophores are oriented in this type of assay. Moreover, this hybridization assay is sensitive to affinity and expression as well. There are a number of reasons why the larger 1-260 fragment might show reduced FRET compared to 125-260. As mentioned in our response to reviewer 2’s public comment 2, we have added a limitation section that outlines the various caveats of FRET that could explain this.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) For FRET experiments, the choice of using pieces of the channel that do not correlate with the truncations studied in functional electrophysiological experiments limits the holistic interpretation of the data. Also, no explanation or discussion is provided for why LRMP fragments that are capable of binding to the HCN4 N-terminus as determined by FRET (e.g. residues 1-108 and 110-230, respectively) do not have a functional impact on the channel.</p></disp-quote><p>As mentioned in the response to comment 2, the exact fragment design is a function of which fragments expressed well in HEK cells. Importantly, because FRET experiments do not provide atomic resolution for the caveats listed in the revised limitations section on page 20-21, small differences in the cut sites do not change the interpretation of these results. For example, the N-terminal 1-125 construct is analogous to experiments with the Δ1-130 HCN4 channel.</p><p>We suspect that residues in both fragments are required and that the interaction involves multiple parts. This is stated in the results “Thus, the first 227 residues of LRMP are sufficient to regulate HCN4, with residues in both halves of the LRMP N-terminus necessary for the regulation” (page 11). We have also added discussion on this on page 21.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) A striking result was that mutating two residues in the C-linker of HCN4 to amino acids found in HCN channels not affected by LRMP (P545A, T547F), completely eliminated the impact of LRMP on preventing cAMP regulation of channel activation. However, a chimeric channel, (HCN4-2) in which the C-linker, the CNBD, and the C-terminus of HCN4 were replaced by that of HCN2 was found to be partially responsive to LRMP. These two results appear inconsistent and not reconciled in the model proposed by the authors for how LRMP may be working.</p></disp-quote><p>As stated in our answer to your question #3, we have revised our interpretation of these data. If the more distal C-terminus plays some role in the orientation of the C-linker and the transduction centre as a whole, these data can still be viewed consistent with our model. We have added some discussion of this idea in our discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) Replacing the HCN2 N-terminus with that from HCN4, along with mutations in the S5 (MCS/VVG) and C-linker (AF/PT) recapitulated LRMP regulation on the HCN2 background. The functional importance of the S5 mutations is not clear as no other experiments are shown to indicate whether they are necessary for the observed effect.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added our experiments on a midpoint HCN2 clone that includes the S5 mutants and the C-linker mutants in the absence of the HCN4 N-terminus (ie HCN2 MCSAF/VVGPT) (Fig. 7). And we have discussed our rationale for the S5 mutations as we believe they may be responsible for the different orientations of the S4-S5 linker in HCN1 and HCN4 structures that are known to impact cAMP regulation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>A) Comments:</p><p>(1) Figure 1: Please show some representative current traces.</p></disp-quote><p>Exemplar currents are now shown for each channel in the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Figure 1: There appears to be a huge number of recordings for HCN4 +/- cAMP as compared to those with LRMP 1-479Cit. How was the number of recordings needed for sufficient statistical power decided? This is particularly important because the observed slowing of deactivation by cAMP in Fig. 1C seems like it may be fairly subtle. Perhaps a swarm plot would make the shift more apparent? Also, LRMP 1-479Cit distributions in Fig. 1B-C look like they are more uniform than normal, so please double-check the appropriateness of the statistical test employed.</p></disp-quote><p>We have revised the methods section (page 7) to discuss this, briefly we performed regular control experiments throughout this project to ensure that a normal cAMP response was occurring. Our minimum target for sufficient power was 8-10 recordings.

In the HCN4Δ1-130 construct, cAMP caused a significant depolarizing shift in the presence of LRMP; however, the midpoint of activation in the presence of LRMP and cAMP showed a non-significant trend towards hyperpolarization compared to cAMP alone (Fig. 3C and 3E; Table 1)&quot;.</p><p>This means that sequence 62-185 is necessary and sufficient for the LRMP effect. I suggest a competition assay with this peptide (synthetic, or co-expressed with HCN4 full-length and LRMP to see whether the peptide inhibits the LRMP effect).</p></disp-quote><p>We respectfully disagree with the reviewer’s interpretation. Our results, strongly suggest that other regions such as residues 25-65 (Fig. 3C) and C-terminal residues (Fig. 6) are also necessary. The use of a peptide could be an interesting future experiment, however, it would be very difficult to control relative expression of a co-expressed peptide. We think that our results in Fig. 7E-F where this fragment is added to HCN2 are a better controlled way of validating the importance of this region.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) &quot;Truncation of the distal C-terminus (of HCN4) did not prevent LRMP regulation. In the presence of both LRMP and cAMP the activation of HCN4-S719X was still significantly hyperpolarized compared to the presence of cAMP alone (Figs. 4A and 4B; Table 1). And the cAMP-induced shift in HCN4-S719X in the presence of LRMP (~7mV) was less than half the shift in the absence of LRMP (~18 mV).&quot;</p><p>On the basis of the partial effects reported for the truncations of the N-terminus of HCN4 162 and 1-130 (Fig 3B and C), I do not think it is possible to conclude that &quot;truncation of the distal C-terminus (of HCN4) did not prevent LRMP regulation&quot;. Indeed, cAMP-induced shift in HCN4 Δ1-62 and Δ1-130 in the presence of LRMP were 10.9 and 10.5 mV, respectively, way more than the ~7mV measured for the HCN4-S719X mutant.</p><p>As you rightly stated at the end of the paragraph:&quot; Together, these results show significant LRMP regulation of HCN4 even when the distal C-terminus is truncated, consistent with a minimal role for the C-terminus in the regulatory pathway&quot;. I would better discuss this minimal role of the C-terminus. It is true that deletion of the first 185 aa of HCN4 Nterminus abolishes the LRMP effect, but it is also true that removal of the very Cterm of HCN4 does affect LRMP. This unstructured C-terminal region of HCN4 contains isotype-specific sequences. Maybe they also play a role in recognizing LRMP. Thus, I would suggest further investigation via truncations, even internal deletions of HCN4-specific sequences.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see the response to the reviewing editor’s comment 3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Figure 5: The N-terminus of LRMP FRETs with the N-terminus of HCN4.</p><p>Why didn't you test the same truncations used in Fig. 3?

This set of peptides will help you connect binding with the functional effects of the truncations tested in Fig 3.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see the response to the reviewing editor’s comment 2 and 5.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Why didn't you test the C-terminus (from 719 till the end) of HCN4?

In Fig. 6 you have shown that the &quot;HCN4-P545A/T547F was insensitive to LRMP (Figs. 6B and 6C; Table 1), indicating that the unique HCN4 C-linker is necessary for regulation by LRMP&quot;. How can be this reconciled with the HCN4-2 chimera? HCN4-2, &quot;containing&quot; P545A/T547F mutations, should not perceive LRMP.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see the response to the reviewing editor’s comment 6.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) &quot;we next made a targeted chimera of HCN2 that contains the distal HCN4 N-terminus (residues 1-212) and the HCN2 transmembrane and C-terminal domains with 5 point mutants in non-conserved residues of the S5 segment and C-linker elbow (M338V/C341V/S345G/A467P/F469T)......Importantly, the HCN4-2 VVGPT channel is insensitive to cAMP in the presence of LRMP (Fig. 7C and 7D), indicating that the HCN4 Nterminus and cAMP-transduction centre residues are sufficient to confer LRMP regulation to HCN2&quot;.</p><p>Why did you insert also the 3 mutations of S5? Are these mutations somehow involved in the cAMP transduction mechanism?</p><p>You have already shown that in HCN4 only P545 and T547 (Clinker) are necessary for LRMP effect.
