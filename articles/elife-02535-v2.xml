Negative epistatic interactions between genes from different parental genomes decrease the fitness of hybrids and can limit gene flow between species. However, little is known about the number and genome-wide distribution of genetic incompatibilities separating species. To detect interacting genes, we perform a high-resolution genome scan for linkage disequilibrium between unlinked genomic regions in naturally occurring hybrid populations of swordtail fish. We estimate that hundreds of pairs of genomic regions contribute to reproductive isolation between these species, despite them being recently diverged. Many of these incompatibilities are likely the result of natural or sexual selection on hybrids, since intrinsic isolation is known to be weak. Patterns of genomic divergence at these regions imply that genetic incompatibilities play a significant role in limiting gene flow even in young species.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02535.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02535.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02535.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>In nature, closely related species often interbreed to produce hybrids. However, hybrids are often less fertile or unable to compete with parent species, making them less likely to thrive in the wild.</p><p>When the genomes of two different species are mixed, versions of genes that are meant to work together can become separated, which means that these genes do not work as well as they should. This reduces the hybrids' chances of survival, and a poor survival rate of hybrids is one barrier that keeps different species distinct, even though the species can interbreed.</p><p>Two species of swordtail fish live in the rivers in Mexico, and although they mostly live in different stretches of these rivers, the two species interbreed to produce hybrids in the regions where they overlap. These hybrids can outnumber the parental species in these ‘hybrid zones’, but the two species have remained separate in other parts of the rivers. Though some genetic incompatibilities that might keep the species distinct have previously been suggested, it is not known how many incompatibilities there are in these fish's genomes.</p><p>Schumer et al. have searched the genomes of wild hybrids between these species and found hundreds of genetic incompatibilities. These were identified by looking for species-specific pairs of genes that are found together more often than would be expected if there were no selection against hybrids. It is likely that many of these incompatibilities reduce the evolutionary fitness of the hybrid fish and Schumer et al. suggest that many could be the result of environmental pressures and the fish's mating preferences. Furthermore, Schumer et al. demonstrate that genes close to identified incompatibilities are more different between species, on average, than genes that are further away. When there is on-going interbreeding between two the species (as is the case with the swordtails), this finding is expected only if these incompatibilities reduce the hybrids' chances of finding mates or surviving.</p><p>The findings of Schumer et al. demonstrate how conflicts in the genomes of two species allow these species to remain distinct even when they live in overlapping environments and frequently interbreed. Future work will investigate how these genetic incompatibilities shape the hybrid populations that are found in the wild; and which incompatibilities are caused by poor survival of the hybrids or by the fish's mating preferences selecting against the hybrids.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02535.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02535.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>hybridization</kwd><kwd>speciation</kwd><kwd>hybrid fitness</kwd><kwd>genetic incompatibility</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>IOS-0923825</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rosenthal</surname><given-names>Gil G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GRFP Grant No. DGE0646086</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schumer</surname><given-names>Molly</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Genetic incompatibilities are common and widely distributed throughout the genomes of swordtail fish, and prevent the regions of the genome around them from being exchanged between different species.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Hybridization between closely related species is remarkably common (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mallet, 2005</xref>). Many hybridizing populations and species remain genetically and ecologically distinct despite bouts of past admixture (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Scascitelli et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Vonholdt et al., 2010</xref>). This has led to a surge of interest in identifying which and how many loci are important in maintaining species barriers. Recent work has focused on identifying so-called ‘genomic islands’ of high divergence between closely related species (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Turner et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nadeau et al., 2012</xref>). This approach assumes that the most diverged regions between species are most likely to be under divergent selection between species or important in reproductive isolation. However, divergence-based measures need to be interpreted with caution because they are susceptible to artifacts as a result of linked selection events (including background selection and hitchhiking) such that outlier regions might reflect low within-population polymorphism rather than unusually high divergence (discussed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Charlesworth, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Noor and Bennett, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Renaut et al., 2013</xref>), and there are many possible causes of elevated divergence that are not linked to isolation between species.</p><p>Investigating genome-wide patterns in naturally occurring or laboratory-generated hybrid populations is another approach to characterize the genetic architecture of reproductive isolation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Payseur, 2010</xref>). Hybridization leads to recombination between parental genomes that can uncover genetic incompatibilities between interacting genes. When genomes diverge in allopatry, substitutions that accumulate along a lineage can lead to reduced fitness when hybridization decouples them from the genomic background on which they arose. The best understood of these epistatic interactions, called ‘Bateson-Dobzhansky-Muller’ (BDM) incompatibilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Coyne and Orr, 2004</xref>), can occur as a result of neutral substitution or adaptive evolution, and are thought to be common based on theoretical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Orr, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Turelli et al., 2001</xref>) and empirical studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Presgraves, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Presgraves et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Payseur and Hoekstra, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brideau et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Sweigart et al., 2006</xref>). One defining feature of BDM incompatibilities is that they are predicted to have asymmetric fitness effects in different parental backgrounds, such that only a subset of hybrid genotypes are under selection. Though the BDMI model is an important mechanism of selection against hybrids, other evolutionary mechanisms can contribute to hybrid incompatibility. For example, co-evolution between genes can result in selection on all hybrid genotype combinations due to the accumulation of multiple substitutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Seehausen et al., 2014</xref>). Similarly, natural or sexual selection against hybrid phenotypes can be considered a form of hybrid incompatibility; in this case the genotypes under selection will depend on their phenotypic effects.</p><p>How common are hybrid incompatibilities and what is their genomic distribution? Most studies to date have addressed this question by mapping hybrid incompatibilities that contribute to inviability or sterility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Orr, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Orr and Coyne, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barbash et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Presgraves, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Presgraves et al., 2003</xref>), in part because these incompatibilities affect hybrids even in a lab environment. Initial genome-wide studies in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and other organisms suggest that the number of incompatibilities contributing to hybrid viability and sterility can range from a handful to hundreds accumulating between deeply diverged species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Harushima et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Presgraves, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Moyle and Graham, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Masly and Presgraves, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Ross et al., 2011</xref>); recent work has also suggested that substantial numbers of incompatibilities segregate within species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cutter, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Corbett-Detig et al., 2013</xref>). However, because research has focused primarily on postzygotic isolation, little is known about the total number of loci contributing to reproductive isolation between species. For example, research shows that selection against hybrid genotypes can be strong even in the absence of postzygotic isolation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fang et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, the focus on hybrid sterility and inviability is likely to substantially underestimate the true number of genetic incompatibilities distinguishing species.</p><p>If negative epistatic interactions are important in maintaining reproductive isolation, specific patterns of genetic variation are predicted in hybrid genomes. In particular, selection against hybrid individuals that harbor unfavorable allele combinations in their genomes will lead to under-representation of these allelic combinations in a hybrid population. Thus, selection can generate non-random associations, or linkage disequilibrium (LD), among unlinked loci in hybrid genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Karlin, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hastings, 1981</xref>). Patterns of LD in hybrid populations can therefore be used to identify genomic regions that are important in establishing and maintaining reproductive isolation between species.</p><p>Only a handful of studies have investigated genome-wide patterns of LD in hybrid populations. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gardener et al. (2000)</xref> evaluated patterns of LD at 85 widely dispersed markers (∼0.03 markers/Mb) in sunflowers and found significant associations among markers known to be related to infertility in hybrids. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Payseur and Hoekstra (2005)</xref> evaluated patterns of LD among 332 unlinked SNPs (∼0.12 markers/Mb) in inbred lines of hybrid mice and identified a set of candidate loci with strong conspecific associations. More recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hohenlohe et al. (2012)</xref> investigated genome-wide patterns of LD at ∼2000 sites (∼4.5 markers/Mb) in oceanic and freshwater sticklebacks and found two unlinked regions in strong LD that are highly differentiated between populations. These studies suggest hybridization can expose the genome to strong selection that leaves detectable signatures of LD in hybrids.</p><p>In this study, we evaluate genome-wide patterns of LD in replicate hybrid populations of two species of swordtail fish, <italic>Xiphophorus birchmanni</italic> and <italic>X. malinche</italic>. These species are recently diverged (0.5% genomic divergence per site; 0.4% genomic divergence following polymorphism masking) and form multiple independent hybrid zones in river systems in the Sierra Madre Oriental of Mexico (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Culumber et al., 2011</xref>). <italic>X. malinche</italic> is found at high elevations while <italic>X. birchmanni</italic> is common at low elevations; hybrids occur where the ranges of these two species overlap. The strength of selection on hybrids between these two species is unknown, but several lines of evidence have suggested that selection may be weak. Hybrids are abundant in hybrid zones, often greatly outnumbering parental individuals. Hybrids are tolerant of the thermal environments at the elevations in which they are found (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Culumber et al., 2012</xref>). Though there is some evidence of BDMIs between the species that cause lethal melanomas, these melanomas typically affect hybrids post-reproduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Schartl, 2008</xref>) and may constitute a weak or even favorable selective force (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fernandez and Morris, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fernandez and Bowser, 2010</xref>). Finally, recent behavioral studies show that once hybrids are formed, hybrid males actually have an advantage due to sexual selection compared to parental individuals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>; and see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fisher et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Culumber et al., in press</xref>). However, the genomes of adult hybrids sampled from hybrid populations have already been subject to multiple generations of selection (at least 30; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Rosenthal et al., 2003</xref>), making it difficult to evaluate the extent of selection on hybrids without genetic information. By surveying the genomes of hybrids from natural populations, we are able to identify interacting genomic regions under selection in hybrids, giving a powerful picture of the number of regions involved in reproductive isolation between this recently diverged species pair.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02535.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Hybrids between <italic>X. malinche</italic> and <italic>X. birchmanni</italic>.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Parental (<italic>X. malinche</italic> top, <italic>X. birchmanni</italic> bottom) and (<bold>B</bold>) hybrid phenotypes with sample MSG genotype plots for linkage groups 1–3 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> for more examples) for each population shown in the right panel.

(2011)</xref>. Originally developed for QTL mapping in controlled genetic crosses, we describe modifications that make the technique applicable to population genetic samples from hybrid populations. With this approach, we assign ancestry to nearly 500,000 ancestry informative markers throughout the genome, allowing us to evaluate genome wide patterns of LD at unprecedented resolution (∼820 markers/Mb). The joint analysis of two independent hybrid zones allows us to distinguish the effects of selection against genetic incompatibilities from confounding effects due to population history (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gardner et al., 2000</xref>). We further evaluate loci that are in significant LD to investigate the mechanisms of selection on these pairs. Our results support the conclusion that a large number of loci contribute to reproductive isolation between these two species, that these loci have higher divergence than the genomic background, and that selection against genetic incompatibilities maintains associations between loci derived from the same parental genome.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Hybrid zones have distinct demographic histories</title><p>We used a modified version of the MSG analysis pipeline, optimized for genotyping in natural hybrids (‘Materials and methods’, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) to genotype individual fish collected from two independently formed hybrid zones, Calnali and Tlatemaco (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Culumber et al., 2011</xref>).

Most hybrid individuals were close to the average hybrid index in each group (Tlatemaco: 95% of individuals 66–80% <italic>malinche</italic> ancestry; Calnali: 95% of individuals 14–35% <italic>malinche</italic> ancestry). We determined the time since hybridization based on the decay in linkage disequilibrium (‘Materials and methods’), assuming an average genome-wide recombination rate of 1 cM/378 kb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Walter et al., 2004</xref>). Estimates of hybrid zone age were similar for the two hybrid zones (Tlatemaco 56 generations, CI: 55–57, Calnali 35 generations CI: 34.5–35.6). Interestingly, these estimates are remarkably consistent with available historical estimates, which suggest that hybridization began within the last ∼40 generations due to disruption of chemical cues by pollution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fisher et al., 2006</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Significant LD between unlinked genomic regions</title><p>Ancestry calls at 469,400 markers genome-wide were thinned to 12,229 markers that are sufficient to describe all changes in ancestry (±10%) across individuals in both populations (‘Materials and methods’).

We discover significant LD between hundreds of pairs of unlinked genomic regions and show that a model of selection against hybrid incompatibilities describes the observed conspecific LD patterns. This implies that many negative epistatic interactions segregate in these hybrid fish populations despite the fact that intrinsic post-zygotic isolation is thought to be weak (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Rosenthal et al., 2003</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>How many regions are involved in hybrid incompatibility?</title><p>Our analysis focuses on a high confidence set of unlinked loci in significant LD. Despite these findings, the true number of loci involved in incompatibilities may involve hundreds more interactions for several reasons. First, we conservatively exclude interactions within chromosomes due to the lack of detailed genetic map information. Second, we have only moderate power to detect incompatibilities (e.g., ∼30% using parameter estimates for Calnali). Third, relaxing the p-value threshold suggests the true number of pairs in significant LD could be much larger (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Finally, our experimental design incorporates two populations with opposite trends in genome-wide ancestry and independent histories of hybridization. This conservative approach allows us to exclude effects of population history, but false negatives in our joint analysis may result from effects that are population-specific (for example, different effects of extrinsic selection in the two populations). Investigating the role of such a large number of hybrid incompatibilities in determining the structure of hybrid genomes is an exciting area for future empirical and theoretical research.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>How strong is selection on hybrid incompatibilities?</title><p>Using an approximate Bayesian approach, we estimate that the average selection coefficient on negative epistatic interactions is in the vicinity of s = 0.03 (Tlatemaco) to s = 0.07 (Calnali); scaling these by estimates of the effective population size (2 Ns∼10 and ∼45, respectively) suggests that selection is strong enough to be deterministic but of moderate strength relative to drift. Given the large number of putative incompatibilities, even weak selection would introduce substantial genetic load in hybrids. Depending on dominance effects, this could explain why hybrid populations are skewed in genome-wide ancestry. However, we may overestimate the potential for genetic load if epistatic interactions are complex. Though this study focuses on pairwise comparisons because statistically evaluating high-order interactions in a data set of this size is intractable, more complex interactions are predicted to be likely (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Orr, 1995</xref>).

Previous studies on the genomic distribution of hybrid incompatibilities have focused almost entirely on incompatibilities involved in post-zygotic isolation (in some studies, exclusively in males; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Presgraves, 2003</xref>). However, such studies can only provide a lower limit on the number of loci involved in reproductive isolation between lineages. A recent study in <italic>Drosophila simulans</italic> and <italic>D. sechellia</italic> investigated the effects of interspecific competition on the fitness of introgressed lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fang et al., 2012</xref>). Though introgressed lines had no detectable differences in fertility or viability, the authors nonetheless detected strong selection on hybrids in competition experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fang et al., 2012</xref>), implying that the number of loci involved in reproductive isolation has been vastly underestimated in most studies.</p><p>Our results lend support to this point of view.

Heterospecific associations may be the result of beneficial epistatic interactions that result in hybrid vigor. For example, hybrid males are better at buffering the locomotor costs of sexual ornamentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Johnson, 2013</xref>) and have an advantage compared to parental males from sexual selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Culumber et al., in press</xref>), which could in part counteract the negative fitness effects of genetic incompatibilities. However, the fact that few loci are heterospecific in association in both populations (2%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>) suggests that these patterns are not repeatable across populations.

These regions were also more divergent between species than the genomic background, likely as a result of reduced permeability to ongoing gene flow between the species. By using samples from two populations with independent histories of hybridization, we are able to exclude population structure and drift as potential causes of these patterns. Our results suggest that past research has vastly underestimated the number of regions responsible for reproductive isolation between species by focusing on intrinsic postzygotic reproductive isolation.

We focus only on sites that have positive R (207 pairs) since these sites are expected to be enriched for hybrid incompatibilities.</p><p>Because selection on two-locus interactions results in changes in the frequency of particular genotypes, we used the frequency of double homozygous genotypes for the major parent (Tlatemaco: MM_MM, Calnali: BB_BB), frequency of homozygous–heterozygous genotypes for the minor parent (Tlatemaco: MB_BB and BB_MB, Calnali: MM_MB and MB_MM), and average final ancestry proportion as summary statistics. Under the BDM incompatibility model, two distinct fitness matrices are possible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Because these models are equally likely (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Coyne and Orr, 2004</xref>), we used the random binomial function in R to assign the 207 conspecific-associated locus pairs to each fitness matrix for each simulation. To simplify our simulations, we assume that selection is equal on all genotype combinations that have not previously been exposed to selection in ancestral populations (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). For each simulation, we drew from uniform prior distributions for 4 parameters. Limits on the prior distribution for admixture proportions for the two populations were determined as 0.5 to A, where A is the 95% CI of 1000 bootstrap resamplings of population ancestry from the observed data.

This model may be more consistent with incompatibilities arising from co-evolving loci or selection against hybrid phenotypes.

To evaluate levels of divergence relative to the genomic background, we compared divergence (calculated as number of divergent sites/length of region) between <italic>X. malinche</italic> and <italic>X. birchmanni</italic> at 207 regions in significant conspecific LD (FDR = 0.05) in both populations to 1000 data sets of the same size generated by randomly sampling regions throughout the genome that were not in significant LD (p&gt;0.013 with all unlinked regions) using a custom perl script and the program fastahack (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/ekg/fastahack">https://github.com/ekg/fastahack</ext-link>). For LD regions that included only 1 marker (n = 60), we included the flanking region defined by the closest 5′ and 3′ marker. To analyze coding regions, we extracted exons from these regions and calculated dN, N, dS, and S for each gene using codeml in PAML with the F3x4 codon model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Yang, 1997</xref>; scripts are available in the Dryad data repository under DOI: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.5061/dryad.q6qn0">10.5061/dryad.q6qn0</ext-link>).

Repeating all analyses for the full data set (i.e., including pairs in heterospecific LD in one or both populations) did not substantially change the results (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1C</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-12"><title>Gene ontology analysis of genomic regions in conspecific LD</title><p>To determine whether there is significant enrichment of certain gene classes in our data set, we annotated regions in significant LD. We only considered LD regions that contained 10 genes or fewer to limit our analysis to regions that are reasonably well-resolved. After excluding regions with no genes, this resulted in 242 regions for analysis containing 202 unique genes. We used the ensembl annotation of the <italic>X. maculatus</italic> genome (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ensembl.org/Xiphophorus_maculatus">http://www.ensembl.org/Xiphophorus_maculatus</ext-link>) to identify the HUGO Genome Nomenclature Committee (HGCN) abbreviation for all the genes in each region. Using the GOstats package in R, we built a custom <italic>Xiphophorus</italic> database using the HGCN gene names listed in the genome and matching each of these to Gene Ontology (GO) categories as specified in the annotated human genome database (in bioconductor ‘org.Hs.eg.db’). This resulted in a total of 12,815 genes that could be matched to GO categories. We then tested for functional enrichment in GO categories, using the GOstats and GSEABase packages in R and a p-value threshold of &lt;0.01.</p></sec><sec id="s3-13"><title>Modeling the effect of demographic processes on LD</title><p>Demographic processes such as bottlenecks and continued migration can affect LD measures and could potentially increase our false discovery rate. To explore how demographic changes might influence LD p-value distributions, we performed coalescent simulations using the MAP estimate of hybrid population size (co-estimated with other parameters using ABC, see above).</p><p>We used Hudson's <italic>ms</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hudson, 1990</xref>) to simulate an unlinked pair of regions in two populations. We calculated time of admixture relative to the time of speciation using the relationship Tdiv<sub>4N</sub>=(1/2) ((D<sub>xy</sub>/θ) −1), where D<sub>xy</sub> is the average number of substitutions per site between species; we previously estimated <italic>ρ,</italic> the population recombination rate, θ, the population mutation rate (<italic>ρ =</italic>θ = 0.0016 per site), and N<sub>e</sub>, the effective population size (N<sub>e</sub> = 10,500), for <italic>X. birchmanni</italic> based on the whole genome sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Schumer et al., 2013</xref>). Because parameter estimates were similar for <italic>X. malinche</italic>, for simplicity, we used these estimates for both parental populations. For population 1, we set the time of admixture (t<sub>admix/4N</sub>) to 0.0014 generations, the proportion <italic>X. malinche</italic> to 0.7 (derived from the average hybrid index in samples from Tlatemaco), and the sample size to 170 diploids. For population 2, we set t<sub>admix/4N</sub> to 0.000875, the proportion <italic>X. malinche</italic> to 0.2 (derived from the average hybrid index in samples from Calnali), and the sample size to 143 diploids. We specified a bottleneck at t<sub>admix/4N</sub> reducing the population to 2% its original size in simulations of Calnali and 18% its original size in simulations of Tlatemaco (based on results of ABC simulations, see ‘Results’). In each simulated replicate, we selected one substitution from each unlinked region and accepted a pair of sites if they were fixed for different states between parents (evaluated by generating 30 chromosomes of each species per simulation). Simulations were performed until 100,000 pairs had been simulated (scripts are available in the Dryad data repository under DOI: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.5061/dryad.q6qn0">10.5061/dryad.q6qn0</ext-link>); we used the rate of false positives from these simulations to calculate the total expected number of false positives given our effective number of tests. Based on these simulations, our expected FDR at p&lt;0.013 is ∼10%, slightly larger than our expected FDR based on permutation of the data.</p><p>Because we do not have information about the migration history of these populations, we use simulations of migration only to explore how continued migration or multiple admixture events might affect our false discovery rate. We simulate unidirectional migration of individuals from each parental population to the hybrid population per generation (4Nm = 80 for each parental population). Under this migration scenario, our expected FDR at p&lt;0.013 is 15%. In addition to scenarios of ongoing migration, we simulated migration bursts. For a short time interval that corresponds to ∼1 generation starting ∼10 generations ago (t<sub>mig/4N</sub> = 0.00025–0.000275), we set the migration rate to 4Nm = 4000, or 10% of the population made up of migrants. We simulated three scenarios: (1) migration from the major parent (expected FDR 15%), (2) migration from the minor parent (expected FDR 11%), and (3) migration from both parents (4Nm = 2000 for each parental population, expected FDR 11%). None of these demographic scenarios increased expected FDR above 15%.</p></sec><sec id="s3-14"><title>MSG parameter determination and power simulations</title><p>Because MSG has not previously been used to analyze natural hybrids, we evaluated performance at a range of parameters and performed power simulations. To optimize the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) parameters of MSG for analysis of natural hybrids, we used a combination of empirical data and simulations. We set the error rate parameter (deltapar) for each parent based on the genome wide average rate of calls to the incorrect parent in the 60 parental individuals of each species analyzed (deltapar = 0.05 and 0.04 for <italic>X. birchmanni</italic> and <italic>X. malinche</italic>, respectively). The transition probability of the HMM in MSG is determined by the mean genome-wide recombination rate multiplied by a scalar (rfac). We set the recombination rate to 240 based on the estimate of approximately 1 recombination event per chromosome per meiosis (24, 1 cM/378 kb, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Walter et al., 2004</xref>), and an a prior expectation of at least 10 generations of hybridization. We then increased the recombination factor step-wise to the maximum value that did not induce false breakpoints in parental individuals; we determined that rfac could be set to 3 without leading to spurious ancestry calls for parental individuals.</p><p>At some point, ancestry blocks will be too small for the HMM to detect given our density of ancestry informative markers. To determine the ancestry block size at which sensitivity decreases, we used the pseudogenomes to generate 25 Mb chromosomes with a homozygous block for the alternate parent randomly inserted (40, 60, 80, 100, 120 kb). We simulated 100 replicates of each size class and generated 1 million reads at MseI sites genome-wide. We then analyzed these simulated individuals using the MSG pipeline and determined whether the homozygous segment was detected. Based on our simulations, we determined that we had low power to detect ancestry blocks smaller than 80 kb (probability of detection ≤80%) and high power to detect blocks 120 kb or larger (probability of detection ≥97%). To determine how much of the genome we are failing to detect in small ancestry segments, we fit an exponential distribution to the observed block sizes in the real data for each parent and for each population, generated samples from an exponential distribution with the lambda of the observed distribution, and determined what percent of bases pairs were found in ancestry blocks below our detection threshold. Based on this analysis, we determined that in both hybrid zones, less than 5% of base pairs in the genome are likely to fall into undetectable segments.</p><p>As an additional evaluation of MSG's effectiveness in genotyping hybrid genomes with similar properties to ours, we simulated a 25 Mb admixed chromosome for 100 individuals, drawing ancestry size blocks from the block size distribution observed in the real data. We then generated MSG data in silico for each simulated individual (1 million reads), and compared MSG ancestry calls to true ancestry. We found that on average 91.4% of raw calls were made to the correct genotype; if ambiguous calls were excluded (posterior probability ≤0.95, 7% of sites), MSG's accuracy increased to &gt;98%. The median size of regions for which incorrect calls were made was 29 kb, much smaller than the median block size in the whole data set.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We would like to thank Molly Przeworski, Graham Coop, and Priya Moorjani for statistical advice, Bridgett vonHoldt, Stephen Wright, and Ying Zhen for reading the manuscript, Dale Nyholt for providing the source code for matSpDlite, John Postlethwait for access to the <italic>Xiphophorus maculatus</italic> genome, and the federal government of Mexico for permission to collect fish.</p></ack><sec sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="conflict" id="conf1"><p>The authors declare that no competing interests exist.</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>MS, Conception and design, Acquisition of data, Analysis and interpretation of data, Drafting or revising the article</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>RC, Conception and design, Analysis and interpretation of data, Drafting or revising the article</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>GGR, Conception and design, Analysis and interpretation of data, Drafting or revising the article</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>PA, Conception and design, Analysis and interpretation of data, Drafting or revising the article</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>DLP, Acquisition of data, Analysis and interpretation of data, Drafting or revising the article</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>RD, Acquisition of data, Analysis and interpretation of data, Drafting or revising the article</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Animal experimentation: The procedures used in this study were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Texas A&amp;M University (Protocols # 2010-111 and 2012-164).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor (Detlef Weigel) and 3 reviewers, one of whom, Gil McVean, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The genetic architecture of species isolation is a fascinating area and, as a result, there are still many things we don't know about the process. This paper exploits a fantastic natural experiment – multiple independent origins of hybrids between two species of fish that live in different thermal zones of Mexican rivers – and uses genome-wide genotyping to look at patterns of inter- and intra-specific LD within the hybrids. You conclude that 100s of loci are important in causing reproductive isolation (or at least are involved in epistatic fitness interactions), though none are identified directly and the evidence is circumstantial.</p><p>These results are potentially very interesting, because they point to many, relatively weak interactions affecting fitness arising from hybridisation. However, in its current form, there are a number of key limitations that need to be addressed.</p><p>1) Confirmation of LD not being driven by physical linkage. Long-range LD could be an artefact resulting from mis-assembly or mis-mapping – small-scale transpositions and duplications, or simply because the Xiphophorus maculates genome as a typical next gen draft might have erroneous linkages. You need to show that the regions you identify as being in long range LD are also linked to their supposedly local neighbors.</p><p>2) Accuracy of dating hybridisation. If you look at the hybrid genomes in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, there are what look like big blocks of ancestry from the non-dominant species, but these seem to be interspersed with brief switches back and forth between the parental types. The reported length of tracts is quite small, implying an old hybridisation, but there is a worry that this is due to over-switching in the ancestry painting. We would like to see an analysis more like that of the Hellenthal et al. recent Science paper in humans, where the decay of parental ancestry along the genome is used, rather than the length of blocks inferred directly. Genotyping error, gene conversion, mis-assembly and segregating deletions might all confuse the simple painting approach used and, because so many of the inferences are critically dependent on the age of the hybridisation event, it is important to be robust to any technical problems. We'd also like to see some evidence that a single hybridisation event fits the data well.</p><p>3) Predictions of the BDMI model. A key prediction of the 2-locus BDM model is that hybrid incompatibilities will be asymmetric. In the case where the ancestor is AABB, species 1 is AAbb, and species 2 is aaBB, only one of the heterospecific homozygous combinations suffers (aabb) – because the other is the ancestral genotype. For loci with significant LD, you find a deficit of heterospecific, homozygous genotypes, which might be seen even if only one of the two genotypes (aabb) is selected against. However, it is unclear to us if the selection model you propose to explain the observed deviations from expected genotype frequencies is consistent with what is predicted under the BDM model. In particular, it is difficult to understand why there might be selection against all single heterozygote combinations, but not against the double heterozygote (AaBb). And why do you group “opposite homozygotes” together? Again, the BDM model says that only one of these should be underrepresented: aabb. In fact, depending on the predominant direction of interspecific gene flow, AABB might even be favored (e.g., in the scenario above, if most backcrosses are to species 1). Given that gene flow is highly asymmetric in both populations, we wonder if this might explain the prevalence of negative LD associated loci. In general, this asymmetric gene flow warrants further explanation because it will affect the frequencies of genotypes at putatively incompatible loci.</p><p>4) Confirmation that a neutral model cannot explain the data. There is a literature on the distribution of ancestry block sizes and the effects of drift and selection on expectations, but it does not appear here (many of these papers trace back to Fisher's junction theory). Given this literature and the simulation results reported here that selection of near zero explains the data well, we wonder whether or not you can exclude the possibility of no selection acting. Can the data also be explained by the neutral fixation of ancestry blocks in a smallish, drifty hybrid population following admixture? The description of the simulations of selection makes no mention of drift, but this is likely a potent force in an admixed population.</p><p>5) Representation of models of speciation and prior work. Throughout the manuscript, you neither clearly define nor distinguish between intrinsic and extrinsic postzygotic reproductive isolation (e.g., Abstract). In its classic form, the BDM model specifically describes how intrinsic postzygotic isolation evolves. Extrinsic postzygotic isolation might also evolve via this scenario (i.e., an environmentally-dependent BDMI), or instead by strictly additive gene action. Adding to the confusion, you conflate BDMIs with prezygotic factors. To improve clarity, you might want to describe the BDMI model in its traditional form, and then use a more general term like “genetic incompatibilities” or “isolation loci” to describe heterospecific interactions that prevent zygote formation (e.g., egg-sperm incompatibilities) or lead to extrinsic isolation. We certainly agree that all of these types of genetic incompatibilities might be important for reproductive isolation between these species. Perhaps this should be the starting point, then: intrinsic hybrid sterility/inviability is weak in these species, so what maintains them in the face of considerable gene flow? What other mechanisms might generate the observed patterns of LD and genotype combinations? Similarly, while BDMI are a prominent model for the origin of incompatibilities, theory suggests they do not lead to effective isolating barriers (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gavrilets 1997</xref>, Evolution 4: 1027-1035; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gompert et al. 2012</xref> doi: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rstb.2011.0196">10.1098/rstb.2011.0196</ext-link>). This does not invalidate the analysis of LD in hybrids, but it does provide prior expectations that even strong BDMI selection is not expected to leave strong effects on hybrid populations. It seems like this expectation is worth incorporating in the manuscript. One other concern is that you somewhat overstate the novelty of your study. Contrary to the claims, there is quite a bit known about the number and distribution of BDMIs between populations and species. In addition to a series of <italic>Drosophila</italic> studies that use deficiency mapping and/or introgression lines to examine genome-wide BDMIs (including the Presgraves and Masly &amp; Presgraves papers they cite), several other studies have characterized genome-wide patterns of transmission ratio distortion or LD.

We include details on this analysis in the Materials and methods section (and see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4–figure supplement 4</xref>).</p><p>The reviewers raise the concern that small-scale duplications (either true duplications or due to mis-assemblies) could generate false positives. We think this is unlikely because in the MSG pipeline, reads that cannot be uniquely mapped are excluded. This suggests that the major problem would stem from duplications in which only one copy is represented in the genome assembly. However, since reads from both copies would map to the single copy represented in the genome assembly, we expect that genotypes at this region would not strongly correlate with genome regions that are physically linked to the missing duplicate. We also expect that we would observe abnormal patterns of local LD decay in such regions, but this is generally not observed (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4–figure supplement 4</xref>).</p><p><italic>2) Accuracy of dating hybridisation.

We'd also like to see some evidence that a single hybridisation event fits the data well</italic>.</p><p>We agree that this is a problem and we now use the method described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hellenthal et al. 2014</xref> to estimate hybrid zone age. Interestingly, these estimates better agree with estimates based on historical records (assuming two generations per year). In particular, our estimate of hybrid zone age is now consistent with reports that no hybrids were found in 1988 (Rauchenberger et al. 1990) but were abundant by 1997 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Rosenthal et al. 2003</xref>). We cannot exclude the possibility that multiple migration events have occurred, but investigate the potential impact of assuming a single migration event by simulation. Because there are many possible migration scenarios, we focus our analysis on demonstrating that even high levels of continuous migration will not strongly inflate our false discovery rate.</p><p><italic>3) Predictions of the BDMI model. A key prediction of the 2-locus BDM model is that hybrid incompatibilities will be asymmetric. In the case where the ancestor is AABB, species 1 is AAbb, and species 2 is aaBB, only one of the heterospecific homozygous combinations suffers (aabb)</italic> – <italic>because the other is the ancestral genotype. For loci with significant LD, you find a deficit of heterospecific, homozygous genotypes, which might be seen even if only one of the two genotypes (aabb) is selected against. However, it is unclear to us if the selection model you propose to explain the observed deviations from expected genotype frequencies is consistent with what is predicted under the BDM model. In particular, it is difficult to understand why there might be selection against all single heterozygote combinations, but not against the double heterozygote (AaBb). And why do you group “opposite homozygotes” together? Again, the BDM model says that only one of these should be underrepresented: aabb. In fact, depending on the predominant direction of interspecific gene flow, AABB might even be favored (e.g., in the scenario above, if most backcrosses are to species 1)</italic>.</p><p>We thank the reviewers for pointing out incorrect assumptions made in our previous simulations of BDMIs, which modeled the average effects of possible BDMI fitness matrices instead of drawing loci randomly from each of them. In addition, we now make no assumptions about the relative fitness of intermediate genotypes except that genotype combinations that did not exist in the mutational path of either species are under equal selection. We also include simulations and discussion of a non-BDMI model of hybrid incompatibility (for example a co-evolutionary model, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5–figure supplement 1C</xref>); our results suggest that this model makes very similar predictions.</p><p><italic>Given that gene flow is highly asymmetric in both populations, we wonder if this might explain the prevalence of negative LD associated loci</italic>.</p><p>The reviewers bring up the point that under a BDMI model one heterospecific-homozygous genotype combination (MM_BB or BB_MM) will not be under negative selection, and suggest that this could be the cause of heterospecific associations in Tlatemaco, especially with skewed ancestry proportions. Though this can cause differences in ancestry between sites in simulations, we do not see significantly negative R between genotypes in simulations of this process regardless of initial admixture proportion. We interpret this as the result of conflicting signal from intermediate genotypes (for e.g., BM_BB or MM_BM) that have positive ancestry correlations.</p><p><italic>In general, this asymmetric gene flow warrants further explanation because it will affect the frequencies of genotypes at putatively incompatible loci</italic>.</p><p>By “asymmetric gene flow” we believe the reviewers are referring to the fact that hybrid populations are skewed in their genome wide ancestry and that this requires some explanation. A simple explanation of this pattern is that the populations did not admix at 50-50 admixture proportions. A more complex possible explanation is that selection could drive this skew through many negative epistatic interactions in the genome (alluded to in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gompert et al. 2012</xref>). We now include this in brief in the Discussion section. Regardless of the cause, we believe we have accounted for the effects of this skew in our analysis; permutation of the data preserves the ancestry skew at each site and in coalescent simulations of hybrid populations we explicitly modeled skewed admixture proportions to match the data.</p><p><italic>4) Confirmation that a neutral model cannot explain the data. There is a literature on the distribution of ancestry block sizes and the effects of drift and selection on expectations, but it does not appear here (many of these papers trace back to Fisher's junction theory). Given this literature and the simulation results reported here that selection of near zero explains the data well, we wonder whether or not you can exclude the possibility of no selection acting. Can the data also be explained by the neutral fixation of ancestry blocks in a smallish, drifty hybrid population following admixture? The description of the simulations of selection makes no mention of drift, but this is likely a potent force in an admixed population</italic>.</p><p>We now include hybrid population size as a parameter in our approximate Bayesian simulations to incorporate joint effects of drift and selection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), and include posterior predictive simulations based on the joint posterior distribution of all parameters to check the consistency of our estimates with the data. The 95% CI interval of our estimate of s does not include s=0 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). We find that the selection coefficient and hybrid population size are correlated in our posterior distributions, but that stronger s is required in small populations to generate the observed two-locus genotype frequencies (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5–figure supplement 1</xref>). In addition, we perform coalescent simulations using the MAP estimate of hybrid population size from the posterior distribution to investigate how hybrid population size might affect our false discovery rate and we find that our expected false discovery rate under this neutral demographic scenario is approximately 10%.</p><p><italic>5) Representation of models of speciation and prior work.

It seems like this expectation is worth incorporating in the manuscript</italic>.</p><p>We have added discussion on theoretical work that suggests that BDMIs do not lead to effective isolating barriers, especially in the context of our findings that suggest reduced gene flow at the regions we detect.</p><p><italic>One other concern is that you somewhat overstate the novelty of your study. Contrary to the claims, there is quite a bit known about the number and distribution of BDMIs between populations and species. In addition to a series of</italic> Drosophila <italic>studies that use deficiency mapping and/or introgression lines to examine genome-wide BDMIs (including the Presgraves and Masly &amp; Presgraves papers they cite), several other studies have characterized genome-wide patterns of transmission ratio distortion or LD.
